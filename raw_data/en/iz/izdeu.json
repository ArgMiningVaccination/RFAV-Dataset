We never know how many patients will require hospital admis-sion, how sick they will be when they arrive, or how well they will do during recovery ,\" says Joshua Lenchus, D.O., interim chief medical officer, Broward Health.\"Fortunately , our caregivers showed remarkableresilience as the wave peaked and have now seen a dra-matic decrease from where we were two months ago.\" Like other health systems across the country , Dr. Lenchus explains that they have learned how to pivot its operations to respond, perfecting its surge capacity plans, identifying areas within the facilities to accommodate those who need hospitaliza-tion, integrating ever-changing testing platforms and medications, incorporating telemedicine to a significant degree, and adjusting visitation policies to ensure the health and safety of the employees, staff and patients. BY DANIEL CASCIATO ImageFIRST continued its growth in 2021. Over the past year, the company expanded its national footprint and are now located in more markets across the nation - making them the largest provider of medical linen in the United States, according to Jay Juffre, Executive Vice President of ImageFIRST. \"We were able to acquire a few compa- nies and expanded our number of pro-cessing facilities as well, including a new facility in Lakeland, Florida,\" he says. The pandemic hasn't had a negative impact on the business, he notes. On the contrary , it has allowed ImageFIRST to revolutionize how it has conducted its busi-ness. \"We started manufacturing fluid resistant gowns and came up with some addition- al creative ways to help our clients,\" explains Juffre. \"We've always been very cus-tomer-focused and since there are products that are being limited in supply chains, we asked ourselves how can we better help our clients. Doing new things like accel-erating manufacturing was the solution.

Some nurses say it is one of the most rewarding nursing specialties because of the close, ongoing relationships they devel-op with dying patients and their families. For many clinicians, hospice work brings them back to the reasons they chose a career in healthcare: personal connec-tions, shared decisions, and one-to-one patient care. For employers, the key question revolves around how to attract nurses to our unique specialty . Hospice employers cannot rely solely on the intrinsic rewards of this cru-cial nursing role. Keeping talent passionate and committed requires a deliberate focus on the things that matter most to them, including two-way communication, recog-nition for their work, and development and career growth opportunities. What we've found, particularly through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, is that the experience of a patient who is nearing the end of life can only be as good as the care that person receives from VITAS employees. As a leading hospice provider, we need to take the best possible care of our own employees so they can provide the best possible care for our patients. BY LOIS THOMSON The Executive Master of Health Administration (EMHA) at Florida Atlantic University College of Business is intended for professionals who are cur-rently working in the healthcare indus-try , but who are going to be in need of a master's degree if they are seeking to advance in the healthcare industry or be promoted within their organization. According to Salvatore Barbera, DHA, MSM, FACHE, associate program direc-tor for health administration programs, \"The MHA is the degree of choice within the industry if you have committed to a career in health services administration, and our executive program was designed to meet that need.\" He called it \"a unique program, because it meets on weekends, and we found that's one of the attractive pieces about it. Students like it, and we realize we are attracting those who are working full-time.\" The program is taught both in a face-to-face traditional format as well as fully online. Barbera said the face-to-face component meets every third weekend on Saturday and Sunday . Online students work at their own pace off of an estab-lished curriculum. \"What's been attractive about the program is that the students are able to take part in getting a master's and also not having it interfere with their work schedule. It's a great convenient feature for full-time professionals.\" Not only does the EMHA give students EMHA Opens Opportunities in Variety of Fields Salvatore Barbera 2 November 2021 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsYou can reach Charles Felix at Charles@southfloridahospitalnews.com Charles Felix Publisher's NotePublisher's Note Paraprosdokian ... No, I Can't Pronounce It Either! Every once in a while, Carol completely forgets who she's married to and decides to improve my mind a bit. On a recent Sunday afternoon, she put down her book long enough to try to explain a Paraprosdokian sentence. Needless to say , her explanation fell on deaf (make that very deaf) ears, but many of the examples were hilarious. And between you and me, I think she was trying to get some points across as well. 1. Do not argue with an idiot. He will drag you down to his level and beat you with experience. (She rarely argues with me.) 2. The last thing I want to do is hurt you. But it's still on the list. (Carol loves lists.) 3. Light travels faster than sound. This is why some people appear bright until you hear them speak. (She always tells me to keep it brief.) 4. If I agreed with you, we'd both be wrong. (She rarely agrees or dis- agrees with me.) 5. The early bird might get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. (I'm the early riser in the house.) 6. Hospitality: making your guests feel like they're at home, even if you wish they were. (We are an extremely hospitable couple.) 7. You do not need a parachute to skydive. You only need a parachute to skydive twice. (Or as Carol puts it, if you don't skydive at all - you never need the parachute.) 8. Dolphins are so smart that within a few weeks of captivity , they can train people to stand on the very edge of a pool and throw them fish. (I think Carol is the dolphin in our marriage.)

One of the reasons for this is social inflation, a term that is used to describe the increasing amount of awards that juries are now giving to plaintiffs as a result of societal trends and views. \"These awards seem to be breaking all records; they can't be predicted as they are way out of the norms of any actuarial projections or normal trends that the industry could expect,\" explained Matt Gracey , managing director, Risk Strategies Danna-Gracey Division. \"We're seeing more and more of these 'nuclear' awards, which is considered anything over $10 million.\" Gracey gives the example of a recent Florida verdict in which the jury came back with a $1 billion award for a traffic accident. \"This sent shockwaves through the insurance industry as a result,\" he said. \"There was another billion-dollar verdict in Georgia in a 2019 sexual assault case, and another $441 million awarded during a 2020 Florida motorcy-cle accident case. \"These awards have gotten out of con- trol, and this is bleeding over into all sec-tors of the insurance market,\" he added. \"It has certainly affected insurance rates for doctors and hospitals throughout Florida.\" There are a number of reasons driving these immense awards, according to Gracey . Some believe that millennial dis-satisfaction and their distrust of large corporations are the impetus behind these jury decisions. \"Millennials are very focused on 'mak- ing things right' in our society and they are against big corporate, big pharma and big medicine,\" said Gracey . \"They are also concerned about pay disparity in our culture. They see these huge data breach cases in the news, like the ones against Monsanto and Pfizer, which lead to huge class action suits awarded with huge settlements, and it distorts the value of money .\" The fact that caps on noneconomic damages have been thrown out in many states including Florida may also be partly to blame as those caps previously protected against nuclear verdicts. \"When you layer COVID on top of this, it's going to get even worse,\" predicted Gracey . \"Approx imately 90-95 percent of last year's cases concerning COVID have not been heard yet, and while a lot will get thrown out, we'll probably see even more nuclear ver-dicts because of COVID dissatisfaction and anger in society .\" Gracey adds that these awards could also be the result of plain-tiffs having access to a better plaintiff bar these days, with attorneys working together during trials to solve problems in real time. \"They are working with a lot more psychologists, and are using other analytical tools as well,\" he said. \"Advertising has ramped up consider-ably; you're now seeing many more big billboards from attorneys looking for auto cases or other cases.\" The industry is also seeing an increase in litigation funding, with companies offering to finance plaintiffs and their attorneys for a return of a percentage of the jury award, which means that these cases are extremely well-funded. As a result, the insurance industry is having a difficult time figuring out pric-ing. \"In actuarial models, which is how the entire industry sets rates, a billion-dollar judgement sets all projections on their ears,\" said Gracey . \"Pricing is problemat-ic at best, and this also affects settle-ments.\" While the majority of medical mal- practice cases go away without payment and the rest are usually settled, a very small percentage are taken to trial. \"Because of the potential for nuclear ver-dicts, settlements are also now affected, and insurance companies are under siege because of that,\" said Gracey . \"According to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB), between 2014-20, there has been a 42 percent increase in payments of medical mal-practice cases,\" he added. \"During that time, the U.S. inflation rate rose 15.3 percent. Medical malpractice awards and settlements have been going up much faster than inflation.\" For more information, contact Matt Gracey at (800) 966-2120 or visit www.dannagracey.com.

Tragically , when a child attempts suicide with a firearm, they are \"success-ful\" 95% of the time, mak-ing firearm accidents and deaths a top priority for pediatric surgeons. The laws vary from state to state on the role that doctors can take on educating and discussing firearm choices with families, but we are now taking a stronger stance against this incredibly dangerous threat to children. In Florida, for example, we are not allowed to talk to patients or families about firearms, so we'd like to share data on suicide attempts and the damage for those who survive. So, the American Pediatric Surgical Association recently released a policy on firearm injuries, endorsing universal background checks including for private sales, which is a gap in the law. They are advocating for restricting assault weapon purchases by children and raising the minimum purchase age of firearms to 21. Finally , my colleagues and I want to encourage and advocate for schools to train their staff on bleeding control, in the wake of mass (and smaller) shoot-ings. Preventing opioid use in children stemming from post-op prescriptions It's startling, but one in 8 children has reported trying opioids by high school. Sixty percent of teenagers who use hero-in say they first started by misusing opi-oids, sometimes prescribed after surgery , including Percocet, Hydrocodone, and similar drugs. My colleagues and I are working to stop the problem before it starts - with that first post-op prescrip-tion, and education surrounding opioid choices for families. A task force of surgeons recently pub- lished the first guidelines for opioid pre-scriptions after surgeries for children and adolescents, filling a gap that before had only published research relating to adults. This is meant to combat the prac-tice of routinely prescribing opioids to children after surgery as they would to those over 18. The recommendations in the new guide- lines essentially promote replacing routine opioid prescriptions for children post-surgery with a schedule of Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen. This is the case for mild and moderate pain levels in the recovery period. If opioids are necessary for pain control, such as in more severe and major surger-ies, the guidelines recommend a prescrip-tion of three days, as any longer than that increases the risk of addiction. More major surgeries like this might include proce-dures that require opening the abdomen or thorax, and/or a larger incision. But it's not just about changing the prescription, but rather the education sur-rounding it. It's all in the expectations and education of the patient and their fami-ly ahead of the procedure. We have to educate the par-ents, family , and the patient to provide expectations before and after. For exam-ple, if you have a patient with a hernia repair, you may say to them, 'This isn't going to be too painful, and you will need T ylenol and Motrin at home, and I'll give you a scheduled regiment.' If you say , 'Oh, it will be painful,' some will go back to the ER saying they need nar-cotics. The new guidelines and a focus on proper education on pain management will eliminate the ER visit. Finally , there is a necessity to educate the entire care team on the risk of opioid addiction from post-medical procedure prescriptions, particularly in Florida, which has high rates of opioid use in teenagers. Nurses, surgeons, and anes-thesiologists should all be aware of the risk of prescription misuse. Florida health care providers can check a website to screen for prior misuse of narcotics, including who prescribed them and the last time the patient used them. Responding to child abuse with a multi-disciplinary team The Florida child abuse situation is bleak, as evident by the Children's Advocacy Center of Florida's 2018 statis-tics: \u0081 35% is sexual abuse \u0081 27% is physical abuse \u0081 The rest is neglect \u0081 Just over a third of abuse victims are ages 0-6 \u0081 60% are female While it's common for pediatric sur- geons to treat child abuse victims in need of trauma-related surgeries, what's new and increasingly important is their ongo-ing involvement on the care team, along with nurses, pediatricians, social work-ers, the family , and child protective serv-ices. We are pushing for advocacy through this structured and multi-faceted team, rather than a more disjoint-ed approach. Because we are very thor-ough in our trauma evaluation/physical exam, we identify and treat findings that are not immediately recognized by pedi-atricians. My hope is that a standardized tool to screen for child abuse when children arrive in hospitals and trauma centers will help. We support data accrual on abuse screening and diagnosis into a trauma registry .

The former executive vice-president of Memorial Healthcare System and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Memorial Regional Hospital is still passionate about being a lifelong learner and help-ing others to succeed in the healthcare industry . \"I stayed at Memorial for almost 30 years because of its culture and the constant challenges, as well as the difference that I could make for patients,\" he said. \"I was always doing something new and learning something that helped me develop as a per-son. I also took the opportunity to help others develop during that time. \"There are a lot of avenues for people to learn from, and one of them is life experi- ences,\" he continued. \"Younger people can learn from those of us who have been there; they don't need to reinvent the wheel. Building relationships and having some-one they feel comfortable enough to call and ask for help is important, which is one reason why I advise them to get involved with the American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE).\" Now a Life Fellow , Ross joined ACHE while a student in graduate school. \"I respected the organization's focus on lifelong learning, as well as the fact that it ensured the safety and quality of care to patients by promoting education, integrity , and leadership capabilities,\" he explained, adding that he attended numerous educa-tional seminars and conferences as a member. \"I remember quite a number of very good courses, including one on negotiating skills,\" he continued. \"I learned that it's not a win-lose situation when negotiating; everyone needs to leave the table feeling that they each won. That changed the way I negotiate, and it still makes a difference on how I approach different issues.\" During his time as a member of ACHE, Ross served as a member and the national chair of the Ethics Committee and became a regent for the Southeastern Florida chap-ter. He also spent a good deal of time mentoring others, including working with younger members of the association on their resumes and interview questions during the annual ACHE meetings in Chicago. \"If I learned something from ACHE or in my life or work, I wanted to pass that information and education along,\" said Ross, who was also a very active participant in Memorial Healthcare System's formal mentoring program. \"Like anything else in life, you need a network of people to support you,\" he added. \"If you join the local chapter, you not only have an 'in' with people who can help you, but you build lifelong relationships. It can also help you in your career; even as a CEO, I would go to the South Florida ACHE chapter meetings on the lookout for tal-ent.\" Ross decided to pursue ACHE's fellowship path to show his commitment to the field and to his patients. \"To me, the fellowship path signifies to others that I reached the top of the 'educa- tion ladder' in the profession,\" he said. \"It shows that since 1978, when I joined, I haven't stopped in my mission of lifelong learning.\" Throughout his tenure, Ross has received numerous awards, including the Lifetime Community Award from ACHE of South Florida; the Senior Careerist award from the ACHE Regent for Florida and the Spirit of Healing Award from the Memorial Foundation. \"These are my top three; the ones that mean the most,\" he said. \"I reflect on why they were given to me, and it makes me realize some of my accomplishments and achievements\u2014not just personal accomplishments, but ones like building Memorial Hospital West, that were important for the community . \"I don't know whether I deserved these awards, but I humbly accepted them,\" he laughed. \"Looking back, I feel I made a difference.\" South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com November 2021 5Zeff Ross Let's Connect: ACHE of South Florida Spotlight Subscribe to...

It is emerging as an effective alternative for many cancer patients and offers an important option for Florida doc-tors and the patients they treat. Originally gaining prominence as a powerful, efficacious treatment for prostate cancer, Cesium-131 brachytherapy is now showing impressive results in other cancer treatment applications that previously had limited treatment alternatives. Cesium-131 brachytherapy is increas-ingly being used to treat a variety of hard-to-treat cancers throughout the body including brain, head and neck, lung, and gynecological cancers as well as other aggressive and recurrent tumors. In Florida, Dr. Michael W . McDermott, Chair of the Division of Neurosurgery and Chief Medical Executive at the Miami Neuroscience Institute, Baptist Health South Florida, has extensive experience in the use of Cesium-131 brachytherapy for the treatment of brain metastases and recurrent atypical and malignant meningiomas. Widely known for advancing neuro- surgical techniques, Dr. McDermott noted some of the advantages, \"If you just reoperate on recurrent menin-giomas after prior surgery and radia-tion therapy , the likelihood of recur-rence is high. There is no effective chemotherapy for recurrent menin-giomas at this point and repeated external beam radiation is not a suit-able treatment paradigm. Cesium-131 offers an important local treatment option. It has a short half-life and short energy path which means a more conformal dose distribution within the resection cavity and deliv-ers a reduced dose to the surrounding brain. With its permanent encapsula-tion in titanium, there is no chance of dissemina-tion of the radioactive sources to other parts of the brain or body .\" The preeminent neuro- surgeon sees opportunity for patients. \"It's a safe and effective alternative treatment for recurrent malignant meningioma and brain metastases. It's been previously under-utilized, and I am glad there is increased recognition of its utility , safety , and effectiveness. Patients can have surgery and Cesium-131 treatment in one procedure. Because the skull absorbs most of the radiation, it makes it safe for patients to be discharged and be around family members without any particular con-cerns,\" said Dr. McDermott. Dr. Chad Zender is a nationally rec- ognized expert in head and neck can-cers who has seen the benefits of Cesium-131 brachytherapy . Dr. Zender, Associate Chief Medical Officer, University of Cincinnati Health, and Professor Department of Otolaryngology , University of Cinc - innati College of Medicine spoke to Cesium-131's unique qualities. \"I think it's most important in patients who have had previous radia-tion or chemo-radiation that have a tumor that is amenable for additional therapy . It can be used in conjunction with surgery in the recurrent setting to help improve local control and decrease the damage to other tissues. Even in patients that have had prior chemo-radiation or radiation, this is an additional targeted radiation that can deliver a meaningful radiation dose and doesn't result in the kind of dam-age we see from traditional re-radiation in our experience. Preliminary studies are exciting on Cesium-131 for head and neck and are showing promise which is why we are continuing to pur-sue its use in the head and neck in the current recurrent setting.\" Dr. Zender commented on the value for patients. \"From my perspective, Cesium-131 is a promising additional therapy that can decrease the chance of their cancer returning without com-promising quality of life and function as traditional re-irradiation does. The head and neck are critical to our qual-ity of life, and we must try to preserve functions like sense of taste, swallow-ing and facial expressions which are so important when interacting with loved ones. Anything we can do to help patients survive without compromis-ing those important functions is going to be of benefit to the patients.\" Cesium-131 has been extensively used to treat prostate cancer and has proven to be a highly customized and effective treatment for the rapid recov-ery of patients. Dr. Bernard W . Taylor is the longest tenured radiation oncolo-gist at Texas Oncology of the US Oncology Network. He has been per-forming LDR Prostate Brachytherapy since 1996 and has used all the avail-able sources in his career. Dr. Taylor pointed to his unique viewpoint regarding Cesium-131 brachytherapy , \"I had prostate cancer treated with LDR Brachytherapy using I-125, so I speak as a patient as well as a physician. For patients, it is impor-tant to also look at its impact and the other critical aspect which is patient quality of life. With Cesium-131, they are not going to have the long-term urinary side effects, which I experi-enced, that they would have with iodine-125, which is 6 to 9 months, or the long side effects with palladium-103 and they will recover faster than they would with other sources.\" Dr. Taylor had this message for Florida physicians. \"There is always a fear to change your protocol as a physician when you are comfortable with an established approach. You shouldn't be fearful to change to Cesium-131 because of the advantages that I see clinically and because I learned firsthand that using Cesium-131 really didn't change my process at all. I think it offers the right energy level to take care of cancer, the short-ened half-life so side effects are less and delivering the dose faster, which I believe improves outcomes for prostate cancer. We may never prove that clini-cally , but I believe it is better and it is certainly better for high-risk patients.\" With over ten years of data on Cesium-131, researchers continue to expand study of its value in addressing cancers. Numerous trials and studies are underway looking at mounting treatment options involving Cesium-131 brachytherapy and its application for the treatment of a variety of cancers throughout the body . One that will be watched with interest given the rapid approach of an era of immuno-oncolo-gy , involves the addition of pem-brolizumab (Keytruda) to the regimen of Cesium-131 brachytherapy with surgical resection. The trial begins the exploration of the opportunity for syn-ergy between Cesium-131 radiation therapy and modern immunotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors. William A.

Promising Option Emerges for T reating Cancers Throughout the Body BY WILLIAM A. CAVANAGH For cancer patients, time is perhaps the most precious commodity . Years ago, a patient at our medically integrated oncolo-gy practice had just come from radiology and was now ready for her medication that was just prescribed by her oncologist. From her wheelchair with her hus-band by her side, she expect-ed to receive her medication and be on her way . The woman's insurance covered the specialized medication, and we had it in stock. But unless she could pay a large costly penalty out of pocket, we could not provide it to her because of a complex and broken system that often forces cancer patients to rely on mail-order pharmacies that could be thou-sands of miles away - rather than the pharmacist standing right in front of her. A delay in treatment can be detrimental to a cancer patient. That experience was the catalyst that led me to create NCODA, the lead-ing nonprofit focused on the patient-centered med-ically integrated oncology practice. After years of work, I believe we finally have a game-changing opportu-nity that will without question improve patient and clinician experience, provide better health outcomes, and lower cost of care. With the significant increase in oral oncolytics, the need to dispense pre-scriptions from the first to last fill quick-ly has become critical in overall patient success. To address this challenge NCODA has forged a new collaboration with a promi-nent pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), Prime Therapeutics, on an accreditation program that would allow pharmacies within an oncology practice to go beyond the first fill. Through Prime's new medically integrated pharmacy cre-dentialing program, NCODA 's Accred - itation will be a preferred requisite as it upholds the gold standards, tools and resources that empowers medically inte-grated pharmacies (MIPs) to deliver the highest level of performance that brings sustainability and value to all stakehold-ers. This collaboration with Prime Therapeutics will benefit millions of Americans across the country and is an important first step, one we are confi-dent will transform the future of oncolo-gy pharmacy . For cancer patients, timing can be everything. Through this approach of dispensing medications from first to last within the MIP , we can put treatments in their hands the moment they need them - allowing them to begin treatment immediately . As early as 7 years ago, a collaborative and connected process like this wasn't even within the realm of possibility . It's my hope that in the near future, med-ically integrated oncology pharmacies will be so commonplace that people will question why it had ever been done dif-ferently . That's the power of innovation and the effect of bringing together smart, patient-centered stakeholders who rec-ognize the value of a win-win-win situa-tion for all. This may not fix every problem in health care, but it can make a tremen-dous difference in the lives of cancer patients. That's the kind of breakthrough that benefits everyone.

Cancer Patients Benefit When Pharmacies and Providers Connect BY MICHAEL REFF South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com November 2021 7 While the last couple of years have been challenging, November is the month to say , \"Thanks.\" We have many things for which we can be thankful. That the vaccines to prevent or lessen the symptoms of COVID-19 were developed in record time using production processes already developed in the creation of other previous vaccines. We can be thankful for not only the success in creating these COVID-19 vaccines, but their subsequent effectiveness and overall safety . Now , similar to flu vaccines, we know that COVID-19 vaccines effectiveness wanes with time and annual booster injections might be in our future (as it has been for flu vaccines for many , many years). We can be thankful to the scientists who have worked tirelessly to develop other drugs now used to lessen the symptoms of COVID-19. Drug infusions and now pill regimens that have saved countless people who have contracted COVID-19. We can be thankful for the men and women who went to work in hospitals, clinics, doctors' offices, and pharmacies despite the risk to themselves and their families. We can be thankful for the healthcare professionals and average Americans who used their positions to advocate for the use of COVID-19 vaccines despite the threats and vile comments they received. We can be thankful for those medical professionals who put off retirement to meet the challenges of the last two years. We can be thankful for the Americans who continue to be thoughtful about their own health and the health of others and continue to wear masks in public situations and to attempt to remain social-ly distanced and to use good hand hygiene. We also can be thankful for our statesman politicians who continue to use their positions to advocate for what is best for Americans; their continuing efforts to cut through the political rhetoric and to talk about the science of vaccinations. I am thankful that I am allowed the opportunity to take advantage of science by getting my annual flu vaccine (already done) and, as of one week ago, to take my booster dose of the Moderna vaccine to help keep me safe. I have a granddaughter and a grandson on the way and I need to be there for them! It is my responsibility to stay healthy . While this is a month of thanksgiving, I am also aware that almost 740,000 Americans have lost their lives to this pandemic and for them I feel sadness. We can-not get them back and we also cannot fill the holes left in the hearts and minds of their children, grandchildren, wives, husbands, and parents. Please, help me be thankful and let us try and end preventable deaths. Vaccines have been with us for a long time, and they have dramatically reduced the numbers of childhood deaths to formerly common and now not too common diseases. Reach out and ask your doctor for advice...be thankful you did. BY JAIME CALDWELL As the calendar turns to Autumn, physicians are once again staring down the barrel of signif-icant decreases in Medicare reimbursement due to take effect in January . The annual exer-cise that was supposed to end with the elimination of the Sustainable Growth Rate, has ended in name only . The same flawed and unsustainable approach to setting physician reimbursement in Medicare in a budget-neutral vice remains. Evidence continues to mount of the dramatic implications that this flawed approach has had on care delivery and provides justification for fundamental reform in how our nation funds access to care for Medicare beneficiaries. Since the release of the draft Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) over the summer, organized medicine has been unified in seeking relief from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and from Congress on the devastating impact these cuts will have. The pro-posed cuts, ranging from 10% to 20% depending on the specialty , would be drastic in any year. They are even more devasting this year given the multi-fac-torial impact of the COVID-19 pandem-ic on physician practice which includes: increased practice expenses to protect patients and staff; the shutdown of elec-tive procedures; inflationary impact on the cost of supplies; and workforce shortages that are driving up employ-ment costs. Simply put, the clock is tick-ing on Congress to act to save access to community-based care for Medicare beneficiaries. Where are the cuts coming from? Here is a breakdown of how these proposed reduc- tions are being generated. \u0081 E/M Pay-As-You-Go Pay ment Cuts (PAYGO) (-4%) In addition to these cuts, some organizations, like the American College of Radia - tion Oncology (ACRO), are highlighting the implications of CMS moving forward with clinical labor data updates in the 2022 Physician Fee Schedule which could cause additional cuts to certain specialties as much as 14%. There are many physicians that believe Medicare reimbursement policy has been a major contributing cause to the continued elimination of the private practice of medicine as many physicians have shifted to employment with hospi-tals, health systems, and the corporate practice of medicine. While there are many factors physicians consider when deciding where to practice, there can be no question that declining reimburse-ment and uncertainty continue to add pressure to private practice medicine. While immediate action from Congress to prevent the proposed cuts in 2022 is critically important and once again likely , it is time for CMS and Congress to have a broader discussion on the fundamental flaws in the physi-cian fee schedule policy and make reforms that will support access to care for Medicare beneficiaries in the com-munity setting.

Fundamental Reform Needed for Medicare Physician Fee Schedule BY FRASER COBBE A message from our President: A Month for Thanksgiving When it comes to brand loyalty , there are a few which clearly rise above the others. When it comes to cars, it's Tesla. Cell phones and tablets, Apple. Fast food, Chick-fil-A. Quick cup of cof-fee, Starbucks. No matter if you like, love or never have used the examples above, one common trait they all have in common is very strong brand and customer loyalty . There is, however, one company which has their customers taking it to an even higher level. Harley-Davidson. This company's customers trav-el from all over the country to attend rallies, get tattoos of the company logo on their bodies and would never think about owning or riding on a different product. Now that is brand loyalty . You can be sure when those two inventors in Wisconsin were messing with small motors and bicycles a hundred plus years ago, they had no idea the cult-like following they would eventually create - a tattoo worthy brand. Before you start thinking, 'that could never happen with our organization', think again. What would it take to have a local, regional, or national brand so good that people simply could not live without it? Like Chick Fil A or Starbucks, people would be willing to drive a little farther and wait a little longer just to experi-ence the best. How deep does your team's loyalty run? How loyal are your customers / patients to your \"brand\" You may not have staff and visitors running out and getting tattoos on their biceps right away , but what might it take to come close. Sit down with your leadership team and simply ask, 'what would it take to be the brand that people simply could not live without and what can we start doing today to help get us there?' After they figure out you are serious, it will be worth a discussion or two. Jay Juffre is Executive Vice President, ImageFIRST .

E-mail Your Editorial Submissions to editorial@southfloridahospitalnews.com 8 November 2021 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsThere is no question that medical technology contin- ues to evolve and that's great news for all of us. What's exciting for athletes and anyone who is recover-ing from an injury or sur-gery is that we have so much more to rely on today including state-of-the-art technology and evidence-based education, training and management. At Holy Cross Health we have launched a premier, state-of-the-art sports medicine program with the opening of the Lillian S. Wells Foundation Institute of Sports Performance and Orthopedic Therapy (iSPORT) in the Holy Cross HealthPlex in Fort Lauderdale. Here we offer the most comprehensive, multidisciplinary sports injury and performance enhance-ment program in South Florida. Technology plays a transformational role in sports whether you are looking to take your athletic performance to the next level, recover from an injury or sur-gery or looking to prevent athletic relat-ed injuries. Here is what you need know about some of the technology that is designed to meet a patient's needs in training and therapy: Blood Flow Restriction (BFR): This involves placement of a blood pressure like cuff on areas of the extremity which limits the amount of the blood flow to the area that encourages muscle growth without heavy loading. BFR allows you to train at 20% effort and achieve the same benefits as if you were working at an 80% effort. This improves strength and muscle mass, prevents atrophy after injury and surgery , promotes healing and decreases pain. During the exercise, a patient will feel pressure around your extremity , similar to that of a blood pres-sure cuff when it is almost completely inflated. While there may be muscle soreness after exercise, there will be a significant decrease in joint pain within 24-48 hours after exercise. DARI Motion: DARI Motion is a motion analysis that uses a patented and FDA approved algorithm to be able to record movements with the use of Automated Data Analytics of Motion (ADAM). The system detects movement that provides data on motion age, athleti-cism and readiness to per-form. This is a benefit to athletes who want to per-form at their best with functional and sports spe-cific testing, with scientifi-cally validated kinematics to protect against injuries and with identified risk fac-tors designed to each per-son's unique musculoskele- tal profile. Through a full body motion analysis, cor-rective exercises are recom-mended to address top focus areas. Quick Board Training: This is an advanced training and diagnostic system that helps enhance an athlete's perform-ance and helps with rehabilitation after injury . Exercises train and restore agility , speed, reaction, strength, stability , bal-ance and coordination. These exercises can be customized for athletes, those with orthopedic injuries and for older adults who are at risk of falls. VertiMax Platform: VertiMax uses advanced technology that allows athletes of all ages to train while loading specific areas of the body for improved sport spe-cific performance. Unlike traditional resistance bands, VertiMax technology allows resistance to remain consistent as the bands are stretched for up to 45 yards. That means that the athlete can complete more unin-terrupted repetitions for greater dis-tances. VertiMax has been used across multiple sports to improve performance and decrease injury . Trazer: Trazer is a revolutionary com- puter-based technology that provides information about the performance of a person's brain, body and heart. Trazer uses motion capture and interactive game-like simulations that has been used for injury rehabilitation, improving sports performance, concussion rehabili-tation and fall prevention. Trazer has been effective in athletic sports perform-ance, ortho and neuro rehabilitation, concussion rehabilitation and senior health. Dr. Fernando J.

MANALAC, JR., MD BY LOIS THOMSON Camillus Health Concern, Inc. (CHC) is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in Miami, Florida, that provides primary care, behav-ioral health, oral health, and social services to men, women, and children experiencing homelessness in Miami-Dade County . The organization's job just got a little more far-reaching with recent funding from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) COVID-19 Telehealth Program in the amount of $983,464.91. The FCC's program supports health care providers by funding their efforts to provide care to their patients via telecommunications servic-es, information services, and connected devices. CHC is looking to use the funding to capitalize on the success of their Telehealth Outreach Pilot Program (TOPP) and expand their tele-health offerings by providing a targeted patient subset with connected smartphones, along with peripheral devices such as wireless blood pressure monitors and wireless glucometers. To support the expanded scope in operations, CHC will look to shift to a new , enhanced telehealth platform, increase their broadband capabilities and equip their providers with new hardware. Michael Zantua, Director of Business Strategy & Operations, led the team that sub- mitted the proposal for the FCC funding, and he explained how the funds will be used: \"What this grant will do is take (the service) to the next level. Not only are we looking to provide phones, but also items like blood pressure cuffs and glucometers, in order to try to focus in on high-risk patients who have hypertension, are diabetic, or are even suffering from COVID.\" Zantua is especially pleased with the outcome because it was his first major project after joining CHC. He said a few days after being hired back in February , \"Francis (Afram-Gyening, CEO) asked me to 'quarterback' the application for the funding. Securing this funding was a team effort all the way . \"This is a big win for the organization, the funding will go a long way to bridge those gaps and access to care; so we're really happy that we have been able to secure funding to impact the lives of the patients we serve, but also to extend our telehealth platforms and take it to next level.\" For more information, call (305) 577-4840 or visit www.camillusHEALTH.org.Camillus Health Concern Secures Nearly $1 Million from the FCC T elehealth Funding Michael Zantua South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com November 2021 9As video creators, you know that there are many ways on how you can create a compelling video. But take note, not all videos are created in the same way . It depends on several factors that a video creator should consider, like the types of videos that their audi-ence responds to or peo-ple relate to the most. Now in terms of healthcare content, there are special considerations that need to be incorporated so you can make effective videos for your company . To help you do that, here are five things you should keep in mind when creating healthcare videos for your company or your clients. Speak to Your Audience Remember this, you created a video for a purpose, and that purpose is to help your target audience understand the message you want to relay . So when producing your healthcare video, make sure that you put your audience's shoes on. For instance, your audience would be patients, patients' loved ones, doctors, hospitals and profes-sionals, or even the company that provides the healthcare service. You can include content about a patient's healthcare journey or how health-care providers give their service. Whatever your content is, make sure that your audi-ence would be able to relate. You also need to consider the literacy and the age range of your audience, as well as their emotional state. In that way , you would be able to create a video tailored to your audience and to be able to speak to them in the same language, situation, or scenario. Use 3D Animations You can use the latest tools and process- es to create beautiful 3D animations. Through this, you would be able to entice your audience and keep them engaged in a new policy , product, or service you are offering. But why 3D? Well, aside from being highly customizable, it allows you to cre-ate videos that show multiple angles of a subject in a very realistic manner. Using 3D animations would save you from the challenges that live action productions usually encounter. And we're not lying when we say your only limit is your imagination because it is! But don't get too excited to use all the high-tech and edgy 3D animations because, at the end of the day , it all boils down to two important things: your audience and the message you'd like to leave them. If the 3D visuals and effects do not really coincide with an emotional subject, then you need to reassess whether what you are using is the correct visual medium. This is especially true for topics focused on patients and present life-altering situations. In this example, your healthcare video should make patients feel support and comfort rather than painfully shooting them with hard facts and data. Be More Intentional with the Character Design In terms of medical topics within healthcare, the best way to show your audience is through different characters rather than using words alone. It will also be easier for them to understand informa-tion by depicting it through illustrations and animations. What's great about 3D is that you can portray hyper-realistic characters. If the video is patient-focused, then the more details you give your characters, the better. In this way , you allow the audience to see themselves, those who they care about, and the support that people can get through healthcare. Conclusion Creating healthcare videos is not just about how beautiful or compelling the content is but how you were able to make a difference and how much impact you've made to your audience.

South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com November 2021 11In a year of racial reckoning on many fronts, we're also seeing a greater focus on racial health disparities \u2014 why people of color have lower life expectancies and are sicker as a group than the white population. Some might be sur-prised that an over-reliance on credit scores may be a key contribut-ing factor. Much has been studied and written about the varied causes of health dispari-ties for Black and Hispanic populations, including less access to care and implicit bias on the part of healthcare providers. But at a time when people are having to reach into their own pockets to pay for big deductibles, high co-pays, and medical expenses not covered by insurance, the inability to access medical credit is a major aggravating factor, especially for this pop-ulation. Most medical credit cards and other medical financing solutions rely on credit scores as the primary - sometimes the only - factor in deciding whether to extendsomeone's credit. So patients with creditscores below 640 are usually out of luck ifthey can't afford to pay out of pocket formedical expenses. About 45 million American adults fit this definition, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Around 26 million of them have no credit record at all. Fifty three million adults lack tradi-tional FICO scores and another 19 million have some kind of credit record, but their information is either incomplete or out of date, which means they don't have a score. That adds up to almost 1 in 5 of all American adults left with few good options. That disproportionately affects people of color. A 2021 survey of 5,000 adults by Credit Sesame found that 54% of Black Americans and 41% of Hispanic Americans report credit scores below 640 - that's 10% below the national average -or they have no credit score at all, makingthem \"credit invisible.\" As a consequence,making large purchases like buying a caror a home and affording medical expenses is nearly impossible. As someone who spent most of my career in finance, I've become convinced that moving away from an over-reliance on credit scores and looking at patients' bigger financial picture will help to close the medical access gap. The \"old way\" of simply using credit scores to evaluate some- one's ability to pay is archaic and it disfavors younger people, Blacks and Hispanics, and any-one without favorable credit scores. Credit scores are limiting and sim-ply don't provide the full picture. And finally big lenders are realizing that credit scores aren't a reliable way to measure lending decisions. In fact, according to a recent survey , 48% of lenders are less con-fident making consumer decisions based on traditional credit scores and reports. Fortunately , there are better ways to evaluate people's propensity to pay , if healthcare providers are willing to think outside the box. We work with medical providers to successfully extend healthcare financing to people with credit scores as low as 400 (and, in some cases, people who are credit invisible). I say successfully because more than 99% of the time, the patients we've worked with have paid back their debts within 12 months. Being credit challenged or credit invisi- ble shouldn't mean that someone can't par-ticipate in the credit economy like anyone else, and it certainly shouldn't deny them access to healthcare. Poor credit might mean limited prior opportunity to demonstrate financial relia-bility or even previous mistakes. It's time for the medical establishment to look past this and see whether patients are financial-ly stable, make payments regularly , and have steady income. Their business is no less valuable and shouldn't be overlooked. Looking at the patient's propensity to pay based on a variety of factors, rather than just their credit score, can bring healthcare within reach of many disenfran-chised people. We have a moral imperative to do that. James N. Giordano is the CEO of Care Cap Plus. How Being Credit Invisible Is Affecting Minority Groups' Access to Healthcare BY JAMES N. GIORDANO The safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines have facilitated safer travel. Over the past 18 months, we have learned that the COVID-19 virus is resilient, changes frequent-ly , and the currently circu-lating Delta variant not only affects people of all ages, including younger children, but is also more transmissible and infec-tious. Fortunately , we expect children ages five to twelve to be eligible for the shot soon. Younger children and unvaccinated children and adults remain a concern for holiday travel. They can be asympto-matic carriers of the virus, and can unknowingly transmit the virus to unvaccinated children and vulnerable or immune-compromised people - leading to serious outcomes. Many travel plans include visiting families and friends, and as plans come together, we must all make sure to explore the safest ways to do so. \u0081General Hygiene: COVID-19 isn't the only disease we can pick up during a trip! Maintaining protocols, such as wearing masks properly over the nose and mouth in public, social distancing, washing hands or using hand sanitizer frequently , being careful about not touching the face - will help prevent the transmission of not only the COVID-19 virus, but also other respiratory viruses. \u0081Routine Immunizations: All adults and children must have their routine immunizations updated. Every year, the influenza vaccine is updated to provide protection against four strains that are expected to be circulating in the com-munity . Since the influenza vaccine is changed every year, annual shots help boost immunity over time. \u0081Plane Travel: If you are traveling by plane, vaccines mitigate the risk of virus transmission. Other factors that may help prevent transmission are: time of travel - flying early morning and off-peak hours is safest; organizing carry-on bags so that access to necessary items is easy; choosing seats away from areas where there may be more movement (such as lavatories); select window seats where less air may circulate than aisle seats; wipe all surfaces upon boarding; avoid using the toilet - but if you have to, make sure you wipe all surfaces with anti-septic wipes - especially handles, taps, seats; be the last to board and dis-embark. If people around you do not follow FAA guidelines for flying, the staff should be notified although mov-ing may not be possible. \u0081Masks and Eating: Not all masks arecreated equal. Surgical, NK95 and multilayer masks are the safest. Remember that the sick person wearing a mask can still transmit the virus, but if you wear the correct mask properly , it prevents you from inhaling the virus. Keep the mask on at all times. If you have to eat or drink, put the mask back on as soon as possi-ble. Bring your own snacks that do not require too much food handling. \u0081Trip Logistics: It is important to consider who you are visiting and the logistics of the potential stay . You should know that those around you are vacci-nated, and if you are staying overnight with family , consider how crowded the residence will be. Make sure the sleep-ing arrangements don't mix and match pods; people sleeping in the same room should be from the same household. Finally , consider whether or to what extent everyone will be able to follow social distancing guidelines. \u0081Hotels and Lodging: If families are coming together, staying at a hotel may be a safer option. Most hotels have guidelines about sanitizing, masking, and social distancing. Unfortunately , since these guidelines are not always fol-lowed, it is up to the travelers to protect themselves. Remember to sanitize, wear masks, and follow social distancing guidelines in shared spaces. \u0081 COVID-19 Testing: PCR testing is less likely to provide false negative results, but there is generally a longer wait for results. Rapid testing results can be available within 20 minutes, but the possibility of a false negative result is higher than with PCR testing. Remember, we can all be asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19. If a family with children travels to a family with older adults, people with chronic illnesses or immune-suppression, it is important for all travelers to be tested. Unfortunately , many people around us do not take precautions and choose not to be vaccinated. Whether we are traveling or in our daily life, it is impor-tant for us to protect ourselves from these people who may be asymptomatic carriers. We can protect ourselves, our children and our families by following guidelines regarding hand washing or using hand sanitizers, wearing effective masks properly , social distancing and sanitizing our space frequently .

Close to 400 participants attended this charitable event organized by WBHI to raise awareness, provide a platform for disease reduction strategies, and offer resources to help support prevention and early detection among college stu-dents, at risk women and other targeted communities. \"We are proud to have been a host and co-sponsor of this great event in asso- ciation with The Women's Breast and Heart Initiative to spread knowledge and advocacy of Breast Cancer within our College and the community at large,\" said Fermin Vazquez, North Campus Interim President. The event included vendors representing health, Cox Media Group, and lifestyle products and services, as well as food trucks. Also, in partnership with NOMI Health, attendees were able to receive COVID-19 testing and vaccina-tions on site. Pink is a color emblematic of breast cancer, a disease mostly diagnosed in women ages of 15 to 39. In the U.S. alone, statistics show that one in eight women will be diagnosed with cancer over their lifetime. Early detection and disease deterrent lifestyles are key to saving and changing lives. The mission of the WBHI is to educate the next generation and to provide resources for at-risk women to beat the odds of breast cancer and heart disease. Earlier in the year MDC also lent its support to WBHI on National Pink Day (June 23), to raise awareness during their Summer Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign by illuminating its National Historic Landmark Freedom Tower pink. During the pandemic, mammography utilization decreased by as much as 80%. And although the number of cancer screenings has begun to rise, delayed, or missed screenings diagnosed at a later stage could result in a poorer progno-sis. Established in 2005, the Women's Breast & Heart (WBHI) Initiative is a non- profit organization based in South Florida with a mission to educate and pro-vide resources to women and college students about the importance of breast and heart health through its disease prevention & early detection initiatives.

This will be the only medical residency program in Florida to benefit veterans by uti- lizing a Veterans Affairs healthcare facility as its primary training site. Residents also will train at Jackson Memorial Hospital and other sites under development. The program, set to start on July 1, 2022, recently received approval from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. \"This is a tremendous opportunity for FIU to serve those who have served us,\" said FIU Provost and Executive Vice President Kenneth G. Furton. \"Graduates of this program will be uniquely prepared to manage the complex medical problems that veterans confront after returning to civilian life, including post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction and chronic pain.\" In addition to newly minted doctors who graduate from HWCOM, the program also is expected to draw skilled physicians from across the country . The new FIU/Miami VA residency program has been approved to participate in the National Resident Matching Program, which culminates on Match Day (March 18, 2022) when graduating medical students are \"matched\" with residency programs nationwide. Residencies offer medical school graduates in-depth training within a specific specialty at a hospital or clinic. This residency training program also is expected to benefit the South Florida commu- nity by attracting more doctors to the area amidst a growing national physician short-age, especially in primary care. \"Studies show the majority of young doctors decide to practice close to where they perform their residency training,\" said Dr. Juan Cendan, interim dean at the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine. \"We expect that many of the doctors we train will remain in South Florida.\" The three-year graduate medical education program has already started recruiting its first class of six residents.BY CAROL NEWMAN Nurses have always held a key role in the country's healthcare system, and the ongoing pandemic has put them on the frontlines of a battle. While COVID-19 continues to wage a war on America's health, they are still playing a vital role fighting to save lives. Each day , nurses and other healthcare professionals show up for work to comfort and care for patients, uncertain of what their shifts will bring. We've all heard sto-ries of these dedicated caregivers who work long hours away from their families and loved ones, risking their own health to help patients who have the virus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), without nurses, there would be very limited response to the coronavirus. While it's important to salute nurses every day , this season we want to take this opportunity to say thank you to not only the nurses, but all the healthcare professionals who are working to keep us healthy . Fortis graduate Leticia Hernandez, RHIT, RN, BSN and Practice Manager at Miami Hematology and Oncology Associates, shares her sentiments from the frontlines: \"We have always been on the front lines of disease and epidemics. We see and do so much more than what the public ever observes. As nurses, we step in head-first to confront viruses, cancers, diseases and trauma.\" At Fortis College Cutler Bay , we are especially proud of our students who have graduated and are working as essential members of our healthcare community . Since January 2020, more than 80 stu-dents have graduated from our Associate Degree in Nursing program on their way to becoming registered nurses. While most of these graduates had no idea how the world would be changing in response to the pandemic, they still felt the calling to become a nurse and give back to their communities in the greater Miami area. In their own words, Fortis students have shared this sentiment. \"I love taking care of people and it's rewarding for us to know that we're there for the patient. For some patients we're the only family they have and the only one they see every day .\" \"I have an affection for people. I love being around people. I love taking care of them, helping them in many forms and capacities. Nursing seems to encompass this the most for me.\" \"I wanted to be a nurse because I want to save the world. It's a big dream\u2014a very big dream.\" In addition to our Associate Degree in Nursing program, Fortis College Cutler Bay has graduated the first class of its practical nursing program, which was launched in July 2020. Since the early days of the Covid-19 crisis, our Medical Assisting and Medical Assisting with Basic X-Ray programs have also graduated dozens of students who eagerly trained to enter the healthcare industry . To these graduates, our students, our faculty and all the other healthcare profes-sionals working every day to save lives, we thank you for continuing to go above and beyond. In this season of thanksgiving, we are giving thanks for you. Fortis College Cutler Bay offers both Associate Degree in Nursing and Practical Nursing programs as well as Medical Assisting.

COVID has had a huge impact on our personal lives, our professional lives, our healthcare system, our educa-tional system. It's interesting to think that for the past 40 plus years of my teaching and research career, that I have used an in-depth class exer-cise putting my students on teams in the role of a health care system C-Suite watching a Pandemic unfolding, asking the teams how they would manage, how they would lead. I could never have imagined that this exercise would become a reality . But the issues we have been enduring for these many months provide signifi-cant insights as to how we go forward in 2022 as it emphasizes the importance of a common vision for the healthcare sys-tem and the various elements of it, the professionals who serve it and the educa-tional process which provides concepts and critical thinking methodologies nec-essary to manage, to lead. What have we learned in healthcare education as we go forward? It is imper-ative that we incorporate disaster pre-paredness and recovery in our healthcare educational programs. Thousands of healthcare organizations were completely unprepared to deal with the health crisis we just experienced. All the aspects of healthcare management and leadership become critical in times of crisis and these issues cut across disci-plines in healthcare management educa-tion. Let's step back for a moment and assess where we must adjust our think-ing going forward. The Institute for Health Improvement came out a number of years ago with the Triple Aim: Achieving a significantly positive patient experience, achieving metrics of population health, and achiev-ing these quality metrics in a cost-effec-tive manner. And now a fourth aim has been added and that is the quality of the work life experience of healthcare work-ers, administrative, clinicians, and staff. The Pandemic has truly allowed us to understand the importance of this fourth aim. As such, our courses need to reflect upon these aspects of healthcare provi-sion as well. So let's begin with human resource management as there has been no greater impact of COVID than this area. Clinicians and staff were providing sup-port to our patients when their own lives were at risk, a risk so far greater than anything we could have imagined. Employee family structures were impact-ed and family health issues in turn impacted the ability of health care personnel to work. Childcare issues impact-ed on the ability of health care workers to work when their young chil-dren were out of school. Add to this the shortage of protective supplies to keep healthcare person-nel as healthy as possible, a function of a supply chain shortage and the ethics associated with distribution deci-sions. Human resource management, supply chain, health care ethics are all aspects of our educational programs. Resultant organizational behavior in a time of crisis becomes far more complex as structures and interactions under stress require appropriate adjustments. Budgeting and financing, always diffi- cult in the provision of healthcare where margins are slim to begin with, requires far more innovative thinking in terms of revenue enhancement, or at least rev-enue maintenance and cost containment. Hence the principles of operations research and Lean-Six Sigma methodolo-gies of process improvement become that much more important. Flexibility and assuring the minimiza- tion of waste becomes important in times of increased financial stress. Supply chain efficiencies become critical. All must be done in a legally compliant man-ner, an area with greater and greater complexity . Ultimately , we must remember that we are dealing with people: those who man-age, those who provide clinical services, those who provide the support services, those that provide the medical supplies and devices, those who provide counsel and ultimately , it is our patients and their families, the people, all to be treated in a compassionate manner. There are other areas of health care management and leadership education that will be important to address as we move into next year and beyond. Areas such as health care technology , from advances in such areas as telemedicine, finally reimbursable, to artificial intelli-gence (with the caveat artificial intelli-gence is subject to bias which must be understood). The complexity of pharmaceutical pricing, pharmaceutical research, devel-opment and production, value-based purchasing, persistent shortage of life saving drugs, questions as to how to eth-ically distribute, and public relations to deal with these various aspects of the industry are significant. Ultimately , we must understand how to be strategic in our thinking. We tend to be reactionary perhaps especially given the special circumstances associat-ed with COVID. But this is not an envi-ronment where we can be just tactical. It becomes essential to understand how the health care industry will be impacted by significant changes in demographics, the aging of our population, coupled with the increasing focus by governments to contain spending at the federal, state, and local level. These are critical ele-ments which will impact health care providers. Further as insurance providers, and employers put increasing pressure on physicians and health care systems to provide quality care at reduced costs or to be excluded from health care networks entirely , providers will have to think about how to adjust to the health care environment ... in 2022 and beyond. It is essential that health care management and leadership educa-tion reflect these needs. Dr. Steven G. Ullmann, Professor and Chair, Department of Health Management and Policy, Director, Center for Health Management and Policy, and Special Assistant to the Provost at Miami Herbert Business School, University of Miami, can be reached at (305) 284-9920 or Sullmann@miami.edu.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects approxi-mately 174,000 job openings for CNAs each year between 2019 and 2029. The project-ed growth for CNAs is fore-casted at 6.9% over the next few years in Florida. CNAs are in very high demand in Florida-second only to California in employing CNAs. Employers often search the CNA registry to fill these high demand posi-tions, so becoming certified provides a distinct advantage. The starting salary of over $27,000 can be increased with experience and acqui-sition of skills such as phlebotomy . CNA certification falls under the auspice of the Florida Department of Health/Board of Nursing requiring a background screening and a testing fee of $155. CNA students participate in both classroom and clinical experiences to become competent mem-bers of the healthcare team culminating in a CNA certification exam. Afford ability is certainly a strength as the financial and time commitment is less than an academic degree. With the growing job market, the decision to become a CNA offers many opportunities. Miami Dade College is meeting the challenge to remedy the CNA shortage in South Florida by providing an entry pathway for CNAs through continuing education. The Benjamin Leon School partnered with continuing education to meet the needs of the community and provide a career that can be accom-plished in a short period of time while assisting these members of the commu-nity to be employed and improve socioe-conomic status. This collaboration with continuing education is to offer CNA training at both the Medical Campus located in the heart of the health district and the south Homestead Campus with a goal to expand into other zip codes in the near future. Nursing students are provided with contacts for employment in many areas such as hospitals, clinics, extended care, and community/home health. Profess - ional opportunities for CNAs are brighter than ever with the career ladder presented to all candidates. The support and resources now provided to these stu-dents are coupled with community needs for immediate employment upon gradu-ation. MDC is developing pathways for CNAs to gain academic credit through prior learning assessment that includes work experience providing a career lad-der to become a licensed practical nurse (LPN) or registered nurse (RN). \"Earn while you learn\" can certainly be a goal for the CNA as employers seeking to up-skill employees may consider financial support while completing a nursing degree. CNAs are a valuable member of the healthcare team working with registered nurses, physicians, nurse practitioners, and ancillary services. Working under the supervision of the RN or LPN, the role of the CNA includes assisting indi-viduals with activities of daily living, monitoring vital signs, feeding, and assisting with ambulation are just a few of the skills provided by the CNA. CNAs have the opportunity to impact the lives of people based on the care provided in an environment that adds to their knowl-edge in a rapidly growing healthcare industry . Dr. T ommie L.

Barbera said the centerpiece of the healthcare system is hospitals, but \"What we're seeing is the healthcare environ-ment expanding and becoming a lot more diverse. I try to make sure students understand that there are other opportu-nities within healthcare that are not in hospitals, which are just as gratifying and rewarding. When they graduate, they are aware they have a multitude of health-care opportunities they might not have ever thought of.\" As examples, he mentioned that long- term care is a great opportunity for some-one who is looking for a career in health administration. Another is home health-care, which is growing significantly - not only because of the graying of America, but also because of what the pandemic taught us. \"Consumers love (home healthcare) because they can stay in their own home environment and have service and providers come to them. Physician prac-tices need to be managed as well. Then you have general outpatient care, whether it be ambulatory surgery , urgent care centers - these are all opportunities that require management to oversee what they're doing.\" The 15-month program requires that students come in with a certain amount of experience in healthcare. Barbera explained, \"We do that because we are cohort-based, so we have a collection of students who are in the same class and pretty much follow the program together. The benefit is that they learn from each other, and by the time they graduate they are very close to each other; so it makes a nice environment for teaching and for learning. They learn by discussing things, and that's the best way for these programs to function, where you have cohorts with similar-style students in them.\" Barbera pointed out another important facet of the EMHA: \"We started a faculty ambassador program where every stu-dent is assigned a faculty member. I'm one. I have students who are connected with me, and I will always be in touch with them to see how it's going, if they have any questions.\" He said it's been extremely effective, because it provides students - especially online students who need someone to connect with - with a direct link to the university . \"They're doing the program at their own pace, but because of their busy sched-ules, they don't have time to make that commitment. This makes them feel a part of the program.\" Perhaps the most important reason for pursuing an EMHA is that, as Barbera said, healthcare is never going to go away . \"Healthcare is here forever, so you can devote your education and your direct experience in an industry that you know is going to be around. The other thing about healthcare is it's extremely challenging and dynamic, because it changes on a daily basis.\" He talked specifically about how things will be different in the post-pan-demic environment, how some concepts healthcare providers and organizations had prior to the pandemic will have little value. \"They're almost going to have to start new. They'll be thinking more along lines of virtual care, like telemedicine, telehealth. That's where a lot of changes are going to be taking place. \"So it's exciting. Never a dull moment in healthcare, it's an industry that's so dynamic, so diverse.\" And full of oppor-tunities for professionals with an EMHA.

In Florida, the situation is dire\u2014the Florida Hospital Association and the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida reports that the state will face a shortfall of 59,100 nurses by 2035. In order to increase the number of nurses in the workforce, Florida Atlantic University (FAU) introduced the Second Degree Working Professional Bachelor of Science in Nursing program in 2019. Offered at FAU's Davie Campus, this pro-gram allows individuals who have previ-ously earned a bachelor's degree or higher in other areas to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. \"A lot of people talk about having an interest in nursing, but they didn't pursue it because they took other career paths,\" explained Safiya George, Ph.D., APRIN-BC, FAANP , dean and professor, Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, Florida Atlantic University . \"The biggest barrier to them going back to school is that they can't commit to a full-time program; they have families to support and need to be able to work full-time to live.\" The second degree program at FAU is offered part-time on weekday evenings and weekends, and students attend classes in person during the week, or watch live streams online. Skills labs and hands-on assessments are done in person, as are clinical rotations. \"While we haven't targeted any specific industries, we are seeing a lot of interest from social workers, people in banking and finance, teachers, and those with healthcare administration degrees who have the desire to be in actual patient care,\" said George. The two-year program graduated its first cohort this past August, and expects to graduate approximately 80 students each year. \"As you can imagine, there are already more employment opportunities for nurs-es than there are nurses; some students in this last rotation already had employers contacting them with opportunities,\" said George. \"Anyone who wants a job after they pass their licensing exam can find oppor-tunities here in Florida, as well as in other states,\" she continued. \"And if they decide to do something else, such as take a position in nurse staffing, those jobs are available even before they take the NCLEX-RN (National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses).\" FAU has a number of pilot programs available to help graduates land positions once they earn their licenses. \"We work with one healthcare system that commits to hiring our nurses if they've done their rotations there,\" said George. \"At a differ-ent healthcare system, students can sub-mit an application to be hired as nurse externs, so they are learning patient care technician skills while in nursing school; when they finish, they can apply to become registered nurses on-site.\" FAU also offers other options to help individuals get into the nursing field, from the freshman direct admit program for high school seniors, to a fulltime course for those with previous degrees that fol-lows an accelerated track. In addition, the university offers a number of healthcare-related courses for the broader population, including a telehealth course that shows students how to implement that technolo-gy and connect with patients on a deeper level. Not only is FAU seeing a lot of interest in the second degree program, but George said that she is seeing increased interest in the field of nursing as well. \"We're really seeing a mix of things right now; while some nurses are burned out and retire or leave the field entirely , sur-prisingly , a lot of people want to get into nursing now because of the pandem-ic\u2014they realize the importance of improving patient outcomes,\" she said. \"They're the ones who say , 'Sign me up, I want to join the front lines,' because they are excited about what nurses are doing,\" she continued. \"They see it as a way for them to make a difference, to help those other health-care heroes who are on the front lines.\" Spring classes for the Second Degree Working Professional Bachelor of Science in Nursing program begin Jan. 8, 2022, with applications closing Nov. 1. The fall 2022 application period opens Feb. 1 and closes April 9, 2022. For more information, visit https://nursing.fau.edu/admissions/index.php.

At VITAS, our executive leaders instill a strong sense of purpose that enables our teams to turn their passion for healthcare into something palpable and satisfying as they focus on quality of life near the end of life for patients and families. Culture-building starts with leaders who are present, accessible, and approachable with an authentic desire to listen to and learn from their staff. Culture itself must be intentional, sus- tained, and proactive. At VITAS, we devel-oped the VITAS Difference: an engage-ment and culture-building program that demonstrates and celebrates each team member's contributions by living and breathing the behaviors and ethos that improve the lives of our patients and their families. The program's three pillars uplift every employee, celebrate everyday excel-lence, and drive every aspect of patient-centered hospice care: \u0081 Commitment: a vow to build trust and maintain a servant attitude to all, manifest by employees who show up on time for shifts and patient appointments and who communicate consistently with patients and family members before, dur-ing, and after visits \u0081 Compassion: a promise to provide heartfelt care by listening actively and carefully to others' needs, honoring the meaningful moments that our patients and their families invite us to share, treat-ing everyone with empathy and respect, and making difficult situations better \u0081 Can-Do Attitude: a mindset of going above and beyond to provide excellent care, consistently showing up with a pos-itive attitude and collaborative spirit, and inspiring others to do the same To embed sincere employee apprecia- tion into everyday activities, we launched a recognition program in 2021 that spans the nation.

Weeks later, Governor Ron DeSantis signed Executive Order 20-91, out-lining a \"Safer at Home\" pol-icy intended to protect Floridians through tempo-rary isolation. While the full statewide shutdown last- ed slightly more than a month, those of us in healthcare are still coping with lingering restrictions, a changing care landscape, and reasonable concerns from patients, their families, and our peers and partners in the industry . Driven by compassion and a commit- ment to our community , South Florida providers and clinicians have continued to treat and support patients in person through the most restrictive periods of the pandemic. VITAS Healthcare\u2014the nation's leading provider of end-of-life care, and a corner-stone of South Florida healthcare for more than 40 years\u2014is no exception. Our hospice and palliative care services support over 18,000 patients with advanced illness and their loved ones in 14 states and the District of Columbia every day . More than 10,000 employees carry out our incredibly rewarding mission: to pro- vide comfort and dignity to patients and their families as they face the end of life together. Through education, resource sharing, and volun- teer efforts, VITAS also sup- ports numerous partner organizations and initiatives dedicated to improving quality of life for vulnerable people throughout the communities we serve: veterans groups, food banks, disaster relief initiatives, and many more. Most VITAS teams\u2014comprising a physician, nurse, aide, chaplain, social worker, volunteer, and bereavement spe-cialist\u2014care for patients wherever they call home. We've built a mobility-first care model using leading-edge technology and operational practices to ensure seamless care coordination and uninterrupted sup-port for patients with advanced illness in any setting. During COVID-19, VITAS has gone even further to protect our staff, partners, patients, and their families without sacri-ficing quality of care. From the earliest days of the pandemic, VITAS has coordinated with the White House COVID-19 Task Force and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, enabling quick adaptation to changing policies and safety guidelines. We stocked up on personal protective equipment to keep our teams and patients safe during routine care in every imagina-ble setting. Additionally , we staffed every VITAS location with an infection control manager to oversee COVID-protocol com-pliance and respond to potential risks. The advantages of our highly mobile, flexible approach to care became especially apparent during the pandemic and contin-ue today . VITAS' mobile technology and telehealth capabilities allow us to deliver complex modalities and symptom relief in heavily restricted settings, transition eligi-ble patients to hospice 24/7, and involve physically distant family members in their loved ones' care. Our embrace of telehealth also ensures that patients, families, and staff at partner-ing facilities receive the psychosocial and spiritual support they require, whenever they require it, from VITAS chaplains and social workers. VITAS employees and volunteers worked hard to keep up with beloved tra-ditions and much-appreciated services amid COVID-19 restrictions: \u0081 Special parades thanked our fellow healthcare workers and uplifted isolated care facility residents \u0081 Music therapists and lovable Paw Pals pet volunteers visited and entertained patients through windows \u0081 A variety of Zoom and phone-in sup- port groups (available in English and Spanish) continue to help families and community members through challenging times\u2014and also facilitated a nationwide virtual celebration of Veterans Day VITAS recognized and addressed the growing personal needs of our staff during this period by expanding employee bene-fits to include Teladoc appointments, an Employee Assistance Program, and extra paid time off. Through it all, VITAS kept employees' insurance premiums down, avoided lay-offs, and continued to provide competitive merit-based pay increases companywide. I'm proud to work for a South Florida healthcare provider that understands the importance of protecting and caring for its employees. Hospice and palliative care are people-focused specialties, and VITAS has never failed to support the people who provide that care. If you're looking for a fulfilling career centered on helping others in their most challenging moments, I encourage you to join our talented team of compassionate professionals.

ImageFIRST's goal has always been to help positively impact patient care and make life easier for the staff that is taking care of the patients. \"We manage the linen program so your staff can focus on the patient,\" says Juffre. \"Many of our products are designed to increase patient satisfaction. Most health systems, hospitals, and doctors, have two top priorities: patient care and staff engagement. The linen is just a by-product of helping our clients achieve their number one and number two goals.\" The rising costs of supplies this past year has impacted many healthcare facilities and has been difficult for everybody , Juffre acknowledges. \"Prices and inflation are going through the roof right now ,\" he says. \"These challenges are real. Inflation is at a 13-year high, everything is going up and the price of gasoline is also impacting the deliveries of supplies.\" While price increases are inevitable at any company , ImageFIRST aims to only increase prices once a year, and they have been able to maintain that through 2021. \"One thing we're doing for our clients right now is eating all of the increased costs rather than unexpectedly increase the cost to our customer. We were able to hold our pricing firm for 2021 and delay any increases until next year,\" says Juffre. \"We're doing that by becoming more efficient with routing and in our production facilities. Creating a partnership with our clients is key and part of that partnership is trying to ensure that our clients can take care of patients right now and not worry about unprojected costs.\" Juffre says another one of their client's pain points is balanc- ing patient care with patient safety . \"Something that most health systems want to do is maintain a good connection with their patients,\" he says. \"With social distancing and mask mandates, it's been a challenge. What we're trying to do is be a resource to them so they can keep everybody safe, and at the same time, make sure that patients feel comfortable. Some of our products are designed to do that, such as the gown line and scrub lines we manufacture.\" This past year, ImageFIRST took its RFID technology to another level in terms of their ability to manage scrub pro-grams and fluid resistant gowns. During the pandemic last year, the company started manufacturing its own line of fluid resistant isolation gowns. \"We added RFID chips to all our scrubs and isolation gowns to track what's coming and going, as well as to better manage our clients' needs.\" says Juffre. \"RFID technology is big in the medical world, and we've always been on the cutting edge of that in terms of tracking inventory , especially as it comes to scrubs. Our ScrubVAULT\u00ae System helps them manage scrubs, mops, towels, and other products. It has been great for our clients.\" The ScrubVAULT\u00ae System allows full accountability for the scrubs being used and by whom. Providers are able to better manage their inventory because the system relies on UHF RFID chip technology . This ensures providers have the scrubs they need when they need it, making it more beneficial to them and ultimately , also to their patients by freeing up staff to focus more on patient care. Health systems right now should be looking for true partners that want to work with them through the rest of the pandemic and through these rising costs, adds Juffre. \"ImageFIRST has always been a company that truly wants to be the partner our customers can't live without,\" he says. \"I encourage them to do that with all their vendor partners. Let's get through this together and let's make sure that patients get the best care they can.\" For more information, visit www.imagefirst.com or call (800) 368-3676.

We incorporate the latest evidence-based and scientific interventions to pro-vide the best treatments available to our patients and community . Lessons learned really have provided us a fresh view of our incredible workforce - folks who have performed heroically in the face of a constantly shifting landscape that has taken an enormous emotional and physical toll on them. Wellness has never before been more important or integral to keeping them healthy .\" From the beginning, Broward Health followed the guidance from the Federal and State governments to help ensure the safety and welfare of the employees. \"We continue to advocate mask usage, hand hygiene, and physical distancing. Broward Health was an early adopter of different medications used to treat those infected with COVID-19, including monoclonal antibodies,\" says Dr. Lenchus. \"And, we have consistently underscored the importance of vaccina-tion, from setting up numerous sites for our employees, their families, and the community through our messaging to the public at-large.\" Although he expects COVID-19 is likely to be with us for some time, Dr. Lenchus is increasingly hopeful that we are gaining the upper hand with each wave encountered, especially as we learn more about disease prevention and treat-ment tools for the virus. He offers some practical advice to the general public. \"Broward Health is here to serve the community , as it has been for more than 80 years,\" he says. \"Do not postpone medical care. Regularly see your doctor. Maintain a healthy lifestyle and diet. Wear your mask. Wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Physically distance your-self from others, especially if they are or may be sick. Vaccinate yourself and encourage those around you to follow these protective measures.

Lee Health Announces Substantial Expansion Plans in Cape Coral Lee Health is investing nearly $150 million to expand Cape Coral Hospital and bring additional health care services to the City of Cape Coral. The Lee Health Board of Directors recently approved plans to expand the intensive care unit (ICU) at Cape Hospital, add additional treatment bays in the Emergency Department and purchase a 22.7-acre parcel of land in the city . Other new projects are also underway . The 12-bed expansion of the ICU increases the number of available beds from 22 to 34. The expansion of the emergency department creates six additional treatment bays and a 12-bed observation unit, which allows patients to be monitored for up to 24 hours without being admitted to the hospital. Lee Health anticipates using the newly acquired land in the city to build an innovative health care facility similar to Lee Health Coconut Point, which opened in Estero in December of 2018. In addition to the planned expansions, Cape Coral Hospital is poised to become a teaching hospital as Lee Health will soon launch its internal medicine residency program at Cape Coral Hospital. This program, in partnership with the Florida State University College of Medicine, will provide top-tier training and bring more highly-skilled doctors to our area. This is Lee Health's second physician residency program, and the family medicine program based at Lee Memorial Hospital has proven effective at retaining high-ly-trained doctors in Southwest Florida. When it reaches full capacity , the internal med-icine residency program will house 36 residents. The Lee Health Board of Directors also approved a plan to construct a new building on the southeast corner of Palm Tree Boulevard and Cape Coral Parkway . Known as Bimini Basin, this project will include a large medical office footprint and apartment units located on top of the medical space. This project brings access to high-quality med-ical care to an area of Cape Coral that is currently underserved. The popular outpatient facility at Surfside is also growing. With a 14,000 square foot expansion, Surfside is adding to its list of convenient services to provide health care close to home. What's New... What's New... What's New...

I was recruited by Columbia Care in 2019 to leverage my strengths, experience and history of business growth. I was familiar with cannabis before I joined, but quickly learned that it is a far more complex and sophisticated science than I ever could have imagined. It's been a really inspiring journey to see, from beginning to end, the process of growing such high-quality cannabis and sharing it with others who share in the passion or are just excited to try it for the first time. Are you personally a MJ card holder? No, we relocated to Georgia from New York and the medical program has not come online yet. Do you see Florida moving forward with recreational Marijuana/cannabis and how will that affect your business? I think a recreational program is on the horizon, yes. Patients and their medical needs will always be prioritized, but we are well positioned to support the influx of customers once an adult-use program comes online. Our Cannabist locations are designed to support patients (and eventually customers) of all experience levels. When Florida eventually goes recreational, I think we'll see an increased demand for more ranges of products and brands, which we'll be excited to provide. 30 November 2021 cannabisnewsflorida.com Cannabis News Florida Back Cover Story: Cannabis Spotlight: Jesse Channon Continued from page 32Florida's Resource for Medical & Business Cannabis Developments PO NANCY LAMMIE JMC Graphics Art/Production JUDY GRAMM Editorial Manager CONTRIBUTING WRITERS Daniel Casciato \u0081 Barbara Fallon Vanessa Orr \u0081 Lois Thomson SUBSCRIPTIONS One Year - $45 T wo Years - $70 Three Years - $85 To subscribe, call (561) 368-6950 Or email: carol@cannabisnewsflorida.com All rights reserved.

It is important to acknowledge that CBD does provide health benefits to the human body . As misinformation begins to spread, the use of CBD for various health advantages will inevitably diminish out of fear for liver toxicity . The endo-cannabinoid system (ECS) is found in all mammals and con-sists of receptors (CB1 and CB2) endogenous cannabinoids, and enzymes that facilitate their production or break them down. The ECS is responsible for regulating many of our homeostatic control processes. When the liver gets damaged, inflamed, or dysfunctional, the body starts to release more endocannabinoids to solve the problem. A healthy liver is correlated with a modest activity of the endocannabinoid system. In fact, this particular organ has a relatively low concentration of the ECS components. However, inflammation in the liver causes endocannabinoids to be very active in this area. Unfortunately , an overactive endocannabinoid system plays a role in the development of fatty liver disease (1). CBD mod-ulates the CB1 and CB2 receptors by stopping particular com-pounds that make these receptors disrupt the liver. CBD ensures the proper functioning of a system that balances us. So while it won't cure fatty liver disease, it can prevent its devel- opment. And should disease occur, it may be able to decrease inflammation to in the organ, protecting it against further damage. Furthermore, CBD users are being presented with unreliable information, potentially causing some patients to turn to more conventional medication such as opioids. The untrustworthy nature of many CBD-related studies is tampering with lives, public health, the economy , business owners, the entire hemp industry , and so on. The spread of misinformation regarding CBD use is critically hazardous for two primary reasons; CBD users will be deterred by unreliable publications which express potential toxicity at abnormal doses, and the hemp industry will be shattered by a devastating drop in CBD use. Nevertheless, in order to combat such damaging circum- stances, more research must be conducted to determine a more practical dosing system (potentially basing dosage on weight, height, gender, genetics, etc.) and at which dose CBD may pose a threat towards liver toxicity .

Red White & Bloom Florida LLC, a Red White & Bloom Brands subsidiary , acquired a 45,000 sq. ft. greenhouse with 4.7 acres in Apopka, Florida in July 2021. Phase one of the company's initial plans for cultivation in Florida, the build-out of Apopka, is now complete. In addition, the site received regulatory approval to commence operations on Sept. 29, 2021. In anticipation of receiving the cultivation license, RWBFL had pre-pared mother stock in advance, and these plants arrived at the greenhouse the morning of Sept 30, 2021. The flower production in the initial Apopka licensed area is capable of pro-ducing 85 g per plant, with projected annual revenue from this area is in excess of USD $10,000,000 and opera-tions having commenced on Sept 30, 2021. Additionally , the newly designed grow will supply phase two of the Florida plans with the activation of thirty 16' x 40' customized, self-con-tained growing pods. With a targeted Q4 launch, the pods are anticipated to yield almost 10,000 pounds of dried flower per year representing a current medical market value of USD $30,000,000. Phase three of the Company's initial launch in the State will be the activation of the 113,000 sq. ft. indoor grow facility in Sanderson, Florida. Projecting a Q4 2021 harvest schedule in the Apopka facility , the company has added additional cultiva-tion specialists specifically for the Florida project from the highly-talent- ed local labor market. \"We brought this site into production ahead of forecast and ahead of budget and I'm very proud of our Florida team,\" said Brad Rogers, CEO of Red White & Bloom. \"Despite being rela-tively new players in the Florida mar-ket, I feel we have the most talented team of PhDs and horticulturalists, and an incredible grow infrastructure to bring the highest quality products, rich in terpenes and cannabinoid content, to some of the best retail locations in the state starting in Q1 2022.\" RWB Launches Phase 1 of Cultivation Expansion in $1.3 Billion Florida Market 34 November 2021 cannabisnewsflorida.com Cannabis News Florida AROUND THE REGIONTM Level-funded Health Plans I just returned from MJBizCon, the largest cannabis conference of the year. This year, I heard from dispensary owners across the country that many haven't been quoted level-funded health plans. It's open enroll-ment \u2014 a time many business owners are r eviewing their health plan options \u2014 so I thought this would be a good time to discuss these. I spoke to several dispensaries whose benefits were offered through a payroll company . They are fre-quently limited to a few fully-insured plans and lack the ability to shop the market. It's important to have an inde-pendent health broker who has access to all plans, especially considering today's health insurance premiums. Level-funded health plans were histor- ically offered to large businesses; today carriers offer plans to employers with ten employees. Moving from a fully insured health plan to self-fund- ing can seem daunting for smaller employers. The good news is that there is a hybrid solution called level-funded health plans for employers that want to move away from fully insured health care but are not yet ready to com- pletely self-insure. Without going into too much detail, they look like a fully-insured health plan to the employee. Your broker can help you design copays for doctor visits, pharmaceuticals, and other benefits. With a level-funded plan, an employer pays a health carrier the same monthly amount to cover the esti-mated cost for expected claims, the pre- mium for stop-loss insurance that covers health care costs over a set dollar amount, and plan administration costs. If total claims costs are higher or lower than expected, the carrier makes adjustments at the end of the plan year in the form of a refund to the employer for lower claims or a premium increase on the stop-loss insur-ance renewal for higher claims. Stop-loss coverage is an essential part of this arrangement because it limits an employ-er's financial responsibility for claims over a certain amount, either on a per-employ-ee basis or for the entire covered popula-tion. Some carriers offer fully customizable benefits. It is possible to create copays for lab and x-ray , emergency room visits, and more. In the fully-insured market, these are frequently applied to a member's deductible, so level-funded health plans allow us to customize an employee bene-fits package to fit the employer's needs. Wellness plans and teledoc visits can be included with these plans. Level-funded plans are more complicat- ed to quote and set up, but they can offer a multi-year strategy rather than shopping rates at renewal every year. Carriers will often accept fully-insured group applica-tions through the last day of the month for fully-insured plans and quotes can often be obtained within hours whereas level-funded plans require employees to com-plete a medical questionnaire and have deadlines for submission. It's also impor-tant to have an accurate census when quoting because a census change can dras-tically alter the rates. If this is an option you're interested in for January 1, you should be looking at your options now. As always, please feel free to reach out with any questions.

Cannabinoids are banned by the NCAA and can result in suspension.\" The changes in policy coincide with an increased acceptance within our society of cannabis use and a relaxation of policy within other organizations such as Major League Baseball (MLB), National Football League (NFL), and the National Basketball Association (NBA). What remains puzzling is the language being used that bans all cannabinoids, especial-ly CBD, since there is not a specific test sensitive to detecting anything other than THC in the urine samples. Since CBD is now legally sold over the counter almost everywhere and has been reclassi-fied as a federally scheduled 5 drug, it is a mystery why it remains banned by the NCAA. Despite the elevated threshold and reduced penalty , the NCAA made it very clear that these changes are not an endorsement of cannabis use. The Association also didn't want to place the threshold too high and imply that the NCAA condones cannabis use and did not cite any performance enhancing effects of any cannabinoid. It is estimated that there are nearly 500,000 student athletes playing an NCAA sport each year. The purpose of the drug testing program is to ensure equitable competition among the partici-pants so the playing field is even and undo any enhanced supplementation that would benefit one's performance above and beyond natural training prac-tices and habits. At the recreational level, the estimated 1/5 million NCAA athletes come from a pool of millions of athletes. Therefore, the policies that the NCAA embraces will be essentially adhered to by many others in preparation for their next steps in sport participation. It is essential for the NCAA to address this topic sooner versus later so that they apply best practices and standards that are in line with the federal and state (as well as International) legislation and guidelines, clarify their language to accu-rately test for and ban what is intended to be screened for, and update their stances based upon the current literature relative to what the different cannabi-noids function to do and if/how testing is used for detection. Any penalties that remain in place should reflect a reason-able rationale that would support unfair play . Otherwise, testing need no longer be performed for such a purpose, and if testing is continued it should be done for the sole purpose of detecting cannabis use disorders and left to the respective medical staffs of each school to intervene with a student-athlete's health and well-being.

Back Cover: NCAA Drug T esting for Cannabis - Why Does It Matter? Continued from page 36 E-mail your Cannabis news to: carol@cannabisnewsflorida.com BY MICHELLE WEINER, DO, MPH, AND DOMENICK NICHOLAS MAGLIONE In recent years, the use of cannabidiol (CBD) as medicine has risen at astronomical rates, providing medical patients with a more traditional approach to treating various health complica-tions. In contrast to the progression of CBD use nationwide, there have been many concerns regarding CBD's toxicity to the human liver. In an effort to mitigate public health risks brought upon by an increase in CBD use coupled with resulting poten-tial liver toxicity , many research studies have been conducted to identify whether CBD is a safe alternative form of medication. Unfortunately , a great deal of these studies have failed to con- duct reliable research due to many protocol, experimental, and conclusive flaws. In April 2019, a study titled \"Hepatoxicity of a Cannabidiol-Rich Cannabis Extract in the Mouse Model\" was published in Molecules journal despite the numerous study flaws. In this study , extremely high doses of isolated Cannabidiol (CBD) extract were administered to six individual mice. The administered dose of CBD given to a small organism such as a mouse was notably high, more than 100 times the dose of Epidiolex, a CBD schedule 5 pharmaceutical indicated for infantile seizure disorders in children. CBD was adminis-tered as an isolate (contributing to heightened potency) and formulated with hexane, a Neurotoxin. The study reported that 75% of the mice had died (this would suggest that 4.5 of the six mice had died). This study had generated much attention from the media, resulting in a distribution of flawed science especial-ly related to liver toxicity . In addition to flawed publications, the current state of CBD use and administration is illogical and elementary . For instance, CBD is typically never dosed based on distinct prop-erties such as genetics, meaning patients could be receiving far beyond a reasonable dose. This then poses yet another issue; CBD is inaccessible for many patients due to its cost. Some patients may be paying hundreds of dollars for a 1000mg CBD product like a tincture, when in reality , an ideal dosing system could reveal that those same patients may need less for suffi-cient treatment, therefore making CBD medication more affordable. Expensive CBD products may also be pushing patients away and more towards unregulated products, which November 2021 Continued on page 352019 Cannabis Business Award's Publication of the Year Jesse Channon CHIEF GROWTH OFFICER OF COLUMBIA CARE What benefits do you see for patients throughout Florida within this space? The cannabis industry is evolving really quick- ly . It's a great time for patients to start exploring the power of the plant and all its various forms, whether they are actively medicating or just starting to learn more. I think one of the great things about the Florida market is how accessible medical cannabis is to patients. We have 14 dis-pensaries across the state that serve a growing number of patients. What motivates you to be a part of the cannabis Industry? The pace of growth of this industry keeps me excited. There is so much opportunity for innovation at every single level, and I love being part of teams that bring those ideas to fruition. I was thrilled to bring my tech background and apply it to an emerging industry where some of these advancements didn't exist including our Virtual.Care platform for virtual appoint-ments; Forage, the industry's first cannabis product discovery tool which will be coming to Florida soon; and the CNC card, the industry's first credit card. What field are you in within the cannabis space? In my role, I lead teams focusing on digital capabilities, dispensary growth and corpo-rate branding, as well as launching new technologies and product commercialization initiatives. How can people in Florida benefit from the company you represent? The days of transactional dispensaries are over. Our new retail brand, Cannabist, which all of our Florida Columbia Care dispensaries will be converting to by the end of this year, was designed to elevate the patient journey by inspir-ing, informing, and providing quality products to consumers of all experience levels. We believe Cannabist will set the tone as the new industry standard and make sure the cannabis com-munity feels supported and engaged every time they walk through our doors.

JEFF KONIN In 1986, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) adopted a drug testing policy that included testing for cannabis, or as it was labeled at the time, marijuana. The policy stated that a positive test would result in one full year suspension from athletic eligibility and the suspension would follow a student athlete if he or she opted to transfer schools. For a majority of the time, the threshold for a positive test was 5 nanograms per milliliter. In June of 2019, the THC threshold used for NCAA drug testing was increased from 15 to 35 nanograms per milliliter, and the penalty for a positive test was adjusted to a 6-month suspension, or essentially 50% of participation. The increased threshold was supported by \"wanting to be fair and to eliminate penalizing students who test positive as the result of passive inhalation of smoke.\" The official banned 2020-2021 all cannabi-noids are banned with no allowed med-ical exception request.
