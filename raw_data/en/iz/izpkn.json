Little did I know it was due to my thyroid being out of whack. After about a month of weekly acupuncture treatments and herbal remedies, I did a complete turnaround. I am sleeping much better and throughout the night... My anxiety and heart palpitations are gone. I am so happy to feel normal again. You have no idea how uncomfortable those symptoms were. The fact that I healed so quickly based on her energy work and herbs is a miracle. Now I can focus on other things than my health... like my business, relationships, and enjoying life.
