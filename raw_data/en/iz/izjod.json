Ugh! Usually we'd just grab whatever is on sale at the drugstore, but all body lotion is not created equal. In fact, traditional body lotions can contains some harmful chemicals that could be absorbed through your skin. Many lotions also contain petroleum products, which is something we also like to steer clear of. That's why we did the research and found you the best non-toxic body moisturizers and lotions that are well reviewed and readily available. Why Go Non-Toxic for Lotions When you put something on your skin for a long period of time (like lotion) there's a chance of dermal absorption, which means chemicals gets absorbed through the outer surface of the skin into the body (1). These chemicals can then enter the blood stream and cause negative health effects in areas of the body other than the skin. Scientists have shown that chemicals can be absorbed through the skin, like triclosan (2), parabens (3), phthalates (4), bisphenols (5), and sunscreen chemicals like oxybenzone and octinoxate (6)... all of which can be found in personal care products! We definitely don't want to be putting chemicals like that on our body! That's why we look for a non-toxic or natural body lotion. Ingredients like coconut oil, shea butter, beeswax, and sweet almond oil are all natural ingredients that are safe to use on skin. In fact, you can even try completely natural options like coconut oil and olive oil from your kitchen. But if you want something in a pretty package that is easier to apply, many brands (like the ones listed below!) include these ingredients in their formulations.
