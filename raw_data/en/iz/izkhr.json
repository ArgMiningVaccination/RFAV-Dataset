I could not be more proud of the critically import ant work that the Environment and Natural Resources Division (the Division or ENRD) accomplished this past year in partnership with our clie nt federal agencies, U.S. Attorneys' Offices, and state, local and tribal governments. Furthering the Division's Core Mission The Division is guided by its core mission, which has four key elements: First, strong enforcement of civil and criminal environmental laws to ensure clean air, clean water, and clean land for all Americans; Second, vigorous defense of environmental, wi ldlife and natural resources laws and agency actions; Third, effective representation of the United States in matters concerning the stewardship of our public lands and natural resources; and Fourth, vigilant protection of tr ibal sovereignty, tribal lands and resources, and tribal treaty rights. In all that we do, we are committed to fulfilli ng ENRD's core mission for the benefit of all Americans. All communities deserve clean air, water and land in the places where they live, work, play and learn. The Division strives to ensure that all communities are protected from environmental harms, including those low-income , minority and tribal communities that too frequently live in areas overburdened by pollution. We pursue the goals of Environmental Jus\u00adtice by ensuring that everyone enjoys the benefit of a fair and even-handed application of the nation's environmental laws, and affected comm unities have a meaningf ul opportunity for in\u00ad put in the consideration of appropriate remedies for violations of the law. This report contains a new chapter describing the Division's work in fiscal year 2011 to further Environmental 4 | foreword Ignacia S. Moreno ENRD Assistant Attorney General Justice. As you will see, we have made sign ificant strides toward achieving these goals, but much work remains and our efforts continue. Individual chapters of this repo rt describe the successful resolution of hundreds of cases in furtherance of ENRD's core mission. Our service to the American people re flected in this report is critical to the protection of public health, the environment and natural resources, and the public fisc. We concluded 52 criminal cases against 77 defendants , obtaining nearly 53 years in confinement and over $31.2 million in criminal fines, restitution, community service funds and special assessments. The results obtained from ENRD's civil and criminal cases in fisc al year 2011 were out\u00ad standing. We secured over $625 million in civil and stipulated penalties, cost recoveries, natural resource damages, and other civil monetary relief, includin g almost $420 million recovered for the Superfund. We obtained over $10.9 billion in corrective measures through court orders and settlements\u2014the highest injunctive relief in any fiscal year to date\u2014which will go a long way toward protecting our air, water and other natural resources. We concluded 52 criminal cases against 77 defend ants, obtaining nearly 53 years in confinement and over $31.2 million in criminal fines, restitution, community service funds and special assessments. These results mean tangible health and environ\u00admental benefits for the American people through significant reductions in emissions and discharges of harmful pollutants. Obtaining these results also has other benefits: in fiscal ye ar 2011, ENRD returned more than 85 times its budget in civil and criminal monetary relief and civil corrective measures. It is especially important during these challenging times that violators are held accountable to the fulles t extent of the law. Responsible companies play a key role in growing our economy and protecting the nation. A system that levels the playing field We secured over $625 million in civil and stipulated penalties, cost recoveries, natural resource damages and other civil monetary relief, including almost $420 million recovered for the Superfund. We obtained over $10.9 billion in corrective measures through court orders and settlements\u2014the highest injunctive relief in any fiscal year to date\u2014which will go a long way toward protecting our air, water, and other natural resources. by penalizing those who cut corners to gain an unfair economic advantage serves everyone. The Division will continue to vi gilantly enforce applicable laws and regulations to ensure that we protect the public fisc as well as human health and the environment. foreword | 5 Deepwater Horizon Site NOAA Photo Holding Those Accountable for the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill The Division's top enforcement priority is to hold fully accountable th ose responsible for the tragic loss of life and disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The Deep water Horizon oil spill began on April 20, 2010, when explosions and fires destroyed the Mobile Off\u00ad shore Drilling Rig Deepwa\u00ad ter Horizon approximately 50 miles from the Missis\u00ad sippi River delta. Eleven people aboard the rig tragi\u00ad cally lost their lives; many other men and women were injured. Oil flowed into the Gulf of Mexico unchecked for months. Ultimately, the \"Macondo Well\" was finally sealed on September 19, 2010, nearly five months after the blowout began. By that time, millions of barrels of oil had been discharged into the Gulf and upon adjoining shorelines, causing immense environmental and economic harm to the entire region. In December 2010, as part of the multi-district litigation in the Eastern District of Louisiana, the United States brought suit against BP, Anadarko, MOEX, and Transocean for civil penalties under the Clean Water Act and a declaration of liab ility under the Oil Pollut ion Act. Litigation in this unprecedented case is ongoing. On February 17, 2012, the Department announced an agreement with MOEX Offshore to settle its liab ility in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Ac\u00ad cording to the terms of the settlement, MOEX wi ll pay $70 million in civil penalties to resolve alleged violations of the Clean Water Act\u2014the largest to date under the Clean Water Act\u2014and will spend $20 million in supplemental environmen tal projects to facilitate land acquisition projects in several Gulf states that will preserve and protect in perpetuity habitat and resources important to water quality. Of that $70 million in civil penalties, $25 million will go to the States of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Other ENRD work related to the Deepwater Horizo n oil spill is equally important. During fis\u00ad cal year 2011, the Department continued its crimin al investigation of the spill. The investiga\u00ad tion is being conducted by the Deepwater Horizon Task Force, which was formed in March 2011 to consolidate the efforts of the Department 's Criminal Division, ENRD, and the U.S. At\u00ad torney for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Additionally, th e Division supported the ongoing interagency administrative response critical to avoiding future disasters and to continuing re\u00adsponsible and safe drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. We were able to successfully 6 | foreword resolve a number of high profile and contentious cases filed against client agencies arising from the Deepwater Horizon oi l spill. Finally, I am the Department of Justice's representative on the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, established by Executive Order and respon\u00adsible in an advisory capacity fo r coordinating efforts to restore the Gulf Coast Region. The task force is responsible for coordinating intergov ernmental responsibilities, planning and ex\u00ad change of information so as to better implemen t Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration and to facili\u00ad tate appropriate accountability and suppo rt throughout the restoration process. Protecting the Public From Air Pollution We remain focused on civil and criminal enforcement of the nation's environmental laws in order to address air pollution from the largest and most harmful sources; improve municipal wastewater and stormwater treatment and collection to keep raw sewage, contaminated storm- water and other pollutants out of America's rivers, streams and lakes; and compel, or recover the costs of, hazardous waste cleanup. The case of United States v. BP Products North Amer- ica, Inc., illustrates the Division's important work to enforce the Clean Air Act (CAA). Under the consent decree entered last year, BP paid a $1 5 million civil penalty to resolve claims that it violated CAA chemical accident prevention regu lations at its Texas City, Texas petroleum refin\u00ad ery. The consent decree resolved claims stemming from two fires, one that killed 15 people and injured more than 170 others, and a leak at the refinery that occurred in 2004 and 2005. The penalty is the largest ever assessed for civil violations of the chemical accident prevention regu\u00ad lations and the largest civil penalty recovered fo r CAA violations at an individual facility. Ensuring the Integrity of Municipal Wastewater Treatment Systems Another important example of this work is a seri es of cases that the Division has brought under the Clean Water Act to improve municipal wastewater and stormwater collection and treat\u00adment. From January 2009 through September 2011, courts entered 29 settlements in these cases, requiring long-term control measures and other relief estimated to cost violators more than $13.5 billion. These cases involve one of the most pressing infrastructure issues in the na\u00ad tion's cities\u2014discharges of untreated sewage fr om aging collection systems. Raw sewage con\u00ad tains pathogens that threaten public health. Di scharges of raw sewage may also lead to beach closures as well as public advisories against consumption of fish. Ten consent decrees with municipalities or regi onal sewer districts across the country\u2014from Honolulu, Hawaii to northeast Ohio to Jersey City, New Jersey\u2014were entered in fiscal year 2011. Collectively, they provide for the expenditure of more than $7.6 billion in improvements, the payment of $4.8 million in civil penalties, and the performance of environmental projects valued at more than $10 million. At the same time, in settling these ca ses, the Division, with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has sought to use the flexibility provided under the law and applicable federal policies to consid er the unique circumstances of municipalities facing difficult economic times to shape protecti ve, fair and just resolution of these cases. foreword | 7 Prosecuting Hazardous Waste Violations As in past years, the Division brou ght important cases in such priority areas of criminal enforcement as the Vessel Pollution Program and Worker Safety Initiative and under the Lacey Act to combat wildlife trafficking. One partic ularly notable environmental prosecution is that of Honeywell International. At a facility near Metropolis, Illinois, Honeywell International illegally stored 7,500 55-gallon drums containing radioactive and hazardous slurry from production of uranium hexafluoride (UF6), a compound used in the uranium enrichment process that produces fuel for nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. The company pled guilty to a felony Resource Conservation and Recovery Act violation for knowingly storing hazardous waste without a permit, was sentenced to pay an $11.8 million fine and complete a five-year term of probation, and agreed to develop, fund and implement a ho usehold hazardous waste collection program providing for the proper trea tment, transportation and disposal of waste collected during at least eight collection events over a two-year period at a cost approximating $200,000. Supporting Administrative Actions Related to Climate Change Success in our defensive litigation preserves vita l federal programs and interests. This work reflects the wide range of activities undertaken by the Division's numerous client agencies. One suite of cases known as Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA is notable. On Janu\u00ad ary 2, 2011, EPA's regulations governing motor vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases took ef\u00adfect, triggering not only mobile source regulation , but also regulation of the largest stationary sources in accordance with EPA' s greenhouse gas tailoring rule. Parties have filed scores of lawsuits challenging these actions as well as EPA's finding that greenhouse gas emissions en\u00ad danger public health and welfare and EPA's va rious regulations implementing the greenhouse gas regulations in the states. After extensive br iefing, the D.C. and Fifth Circuits denied mo\u00ad tions seeking to stay the effectiveness of EP A's principal greenhouse gas regulations pending judicial review. This allowed EPA's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to begin as sched\u00ad uled. Last year, we also filed substantial briefs defending the merits of those regulations in the D.C. Circuit. In February 2012, the D.C. Circui t held two back-to-back da ys of oral argument in these cases and its decisions are pending. Achieving Landmark Settlements for the Endangered Species Act Listing Program The third component of the Divisi on's core mission is litigation related to the management of public lands and associated natural and cultural resources. These case s involve federal land, resource and ecosystem management decisions chal lenged under a wide variety of federal stat\u00ad utes that affect more than a half-a-billion acre s of land (totaling nearly one-quarter of the en\u00ad tire land mass of the United States) and hundre ds of millions of acres of subsurface mineral interests. Among these cases handled by the Division in fiscal year 2011 is In re: ESA Section 4 Deadline Litigation . When the Fish and Wildlife Service in the Department of the Interior (FWS) was unable to make timely findings on peti tions for listing species as threatened or 8 | foreword endangered under the Endangered Species Act due to budget and resource constraints, the agency was sued by two organizations in over 20 different lawsuits filed in seven different dis\u00ad trict courts. After nine months of mediation, the Division successfully negotiated two water\u00ad shed settlement agreements under which the FWS will make overdue listing petition findings for more than 600 species by the end of fiscal year 2012 and complete proposed rule determi\u00ad nations for 251 others by the end of fiscal year 20 16. This is likely to result in the listing of many new species for which protective action had languished due to the diversion of resources to litigation. Protecting Tribal Resources We had notable achievements in fiscal year 2011 across the broad range of litigation involving Indian tribes. Vigilant protection of tribal so vereignty, tribal lands and resources, and tribal treaty rights is at the heart of ENRD's core mi ssion. The Division also is charged with repre\u00ad senting the United States in ci vil litigation brought by tribes and their members against the United States, including claims that the United States has br eached its trust responsibility. The United States is strongly committed to re solving the pending tribal trust accounting and trust management cases in an expedited, fair and just manner. One case is worth a special mention. It is the settlement of the Osage Tribe's claims that the United States breached its trust duties and respon sibilities to the tribe by allegedly failing to provide a trust accounting and mismanaging the tribe's trust funds and non-monetary resources (primarily oil and gas resources) from 1896 to 2000. In October 2011, the tribe and the United States agreed to a historic settlement of those claims for $380 million. The settlement was the outcome of months of dedicated effort by both parties to resolve more than a decade of costly litiga\u00ad tion. I believe that this agree\u00ad ment demonstrates the strong commitment of the United States to resolving pending tribal trust accounting and management cases in an expe\u00ad dited, fair and just manner; and shows how we can work to\u00ad gether to settle conflicts that have long defied resolution. Assistant Attorney General Ignacia S. Moreno is joined by Deputy Secretary of the Interior David Hayes, Solicitor of the Interior Hilary Tompkins, Bureau of Indian Affairs Director Michael S. Black, the Treasury Department's General Counsel George W. Madison, Osage Principal Chief John Red Eagle, and other Osage tribal leaders to commemorate the final settlement of histor ic trust accounting an d trust management claims. DOI Photo foreword | 9 I was pleased to stand with the Osage tribal leaders and their counsel and with the Depart\u00ad ments of the Interior and Treasury, in a spirit of partnership and mutual respect, and mark this significant milestone at the signing ceremony on October 21, 2011. Under settlements reached this spring, the United States will pay a total of more than $1 billion to 41 tribes in compensation of the tribes' cl aims regarding the government's management of trust funds and non-monetary trust resources. The settlements set forth a framework for pro\u00ad moting tribal sovereignt y and improving or facilitating aspects of the tribes' relationship with the United States, while reducing or minimizing the possibility of future disputes and avoiding unnecessary litigation. We will continue to pres s forward to right historical wrongs and fulfill the promise of the government-to-government and trust relationship between the United States and the tribes. Litigating Cases Before the U.S. Supreme Court I also would like to acknowledg e the Division's appellate practi ce and the important role we play in supporting the Department's Office of the Solicitor General as it formulates positions on behalf of the United States in cases handled by, or of interest to, the Division. We handle the appeal of cases arising under a multitude of statut es before the federal, and occasionally state, courts of appeals across the country. In additi on, the Division frequently has cases that come before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2010 to 2011, the Supreme Court decided four cases reflect\u00ad ing the breadth of the Division's practice: United States v. Tohono O'odham Nation , conclud\u00ad ing that the Court of Federal Claims lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a tribal breach of trust claim where the tribe had a related suit pending in federal district court; Montana v. Wyo- ming , resolving a dispute between the States of Montana and Wyoming over claims to water in the Yellowstone River Basin; American Electric Power Co., Inc. v. Connecticut , finding that Congress had displaced any public nuisance cause of action that may have existed under fed\u00ad eral common law to address greenhouse gas emissions from power plants; and United States v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe , recognizing the right of the United States to assert the attorney-client privilege to protect documents demanded by an Indian tribe in a breach of trust claim by the tribe against the United States. Working with U.S. Attorneys, States, Tribes and Local Government It is my hope that through this accomplishments report the reader gains a renewed apprecia\u00ad tion of the Division's great work . I must observe that none of it would happen without the tire\u00ad less effort, creativity and initiative of the U.S. Attorneys' Offices across the country, our coun\u00ad terparts in state, tribal and local government, and, most of all, the extraordinary people we have in the Division. I am strongly committed to working closely with the U.S. Attorneys and state, tribal and local partners. Such cooperatio n allows us to solve difficult problems and to make the most efficient use of scare resources, and thus is critical to protection of human health, the environment and natural resources acro ss the country. This report is replete with examples of our continued outreach and the fruits of our joint efforts. 10 | foreword Appreciation of Division Staff For the third year in a row, ENRD was named the \"Best Place to Work in the Federal Govern\u00ad ment\" out of 240 components surveyed. This is due in no small part to the varied, challenging and important work that we do in the Division, bu t also to the collegiality , expertise, dedication and professionalism of the Divisi on's employees. Our people are leaders in the government and experts in their field. They are talented and diverse in ways that reflect the best of our na\u00adtion. And I am committed to doing what I can to ensure the best quality of work life for ENRD employees and to expand their opportunities for pr ofessional growth. Some of our efforts to do just that are described in the final chapter of this report. In closing, I offer my congratulations and than ks to the terrific ENRD management team and staff. We made great strides this past year to protect human health and the environment, and will continue to do more. This is critically im portant work that ensures that all Americans have clean air to breathe, clean water to drink and clean land on which to live. Our work protects our wildlife and natural resources so that we can enjoy them today and in the future. Ignacia S. Moreno Assistant Attorney General Environment and Natural Resources Division April 20, 2012 foreword | 11 Clockwise: Muir Woods; Centennial Park; Sedona Photos Courtesy of Jeffrey Banks In fiscal year 2011, the Division continued to achieve significant victories for the American people across its many practice areas. The chapters of this report briefly describe the organization of the Division, hi ghlight its progress toward achieving the goal of environmental justice in protecting all communities from environmental harm, and describe the Division's key accomplishments. The chapters, which reflect th e components of the Divi sion's mission, are: protecting our nation's air, land, and water; en suring cleanup of oil an d Superfund waste; promoting responsible stewardship of America's wildlife and natural resources; enforcing the nation's pollution and wildlife criminal laws; defending vital federal programs and interests; promoting national security and mi litary preparedness; protecting Indian resources and resolving Indian issues; and support ing the Division's staff. As explained in last year's report, ENRD Accomplishments Report Fiscal Year 2010, environmental justice is one of the priorities of the Division, and there is much progress to report. Action on other priorities--supporting the federal government's efforts to protect the environment and natural resources; Indian Country; working with U.S. Attorneys, states, tr ibes, and local government; national security; and addressing domestic impacts of global pollution and environmental violations--is reflected throughout this report. overview | 13 The Division has a main office in Washington, D.C., and field offices in: Denver, Colorado; Sac- Boston, Massachusetts; and Appellate Anchorage, Alaska. ENRD has a staff of almost Environmental Crimes 700, more than 400 of whom are attorneys. The Environmental Defense Division is organized into nine litigating sections Environmental Enforcement plus the Office of the Assistant Attorney General Indian Resources and the Executive Office. Land Acquisition The Division has responsibility for cases involving Law and Policy more than 150 statutes and represents virtually Natural Resources every federal agency in courts all over the United Wildlife and Marine Resources States and its territories and possessions. Our liti\u00ad gation docket contains almost 7,000 active cases and matters. About one-half of ENRD's lawyers bring cases ag ainst those who violate the nation's civil and criminal pollution-control laws. Others defend environmental challenges to government pro\u00ad grams and activities, and represent the United States in matters concerning the stewardship of the nation's natural resources and public lands. The Division is responsible for the acquisition of real property by eminent domain for the fe deral government and for cases arising under the wildlife protection laws. In addition, ENRD litigates cases concerni ng Indian rights and claims. One of the Division's primary responsibilities is to enforce federal civil and criminal environ\u00ad mental laws such as the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Resource Con\u00ad servation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comp rehensive Environmental Response, Compensa\u00ad tion, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund), and the Safe Drinking Water Act. The main federal agencies that the Division represents in these areas are the U.S. Environmental Protec\u00ad 14 | introduction tion Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps or USACOE). The ENRD sections that carry out this work are the Environmental Crimes Section, the Environmental Enforcement Section, and the Environmental Defense Section. A substantial portion of the Divisi on's work includes litigation un der a plethora of statutes re\u00ad lated to the management of public lands and asso ciated natural and cultur al resources. All va\u00ad rieties of public lands are affected by ENRD's li tigation docket, ranging from entire ecosystems, such as the nation's most significant sub-trop ical wetlands (the Everglades) and the nation's largest rain forest (the Tongass), to individual rangelands or wildlife refuges. Examples of ENRD's land and natural resources litigation include original actions before the U.S. Supreme Court to address interstate boundary and water allocation issues; suits over management deci\u00ad sions affecting economic, recreational, and religi ous uses of the national parks, national for\u00ad ests, and other public lands; and actions to reco ver royalties and revenues from development of natural resources. The Division represents all the land management agencies of the United States including, for instance, the Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Corps, the Fish and Wild life Service (FWS), the Department of Trans\u00ad portation, and the Department of Defense. Th e Natural Resources Section is primarily respon\u00ad sible for these cases. The Division's Wildlife and Marine Resources Se ction handles civil cases arising under the fish and wildlife conservation laws, including suits defending agency actions under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which pro\u00ad tects endangered and threat\u00ad ened animals and plants; the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), which protects ani\u00admals such as whales, seals, and dolphins; and the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, which regulates increasingly depleted fishery resources. The Environ\u00ad mental Crimes Section also brings criminal prosecutions under these laws against, for example, people who are found smuggling wildlife and plants into the United States. The main federal agencies that ENRD represents in this area are FWS and the National Ma\u00ad rine Fisheries Service (NMFS). WHAT WE DO The Environment and Natural Re sources Division has primary responsibilities for litigation as well as policy work on behalf of the United States regarding: Prevention and Clean Up of Pollution Environmental Challenges to F ederal Programs and Activities Stewardship of Public Lands and Natural Resources Property Acquisition for Federal Needs Wildlife Protection Indian Rights and Claims With offices across the United States , the Division is the nation's environmental lawyer, and has the la rgest environmental law practice in the country. introduction | 15 Division cases frequently involve allegations that a federal progra m or action violates constitu\u00ad tional provisions or environmen tal statutes. Examples include regulatory takings cases, in which the plaintiff claims he or she has been deprived of property without just compensation by a federal program or activity, or suits alleging that a federal agency has failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by, for instance, failin g to issue an Environ\u00ad mental Impact Statement. Both takings and NEPA cases can affect vital federal programs such as those governing the nation's defense capabiliti es (including military preparedness exercises, weapons programs, and military research), renewable energy de velopment, and food supply. These cases also involve challenges to regulations promulgated to implement the nation's anti\u00ad pollution statutes, such as the CAA and the CWA, or activities at federal facilities that are claimed to violate such statutes. The Division's main clients in this area include the Depart\u00ad ment of Defense and EPA. The Natural Resour ces Section and the Environmental Defense Sec\u00ad tion handle these cases. Another portion of the Division's caseload consis ts of non-discretionary eminent domain litiga\u00ad tion. This important work, undertaken with cong ressional direction or authority, involves the acquisition of land for projects such as national parks or the construction of federal buildings including courthouses, and for national security -related purposes. The Land Acquisition Sec\u00ad tion is responsible for this litigation. The Division's Indian Resources Section litigates on behalf of federal agencies to protect the rights and resources of federally recognized Indian tribes and their members. This includes de\u00ad fending against challenges to statutes and agency action designed to protect tribal interests, and bringing suits on behalf of federal agencies to protect tribal rights and natural resources. The rights and resources at issue include water righ ts, the ability to acquire reservation land, and hunting and fishing rights, among others. The Natural Resources Section also defends claims asserted by Indian tribes against the United States on grounds that the United States has failed to live up to its obligations to the tribes. The main federal agency that the Division represents in connection with this work is the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior. The Appellate Section handles the initial appeals of all cases litigated by Division attorneys in the trial courts, and works closely with the Depart ment of Justice's Office of the Solicitor Gen\u00ad eral on ENRD cases that reach the U.S. Suprem e Court. Finally, the Law and Policy Section advises and assists the Assistant Attorney General on environmental legal and policy questions, particularly those that affect mu ltiple sections in the Division. It handles the Division's re\u00ad sponse to legislative proposals and congress ional comments on federal agency rulemakings, amicus partic ipation in cases of importance to the United States, as well as other special projects on behalf of Division leadership. Othe r Law and Policy Section duties include serving as the Division's ethics and prof essional responsibility officer and counselor, alternative dispute resolution counselor, and li aison with state and loca l governments. Attor\u00ad neys in the Law and Policy Section also coordina te the Division's involv ement in international legal matters, as well as the Division's Free dom of Information Act and Privacy Act work. 16 | introduction ENRD CLIENT AGENCIES To learn more about the client agencies refe renced in this report, visit their websites: United States Department of Agriculture United States Forest Service Animal and Plant Health Inspecti on Service United States Depa rtment of Commerce National Marine Fisheries Service National Oceanic an d Atmospheric Administ ration United States Depart ment of Defense United States Air Force United States Army United States Army Corps of Engineers United States Marine Corps United States Navy United States Department of Energy Environmental Protection Agency General Services Admini stration United States Department of Ho meland Security United States Customs and Bord er Protection Federal Emergency Manageme nt Agency United States Coast Guard United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs Bureau of Land Management Bureau of Ocean Energy Ma nagement Bureau of Reclamation Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement National Park Service Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement United States Fish and Wildlife Service United States Geologica l Survey United States Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration Federal Highway Administration Federal Transit AdministrationPipeline Safety and Hazardous Materi als Administration United States Maritime Administration United States Department of Veterans as an impo rtant public policy goal for the federal govern\u00ad ment in the Clinton Administration, when Execut ive Order 12898 was issued, is a top priority for this Administration.

Low-income, mi\u00ad nority, and Native Americans, like all Americans, should breathe clean air, drink clean water, and be free from exposure to hazardous waste and toxic substances. Indeed, the essence of en\u00ad vironmental justice is not special treatment, but equal treatment and full protection under the nation's environmental, civil rights, and health laws. 18 | environmental justice This chapter is divided into two sections. First, we de\u00ad scribe the Division's pro\u00ad gress in achieving environ\u00ad mental justice through col\u00ad laboration with other federal agencies and Department of Justice components. Work\u00ad ing primarily through the Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice (IWG), the Division has played a leadership role in ensuring that we are work\u00ading with other agencies to promote a coordinated fed\u00ad eral response to environmental justice issues. Second, we highlight the Division's internal ac\u00ad tions to further environmental justice thro ugh its own work and litigation docket. Collaborative Work with Other Federal Ag encies and Department Components in Fiscal Year 2011 Actively Participating in the IWG One of the cornerstone achievements of Executive Order 12898 was the creation of the IWG. Moribund for nearly a decade, the IWG has been reinvigorated during this Administration. The IWG is chaired by EPA and is charged with pr oviding guidance to federal agencies on envi\u00ad ronmental justice issues; coordinating the development of agency environmental justice strate\u00adgies; coordinating resear ch, data collection, and analysis; holding public meetings; and devel\u00ad oping interagency model projects on environmental justice. The creation of the IWG under\u00adscores the importance of working collaboratively within the federal government to address en\u00ad vironmental justice issues. Representatives from ENRD and the Department's Civil Rights Division regularly attend IWG senior staff level meetings and identify how th e Department can support and further the IWG's work. One example of the Division's extensive involvement in the IWG this year was the devel\u00ad opment and execution of a foundational inte ragency document on environmental justice, which is discussed below. Signing and Implementing an Interagency Memorandum on Environmental Justice In August 2011, the Department of Justice, al ong with 16 other federal agencies, signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Justice and Executive Order 12898 Attorney General Eric Holder wi th the Other Members of the Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice EPA Photo environmental justice | 19 \"To the greatest extent practicable and permit ted by law . . . each Federal agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minori ty populations and low-income populations in the United States and its territories and possessions, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands.\" Section 101, Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994, Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority Po pulations and Low-Income Populations (MOU). The MOU builds on the foundation laid by Executive Order 12898 and embodies the government's renewed commitment to environmental justice. The MOU promotes interagency collaboration and public access to information about agency work on environmental justice, and specifically requires each agency to publish an environmental justice strategy, to ensure that there exists an opportunity for public input on those strategies, and to produce annual im\u00adplementation progress re ports. The MOU also adopts a charter for the IWG and incorporates several new agencies into the IWG that had not pr eviously been active pa rticipants. The Divi\u00ad sion played an important leadership role in the conception and development of the MOU, which will provide a strong and lasting foundation for continued coordinated federal efforts to address environmental justice issues. The Department has taken steps to fulf ill its own obligati ons under the MOU. \u2014 In 1995, the Department produced the Department of Justice Environ- mental Justice Strategy and Environ- mental Justice Guidance Concerning Environmental Justice . These docu\u00ad ments were initially prepared to imple\u00ad ment the Department's commitments following the issuance of Executive Order 12898. The Department carefully re-evaluated the Strategy and Guidance in light of the MOU, and believes that both docu ments continue to fully reflect the goals and commitments of the Department of Justice. On September 30, 2011, we solicited comments on the Strategy and Guidance through the Department's environmental justice public website (www.just ice.gov/ej), as well as thro ugh EPA's IWG website and IWG conference calls with environmental justice advo cates and community leaders. Public input on these documents is always welcome. \u2014 In February 2012, the Department released the Department of Justice 2011 Implementa - tion Progress Report on Environmental Justice , its first annual report on the work and achievements of the Department in this area. ENRD contributed significantly to the accom\u00ad plishments reported in that document. The report is available on the Department's environ\u00ad mental justice website. 20 | environmental justice Launching the Department's Environmental Justice Public Website In September 2011, the Division helped develop and launch the Department's environmental justice public website, www.just ice.gov/ej. This site provides information about Department environmental justice policies, case resolutions that incorporate environmental justice consid\u00ad erations, and contact information for the public. The site also provides the public access to view and comment on the Department's Strategy and Guidance. Increasing Communication and Awareness Across Federal Agencies The Division also has been working directly with other federal agency partners to further the dialogue on and awareness of environmental justice issues. In fiscal year 2011, ENRD, along with EPA's Office of General Co unsel, organized a group of ca reer attorneys from agencies across the federal government to discuss legal is sues that arise with respect to environmental justice. The open dialogue and informal counseling fostered by this effort improves each agency's ability to understand not only how to implement environmental ju stice initiatives, but also how to respond to environmental justice conc erns within the parameters of existing law. Division attorneys also have assi sted in training staff of other federal agencies regarding envi\u00ad ronmental justice issues. This past year, we participated in training sessions for personnel from the Department of Energy and the Department of the Interior (DOI or Interior), for ex\u00ad ample. Working Within the Department to Heig hten Awareness and Increase Dialogue The Department has renewed its e fforts to consider environmental justice across its work. The Department's internal Environm ental Justice Workgroup, chaired by the Associate Attorney General's Office, has been reconstituted, and the Divi sion is an active participant in this group. This workgroup reviewed and reaffirmed the Department's Strategy and Guidance. All affected components of the Department are working to increase awareness of environ\u00ad mental justice and environmental enforcement issues among their staff. For example, in De\u00ad cember 2010, ENRD and the Civil Rights Division jointly hosted a Town Hall discussion of en\u00ad vironmental justice. This session, which was well -attended by attorneys and staff, provided an overview of environmental justice principles an d gave attorneys an opportunity to discuss how those principles apply to the varied work of the Department. Through the work of the Environmental Issues Subcommittee (chaired by U.S. Attorney Mike Cotter) of the Attorney General's Advisory Commi ttee, the Department also is actively working to increase awareness in U.S. Attorneys' Offi ces around the country regarding environmental justice issues. The Division has active ly participated in this subcommittee. Participating in Community and Other Outreach The IWG has organized numerous listening session s in communities around the United States. environmental justice | 21 These sessions provide community members; federal, state, tr ibal, and local governments; businesses; academics; and other interested part ies the opportunity to hear about federal ini\u00ad tiatives and speak directly to federal agency representatives about environmental issues that affect them. These meetings are often held in conjunction with other environmental and public health-related meetings to maximize the opport unities for reaching a broad spectrum of stake\u00ad holders. The Division has been an active participant in many of these IWG sessions. Division represen\u00ad tatives participated in sessions in New Orlean s, Louisiana; Brooklyn, New York; Richmond, California; and Washington, D.C. These sessions allow us to he ar first-hand from community members about how our work is affecting them and what we might do better. We gain valuable feedback from these sessions, and look forward to continuing our participation in more of them. In addition, the Department worked directly with federal agency partners, as well as state and local officials and community representatives, to organize direct outreach to many communi\u00ad ties. The Division attended many such sessions. For example: \u2014 In July 2011, Assistant Attorney General More no, ENRD and Civil Righ ts Division senior staff, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, EPA Assist ant Administrator Cynthia Giles, and other EPA officials toured sites in Newark, New Jersey, and met with environmental and community or\u00ad ganizations to discuss joint efforts to address environmental challenges and enforce environ\u00ad mental laws, and in particular, efforts to achieve environmental justice. \u2014 Also in July 2011, Assistant Attorney Genera l Moreno joined U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance, FBI Special Agent in Charge Pat\u00ad rick Maley, and EPA Regional Ad\u00administrator Gwen Keyes Fleming in Birmingham, Alabama, to listen to concerns from residents and community groups about the Black Warrior River basin and environ\u00admental justice issues. The listen\u00ad ing session was held in Ensley, a Birmingham neighborhood that borders Village Creek, a tributary of the Black Warrior River. The Black Warrior River provides drinking water for much of north\u00ad ern Alabama and was recently listed as one of America's Most Endangered Rivers.

Bar events. ENRD also conducted outreach to the corporat e community regarding environmental justice. Together with Cynthia Giles, EPA's Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Assistant Attorney Ge neral Moreno also met with representatives from the Business Network for Environmental Justice in October 20 11 to discuss opportunities for corporate en\u00ad gagement with communities. ENRD is currently working with EPA to plan additional meetings in order to foster a dialogue with the co rporate community on th ese important matters. Division-Specific Fiscal Year 2011 Environmental Justice Achievements Through its work, ENRD strives to ensure that all communities are protected from environ\u00ad mental harms, including the low-income, minori ty, and Native American communities that too frequently live in areas with particularly ac ute environmental problems . The Division works closely with U.S. Attorneys' Offices and in conc ert with other federal agencies to ensure that affected communities have a meaningful opportunity for involvement in environmental deci\u00ad sion making that affects them, including the co nsideration of appropriate remedies for viola\u00ad tions of the law. To this end, the Division ha s taken significant steps to better integrate envi\u00ad ronmental justice considerations into its work and that of its client agencies. Increasing Training and Awareness Within the Division ENRD has worked to increase awareness and un derstanding of environmental justice issues among its attorneys and staff. For example: \u2014 In 2010, ENRD formed an internal workgroup with representa tives from all litigating sec\u00ad tions to consider how to better incorporate environmental justice into the work of the Division. This group has provided training to attorneys throughout the Division, and coordinated with other Department components and federal agencies regarding environmental justice issues. The Division is in the process of implementing plans for additional training to help Division attorneys identify and address environmental justice issues that arise in their work. \u2014 Attorneys from ENRD's Environmental Crimes Section wrote and published an article enti\u00ad tled \"Environmental Justice in the Context of Environmental Crimes,\" in the July 2011 issue of the USA Bulletin , which is circulated throughout the De partment. The July issue was devoted entirely to the subject of environmental crimes. environmental justice | 23 Integrating Environmental Justice Principl es into ENRD Liti gation and Outcomes The Division has sought ways to integrate environmental justice pr inciples across its litigation components. Through its affirmative work to enforce the nation's landmark environmental laws--the CWA, CAA, Superfund, RCRA, and the Safe Drinking Water Act, amon g others--the Division is vigorously enforcing the law, and strong enforcement help s all communities. In\u00ad deed, Congress enacted these laws to protect all the American people from harmful pollution in their air, water, and land. In addition, ENRD has identified ways to address the needs of communities that have been dis\u00ad proportionately impacted by pollution. For ex ample, the Division is engaging with communi\u00ad ties directly affected by its enforcement litigation at an earlier stage. Talking to the community about a particular case allows Division attorn eys to hear the community's concerns and pro\u00ad vides an opportunity to see if those concerns can be addressed through the Division's enforce\u00ad ment action. This outreach can help develop facts, determine the scope and the degree of vio\u00ad lations, identify witnesses, and pinpoint harms. This also can give Divi sion attorneys the infor\u00ad mation needed to craft remedies that provide the most meaningful, immediate, and appropri\u00ad ate relief. The Division also is seeking creative solutions th at will have a positive and discernible outcome in affected communities. Information learned through the outreach process can help enable the Division to negotiate a case resolution that better serves the needs of the community, or where, if necessary, to demand an effective an d meaningful remedy from the court. For exam\u00ad ple, in reaching a settlement, community input ma y help the Division decide whether to look to traditional methods--like injunctive relief--or non-traditional methods--such as supplemental environmental projects (SEPs)--to achieve the desi red outcome. (A SEP is an environmentally beneficial project that a defendan t agrees to undertake in settlement of a civil penalty action that has a sufficient nexus to th e alleged violation(s), but that the defendant is not otherwise legally required to perform.) We are already seeing the benefits of these efforts pay off in our litigation results. Some exam\u00ad ples of cases concluded by the Environmental Enforcement Section in fiscal year 2011 that have furthered the principles or goals of environmental justice include: \u2014 As part of a comprehensive settlement under the CWA to address untreated sewage depos\u00ad ited into the Cleveland area waterways and Lake Erie, communities will benefit directly from construction projects and be able to participate publicly in infrastructure proposals. Under the settlement reached in United States v. Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer Dist., a case brought with the State of Ohio, the sewe r district (NEORSD) will spend $3 billion to install pollution controls, including seven tunnel systems. The di strict has arranged its construction schedule so that the first tunnels to be completed, the Euclid Creek and Dugway Storage Tunnels, will benefit underserved communities. The district also will spend at least $42 million on green infrastructure projects that will help address se wage overflows, a majority of which occur in the 24 | environmental justice City of Cleveland, where many minority and low-income resi\u00ad dents live. The district will be able to propose larger uses of green infrastructure in exchange for reductions in traditional in\u00adfrastructure projects. As a part of this process, NEORSD will collaborate with local commu\u00adnity groups, including those representing minority and low- income neighborhoods, in se\u00ad lecting the locations and types of green infrastructure projects to propose. (Examples of such projects include wetlands, troughs, cisterns, or other for\u00ad mations to store water, and rain gardens, urba n croplands, and permeable pavement to allow for greater infiltration of water into the ground.) \u2014 The homes of many economically disadvantaged residents of Jersey City will now be con\u00ad nected to the city's se wer system as a result of the consent decree in United States v. Jersey City Municipal Utilities Authority . The agreement requires the authority to pay a $375,000 penalty under the CWA and invest more than $52 million in repairs and upgrades to the com\u00ad bined sewer system; it also includes a SEP requ iring the authority to invest $550,000 in the replacement of illegal \"common sewers\" with di rect sewer connections and in the process en\u00ad sure better wastewater collection and disposal . Thus, the settlement will improve access to sewage removal for low-income communities and reduce the city's combined sewer overflow, which contains untreated human and industri al waste, toxic materials, and debris. \u2014 In United States v. Northern Indiana Public Service Co. (NIPSCO), NIPSCO agreed to spend approximately $600 million to install pollu tion control equipment at three of its four coal-fired power plants (it will shut down the fo urth plant), spend $9.5 million on mitigation projects, and pay $3.5 million in civil penalties under the CAA. These measures will reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by 18,000 tons and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by 46,000 tons. The decrease in harmful pollutants will benefit communities located near NIPSCO facili\u00ad ties, including communities disproportionately a ffected by environmental risks and vulnerable populations, such as children. ENRD's Environmental Crimes Section (ECS) has prosecuted cases that benefit environmental justice communities. For example, ECS and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Rhode Island prosecuted the case of United States v. Southern Union Co. , which involved the im- Lake Erie near Cleveland environmental justice | 25 proper storage of mercury at a Rhode Island fa cility. In September 2004, vandals broke into the mercury storage building and took several cont ainers of liquid mercury. Some of the con\u00ad tainers shattered, causing mercury to be spilled around the facility's grounds. The mercury was discovered in a vacant building in a neighbor hood frequented by vandals and homeless people and some 10 to 20 pounds were taken to the ne arby Lawn Terrace Apartments in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, home to many low-income, minori ty, and immigrant families. Fifty-five house\u00ad holds had to be evacuated for two months. On October 15, 2008, after a three-week jury trial, Southern Union Company was convicted of one RCRA storage violation. The company was sentenced in October 2009 to pay a $6 million fine and $12 million in payments to community initiatives. In a case handled by ENRD's Appellate Section, the First Circuit affirmed the con\u00adviction and sentence on December 22, 2010. (On November 28, 2011, the Supreme Court granted Southern Union's petition for a writ of certiorari on the issue of whether the sentence exceeded the district court's authority under the Supreme Court's ruling in Apprendi v. New Jersey .) More than half of ENRD's work consists of defending the environmental or natural resource actions of federal agencies. The Division is working to ensure that envi\u00ad ronmental justice principles are considered in our han\u00ad dling of these cases as well. Two examples of this aspect of ENRD's environmental jus\u00ad tice effort in fiscal year 2011 are described below: \u2014 ENRD's Wildlife and Ma\u00ad rine Resources Section (WMRS) helped defend a FWS action that protected tribal cultural in terests. Fish and Wildlife Service had is\u00adsued a biological opinion un\u00ad der the ESA governing Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) operation of the Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona to minimize effects on the ESA-listed humpback chub. One conser\u00ad 26 | environmental justice Glen Canyon Dam Pam Sponholtz/USFWS Photo vation measure in the biological opinion called for the implementation of measures to elimi\u00ad nate non-native fish species that predate and compete with the chub. Subsequently, the Zuni Tribe notified Reclamation that it strongly objected to killing fish within their culturally sacred areas of the Colorado River. Once notified , WMRS attorneys worked with FWS and Reclama\u00ad tion to develop a defensible plan for deferring the scheduled non-native fish removal trips in response to the concerns expressed by the Zuni Tribe. When that plan was implemented, an environmental group filed a motion for an injunc tion seeking to compel Reclamation to under\u00ad take the non-native control measures. We succ amation's decision, re\u00ad sulting in the court's denying the motion. The court also noted that Reclamation was acting reasonably to balance the need to ameliorate th e threat posed by non-native fish, while being mindful of tribal concerns. Humpback Chub USFWS Image \u2014 The Division's Natural Resources Section su ccessfully resolved, through settlement, Cone- jos County Clean Water, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Energy . Here, plaintiffs challenged the Depart\u00ad ment of Energy's (DOE) use of a truck-to-train transfer facility near Antonito, Colorado, to transfer environmental waste from flat-bed trucks to rail cars for shipment to Utah. The trans\u00ad fer facility is located on the edge of Antonito , a small community in Co nejos County, a majority Hispanic (60%) farming and ranching community with a median household income of $27,744 --less than half the national av erage. The community had no notice of DOE's plan to use the transfer facility until the first truckloads of waste arrived. Under the settlement, DOE agreed not to utilize the Antonito transfer facility fo r the shipment of environmental waste materials unless and until it completes an environmental an alysis under NEPA. In addition, DOE agreed not to rely on a categorical exclusion to satisf y NEPA and to provide public notice and opportu\u00ad nity to comment. environmental justice | 27 Investigating the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico and Initiating Civil Affirmative Litigation On April 20, 2010, explosion and fire destroyed the Deepwater Horizon offs hore drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico and triggere d a massive oil spill amounting to millions of barrels of dis\u00ad charge that took approximately three months to contain. Immediately, ENRD and the Depart\u00ad ment's Civil Division--along with local U.S. Attorneys' Offices, the Gulf States, and client agen\u00ad cies--launched a civil investigat ion into the matter. In December 2010, as part of a multi- district litigation in the Easter n District of Louisiana, the Unit ed States brought suit against BP, Anadarko, MOEX, and Transocean for civil penalties under the CWA and a declaration of liability under the Oil Pollution Act. On February 17, 2012, the Department announced an agreement with MOEX to settle it s liability in the Deepwater Horizo n oil spill. According to the terms of the settlement, MOEX will pay $70 mill ion in civil penalties to resolve alleged viola\u00ad tions of the CWA--the largest to date under th e CWA--and will spend $20 million to facilitate land acquisition projects in several Gulf States that will preserve and protect in perpetuity habitat and resources important to water quality. Of the $70 million in civil penalties, $25 mil\u00ad lion will go to the States of Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Texas. Since filing, ENRD, in concert with the Civil Di vision, has taken or defended over 250 deposi\u00ad tions, produced some 50 million pages in discov ery, and continued preparation for the first of what is scheduled to be several phases of trial. The United States intends to prove that viola\u00ad tions of federal safety and operat ional regulations caused or contri buted to the oil spill and that the named defendants (not includ ing insurers) are jointly and severally liable, without limita\u00ad tion, under the Oil Pollution Act for government removal costs, economic losses, and damage to natural resources due to the oi l spill. The United States seeks civil penalties under the CWA, which prohibits the unauthorized discharge of oil into the nation's waters . We allege that the defendants named in this lawsuit were in violat ion of the act throughout the months that oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico. 28 | protecting air, land, and water Obtaining Company-Wide Relief for Violations Company-wide case sett lements benefit everyone. The government benefits through expedited resolution of historic and ongoing violations on an efficient scale. Industry benefits because it gains the certainty of knowing that it is not in vi olation, avoids the cost and risk of additional litigation, and can obtain a negotiated settlement of important technological upgrades on an efficient scale. Communities located near a rang e of facilities benefit from pollutant reduction and, where appropriate, environmentally beneficial projects. During fiscal year 2011, the Division \"T his agreement is the result of extensive cooperation obtained an impor\u00adbetween the States of Texas and Oklahoma and the federal tant company-wide government to address multiple settlement in United States v. Mahard Egg Farm, Inc. There, a consent de\u00ad cree resolved claims that the company failed to comply with the CWA at its egg production facilities in Texas and Okla\u00ad homa. Mahard paid a $1.9 million civil penalty, the largest ever to be paid in a federal enforcement action involving a concentrated ani- mal feeding operation, and wi ll spend approximately $3.5 million on measures to bring each of the company's seven facilities into compliance with the law and protect public health and the environment. Most egg production facili- ties generate various wastes, including wet or dry manure violations of the Clean Water Act at Mahard facilities. Ensuring the lawful handling of CAFO wastes will mean cleaner steams and waterways in Texas and Oklahoma, which is important for aquatic habitats, safe drinking water, and public recreation.\" \u2014 Ignacia S. Moreno United States v. Mahard Egg Farm, Inc. Press Release Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations Collage EPA Image Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations Concentrated animal feeding operations are lives tock and poultry animal feeding operations that meet the regulatory thresholds of number of animals for various animal types. Animals are kept and raised in confined situations for a total of 45 days or more in any 12-month period, and feed is brought to the animals rather than the animals grazing or otherwise feeding in pastures, fields, or on rangeland. These operations generate significant volumes of animal waste which, if improperly managed, can result in environmental and human health risks such as water quality impairment, fish kills, algal blooms, contamination of drinking water sources, and transmission of disease-causing bacteria and parasites associated with food and waterborne diseases. \u2014EPA Fact Sheet from chicken houses and compost from chicken carcasses.

Reducing Air Pollution from Power Plants The Environment and Natural Resources Division has continued to litigate civil Twenty-one settlement s with operators of claims under the CAA against operators of coal-fired electric power generating plants coal-fired electric power generating plants. as of September 30, 2011, will result in Violations in these cases arise from compa- reductions of over 2 million tons of nies engaging in major life-extension pro- sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, once jects on aging facilities without installing the more than $12 billion in required pollution controls are fully functioning.required state-of-the-art pollution con\u00ad trols, resulting in excess air pollution that has degraded forests, damaged waterways, contam inated reservoirs, and adversely affected the health of the elderly, the young, and asthma sufferers. Through fiscal year 2011, 21 of these matters settled on terms that will result in re ductions of over 2 million tons of SO2 and NOx each year, once the more than $12 billion in re quired pollution controls are fully functioning. Last year, the Division obtained three mo re settlements under this initiative in United States v. Northern Indiana Public Service Co. ( NIPSCO); United States v. Hoosier Energy Rural Elec - tric Cooperative (Hoosier) ; and United States v. American Municipal Power, Inc. (AMP). Un\u00ad der the NIPSCO consent decree, the company will instal l approximately $600 million worth of air pollution controls at three of its coal-fired power plants located in Chesterton, Michigan City, and Wheatfield, Indiana, and permanently reti re a fourth facility in Gary, Indiana. Under the Hoosier consent decree, the cooperative will spend between $250 and $300 million up\u00ad grading and installing pollution controls at it s two plants, the Meron and Ratts Stations, both located in southwest Indiana. The AMP consent decree requires the Ohio utility to perma\u00ad nently retire its Richard H. Gorsuch Station near Marietta. When fully implemented, air pollu\u00ad tion controls and other measures will collective ly reduce air pollution by more than 123,000 tons every year compared with pre-settlement emissions. NIPSCO, Hoosier, and AMP, respec\u00ad tively, also paid civil penalties under the CAA of $3.5 million, $950,000, and $850,000, and will spend $9.5 million, $5 million, and $15 millio n on projects to mitigate the adverse effects of past excess emissions. Addressing Air Pollution from Oil Refineries The Division also made progress in its national initiative to co mbat CAA violations within the petroleum refining industry. Three additional se ttlements were obtained under this initiative during fiscal year 2011. In United States v. Western Refining Co. , the court entered a consent decree that requires the company to make $60 mi llion worth of capital improvements at its re\u00ad 30 | protecting air, land, and water finery in El Paso, Texas, which, when fully oper ational, will reduce annu al air emissions of NOx and SO2 by 509 tons per year and 389 tons per year, respectively. West ern also paid a civil penalty of $1.45 million. A consent decree entered by the court in United States v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc. , a case handled in close coordination with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Wisconsin, requires that refiner to spend more than $142 million to install new and upgraded pollution control reduction equipment at its two petroleu m refineries in Superior, Wisconsin, and Mer- aux, Louisiana. Once the controls are installe d, annual emissions of NOx and SO2 will be re\u00ad duced by more than 1,400 tons per year from thes e facilities. Murphy also paid a civil penalty of $1.25 million and agreed to spend $1.5 million on SEPs, including ones to address the con\u00ad cerns of citizens living near the Meraux refine ry, where the refiner will install and operate an ambient air monitoring station and implement noise abatement and dust control measures. The consent decree replaces a 2002 consent decr ee that addressed violations at the Superior refinery. In a settlement with the owner of the nation's second largest refinery, the court en\u00ad tered a consent decree in United States v. HOVENSA, L.L.C. , under which HOVENSA will spend more than $700 million to install pollution control equipment at its refinery in St. Croix, Virgin Islands. HOVENSA also pa id civil penalties of $5.375 million, and agreed to provide an additional $4.875 million for proj ects to benefit the environment of the Virgin Islands. With these settlements, the Division's petroleum refinery enforcement initiative has produced settle\u00ad ments or other court orders that have addressed more than 90% of the nation's refining capac\u00ad ity, and will reduce air pollutants by more than 360,000 tons a year. View of HOVENSA Refinery in St. Croix, Virg in Islands Photo Courtesy of Jason P. Heym Ensuring the Integrity of Municipal Wastewater Treatment Systems The Division has made it a priority to bring ca ses nationwide to improve municipal wastewater and stormwater treatment and collection. From January 2009 through September 2011, courts entered 29 settlements in these cases, requiring long-term control measures and other relief estimated to cost violators more than $13.5 billion. These cases involve one of the most pressing infrastructure issues in the nation's cities-\u00ad discharges of untreated sewage from aging coll ection systems. Low-income and minority com\u00ad munities often live in older urban areas. Raw sewage contains pathogens that threaten public health and may cause beach closures as well as the issuance of public advisories against con\u00ad protecting air, land, and water | 31 sumption of fish. Clean Water Act enforcement al so protects national water treasures like the Chesapeake Bay. Ala Wai Canal, Honolulu, Hawaii Photo Courtesy of Daryl MitchellTen consent decrees with munici\u00ad palities or regional sewer districts were entered in fiscal year 2011. Collectively, they provide for the expenditure of more than $7.6 billion in improvements, the pay\u00ad ment of $4.8 million in civil pen\u00adalties, and the performance of SEPs valued at more than $10 mil\u00ad lion. A few examples are the fol\u00ad lowing cases: \u2014 United S tates v. City and County of Honolulu resolved claims of violations of the CWA and the State of Hawaii's water pollution law, such as the 2006 Beachwalk force main break that spilled approximately 50 million gallons of raw sewage into the Ala Wai Canal. Under the terms of the consent decree, the city agreed to make extensive improvements to its aging wastewater collection and treatmen t systems, at an estimated cost of $3.7 billion over 25 years, to eliminate unauthorized overflow s of untreated raw sewage. The city also paid a $1.6 million civil penalty, split evenly between the federal government and the State of Hawaii, which worked closely with us in this case. \u2014 In United States v. Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD), also discussed in the Environmental Justice chapter, the district agreed to address the flow of untreated sewage into Cleveland area waterways and Lake Erie and take measures to capture and treat more than 98% of wet weather flows entering the district's combined sewer system, which serves the City of Cleveland and 59 adjoining communities. The settlement requires the district to spend ap\u00ad proximately $3 billion to install pollution contro ls, including the construction of seven tunnel systems that will reduce the disc harge of untreated raw sewage. The consent decree also sig\u00ad nificantly advances the use of large-scale green infrastructure projects by requiring NEORSD to invest at least $42 million in such projects. NEORSD also paid a $1.2 mill ion civil penalty, split evenly between the United States and the State of Ohio. \u2014 A district court entered a consent decree in United States v. City of Evansville (Indiana) under which the city agreed to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to increase the capacity of its sewer system to minimize, and in many cases eliminate, longstanding sewage overflows into the Ohio River.

Costs may exceed $500 million over approxi\u00ad 32 | protecting air, land, and water mately 25 years. The city also paid civil pe nalties totaling $490,000 and agreed to implement an environmental project that will connect homes wi th failing septic systems to the city's sewer system at a cost of mo re than $4 million. \u2014 Consent decrees entered in United States v. City of Lexi ngton-Fayette Urban County Gov- ernment , United States v. Jersey City Municipal Utilities Authority , and United States v. City of Revere (Massachusetts) require those municipali ties to spend $290 million, $52 million, and $50 million, respectively, to make improvem ents to their wastewater collection systems to eliminate unauthorized discharges of sewage into local waterways. Protecting the Nation's Waters and Wetlands Keeping contaminated stormwater out of America's waters is one of EPA's national enforcement initiatives. Construction projects have a high potential for environmental harm because they disturb large areas of land and significantly increa se the potential for erosion. Last year, courts entered consent decrees with two residential home builders to resolve claims of CWA violations in connection with their construction projects, the fifth and sixth consent decrees with residen\u00ad tial homebuilders under this initiative. In United States v. Beazer Homes USA, Inc. , the na\u00ad tional homebuilder paid a civil penalty of $925,000 to resolve alleged CWA violations at its con\u00adstruction sites in 21 states and agreed to im plement a company-wide program to improve com\u00ad pliance with stormwater runoff requirements at current and future construction sites around the country. In United States v. Eastwood Constr., L.L.C. , two related homebuilders that oper\u00ad ate in North and South Carolina, paid a $60,000 ci vil penalty to resolve allegations of their non\u00ad compliance with CWA stormwater requirements at three development projects. The companies also agreed to take additional measures to facilitate their compliance with the CWA. In United States v. Johnson , defendant cranberry farmers had dumped unauthorized fill material in approximately 45 acres of wetlands and streams at two locations in Carver, Massachusetts, in connection with the constructi on of cranberry bogs. When the Division brought an enforcement action against them, they dis\u00adputed whether the bogs were waters within federal regulatory jurisdiction. In April 2011, ENRD, in conjunction with the United States Attorney's Office in Massachusetts, tried that issue before a jury. Following the trial, the jury returned a quick verdict in favor of the United States. The Division negotiated a high ly favorable consent decree in United States v. Century Homebuilders, L.L.C. , an enforcement action in connection with violation of a permit governing discharges into wet\u00ad lands adjacent to the Snapper Creek Extension Canal in Doral, Florida. In December 2010, the court entered a consent decree that required defe ndants to pay a $400,000 civil penalty and to pre\u00ad serve and maintain a mitigation parcel in perpetuity. Cranberry Bog Site Carver, MA protecting air, land, and water | 33 Reducing Air and Water Polluti on at Other Diverse Facilities In fiscal year 2011, the Division improved the nation's air quality by concluding a number of civil enforcement actions against industrial faci lities. Under the consent decree entered in United States v. BP Prod ucts North America, Inc., BP paid a $15 million civil penalty to resolve claims that it violated the CAA's chemical acci dent prevention regulati ons, also known as the risk management program regulations, at its Te xas City, Texas, petroleum refinery. The pen\u00ad alty is the largest ever assessed for civil violations of the chemical accident prevention regula\u00ad tions and the largest civil penalty recovered for C AA violations at an individual facility. The consent decree resolved claims stemming from two fires, one that killed 15 people and injured more than 170 others, and a leak at the refinery that occurred in 2004 and 2005. During the three incidents, which each resulted in the su rrounding Texas City community being ordered to shelter-in-place, thousands of po unds of flammable and toxic air pollutants were released. The CAA's risk management program regulations contain a comprehensive set of requirements to prevent such accidental releases of hazardous ai r pollutants. Previous civil, criminal, and ad\u00ad ministrative proceedings resolved other claims in connection with the three incidents and BP's operation of the refinery. According to the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigat ion Board, the cause of the March 23, 2005 incident at the BP Texas City, Texas, petroleum refinery was the flooding of a distillation tower with flammable hydrocarbons that erupted through a blowdown stack. Backfire from an idling pickup truck quickly ignited the vapor cloud. U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board Incident Diagram 34 | protecting air, land, and water In fiscal year 2011, the Division secured agreements with industri al defendants under the Clean Air Act to spend an estimated $1.8 billion on corrective measures to reduce harmful air emissions, to pay $47 million in civil penalties, and to perform $8.6 million in mitigation projects to offset the harm caused by their unlawful emissions. In fiscal year 2011, the Division settled cases with industrial defendants under the Clean Water Act valued at more than $224 million in injunctive relief and $13.6 million in civil penalties.The court entered a consent decree with three gasoline distributors in United States v. Rocky Mountain Pipeline Systems, L.L.C. , which re\u00ad solved claims that they illegally mixed and dis\u00ad tributed more than one million gallons of gaso\u00ad line that did not meet CAA emissions and fuel quality requirements. Use of gasoline that does not meet the CAA's standards for fuel can result in increased emissions from tailpipes, affect vehicle performance, and in some cases damage engines and emissions controls. Under the consent decree, the companies paid a $2.5 mil\u00ad lion civil penalty and agreed to conduct an envi\u00ad ronmental project designed to offset the harm that was caused by their failure to meet the fed\u00ad eral gasoline quality requirements. Courts entered consent decrees in three cases resolving alleged violations of the National Emis\u00adsion Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) applicable to the defendants' indus\u00ad tries. In each case, the defendant failed to control the emission of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) as required by the CAA and implementing regulations. HAPs, also known as air toxics, are pollutants which are known or are suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects such as birth defects or reproductive effects in humans. Each defendant paid a civil penalty and agreed to take measures to control the unlawf ul emissions. \u2014 In Unite d States v. Jeld-Wen, Inc. , a manufacturer of composite wood products paid a civil penalty of $850,000 to resolve claims that it violated the NESHAPs applicable to the Plywood and Wood Products Industry at facilities in Washington, Iowa, North Carolina, and West Vir\u00ad ginia. \u2014 In United States v. Logan Aluminum, Inc., a manufacturer of aluminum coils, which are used in the beverage industry, paid a civil penalty of $285,000 to resolve claims that it violated the NESHAPs for Secondary Aluminum Production at its facility in Russellville, Kentucky. \u2014 In United States v. Gasco Energy Co. , defendant oil and gas company paid a $350,000 civil penalty to resolve claims that it violated th e NESHAPs applicable to Oil and Natural Gas Pro\u00ad duction Facilities at its Riverbend compressor st ation located on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. Two cons ent decrees furthered efforts to ensure compliance with the CAA's vehicle emissions standards, labeling, and reporting requirements. Under the consent decree entered in United States v. Caterpillar, Inc. , the company paid a $2.55 million ci vil penalty to settle alleged CAA violations for shipping over 590,000 highway and non-road engines without the correct emis\u00ad protecting air, land, and water | 35 sions controls and for failing to comply with emissions control report ing and engine-labeling requirements. Engines operating without proper emissions controls can emit excess NOx, particulate matter, and other pollutants that im pact public health, potentially causing respira\u00ad tory illnesses and aggravating asthma.

Caterpillar, Inc. without the correct ATDs and with improperly Press Release configured fuel injector and map settings. In some cases, the misconfigured engines were incorp orated into vehicles, wh ich resulted in excess emissions of NOx and particulate matter into the environment. Under the consent decree in United States v. Powertrain, Inc. , defendants paid a $2 million civil penalty to resolve claims that they unlawf ully imported and sold engines that were not covered by EPA certificates of conformity, lack ed legally sufficient emissions-control labels, and lacked sufficient emissions-re lated warranties; and failed to maintain required records. Defendants also agreed to export or destroy non-compliant engines in their inventory, imple\u00ad ment a Corporate Compliance Plan, and mitigate past excess emissions with one or more emis\u00ad sions offset programs. The Division also improved the nation's water qual\u00ad ity by concluding a number of civil enforcement actions against industrial facilities. Among the in\u00ad dustries agreeing to settle their noncompliance with the CWA are a coal company, a beef processor, and a mining and phosphorous processing com\u00ad pany: \u2014 The largest producer of coal from underground mines in the United States paid a $5.5 million civil penalty to settle CWA claims at six of its mines in West Virginia under a consent decree entered in United States v. Consol Energy, Inc. In addition to the penalty, Consol will spend an additional esti\u00ad mated $200 million to implement pollution con\u00ad trols that will reduce disc harges of harmful mining wastewater into Appalachian streams and rivers.

Swift Beef Co. , the company paid $1.3 million to the United States and the State of Nebraska to resolve alleged violations of the CWA at its Grand Island, Nebraska, beef proc\u00ad essing plant. Swift spent approximately $1 million implementing measures at its plant to reduce pollutants in its wastewater and prevent future upse ts at the city's publicly owned treatment works. \u2014 Under the terms of the consent decree entered in United States v. P4 Production, L.L.C. , the defendant, a mining and phosphorous proc essing company wholly-owned by Monsanto, paid a $1.4 million penalty to resolve claims th at it violated the CWA by discharging wastewa\u00ad ter containing high concentrations of selenium and heavy metals from a waste rock dump at its South Rasmussen Mine in southeast Idaho without a required permit. Ensuring the Safe Treatment, Storage, and Disposal of Waste According to EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, mi ning and mineral processing generate more hazardous and toxic waste than any other industrial sector. If not properly managed, these fa\u00ad cilities pose a high risk to human health and the environment. In fiscal year 2011, the Division concluded its second settlement under EPA's Na tional Enforcement Priority for Mining and Mineral Processing in United States v. Air Products, L.P. The consent decree resolves the com\u00ad pany's hazardous waste misman\u00ad agement violations under RCRA at its Pasadena, Texas, chemical manufacturing facility. Air Prod\u00ad ucts, while not itself a mineral proc\u00ad essor, sent large volumes of spent sulfuric acid waste for many years to Agrifos Fertilizer Co., a mineral processor that was not authorized to receive it. Some of the spent acid waste was contained in a release of 50 million gallons of acidic hazard\u00ad ous wastewater into the Houston Ship Channel from Agrifos' Hous\u00ad ton phosphoric acid facility. Under the consent decree, Air Products paid a $1.485 million civil penalty and agreed to manage the spent acid on-sit e so as not to generate a hazardous waste. It completed construction of a $60 mi llion sulfuric acid regeneration plant that will stop the acid waste stream altogether, grea tly reducing risks to human health and the environment. \"T his settlement eliminates the disposal of spent acid waste from the Air Products facility into the environment. By stopping this source of pollution, this settlement will reduce risks to human health and the environment.\" \u2014Ignacia S. Moreno United States v. Air Prod ucts, L.P.

Ausimont Industries, Inc. , the settling defen\u00ad dants agreed to perform a $30 million response ac tion, to reimburse EPA $4 .5 million in oversight costs, and to pay $1.65 million for NRD at the Su tton Brook Superfund Site in Tewksbury, Massachu\u00ad setts. \u2014 In United States v. Manzo , three defendants agreed to pay the United States $4 million, based on their limited ability to pay, toward its cleanup costs at the Burnt Fly Bog Superfund Site in Marlboro County, New Jersey, and to do nate a conservation easement of 41 acres of land to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in order to settle New Jersey's claim for NRD. Additionally, thre e separate groups of insurers paid the United States a total of $15.025 million in reimbursement of clea nup costs it incurred at the site. \u2014 In December 2010, the court entered two consent decrees in United States v.

Togeth er, the United States will recover a total of 38 | ensuring cleanup of oil and superfund waste Double Eagle Superfund Site EPA PhotoDouble Eagle Superfund Site The Double Eagle Superfund Site extends over approx imately 12 acres in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and is bounded to the north by the Union Pacific Railroad tracks. Although industrial areas surround the sites, the land use within a one-mi le radius of both sites is mixed industrial and residential. A small neighborhood is located about one-quarter mile to the northwest. Four schools and two recreational facilities are located wi thin a one-mile radius of the sites. The Double Eagle site collected, stored, and re-refined used oils and distributed the recycled product. The refinery was active as early as 1929, and Double Eagle continued to accept waste oil for storage in on-site storage tanks until 1980. The Double Eagle site recycled approximately 500,000 to 600,000 gallons of used motor oil per month into finished lubricating oil. This process generated approximately 80,000 gallons of oily sludge per month. Sludges were initially sent to an off-site disposal facility. Later, sludges we re disposed of in on-site impoundments and a sludge lagoon until the late 1960s to early 1970s. The Double Eagle site was found to be contaminated with metals ( particularly lead) and organic contaminants in the soil and ground water. It also contained acidic sludges found in on-site lagoons or pits. \u2014EPA Fact Sheet ensuring cleanup of oil and superfund waste | 39 Tactical Fighter Squadron over Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina, in September 1971 U.S. Air Force Photo $19,759,870 in past response costs, the State of Oklahoma will recover $1,005,315 in past response costs, and the Joint State and Federa l Trustees will recover $774,416 in NRD. \u2014 In August 2011, two consent decrees were entered in a different United States v. Union Pa- cific Railroad case, a CERCLA cost recovery case invo lving lead contamination in the residen\u00ad tial yards of the Omaha Lead Superfund Site in Nebraska. Under the first decree, Union Pacific paid almost $22 million in cost recovery and $100,000 in NRD, and agreed to perform addi\u00ad tional response work valued at $3.15 million to se ttle its liability. Unde r the second decree, an\u00ad other settling party, Gould Electronics, paid $1.15 million in response costs. Protecting the Public Fisc Against Excessive or Unwarranted Claims The Division also defends federa l agencies that are sued for their activities at contaminated sites being remediated. In United States v. Washington State Dep't of Transp. , the state brought contribution counterclaims against the Corps in connection with the cost of cleaning up the Thea Foss and Wheeler Osgood Waterways in the Commencement Bay-Nearshore Tide- flats Superfund Site in Tacoma, Washington. Following trial, the court chose to allocate none of the response costs to the Co rps, holding that the Corps did not introduce any hazardous sub\u00ad stances and, on balance, the Corps' dredging of hazardous substances was environmentally beneficial because it removed hazardous substanc es from the waterway. Accordingly, the court held that the Corps' equitable share of the $9.3 million in response costs was zero, and dismissed the state's counter\u00ad claim. In AVX Corp. v. United States , plaintiff sought to recover up to $3 million from the United States for cleaning up tri\u00adchloroethylene in the groundwater un\u00ad derlying undeveloped property in Myr\u00ad tle Beach, South Carolina. The com\u00ad pany alleged that a significant portion of the contamination was attributable to facilities on the now-closed Myrtle Beach Air Force Base. Following a trial in March 2011, the court entered judgment in favor of the United States. The court found that the United States was not liable under CERCLA and allocated 100% re sponsibility to AVX. The Division settles claims seek ing to impose liability for clea nup on federal agencies where a fair apportionment of costs can be reached. In fiscal year 2011, these included such multimil\u00ad lion dollar settlements as United States v. Newmont Mining USA, Ltd. (regarding costs of cleanup of the Midnite Mine, an inactive, open -pit uranium mine loca ted within the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington State); General Electric v. Dep't of the Interior (response 40 | ensuring cleanup of oil and superfund waste costs that plaintiffs are incurring cleaning up hazardous substances at the Northeast Church Rock Mine Superfund Site, a former ur anium mine near Gallup, New Mexico); MeadWestvaco, Inc. v.

(relating to costs of removal of unex ploded ordnance at the former Conway Bombing and Gunnery Range near Conway, South Carolina); United States v. Boeing Co. (resolving claims by and against the United States for response costs incurred or to be incurred to clean up environmental contamination at the Moses Lake Wellfield Superfund Site, near the City of Moses Lake, Washington); and Westinghouse v. United States (response costs incurred or to be incurred by Westinghouse at a former nuclear fuel developmen t and processing plant in Hematite, Missouri). From the beginning of fiscal year 2009 through the end of fiscal year 2011, ENRD has obtained agreements in 25 bankruptcy proceedings , under which debtors committed to spend an estimated $1.46 billion to clean up hazardous waste sites, reimburse the Superfund $663 million , and pay more than $77 million in natural resource damages. Over that same time period, the United States also recovered an additional $237 million for the Superfund as a result of payment of claims settled in earlier years. Enforcing Cleanup Obligations in Bankruptcy Cases The Division files claims to pr otect environmental obligations owed to the United States when a responsible party goes into ba nkruptcy. In fiscal year 2011, ENRD secured significant com\u00ad mitments of responsible parties to clean up hazardous waste si tes, reimburse the Superfund, and pay damages for injuries to natural resources, in the cont ext of several bank\u00ad ruptcy proceedings. In the In re Motors Liquidation Co. (formerly General Motors) bankruptcy, the Division, working closely with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, obtained settle\u00ad ments in which (i) the debtor provided over $639 million in funding for an envi\u00adronmental response trust for cleanup and administrative costs at 89 proper\u00ad\"T he [General Motors] agreement marks a new beginning by responsibly addressing hazardous waste contamination in impacted communities, and at the same time creates jobs to help clean up and return these sites to beneficial uses.

GM Bankruptcy Proceedings From 1908 through 2009, General Motors Corporation was an auto manufacturer based in Detroit, Michigan. On June 1, 2009, General Motors Corporation and se veral wholly owned subsidiaries filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the Un ited States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. On July 5, 2009, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of most of the company's assets to NGMCO, Inc., which later became known as General Motors Company (\"New GM\"). The original company retained certain real property from the sale . After the sale of a ssets to the new company, the original company was renamed Motors Liquidati on Corporation, which is the holding company remaining to settle past liabilities of the original General Motors Corporation. In 2009 and 2010, the Department of Justice filed proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding on behalf of EPA, the Department of the Interior, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, seeking to obtain past and future response costs and Natural Resource Damages under Superfund and reimbursement for certain li abilities under the Resour ce Conservation and Recovery Act related to specified properties owned by the original company. On March 3, 2011, the bankruptcy court approved an initial October 20, 2010 settlement and environmental response trust, along with six additio nal settlement agreements. The parties to the settlement agreements were the Unit ed States, fourteen states (Delaw are, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Je rsey, New York, Ohio, P ennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin), and the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe as well as Motors Liquidati on Corporation and several subsidiaries. The environmental response trust is the largest and mo st inclusive in the Un ited States. More than half of the cleanup funds to be paid to the environmental response trust will be provided for the environmental remediation of si tes in New York and Michigan. 42 | ensuring cleanup of oil and superfund waste Pursuant to a settlement in the In re Tronox, Inc. bankruptcy, the debtor paid $270 million in cash and will cause to be paid 88% of future pr oceeds from a fraudulent conveyance action to environmental response trusts and federal and state agencies that will fund the cleanup of con\u00ad taminated sites in 22 states. The settlement creates 5 environmental response trusts for con\u00ad taminated properties in 14 states and 1,800 po tentially contaminated former service station properties around the country, and provides them over $202 million in cash funding and a share of the fraudulent conveyance action proceeds. The United States has intervened in the pending fraudulent conveyance proc eeding, and trial is set for 2012. The court in the In re Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. bankruptcy proceeding approved a set\u00ad tlement agreement under which the debtor distri buted stock on account of allowed bankruptcy claims resolving federal environm ental claims at six contaminated sites. Upon liquidating the stock, the United States received more than $14.7 million in CERCLA cost recovery and more than $3.5 million in NRD. In the In re Caribbean Petroleum bankruptcy proceeding, the court approved a settlement agreement under which debtors paid more than $8.2 million to address environmental liabili\u00ad ties relating to their former petroleum distributi on facility in Bayam\u00f3n, Puerto Rico, and more than 170 service stations they formerly owned or leased throughout Puerto Rico, and allowed general unsecured claims in excess of $18 milli on for pre-bankruptcy cleanup costs and penal\u00ad ties. The court also entered a stipulation and order under which the debtors paid $850,000 to address contamination at service stations they still own. ensuring cleanup of oil and superfund waste | 43 Wildlife Covered by ESA Section 4 Deadline Litigation USFWS Photos Achieving Landmark Settlements for the Endangered Species Listing Program Protections for the nation's most imperiled specie s are triggered when a species has been listed under section 4 of the ESA. The ESA permits citize ns to petition the responsible agency to list a species as endangered or threatened. For some time, however, the number of statutory obli\u00ad gations for addressing petitions for listing filed by citizens has far outstripped the appropria\u00adtions provided by Congress to FWS's program for listing species under the ESA. The result has been roughly two decades of lawsuits and court orders directing the FWS to take actions, leav\u00ading FWS with no control over its own program. The situation reached a peak when, from 2007 to 2010, FWS was flooded with ESA listing petiti ons filed principally by two organizations to add hundreds of new species to the list of endangered and threatened species. When the agency was unable to make timely findings on these petitions due to budget and resource con\u00ad straints, it was sued by the 2 organizations in ov er 20 different lawsuits filed in 7 different dis\u00ad trict courts. Subsequently, all of these suits were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia as the In re: ESA Section 4 Deadline Litigation . After nine months of me\u00ad diation, the Division successfully negotiated two watershed settlement agreements that aim to reform the FWS's litigation-plagued ESA sectio n 4 listing program. Under the settlement agreements, the Service will make overdue listing petition findings for more than 600 species by the end of fiscal year 2012 and complete proposed rule determinations for 251 others by the end of fiscal year 2016. The agreement is likely to result in the listing of many new species for which protective action had languished due to the diversion of resources to litigation. Defending the Polar Bear Listing Decision In May 2008, by regulation, FWS listed the polar bear as a threatened species un\u00ad der the ESA, based on the loss of its sea ice habitat due to Arctic warming caused by man-made climate change. By fall 2008, 10 suits challenging the listing had been filed by environmental groups, oil and gas industry representatives, and the State of Alaska. The Division successfully supported the consolidation of all of the cases in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia as the In re Polar Bear Endangered Species Litigation . The suits attacked FWS's determination that the polar bear should be listed as a thre atened species, an accompanying ESA section 4(d) rule outlining conditions affecting application of the rule, and the FWS's denial of permits to import polar bear trophies. At the heart of the claims are the scientific find ings of the United Nations Inter\u00ad governmental Panel on Climate Change and related work by the U.S. Geological Service, on which the listing determination is based. Polar Bear Terry Debruyne / USFWS Photo stewardship of wildlife and nat ural resources | 45 Gray Wolf John and Karen Hollingsworth/USFWS Photo In 2011, a team of Division lawyers presente d multi-day oral arguments on several cross- motions for summary judgment in defense of the ru les. In June 2011, the court issued a land\u00ad mark 116-page ruling on the first phase of the case , upholding in its entirety the decision to list the polar bear as a threatened species. Defending the Constitutionality of Congressional Acti on Regarding the Northern Rocky Mountain Gray Wolf Responding to the recovery of gray wolf popu\u00ad lations in the Northern Rocky Mountain re\u00ad gion, FWS issued a rule in 2009 removing the gray wolf from the list of endangered species under the ESA in Idaho and Montana, but not in Wyoming. In August 2010, a district court in Montana set aside the 2009 delisting rule. In April 2011, Congress enacted the Depart\u00ad ment of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Ap\u00ad propriations Act of 2011, which included a spe\u00ad cific provision directing FWS to reinstate the 2009 rule that removed the gray wolf in Mon\u00ad tana and Idaho from the list of endangered species. On the same day that FWS reinstated the 2009 rule, two lawsuits were filed claiming that the statutory provision violated the Separation of Powers doctrine in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The Division succes sfully defended FWS's action to reinstate the rule. The court granted ENRD's motions for summary judgment in their entirety and upheld the constitution\u00ad ality of the statute. Upholding the Constitutionality of the Endangered Species Act In the case of Stewart & Jasper Orchards v. Salazar , the Ninth Circuit in March 2011 rejected an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of the ESA. Plaintiffs, farmers in California's Central Valley, alleged that extending the act's pr otections to the delta smelt, a fish of no pre\u00ad sent commercial value that was formerly harvested as bait, violated the Commerce Clause. They alleged that under a biological opinion ev aluating the effects of federal and state water diversion operations on the delta smelt, they would receive less water. On the merits, the ap\u00adpellate court concluded that the ESA is a comp rehensive regulatory scheme that bears a sub\u00ad stantial relation to interstate commerce. Managing the Variety of Resources in the Klamath River Basin The Klamath River Basin extends from southern Oregon, through northern California, to the Pacific Ocean. The basin is home to four Indian tribes, import ant federal irrigation projects, and National Wildlife Refuges crucial to migratory waterfowl, and is a historically large pro\u00ad 46 | stewardship of wild life and natural resources ducer of salmon. Over the past three decades, it has been the subject of intense litigation over natural resources. The litigati on has encompassed water rights adjudications for both tribal and federal lands, important issues under th e ESA, and the operation of Reclamation's Klamath Project. Civil unrest occurred in summer 2001 over federal ESA actions and, as a re\u00ad sult, federal marshals were assigned to protect the project facilities for many weeks. The Division worked closely with Interior and other federal agencies to draft and negotiate a global settlement regarding the fish, water, and hydropower resources of the Klamath River Basin in Oregon and California. These efforts led to two far-reaching agreements--the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) and the Klamath Hydropower Settlement Agreement (KHSA)--that were signed on February 18, 2010. Secretary of the Interior Salazar, the Gover\u00ad nors of California and Oregon, the Chairs of th e Klamath, Yurok, and Karuk Tribes, leaders of environmental groups, the President of PacifiCorp (the owner of a hydroelectric project on the Klamath River), and representatives of the Klam ath Basin Water Users Association all partici\u00ad pated in the signing ceremony. The KBRA seeks to reduce the potential for futu re conflicts in various ways, including by ad\u00ad dressing the relative proportions of water avai lable to various stakeh olders; improving fish habitat; and purchasing and reti ring farmland in the basin, th ereby reducing irrigation de\u00ad mands. The KHSA provides a framework for the stakeholders to collab orate on environmental and economic studies assessing the potential for removal of four PacifiCorp dams. The Divi\u00ad sion has continued to work closely with other federal agencies as those studies are conducted and as the necessary environmental review is completed.

The KHSA calls for the United States to de\u00adcide by 2012 whether to remove the dams. If removal is selected, the dams would be targeted for removal beginning in 2020. The agreements con\u00ad template that re\u00ad moval would be stewardship of wildlife and nat ural resources | 47 Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge USFWS Photo funded by PacifiCorp ratepayers and the State of California. Legislative ratification and assur\u00ad ances of sufficient funding are necessary for removal to become effective. The Division has worked closely with other agencies and parties to the agreements on legislation implementing those agreements, which was introduced in the U.S. Congress in early November 2011. Everglades National Park NPS Photo Restoring Critical Natural Resources in the Everglades In July 2010, in United States v. South Florida Water Mgmt. Dist. , the United States filed a motion to resolve disputes with the state defendants over comp letion of the cleanup of phos\u00ad phorus pollution from agricultural runoff in the Everglades. In January 2011, the Special Mas\u00ad ter issued a report recommending that the distri ct court grant our motion. The Special Master agreed that the State of Florida must enforce st ricter limits on phosphorus pollution in water discharged to the Loxahatchee National Wildli fe Refuge, and must achieve compliance with \"Class III\" water quality standards throughout the refuge. In September 2011, the district court entered an order adopting the Special Master's report and recommendation and ordering fur\u00ad ther proceedings to establish the limit of phosphorus pollution in discharges to th e refuge. This decision will promote efforts to restore water quality needed to pro\u00adtect natural populations of flora and fauna in Everglades National Park and elsewhere in the remaining Florida Everglades. This cleanup is a critical component of the largest ecosystem restoration effort in human history-\u00ad the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, ap\u00ad proved by Congress in 2000 , with a cost of approxi\u00ad mately $11 billion over 30 years. Protecting National Forest Roadless Areas In October 2011, in State of Wyoming v. United States Dep't of Agriculture , the Tenth Circuit reversed a Wyoming district court judgment that had set aside and permanently enjoined the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (Roadless Ru le). For a number of years, the Division has defended the Roadless Rule, which prohibits ro ad-building and commodity-purpose timber har\u00ad vests in \"inventoried roadless ar eas\" of the National Forest System . (In 2005, the Department of Agriculture promulgated a replacement rule, but that action was invalidated and the Roadless Rule \"reinstated\" by virtue of litigation in the Ninth Circuit. This challenge followed.) The Tenth Circuit rejected the State of Wyoming's claims th at the Roadless Rule violated the Wilderness Act, the National Forest Management Act (NFMA), the Multiple-Use and Sustained-Yield Act, and NEPA. The court determined that the use restrictions for inventoried roadless areas did not constitute a \"de facto\" designation of wilderness. The court also held that the Forest Service had authority, under its Organic Act, to promulgate nationwide rules for the management of National Forest System lands, notwithstanding NFMA's requirement that forests be managed under forest -specific management plans. The court further held that the Roadless Rule was a reasonable ex\u00ad ercise of the Forest Service's authority to manage lands for wildlife, recreational, and watershed uses (in addition to commodity uses). Finally, the court rejected the state's NEPA challenges, determining, among other things, that the Forest Service was not obligated to evaluate site-specific impacts (given the broad nature of the rule) or cumulative impacts that were not \"reasonably foreseeable\" because they were left to future planning decisions. 48 | stewardship of wild life and natural resources The Division also has continued to defend the Fo rest Service in its effo rts to manage and pre\u00ad serve specific inventoried roadless areas within the National Forest System. Much of this land is ecologically significant. In Jayne v. Sherman , we successfully defended the state-specific Idaho Roadless Rule, which was collaboratively developed by the agency, the State of Idaho, and a broad coalition of environmental and indu stry interests. In defending the rule, we worked closely with the Idaho Attorney General' s Office, helping to promote a strong relation\u00ad ship with a state that contains a large share of federal lands. Defending Forest Service Implementation of the 2005 Travel Management Rule The Division also continues to vigorously defend Forest Servic e decisions designating roads, trails, and areas for motor vehicle use in National Forest System lands. The 2005 Travel Man\u00ad agement Rule requires the National Forests to specifically designate roads, trails, and areas that would be open for motor vehicle use. As in dividual forests have been completing their en\u00ad vironmental analyses and designating motor vehicle use under the rule, a number of environ\u00admental and off-highway motor vehicle user groups have been bringing challenges to the desig\u00ad nation decisions. The Division is defending over 20 cases in 9 states at various stages of litiga\u00ad tion. Examples of cases the Division has successfully defended include Center for Sierra Ne - vada Conservation v. U.S. Forest Service , a challenge to the travel management plan for the Eldorado National Forest. The district court up held the Forest Service's authority to designate Overview of Travel Management in the Eldorado National Forest Starting in January 2009, the Eldor ado National Forest began implementing the decision to restrict all motor vehicles to designated roads and trails. The new designated route system in cludes the following features: Allows public motor vehicle use on 1,002 miles of native surface (dirt) roads and 210 miles of trails across the forest, including in the Cryst al Basin area, Silver Fo rk Road, Mormon Emigrant Trail, Elkins Flat, Gold Note, Rock Creek, and many other areas. This includes cars, trucks, campers, RV's, ATV's, motorcycles, 4WD's, etc. Allows passenger cars on 635 miles of su rfaced roads suitable for passenger cars. Prohibits cross-country travel by cars, trucks, ATV's, motorcycles, RV's, etc. Directs seasonal closure of designated system trails and dirt roads from January 1 through March 31. Seasonal closures may be longer if roads or trails are wet and susceptible to damage. Prohibits wheeled over-the-snow travel on certain routes and trails. Restricts parking outside of devel oped trailheads and other recreat ion sites to turnouts, landings, or within one vehicle length of the road or trail. \u2014 Eldorado National Forest Website stewardship of wildlife and nat ural resources | 49 The bison is the largest land mammal in North America. Yellowstone National Park is the only place in the lower 48 states where a population of wild bison has persisted since prehistoric times. In a typical year, more than 3,000 bison roam the park. Bison are strictly vegetarian, grazers of grasslands and sedges in the meadows, the foothills, and high-elevation forested plateaus of the park. \u2014National Park Service Fact Sheet Yellowstone Bison Jenny Jones/NPS Photo roads, trails, and areas under the Travel Manage ment Rule independently of other travel plan\u00ad ning activities under the rule. In American Independence Mines and Minerals Co. v. U.S. Dep't of Agriculture , mining companies challenged the travel management plan for the Payette National Forest in Idaho, alleging that the Fore st Service failed to adequately analyze impacts and failed to include a no-action alternative. The court dismissed the mining companies' claims for lack of standing and entered judgment in favor of the United States. Litigating Other Federal Land Management Policies In fiscal year 2011, ENRD also successfully hand led litigation related to other forest manage\u00ad ment activities of the Forest Service. \u2014 In Western Watersheds Project v. Salazar , ENRD prevailed in its defense of Forest Service and National Park Serv ice management of the iconic Yellowstone bison when the herds migrate out of Yellowstone National Park (and into Gallatin National Forest) in the winter seeking forage. The federal agencies manage the bison under a cooperative arrangement with the State of Montana that permits preservation of healthy and robust herds while also protecting the people and property in Montana from unwanted bison incursions. \u2014 The Division negotiated a settlement in the remedies phase of Conservation Northwest v. Sherman that will allow the Forest Service and BLM to responsibly manage over 24 million acres of federal lands located in Washington, Oregon, and California that lie within the Northwest Forest Plan area. This settlement arose out of a lawsuit challenging the Department of Agriculture's and the Department of the Inte rior's 2007 Records of Decision that removed the Survey and Manage mitigation measures from the Northwest Forest Plan. The Survey and Manage mitigation measures have been the subject of litigation for many years, and this settle\u00ad ment enables the agencies to proceed with a timber program and gives the agencies greater flexibility in pr oject planning. \u2014 In Ark Initiative v. U.S. Forest Service , ENRD defended the Forest Service's 2003 accep\u00ad tance of an amendment to a permittee's ski area master plan and the agency's approval of the Snowmass Ski Area Improvements Project in the White River National Forest, near Aspen, Colorado. The district court fo und that the acceptance of this conceptual master plan amend\u00ad 50 | stewardship of wild life and natural resources ment was not a final agency action, and thus did not trigger NEPA or ESA requirements. The district court further found that the Forest Serv ice complied with NEPA in authorizing the ski area improvements project. On appeal, plaintiffs abandoned many of their arguments and the Tenth Circuit allowed the agency's actions to stand. \u2014 The Division successfully defended a challenge to a pro\u00ad ject on the Norbeck Wildlife Preserve in the Black Hills Na\u00ad tional Forest designed to en\u00ad hance wildlife habitat and ad\u00ad dress a mountain pine beetle infestation in Friends of the Norbeck v. U.S. Forest Service . This is a unique area subject to the Norbeck Organic Act. This decision allows the Forest Ser\u00ad vice to continue its response to devastating mountain pine bee\u00ad tle infestation, furthers the agency's habitat enhancement goals, and affirms the agency's scientific methodology. The State of South Dakota intervened in the matter and we worked closely with them to defend the project. Protecting National Park Lands Norbeck Wildlife Preserve, Black Hills National Forest Forest Service Photo Padre Island National Seashore NPS Map In January 2011, the Fifth Circuit reversed an adverse lower court ruling and directed entry of judgment in favor of the National Park Ser\u00ad vice in Dunn-McCampbell Royalty Interest v. National Park Service . Plaintiffs, who hold rights to oil and gas beneath Padre Island Na\u00adtional Seashore, challenged and obtained a district court judgment invalidating a 2001 management plan for the seashore on the ground that it unlawfu lly infringed upon the right of entry to their mineral estate by clos\u00ading drilling and exploration on sensitive re\u00ad source areas within th e seashore. The Fifth Circuit concluded that a state law pursuant to which Texas had consented to the federal government's acquisition of land for inclusion stewardship of wildlife and nat ural resources | 51 Sand Dunes at Padre Island National Seashore NPS Photo in the seashore, did not protect plaintiffs' oil and gas interests from National Park Service regulation. The appellate court also rejected plaintiffs' arguments that their interests were protected from federal regulation by virtue of the Federal Enabling Act, the federal law re\u00adgarding acquisition of the land. Defending BLM Stewardship of National onuments M The Division successfully defended challenges to resource management plans for the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument, the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, and the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in In re Montana Wilderness Ass'n , The Wilderness Society v. BLM , and Center for Biological Diversity v. BLM . The district courts found that the management plans were consistent with Presidential intent in creating the monuments. The district courts upheld BLM's protection of monument objects, prohib ition of off-road vehicle use, design ation of roads, inventories of historic properties, and NEPA analyses on all three monuments. Upholding BLM Stewardship of Wild Horse Herds The Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act requires BLM to manage wild horses on public lands, primarily in the West, as part of the natu\u00ad ral ecosystem, but also requires BLM to remove excess horses from the range when the number of horses exceeds carrying capacity. To execute this mandate, BLM is re quired to carry out a number of gathers to remove excess horses from the wild and hold them available for adoption. These gathers are controversial and emotional for those attached to the wild horses, and often result in motions for temporary restraining or\u00ad der and/or preliminary in junction of BLM's ac\u00ad tions. In several cases this year, ENRD success\u00ad fully defended BLM's gather decisions in the Rocky Mountain west against such requests for emergency relief: American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign v. Salazar (White Mountain gather in Wyoming); Leigh v. Salazar (Triple B gather in Nevada); Cloud Foundation v. Salazar (Triple B gather in Nevada); Leigh v. Salazar (Silver King gather in Nevada); Habitat for Horses v. Salazar (North Piceance gather in Colorado). In each of these cases, the gathers proceeded as planned, thereby allowing BLM to carry out its statutory mandate. Wild Horses at Saylor Creek, Idaho BLM Photo 52 | stewardship of wild life and natural resources Defending Management of Mineral Resources The Division successfully defended a challenge to BLM's management of a uranium mine within 10 miles of the north rim of the Grand Ca nyon that resumed mining in 2009 after a 17\u00ad year hiatus. The district court decided that BL M was not required to issue a new mining plan of operations. The district court also decided that BLM was not required to complete new or supplemental NEPA review of its approval of the existing mining plan of operations or of its decision to approve an updated reclamation bond for the mine. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's denial of a motion for a prelimin ary injunction and also denied two requests by plaintiffs for an inju nction pending appeal. Defending NMFS Management of Ocean Fisheries The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation an d Management Act and other related statutes charge NMFS with the difficult task of managi ng ocean commercial fishing to provide for con\u00ad servation and sustainable fishing while, at the sa me time, optimizing fishing yield. In fiscal year 2011, the Division again successfully defended the balancing of these often-competing ob\u00adjectives in several challenges to NMFS regulation s. Of particular note was ENRD's successful defense of two fishery management plans govern ing groundfish fisheries on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts known as Amendment 16 and Amen dment 20, respectively. These two plans ap\u00ad plied for the first time a catch shares/limited access privileges management approach to these fisheries. The approach was designed to tighte n restrictions on commercial groundfish fishing in an effort to end overfishing and rebuild stocks under the strict deadlines set by Congress. A variety of groups representing various interests challenged the agency's adoption of the amend\u00ad ments in two cases in Massachusetts and California: City of New Bedford v. Locke (as to Amendment 16) and Pacific Coast Fed'n of Fishermen's Ass'ns v. Locke (as to Amendment 20). In each case, ENRD presented oral argument and responded to several hundred pages of sum\u00ad mary judgment briefing that levi ed a wide array of attacks, ranging from broad-scale constitu\u00ad tional allegations to detailed challenges to th e scientific and mathemat ical methodologies em\u00ad ployed by the agency. In the end, our efforts were successful with su mmary judgment granted in favor of NMFS on all issues, thereby allowing these important plans to be implemented. We achieved similar success in the case of Charter Operators of Alaska v. Locke, a challenge to NMFS's final rule creating a li mited access system for charter vessels in the Guided Halibut Sport Fishery in southeast Alaska and the Central Gulf of Alaska. Plaintiffs claimed that the rule violated the Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 and the Magnuson-Stevens Act. As with Amendments 16 and 20, this rule was intended to reduce pressure on the Alaska halibut fishery to ensure a sustainable fishery for the future. The Division successfully opposed a motion for preliminary injunction by charter fishing operat ors seeking to enjoin implementation of the rule, thereby allowing the rule to take effect and provide needed protections for halibut without delay. stewardship of wildlife and natural resources | 53 From January 2009 through September 2011, the Division concluded cr iminal cases against 186 individuals and 59 corporate defendants , obtaining over 113 years of confinement and over $214 million in criminal fines, restitut ion, and other monetary relief. Prosecuting Hazardous Waste Violations Honeywell International owns and operates a facili ty near Metropolis, Illinois, where it refines raw uranium ore into uranium he xafluoride (UF6), a compound used in the uranium enrich\u00ad ment process that produces fuel for nuclear re actors and nuclear weapons. The air emissions from the UF6 conversion process are scrubbed with potassium hydroxide (KOH) prior to dis\u00ad charge. This process accumulates uranium comp ounds that settle out of the liquid and are pumped as slurry into 55-gallon drums. In No vember 2002, Honeywell shut down part of its wet reclamation process used to reclaim this uranium from the potassium hydroxide and began storing the drums onsite. Honeywell was required to obtain a RCRA permit to store the drums for longer than 90 days, but failed to do so. Environmental Protection Agency special agents executed a search warrant in April 2009 and found 7,500 drums of KOH mud that was both radioactive and hazardous. As a result, Honeywell pled guilty to a felony RCRA violation for knowingly storing hazardous waste without a permit and was sen\u00ad tenced to pay an $11.8 million fine and complete a five-year term of probation. In addition, Honeyw ell must develop, fund, and implement a household haz\u00ad ardous waste collection program and arrange for the proper treatment, trans\u00ad portation, and disposal of waste col\u00ad lected during at least eight collection events over a two-year period at a cost approximating $200,000. Corroded Drum of \"KOH Mud\" with Warn ing Label EPA Photo 54 | enforcing pollution and wildlife criminal laws Reducing Pollution from Ocean-Going Vessels Under the auspices of the Vessel Pollution Initiative which began in the late 1990s, the penal\u00ad ties imposed in vessel pollution cases prosecuted by ENRD from January 2009 through Sep\u00ad tember 2011 have totaled more than $42 million, and responsible maritime officials have been sentenced to more than 40 months of confinement. The program reflects the Division's ongo\u00ad ing, concentrated effort to detect, deter, and prosecute those who illegally discharge pollutants from ships into oceans, coastal waters, and inland waterways. Enforcement is chiefly under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as \"MARPOL,\" and the U.S. implementing legislation, the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS). These laws require vessels to maintain logbooks recording all transfers an d discharges of oily wastes. In addition, these cases frequent ly involve obstruction of U.S. Coast Guard inspections, which are charged under appropriate provisions of the federal criminal code. In fiscal year 2011, the Division's successful prosecution of these violations included the repre\u00ad sentative cases below: \u2014 Stanships, Inc. (Marshall Islands), Stanships, Inc. (New York), Standard Shipping, Inc. (Liberia), and Calmore Shipping (British Virgin Is lands) pled guilty to obstruction of justice, failing to maintain an Oil Record Book (ORB) under APPS, and violating the Ports and Water\u00ad ways Safety Act. Stanships failed to notify the Coast Guard of hazardous conditions on the M/V Americana, a Panamanian-registered cargo vessel. Moreover, the Coast Guard obtained photographs taken by a crew member showing the use of a valve to bypass the ship's oily water separator. The ship's ORB was fa lsified to conceal the discharges and when the ship arrived in port in New Orleans, it had a variety of unrepo rted hazardous conditions, including an inoper\u00ad able and unreliable generator and a hole between a fuel tank and a ballast tank. Defendants were collectively sentenced to pay a $1 million fine, and each will complete a five-year term of \"T ogether with our partners at the Coast Guard, Environmental Protection Agency, and United States Attorney's Office, we are sending the message that we will vigorously prosecute deliberate violations of environmental and safety laws. As a consequence of their violations of the law, Stanships' vessels and related corporations will pay a substantial fine and be barred from doing business in the United States for the next five years.\" \u2014Ignacia S.

Additionally, Stanships (Marshall Islands) is a repeat offender, having pled guilty to an APPS ORB violation and CWA violat ion for discharging oil in the Gulf of Mexico from the M/V Doric Glory. As a result, the M/V Americana and M/V Doric Glory are banned from entering U.S. waters. \u2014 Guilty pleas were entered in nine additional ca ses involving deliberate violations by vessel operators and crew members: United States v. Koo's Shipping Co. ; United States v. Atlas Ship Mgmt., Ltd. ; United States v. Offshore Service Vessels, Inc. ; United States v. Irika Shipping, S.A.; United States v. Grifakis ; United States v. Uniteam Marine Shipping GmbH. ; United States v. EPPS Shipping Co. ; United States v. Fleet Mgmt., Ltd. (third conviction); and United States v. Nova Shipping Co. These companies and individuals were sentenced to pay a total of $11.4 million in fines, $2.2 million in commun ity service payments, and $250,000 in restitu\u00ad tion, and to serve a total of six months of incarc eration, with each serving a term of probation for crimes including conspiracy, false statements , obstruction of justice, and ORB violations under APPS. Investigating the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in the Gulf of Mexico During fiscal year 2011, the Department continue d its criminal investigation of the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that took place on April 20, 2010. This work is being conducted by the Deepwater Horizon Task Force, which was formed in March 2011 to consolidate the ef\u00ad forts of the Department's Criminal Division, ENRD, and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern Dis\u00ad trict of Louisiana. The Environment and Natura l Resources Division is a member of the task force. Bringing Actions to Safeguard America's Waters Over the course of a four-day voyage down part of the Mississippi River and then up the Ohio River, a barge of defendant Canal Barge Co. leaked benzene, a hazardous substance, from a cracked pipe. Rather than imme diately reporting the leak to the Coast Guard, as required by the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, the barge crew tried to patch the crack first with bar soap and then with an inappropriate epoxy compound, neither of which worked. A jury convicted Canal Barge of failing to notify the Coast Guard of a hazardous condition on the barge. Post- trial, the district court set aside the jury's verd ict, concluding that the United States should have brought the prosecution in the judicial district in which the leaking was first discovered. In January 2011, in the case of United States v. Canal Barge Co. , the Sixth Circuit reversed, concluding that the failure-to-report offense is a continuing offense for purposes of the crimi\u00ad nal venue statute and, therefore, venue was proper in the charging district because the offense continued on the Ohio River within the Western Di strict of Kentucky. This ruling (which im\u00ad plicates the \"law of the thalweg\" under which the river boundary betwee n states moves as the channel changes from erosion and accretion) will be important for states that share borders with other states that run thro ugh major navigable waterways. 56 | enforcing pollution and wildlife criminal laws Upholding the Constitutionality of the Safe Drinking Water Act The defendant, Cory Ledeal King, a manager of a large farming and cattle operation in south\u00ad ern Idaho, was convicted in the district court of violating the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), based upon his injection of runo ff waters into underground wells without the permits required by Idaho law. In October 2011, in the case of United States v. King , the Ninth Circuit affirmed King's conviction, rejecting his arguments that the SDWA was unconstitutional for allegedly exceeding Congress' Commerce Clause power. The appellate court concluded that Congress had authority to regulate the activities proscrib ed in the SDWA because those activities had a substantial relation to interstate commerce; th at is, unregulated injections of polluted sub\u00ad stances into drinking water sources can have subs tantial negative effects on drinking water and the economy. The court of appeals also found that the federal government had authority to prosecute King for violating the state program, any injection without a permit violated the pro\u00ad gram, and the United States did not have to prove that the injection was contaminated or was into an underground source of drinking water. Protecting the Environment, Pub lic Health, and Worker Safety The Division successfully prosecuted a number of asbestos-related cases this year. When as\u00ad bestos-containing materials are damaged or distur bed by repair, remodeling, or demolition ac\u00ad tivities, microscopic fibers become airborne and can be inhaled into the lungs, where they can cause significant health problems. The Environmental Protection Agency has strict rules under the CAA regarding the manner in which asbest os may be removed from buildings during demolition or remodeling projects in order to protect public health. The following cases are illustr Because of its fiber strength and heat resistant properties, asbestos has been used for a wide range of manufactured goods, mostly in building materials, friction products, heat- resistant fabrics, packaging, gaskets, and coatings. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disturbed by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers become airborne and can be inhale d into the lungs, where they can cause significant health problems. EPA regulates asbestos primar ily under the authority of: The Clean Air Act (Asbestos National Emissi on Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants regulations). The Toxic Substances Control Act (Asbestos Ban and Phaseout regulations). The Comprehensive Environmental Resp onse, Compensation, and Liability Act. \u2014EPA Fact Sheet and Image ativ e: Facts about Asbestos enforcing pollution and wildlife criminal laws | 57 \u2014 A district court jury convicted Mark Desnoyer s, a licensed air monitor, who was charged with conspiring to violate the CAA, the Occupa tional Safety and Health Act, the Mail Fraud Statute, and New York state law by conducting numerous unauthorized asbestos removal pro\u00ad jects without taking appropriate pr otective measures. After the trial, the district court entered a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count finding that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that any projects except one met the relevant regulatory requirements of the CAA. In March 2011, in the case of United States v. Desnoyers , the Second Circui t reversed. The court reasoned that where the defendant disput ed only one object of the multi-conspiracy count, but conceded that the government had proved other objects of the conspiracy, his fac\u00adtual insufficiency challenge to the disputed object was without merit. \u2014 Keith Gordon-Smith and his asbestos abatemen t company, Gordon-Smith Contracting, Inc. (GSCI), were convicted by a jury of eight CAA violations and three false statement counts. Asbestos Clump EPA Photo Gordon-Smith ordered workers at GSCI to remove copper pipes, ceiling tile, and scrap metal from the six-story Genesee Hospital complex prior to its being demoli shed in the summer of 2009. When the unprotected workers removed this material they were exposed to asbestos, and often wore their asbestos-contaminated clothing back to their homes an d families. Gordon-Smith and GSCI made false statements to an Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspector who had received complaints from GSCI workers. Gordon-Smith and GSCI were also convicted of six counts of failing to provid e the required notice to EPA prior to commencing asbestos abatement projects at six different sites in Rochester, New York, includ ing several schools. Gordon- Smith was sentenced to six years of incarceration, followed by a three-year term of supervised release. GSCI is now defunct. \u2014 Despite knowing of the presence of asbestos, Charles Yi and co-conspirators John Bostick and Joseph Yoon hired a company that was not licensed to conduct asbestos abatement to scrape asbestos-containing ceilin gs during the renovation of a 200-plus-unit apartment building. Defendants hired un\u00ad trained Hispanic day laborers and failed to tell them about the asbestos or provide them with adequate protective gear. Yi was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to violate the CAA and five substantive CAA violatio ns for his role in the illegal removal of asbestos. The co-defendants, Joseph Yoon and John Bostick, pled guilty to co nspiracy. Yi was sentenced to 48 months of incarceration, followed by a 2-year term of supervised release, and ordered to pay $5,400 in restitu\u00ad tion.

During the renovations, de\u00adfendants disturbed large quantities of the popc orn ceiling mixture that contained significant amounts of asbestos without noti fying regulators or following th e work practice standards for asbestos removal. Gannaway was convicted by a jury of conspiracy, false statements, and other CAA charges related to the mishan dling of asbestos. He was sent enced to 90 days of incarcera\u00ad tion, followed by 6 months of house arrest, a 3-year term of supervised release, and 30 hours of community service.

Prosecuting Crimes Against U.S. Fisheries and the Seafood Consumer When fisherman and fish wholesalers do not comply with the law, they imperil the entire fish\u00ad ery, adversely impact the liveli hoods of those who abide by the law, and commit a fraud on the U.S. consumer. Illegal commercial fishing encomp asses such crimes as illegal fish harvesting, purchase of illegally harvested fish, and false labe ling of fish under the Lacey Act as well as re\u00ad lated general criminal violations.

Some of the fish seized tested positive for malachite green and Enrofloxin, both of which are prohibited from use in U.S. food. Additionally, Blyth and Phelps bought more than 25,000 pounds of Lake Victoria perch from Africa and then mislabeled and sold it as grouper to customers in Alabama and Florida at 60 | enforcing pollution and wildlife criminal laws a higher cost and in greater quantities than if it had been accurately la beled. Further, defen\u00ad dants repackaged farm-raised foreign shrimp as U.S. wi ld-caught shrimp. Defendants pled guilty to conspiracy, Lacey Act, misbranding, and smuggling violations for their roles in this mislabeling of seafood. Blyth and Phelps were sentenced to 33 and 24 months of in\u00adcarceration, respectively, followed by a 3-year term of supervised release, and were ordered to pay a fine of $5,000 and barred for 3 years from working in the seafood industry. Popa was sentenced to 13 months of incarceration fo llowed by a 3-year term of supervised release. \u2014 Stephen Delaney, Jr., was convicted by a jury of violating the Lacey Act and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The violations involved the false labeling of $8,000 worth of frozen fillets of pollock from China as cod loins from Canada and the mis\u00ad branding of $203,000 worth of frozen fish fillets that were falsely labeled as products of Holla nd, Namibia, and the United States, when they were actually products of Canada. The price of cod was $1 per pound higher than that for Alas\u00ad kan pollock. Delaney wa s sentenced to three months of home detention, as part of a one-year term of probation, and was ordered to pay a fi ne of $5,000 into the Magnuson-Stevens Fund. Stopping Illegal Wildlife Trafficking Federal criminal enforcement of wildlife statutes plays a key deterrent role and augments state, tribal, and foreign wildlife management efforts. A wildlife case can include prosecution of both individual and organizational pe rpetrators; disgorgement of proc eeds from illegal conduct such as smuggling; punishment that includes commun ity service to help miti gate harm caused by the offense; and forfeiture of wi ldlife and instrumentalities used to commit the offense. One key statute for prosecution of wildlife crimes is the Lacey Act. The Division resolved a number of these cases in fiscal year 2011: \u2014 James Bobby Butler, Jr., was involved in the i llegal hunting and killing of white-tailed and mule deer. Butler and his brother, Marlin Jackson Butler, operated a guiding service hunting camp to out-of-state hunters, who killed deer in excess of annual bag limits, hunted deer with\u00ad out permits, and killed deer using illegal equipm ent and hunting methods such as spotlighting. The enterprise brought in $77,500 in guiding fe es, which included arra nging for the transport of the antlers and capes to Kansas, Texas, and Lo uisiana. James Bobby Butler pled guilty to conspiracy to violate the Lacey Act, a Lacey Act trafficking charge, and obstruction of justice. He was sentenced to 41 months of incarceration, followed by a 3-year term of supervised re\u00ad enforcing pollution and wildlife criminal laws | 61 Boxes of Frozen Fillets of Vietnamese Catfish Seized upon Entry into the United States by NOAA's Office of Law Enforcement and Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement NOAA Photo lease, a fine of $25,000 to the Lacey Act Rewa rd Fund, and an additional $25,000 in restitu\u00ad tion to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks, and was banned from all hunting and guiding activities for 3 years. Marlin Jackson Butler pled guilty to conspiracy and Lacey Act violations, and was sentenced to 27 months of in carceration, followed by a 3-year term of su\u00ad pervised release, a $10,000 fine, and an additional $10,000 in restitution. Sperm Whale Teeth \u2014 David Place illegally bought and imported sperm whale teeth and narwhal tusks into the United States. From 2 001 to 2006, Place and two Ukrainian co- defendants, Andrei Mikhalyov and Charles Manghis, conspired to import the whale teeth for resale in the United States through the Manor House Antiques Cooperative in Nantucket, Massachusetts, that Place owned. The market value of the teeth and tusks illegally im ported by Place was determined to be between $200,000 and $400,000. Place was convicted by a jury of 7 felony counts including conspiracy, Lacey Act, and smuggling violations, and was sentenced to 33 months of incarcera\u00ad tion followed by a 3-year term of supervised rele ase. Mikhalyov pled guilty to conspiracy, and was sentenced to nine months of incarceration and deported to the Ukraine. Manghis was sen\u00ad tenced to 30 days of intermittent incarceration as part of a 2-year term of probation, and was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine and forfeit a number of ivory carvings. \u2014 Je ffrey M. Bodnar and his wife Veronica Ander\u00ad son-Bodnar engaged in the illegal trapping and in\u00ad terstate sale of bobcats. They sold the bobcat pelts to fur buyers in Montana and Kansas. Additionally, the two conspired to submit false records to the Colorado Division of Wildlife in order to obtain tags for the pelts. Jeffrey Bodnar pled guilty to conspiracy to violate the Lacey Act and possession of a firearm by a felon, and was sentenced to serve 27 months of incarceration, followed by a 3-year term of supervised release during which he is pro\u00adhibited from hunting, trapping, or fishing. Ve ronica Anderson-Bodnar was sentenced to a five- year term of probation, during which time she will not be allowed to possess firearms and also will be prohibited from hunting, trapping, or fishing. \u2014 Between 2003 and 2007, Jeffrey Foiles and his hunting club, Fallin' Sk ies Strait Meat Duck Club, sold and guided waterfowl hunts for the pu rpose of illegally hunting ducks and geese in excess of hunters' individual bag limits. Foiles pled guilty to violating the Lacey Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. He was sentenced to 13 months of incarceration and a 1-year term of supervised release, and was ordered to pay a fine of $100,000. Additionally, he will be pro\u00ad hibited from hunting or being a guide for two year s. Fallin' Skies Strait Meat Duck Club was sentenced to complete a two-year term of pr obation and will serve as guarantor of the $100,000 fine assessed to Foiles. Bobcat USFWS Photo 62 | enforcing pollution and wildlife criminal laws Working Together on Criminal Environmental Enforcement In fiscal year 2011, the Division continued its vigorous efforts to ensure that U.S. Attorneys across the nation make pollution and wildlife pros ecutions part of their everyday practice. In addition to hosting, along with the Attorney General's Advisory Co mmittee, the first-ever United States Attorneys' Environmental Crimes and Enforcement Conference for all United States Attorneys on November 18 and 19, 2011, the Division deve loped and participated in ma\u00ad jor training events and task forces with various United States Attorneys' Offices: \u2014 Thr ee major training events centered around growing concerns with new techniques in en\u00ad ergy extraction. The first of these was the Marcellus Shale Law Enforcement Conference in State College, Pennsylvania, in May 2011. Approximately 250 people attended this conference, which was sponsored by ENRD, each of the 3 U.S. Attorneys' Offices in Pennsylvania, EPA's Criminal Investigations Division, FWS, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Pennsyl\u00ad vania Office of the Attorney General, among others. The purpose of the conference was to strengthen coordination and communication among federal, state, and local law enforcement in this area. Other energy extraction conf erences included the Environmental Enforcement Training Conference in Bismarck, North Dakota, in September 2011; and the Environmental Law Conference in Great Falls, Montana, in October 2011. \u2014 United States Attorneys' Offices in Alabam a, Colorado, Louisiana, Missouri, and Ohio joined in the Division's Worker Endangerment In itiative, conducting joint training and docket reviews with the Occupational Safety and Heal th Administration and Department of Labor. \u2014 The Division provided pollution and wildlife crimes training at events held by the United States Attorneys' Offices in the District of Montana in February 2011, the District of Idaho in April 2011, and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in June 2011. \u2014 Division attorneys worked closely with United States Attorneys' personnel on environ\u00ad mental task forces in the Southern District of Alabama, District of Idaho, Southern District of Ohio, District of Maryland, West ern District of New York, Eastern District of North Carolina, Western District of Pennsylvania, and District of South Carolina. \u2014 In January 2011, representatives of the U.S. Atto rney's Office for the Ea stern District of Vir\u00ad ginia, the ENRD Environmental Crimes Section, the Coast Guard, and EPA met in Norfolk, Vir\u00ad ginia, to discuss environmental crimes in the Tidewater area. The topics of the meeting in\u00ad cluded Coast Guard investigative authorities, substantive environmental laws, title 18 crimes, and investigative strategies. The Coast Guard thereafter conducted numerous facility and ves\u00adsel visits, and generated a number of leads for further investigation. \u2014 And, as it does each year, the Division co-hosted the biannual meetings of the Environmental Crimes Policy Committee, compri sed of Division prosecutors and Assistant United States Attor\u00ad neys; and provided basic and adva nced environmental crimes trai ning to dozens of Assistant United States Attorneys and ag ency counsel in the week-long Environmental Crimes Seminar. enforcing pollution and wildlife criminal laws | 63 IMPACTS FROM THE DEEPWATER HORIZON SPILL Oil Near Deepwater Horizon Rig, May 2010 NOAA Photo Oil at Pass a Loutre, LA May 2010 NOAA Photo Turtle Rescue & Rehab NOAA & GA Dept. of NR Photo Pelican Rescue & Cleaning USFWS Photo Tar Balls of Weathered Oil Wash Ashore Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge USFWS Photo Defending the U.S. Response to the Deepwate r Horizon Oil Spill and Management of Oil and Gas Resources In fiscal year 2011, the Division continued to defend a number of cases arising from the Deep- water Horizon oil spill. These cases challenge aspects of the federal government's response to contain the oil spill following th e explosion, regulatory actions to prevent future recurrence of oil spills, and approval of exploration and production plans and lease sales in the Gulf of Mex\u00adico and Alaskan waters. Examples of cases resolved in fiscal year 2011 include the following cases: \u2014 In H ornbeck Offshore Services, L.L.C. v. Salazar and Ensco Offshore Services v. Salazar , the Division successfully defeated claims alleging that Interior lacks authority to impose plan\u00ad ning and permitting requirements on oil and gas development activities on the Outer Conti\u00ad nental Shelf. We also obtained dismissal of district court challenges to the Secretary's suspen\u00adsion in 2010 of certain deepwater drilling activi ties, and successfully negotiated a resolution to claims alleging unreasonable delay in the re view of applications for permits to drill. \u2014 In Center for Biological Diversity v. Salazar , the U.S. District Court for the District of Co\u00ad lumbia dismissed nearly all of plaintiff's claims in response to the United States' motion to dis\u00ad miss. Plaintiff had challenged DOI's policy of using categorical exclusion reviews under NEPA when approving exploration plan s, development and production plans, and drilling permits, but the court agreed that the st atute of limitations on any such challenge had run because the categorical exclusion policy was first adopted in 1986. The court also di smissed claims related to several planned lease sales as constitutiona lly and prudentially unripe for decision. The court also ruled that the plaintiff had failed to provide the notice required before bringing chal\u00ad lenges to certain permits under the ESA. In fiscal year 2012, the parties continued to litigate plaintiff's remaining challenges to Lease Sale 213. \u2014 In Defenders of Wildlife v. Bureau of Ocean Energy Mgmt., Regulation & Enforcement , plaintiff also challenged oil and gas lease sales for deepwater wells in th e Gulf of Mexico, alleg\u00ad defending federal pr ograms | 65 ing violations of NEPA, ESA, and the Administ rative Procedure Act (APA) arising from DOI's alleged failure to modify offshore oil and gas leasing operations, policies, and practices follow\u00ad ing the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and oil spill. The U.S. district court in Alabama also granted the United States' motion to dismis s all claims other than those relating to Lease Sale 213. \u2014 In Alask a v. Salazar , the State of Alaska primarily sought to compel Interior to vacate a purported moratorium on Outer Continental Shel f exploration and development in the Alaska region and to provide plaintiff with notice and an opportunity to participate before imposing any future moratorium. The district court in Alaska granted the United States' motion for summary judgment in the case, agreeing that no moratorium on permitting of oil and gas exploration and development in the Alaska region existed. \u2014 We filed responsive briefs in the Fifth Circuit in Center for Biological Diversity v. Salazar in November 2010 and in Gulf Restoration Network, Inc. v. Salazar in December 2010. Both of these cases consist of consolidated petitions for review of DOI's appr oval, shortly after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and resulting oi l spill, of exploration plans that provide for the drilling of exploratory wells in the Gulf of Mexico. Petitioners primarily challenge Interior's reliance on categorical exclusions from NEPA re view requirements when approving the plans. Petitioners also argue that Interior violated the APA and other federal statutes by allegedly fail\u00ad ing to consider the implications of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In April 2011, the Fifth Cir\u00ad cuit heard argument in both cases. Upholding Administrative Actions Related to Climate Change EPA's efforts to regu\u00ad late greenhouse gases that contribute to global climate change reached a critical point in fiscal year 2011. Specifically, on Janu\u00ad ary 2, 2011, EPA's regulations governing motor vehicle emis\u00ad sions of greenhouse gases took effect, trig\u00ad gering not only mobile source regulation, but U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks by Economic Sector, 1990-2008 This figure shows greenhouse gas sinks and emissions by source in the United States from 1990 to 2008. For consistency, emissions are expressed in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. Emissions (million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents) EPA Image 66 | defending federal programs also regulation of the largest stationary sources in accordance with EPA's greenhouse gas tai\u00ad loring rule. Scores of lawsuits have been filed challenging these actions as well as EPA's finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare and EPA's various regula\u00ad tions implementing the greenhouse gas regulations in the states. \u2014 In a suite of cases known generally as Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA , four motions were filed in the D.C. Circuit by oppo nents of EPA's principal greenhouse gas regula\u00ad tions seeking to stay their effectiveness pendin g judicial review, and additional motions were filed in the Fifth and D.C. Circuits seeking to stay EPA's implementation rules in the states. After extensive briefing, both courts entered or ders denying the motions for stay in December 2010 and January 2011, thus ensuring that EPA' s efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions began as scheduled. \u2014 In March 2011, the D.C. Circuit issued briefing orders in the suite of cases chal\u00ad lenging EPA's principal greenhouse gas regulations, largely adopting our briefing format proposal and establishing a briefing schedule extending through December 2011. From August to September 2011, the United States filed subs tantial briefs on the merits defending EPA's principal green\u00adhouse gas regulations. In February 2012, the court heard two back-to-back days of EPA Image oral argument. In a related matter, Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. EPA , the D.C. Circuit dis\u00ad missed challenges to EPA's 2009 decision to grant California a waiver of preemption under the CAA so that the state could implement its own motor vehicle greenhouse gas emission regula\u00ad tions. The court found that petitioners la cked standing to challenge EPA's action. Additionally, in Amigos Bravos v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt. and WildEarth Guardians v. Bureau of Land Mgmt. , the Division successfully defend ed three BLM quarterly oil and gas lease sales in New Mexico as well as a Forest Serv ice decision to open an area of the Carson Na\u00ad tional Forest in New Mexico to oil and gas leasing. Plaintiffs alleged that the decisions, involv\u00ad ing dozens of lease tracts around the state, violate the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the Mineral Leasing Act, NEPA, and NFMA. In Amigos Bravos , the court dismissed plain\u00ad tiffs' claims for lack of standing , finding that plaintiffs' could no t satisfy Article III injury re\u00ad quirements by alleging harm stemming from impacts caused by global climate change. In WildEarth , the court found in favor of BLM and the Fore st Service on the merits on all claims. These cases are significant because of the court' s holdings on air quality impacts and standing in the climate change context. defending federal prog rams | 67 Defending Against a Public Nuisance Tort Lawsuit Related to Climate Change The Division also assisted the So licitor General's Office in handling a case before the Supreme Court on behalf of the Tennessee Valley Authority on the issue of climate change. Eight states, a city, and several private land trusts sued five major electric power co mpanies, including the Tennessee Valley Authority, in an attempt to a ddress climate change issues. They alleged that power plant emissions violated common law nuisan ce principles and sought an injunction to limit those emissions. The dist rict court dismissed the lawsuit, but the Second Circuit rein\u00ad stated it. In June 2011, in American Electric Power v. Connecticut , the Supreme Court issued a favorable decision reversing th e Second Circuit. An equally divided Court of eight Justices held that plaintiffs had standing to bring thei r complaint (the four dissenting justices would have held that plaintiffs lacked constitutional standing). On the merits, however, the Court found that the CAA and actions taken by EPA un der the act displaced any federal common law right that plaintiffs may once have had. In re aching this conclusion, the Court noted EPA's au\u00ad thority to regulate existing stationary sources under the act, and the multiple avenues for en\u00ad forcement provided by the act, including the abilit y of parties to petition for rules. The Court further explained that Congress' decision to entrust EPA with regulation of greenhouse gases made sense based upon the agency's scientif ic, economic, and technological resources. Upholding the Administration's Decisions Regarding Handling of Nuclear Waste In July 2011, the D.C. Circuit issued a favorable decision in In re Aiken . The court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction four consolidated petiti ons for review that sought to challenge the De\u00ad partment of Energy's (DOE's) decisions to file a motion to withdraw its license applica\u00ad tion for a permanent geologic repository for high-level nu\u00adclear waste at Yucca Mountain and to terminate the Yucca Mountain program. The court agreed that petitioners' claim challenging DOE's attempt to withdraw the license applica\u00ad tion was not ripe because the Nuclear Regulatory Commis\u00ad sion's Licensing Board had de\u00ad nied DOE's motion to with\u00addraw and the Nuclear Regula\u00ad tory Commission itself had not yet decided whether it would review the Board's denial. The Yucca Mountain Disposal Conceptual Plan NRC Diagram 68 | defending federal programs court explained that if the Commission declined to review the Board's decision or upheld it, DOE will have failed in its attempt to withdraw the license application and petitioners' claim will be moot. The appellate court also held that petitioners' claim chal lenging a determination allegedly made in January 2010 by the President and DOE Secretary to unilaterally and irrevo\u00ad cably terminate the Yucca Mountain repository process is not justiciable because petitioners failed to identify any reviewable final agency action. Supporting Investment in Transportation Infrastructure In fiscal year 2011, the Division continued its effort to support the Department of Transporta\u00ad tion's investment in state and city efforts to improve transportation options in urban areas. In St. Paul Branch of the NAACP v. Fed- eral Transit Admin. , we worked with the United States Attorney's Office in Minnesota to defend the Fed\u00ad eral Transit Ad\u00administration's envi\u00ad ronmental impact disclosures for the Central Corridor Light Rail Transit Project connecting downtown St. Paul with downto wn Minneapolis. The court ruled in favor of the agency on all claims but one, and declined to halt the project while the agency remedied its environmental disclosure s. The court agreed with our argument that the public interest in the transit project, includ ing the construction jobs it is bringing to the Twin Cities, outweighed the potential harm to plaintiffs. In Friends of Congaree Swamp v. Federal Highway Admin. , ENRD also succeeded in defending a $37 million project to rebu ild a series of four structurally deficient bridges and expand connec ting causeways along U.S. Highway 601 within the Congaree National Park in South Carolina. Plaintiffs were successful in a prior challenge, and brought new claims challenging the revised environmental analysis. The South Carolina Department of Transportation also was a defendant in this suit and the Division worked very closely with it. As a result of the favorable decision, this important public safety work continues. Construction is expected to be completed NPS Image in June 2013. Central Corridor Light Rail Transit Project, Minnesota FTA/DOT Diagram defending federal prog rams | 69 Birds-Point New Madrid Floodway USACOE DiagramDefending the Operation of Floodways During Mississippi River Flooding The State of Missouri sought emergency relief in Missouri v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs to en\u00ad join the Corps from operating the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway in response to record high flooding. Operation of the floodway was necessary to protect thousands of peo\u00adple and millions of dollars' worth of prop\u00ad erty from the potential of a catastrophic flooding event that could result from the failure of a levee near Cairo, Illinois. Mis\u00ad souri alleged that the Corps' plans to oper\u00ad ate the floodway violat ed the Missouri CWA and the APA. In less than a week, the Divi\u00adsion successfully opposed a request in the district court for a temporary restraining order, and motions for emergency stay in the Eighth Circuit and the Supreme Court. The Corps detonated the levee several days later. Misso uri then voluntarily dism issed its suit. This victory required close cooperation among the local U.S. Attorney's Office, three sections of the Division, and the Solicitor General's Office. Upholding Efforts to Deepen the Delaware River for Navigation We successfully opposed multiple challenges to the long-planned deepening of the Delaware River's 102-mile main channel from 40 to 45 feet. In Delaware Dep't of Na tural Resources v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs , ENRD successfully defended the deepening of one stretch of the river against a motion for preliminary injunction from the State of Delaware, which argued that the Corps could not proceed with the project unti l it received certain state permits and made supplemental findings under the Coastal Zone Management Act. In November 2010, the dis\u00adtrict court in Delaware granted summary judgment in favor of the Corps, allowing the full pro\u00ad ject to proceed. In January 2011, the district court in New Jersey similarly granted summary judgment in favor of the Corps in New Jersey v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs on claims brought by the State of New Jersey and several environmental groups under the CWA, CAA, and NEPA. Defending Permitting of Dredge-or-Fill Activities The Division successfully defended multiple de cisions by the Corps to issue CWA permits au\u00ad thorizing the discharge of dredged or fill material s into various waters of the United States, in\u00ad cluding in: Jordan River Restoration Network v. Army Corps of Eng'rs (April 2011 order de\u00ad nying preliminary injunction against a permit au thorizing the discharge of dredged or fill mate\u00ad rials into wetlands adjacent to the Jordan River in Salt Lake County, Utah, in connection with the construction of the Salt Lake Regional Athletic Sports Complex); ARC Ridge, L.L.C. v. Army Corps of Eng'rs (February 2011 judgment dismissing ch allenge to the Corps' decision to allow the construction of an electric transmission line in Texas to proceed pursuant to a nation\u00ad 70 | defending federal programs wide permit); Hillsdale Environmental Loss Prevention, Inc. v. Army Corps of Eng'rs (orders denying a preliminary injunction and subsequently affirming the de cision of the Corps in issu\u00ad ing a permit allowing BNSF Rail way Co. to fill wetlands in conjunction with development of an intermodal transportation facility near Gardner and Edgerton, Kansas). Litigating Water Qualit y in the Everglades Plaintiffs in Miccosukee Tribe v. EPA originally challenged a determination by EPA that certain statutory and regulatory actions by the State of Florida concerning discharges into the Ever\u00ad glades did not amount to changes to the state's water quality standards. After a largely unfa\u00ad vorable ruling in 2008, the dist rict court issued a harshly worded order in April 2010, in re\u00ad sponse to contempt motions filed by plaintiffs. That order directed EPA to issue an amended determination in the matter by September 3, 2010, and to take other specific actions related to its implementation of the CWA. While EPA issued a comprehensive amended determination that complied with nearly all of the court's inju nctive instructions, the Division filed a motion for reconsideration of aspects of the April 2010 order. The Divisi on also successfully petitioned for a writ of mandamus from the Eleventh Circuit setting aside the district court's order requir\u00ad ing EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson to personally appear and be subject to examination by the court. In December 2010, following months of briefing, the court held a hearing on, among other things, EPA's compliance with the April 2010 order and the pending reconsideration mo\u00ad tion. In April 2011, the court granted EPA's re consideration motion in full and resoundingly endorsed EPA's views as to the appropriate admi nistrative approach to protecting the Ever\u00ad glades under the CWA. Last year, the Division al so successfully litigated petitions for review in the Eleventh Circuit chal\u00ad lenging EPA's September 2010 amended determi\u00ad nation. In July 2011, in South Florida Water Mgmt. Dist. v. EPA , the court of appeals granted ENRD's motion to dismiss because the amended determination was neither final for purposes of review nor the type of EPA action reviewable un\u00ad der the provisions of the CWA. Protecting Everglades Restoration Efforts from Constitutional Challenges In Mildenberger v. United States , landowners along the St. Lucie River in Florida alleged a tak\u00ad ing of their property in violation of the Fifth Amendment resulting from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' operationa l plan for Lake Okeecho\u00ad bee. Plaintiffs alleged that releases of pollutants Lake Okeechobee, covering 700 square miles, is the fourth largest lake wholly within the United States. The water body receives water from the Kissimmee River to the north and drains to the ocean through the Everglades. NASA Arial Photo defending federal prog rams | 71 and fresh water into the St. Lucie River and Estuary over time have destroyed the estuarine en\u00ad vironment and riparian rights of plaintiffs. In 2010, the court re jected plaintiffs' claims that their riparian rights had been taken, holding th at the claims were time-barred; the various ri\u00ad parian rights claimed (fishing, swimming, and boat ing) are shared by the public at large under the state's public trust doctrine and are therefore non-compensable; and even if plaintiff could assert a compensable property interest under state law, the claims would be barred by the fed\u00aderal navigational servitude. In subsequent proceedings, the court dismissed all remaining claims, including those relating to alleged noxi ous odors, mangrove tree mortality, flooding, and pollution of an irrigation well. In Septem ber 2011, the Federal Circuit affirmed the Court of Federal Claims' dismissal of all claims.

In fiscal year 2011, the Division continued to succe ssfully represent the interests of the United States in litigation involving the migration of Asian carp into the Great Lakes through the Chicago Area Waterway System. In State of Michigan v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs , the States of Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Ohio filed su it against the Corps, alle ging that the Corps had created a public nuisance by operating structures around Chicago in such a way as to allow Asian carp to enter Lake Michigan. They moved for a pr eliminary injunction, which the district court in Illinois denied. In August 2011, in the case of Michigan v. Corps of Eng'rs , the Seventh Circuit af\u00ad firmed the denial of a preliminary injunction. The appellate court held that the injunctive relief sought would only marginally decrease the likelihood of harm during the pendency of the litigation while imposing great costs on the government and th e public. It concluded that any effort by the courts to intervene in the ongoing extensive interage ncy effort to stop the invasion of carp was un\u00ad necessary and might do more harm than good gi ven the relative competency of the branches. 72 | defending federal programs Protecting U.S. Waters Against Invasive Speci es Carried in Vessels' Ballast Water Marine vessels traveling in commerce in the United States can pose a threat to the waters in which they travel when they discharge ballast water laden with foreign organisms. EPA has promulgated a general permit under the CWA specifying procedures designed to reduce the threats posed by such ballast water discharges. In July 2011, in the case of Lake Carriers Ass'n v. EPA , the D.C. Circuit upheld EPA's regulations ag ainst challenges brought by representatives of the shipping industry who contended that the permit was too burdensome because it re\u00ad quired compliance with all states' water qualit y certification conditions. The court rejected these arguments, holding that petitioners had fail ed to establish that EPA may alter or reject state certification conditions. Defending EPA's Regulation of Hazardous Ai r Pollutants Emitted by Medical Waste Incinerators In Medical Waste Inst. v. EPA , a trade group representing the hospital waste industry chal\u00ad lenged EPA's CAA standards governing the emission s of hazardous pollutants that result from the incineration of hospital, medi cal, and infectious wastes. In June 2011, the D.C. Circuit up\u00ad held EPA's determination to cons ider up-to-date data in revisi ng these standards following a prior remand and rejected as unti mely petitioners' challenges to EPA's approach of setting haz\u00ad ardous air pollutant standards on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis. Ensuring Timely Implementation of Air Quality Standards for Sulfur Dioxide In National Environmental Dev. Coun cil's Clean Air Project v. EPA , petitioners sought to stay implementation of EPA's more stringent air qual ity standards for SO2 pending judicial review. We opposed, and in April 2011 the D.C. Circuit entered an order denying the stay motion, thus ensuring that the protections afforded by the new standards would be implemented as sched\u00aduled. Defending the Animal and Plant Health In spection Service's Biotechnology Program The Animal and Plant Health Insp ection Service (APHIS) of the Department of Agriculture regulates the nation's use and intro\u00adduction of genetically engineered cr ops. In fiscal year 2011, the Division continued its defense of APHIS's biotechnology regula\u00ad tory program with respect to seve ral genetically engineered crops. Sugar beets comprise about one-ha lf of the current domestic re\u00ad fined sugar supply, and geneticall y modified sugar beets make up 95% of all sugar beets planted. Several ENRD's cases involved \"Roundup Ready\" sugar beets (RRSB): APHIS Image defending federal prog rams | 73 Eucalyptus Tree USDA Image \u2014 In February 2011, in the case of Center for Food Safety v. Vilsack , the Ninth Circuit re\u00ad versed a district court's preliminary injunction entered against APHIS. In 2005, APHIS de\u00ad regulated genetically engineered RRSB under the Plant Protection Act. Its decision was accom\u00ad panied by an Environmental Assessment (EA). After plaintiffs filed suit challenging the EA, the district court vacated the deregulation decision and remanded for preparation of an Envi\u00ad ronmental Impact Statement (EIS). Pending its issuance of the EIS, APHIS issued four per\u00ad mits allowing seed companies to grow RRSB \"ste cklings\" (seedlings), which could be used to grow the seed crop if APHIS granted additional regulatory approvals that were the subject of the EIS review. Plaintiffs, a public interest group and organic farmers, sued to enjoin the in\u00ad terim authorizations. The district court grante d a preliminary injunction requiring destruction of the stecklings. In reversing, the Ninth Circui t held that growth of the stecklings posed a neg\u00ad ligible risk of genetic contamination, as the juve nile plants are biological ly incapable of flower\u00ad ing or cross-pollinating before the permits expire d. The court found the district court improp\u00ad erly relied on alleged past incidents of contamin ation by genetically engineered plants to find present harm. The court noted that APHIS's permits \"follow the . . . blueprint\" the Supreme Court set forth in Monsanto v. Geertson Seed Farms for a limited authorization of a genetically engineered crop pending completion of an EIS. Once the permits expired, ENRD subsequently obtained a dismissal on mootness grounds from th e district court. The favorable outcome al\u00ad lowed the planting of up to 526 acres of RRSB seed crop in the fall of 2011. \u2014 In Grant v. Vilsack and Center for Food Safety v. Vilsack , ENRD defended APHIS from litigation brought by industry groups and enviro nmental groups against its interim decision to partially deregulate RRSB root crop production and to permit planting of RRSB seed crop sub\u00ad ject to mandatory conditions whil e it prepares the EIS regarding full deregulation of RRSB. A decision from the court is expected in the se cond or third quarter of fiscal year 2012. Additionally, in Center for Biological Diversity v. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service , the Division successfully manage d a challenge to APHIS's approval of permits that authorize Eucalyptus species are among the fastes t growing woody plants in the world and represent about 8% of all planted fore sts. While there are over 700 eucalyptus species identified, only a limited number are grown commercially. Eucalyptus is a preferred fiber sour ce for the global pulp and paper industry. It is hoped that genetically engineered (GE) cold tolerant eucalyptus will allow production of this hardwood species for pulping and for biofuel applications in managed plantation forests in the southeastern United States. \u2014APHIS Fact Sheet 74 | defending federal programs th e planting and flowering of a genetically modified hybrid of eucalyptus tree in seven states in Genetically Engineered Eucalyptus the southeastern United States. The permits authorized field trials of a variety of eucalyptus that is designed to reduce fertility, enhance th e ability to occasionally withstand cold tempera\u00ad tures, and increase efficiency for producing pulp and paper. Plaintiffs brought claims under NEPA, ESA, and the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. The Division obtained a dis\u00ad missal of certain claims on jurisdictional grou nds and succeeded on the merits of the remain\u00ad ing NEPA claims. Clarifying the Jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims In United States v. Tohono O'odham Nation , the Supreme Court held that long-established statutory law precludes the Court of Federal Claims from hearing \"any claim for or in respect to which the plaintiff . . . has pending in any other co urt.\" Following the issuance of that decision, we concluded that the Court of Federal Claims la cks jurisdiction to hear claims in several pend\u00ad ing Fifth Amendment takings cases. As a result of motions filed by ENRD, the United States was able to gain dismissals of taking s claims in three significant cases: Central Pines Land Co. v. United States , seeking more than $150 million for the alleged taking of oil and gas rights on federal lands in Louisiana; Brandt v. United States , involving the alleged taking of an interest in an abandoned railroad right-of-way in Wyoming; and Stockton East Water Dist. v. United States , seeking $500 million for an alleged taking based on the alleged failure by Reclamation to deliver water to several California water dist ricts. Motions to dismiss several other signifi\u00ad cant cases remain pending. Ensuring the Continued Vitality of the Rails-to-Trails Program The Division continues to defend thousands of Fifth Amendment takings claims brought by landowners who allege that the National Trails S ystem Act deprives them of reversionary rights in abandoned railroad rights-of-way. While the defense of these cases presents numerous legal challenges and requires significant resources, we have been able to narrow the claims in many of the cases, resulting in a saving s of millions of dollars to the publ ic fisc. These cases include: Thompson v. United States (granting partial summary judgment to the United States for Michigan properties); Gregory v. United States (granting partial summ ary judgment to the United States for Mi ssissippi properties); Farmers Co-op Co. v. United States (limiting tempo\u00ad ral scope of federal liability for Kansas properties); Whispell Foreign Cars, Inc. v. United States (granting partial summary judgment to the United States for Florida properties); Macy Elevator, Inc. v. United States (granting partial summary judgment to the United States for Indiana properties); and Rasmuson v. United States (denying plaintiffs' motion to certify a class of Iowa property owners). Acquiring Property for Public Purposes The Division exercises the federal government's power of eminent domain to enable agencies to acquire land for public purposes ranging from es tablishing national parks to building federal courthouses to protecting the nation's borders. These actions secure the Fifth Amendment defending federal prog rams | 75 Incline Lake, Nevadaguarantee of just compensation in amounts that ar e fair to property owners and to taxpayers. Examples of this type of action in fisc al year 2011 include the following cases: \u2014 Last year saw a successful conclusion to the protracted eminent domain action, United States v. 753.95 Acres in Washoe County, Nevada, and Incline Lake Corp . This action was filed at the request of the Forest Service under authority of the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act, which makes funds generated by disposal of public lands in the Las Vegas Val\u00adley available for purchase of environmentally sensitive land. In May 2008, the Forest Service and landowner Incline Lake Corporation (ILC) agreed to federal acquis ition of these 753.95 acres, with the purchase price to be set by a fed\u00ad eral court. Estimated just compensation of $46,000,000 was deposited in the district court in Nevada by the United States at the outset of litigation. ILC sought a valuation of at least $74,450,000. After lengthy discovery and pre\u00adtrial motions, the parties arrived at a settlement amount of $43,500,000. The settlement resulted in repayment by ILC to the United States of the $2,500,000 difference between the init ial deposit and the settlement amount. \u2014 In the case of United States v. 1.604 Acres of Land Situate in the City of Norfolk, Common - wealth of Virginia, and 515 Granby, L.L.C. , the Division sought to acquire land on behalf of the General Services Administrati on for construction of an an nex to the Walter E. Hoffman U.S. Courthouse in Norfolk, Virginia. The site had been slated to house a $180,000,000 condominium project; however, construction halted in 2007 as a result of financial difficulties. The landowner was seeking more than $36,000,000 in just compensation for the property but, following a series of successful pre-trial motion s and an effective trial presentation, the jury Walter E. Hoffman Courthouse, Norfolk, Virginia GSA Photo 76 | defending federal programs ultimately awarded just compensation in the amount of $13,401,741. United States v. 15,478 Square Feet of Land Situate in the City of Norfolk, Commonwealth of Virginia, and Balaji Sai, L.L.C. , is a companion case for the same project. The parties engaged in court-ordered media\u00ad tion in June 2011, and reached a favorable $1,667,000 settlement. Flight 93 Memorial Design Plan NPS Image \u2014 United States v. 275.81 Acres of Land in Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania and Svonavec, Inc., is a condemna\u00ad tion action on behalf of the National Park Serv ice for construc\u00ad tion of the Flight 93 National Memorial. The memorial site includes approximately 275 acres containing a museum, observation area, and memorial. The United States' designated trial appraiser values the property at $600,000. Defendant's appraiser originally estimated just compensation at $30,895,000 ($23,300,000 for land value and $7,595,000 for oil and gas rights), but in the course of discovery defendant agreed to stipulate to a reduced oil and gas value of $105,000. This matter will likely be scheduled for trial in 2012. \u2014 Th e condemnation action United States of America v. 7.85 Acres of Land, More or Less, Located in Prince William County, Commonwealth of Virginia , was filed on behalf of the Na\u00ad tional Park Service in January 2011. We sought to acquire on e of the last remaining private landholdings within the boundaries of Prince Wi lliam Forest Park on be half of the National Park Service. The Service had attempted to nego tiate acquisition of this property for nearly a decade, but was unsuccessful because ownershi p was divided among dozens of descendants and heirs of the last record owner, who died near ly 50 years ago. Taking this action allowed the transfer of title from and payment of just compensation to the many landowners. Prince William Forest Park, established in the 1940s, protects the largest piedmont forest in the na\u00ad tional park system and the largest green space in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region. The district court in Virginia awarded just compensation of $190,000, the amount for which the Division presented evidentiary support at trial. NPS Map and Photo In fiscal year 2011, ENRD also conducted title reviews for client agencies able to negotiate property purchases without the need for the Divisi on to file condemnation actions. Examples include the acquisition by the General Services Administration of a warehouse in Sterling, Vir\u00ad ginia, for use by the Department of State for a consideration of $9,700,000; by the Indian Health Service of 18.77 acres of land located in Sage, Riverside County, California, for construc\u00ad tion of a residential rehabilitation treatment center serving 96 American Indian/Alaska Native youth annually for a consideration of $850,000; and by the U.S. Department of Veterans Af\u00ad fairs of 12 city blocks in New Orleans, Louisian a, as the site of the new $1 billion VA Medical Center to replace the facility damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Working with the United States Congress on Environmental and Natural Resources Legislation and Related Matters Through the Department's Office of Legislative A ffairs, the Division responds to relevant legis\u00ad lative proposals and congressio nal requests, prepares for appearances of Division witnesses before congressional committees, and drafts legislative proposals, including proposals imple\u00ad menting settlements of Division litigation. One ex ample of this work from last year is the Divi\u00ad sion's continuing support for the development of legislation to clarify the Oil Pollution Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and other federal statutes to prevent future oil spills from deepwater petroleum exploration and production, ensure that responsible parties are held ac\u00ad countable for spills, assure that adequate plans and resources are in place to mitigate the ad\u00ad verse environmental impacts from such events, and improve the administration of federal min\u00ad eral and energy resources. Enforcing Environmental Law Through International Capacity Building The Division implements an active and varied pr ogram of international ac tivities, often in col\u00ad laboration with partners from other federal ag encies, to support important Administration and Department objectives. \u2014 We suc cessfully prosecute transnational enviro nmental and natural resource crimes that involve foreign evidence or foreign assistance, or that rely on the violation of underlying for\u00ad eign statutes. \u2014 We provide critical training for law enforcemen t partners in other countries to ensure that they may work effectively with us in investig ating and prosecuting transnational environmental crimes. \u2014 We participate in the development and impl ementation of trade and investment agree\u00ad ments, treaties, international environmental agreements, and domestic implementing legisla\u00ad tion in order to ensure that they protect and promote effective environmental enforcement. \u2014 We also help to develop and facilitate inte rnational partnerships and networks that pro\u00ad mote effective prosecution of transnational environmental crimes. defending federal prog rams | 79 To carry out these objectives, in fiscal year 2011 ENRD spoke at conferences and workshops, provided training, and met with law enforcement counterparts in Brazil, Chile, China, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, and Russia, as well as in the United States. The Division continued to spea k at conferences and workshops internationally and domesti\u00ad cally in order to disseminate information about the 2008 amendments to the Lacey Act, which added enforcement tools to combat international trafficking in illegally harvested timber and wood products made from such timber. For example, ENRD worked with the Department's Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance , and Training Program to organize a work\u00ad shop on the Lacey Act and prosecution of illegal logging crimes at the Ru ssian Ministry of Jus\u00ad tice Legal Academy in Khabarovsk, Russia. The workshop was attended by representatives of the Russian Ministry of Justice, regional and local prosecutors, regional police, and the Rus- Lacey Act Plant Protection Provisions Added by the Food, Conservati on, and Energy Act of 2008 The Lacey Act now makes it unlawful to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any plan t, with some limited exceptions, taken in violation of the laws of a U.S. state, or any foreign law that protects plants. The Lacey Act also makes it unlawful to make or s ubmit any false record, account or label for, or any false identification of, any plant. The definition of the term \"plant \" includes \"any wild member of the plant kingdom, including roots, seeds, parts, and products thereof, and including trees from either natural or planted forest stands.\" The definition contains certain exceptions, including for common cultivars and common food crops. The Lacey Act also requires an import declarati on for plants and plant products, except for plant- based packaging materials used exclusively to import ot her products. Importers must file a declaration upon importation that contains the sci entific name of the plant, the value of the importation, the quantity of the plant, and the name of the country from which the plant was taken. Enforcement of the declaration require ment is currently being phased in. Anyone who imports into the United States, or expor ts out of the United St ates, illegally harvested plants or products made from illegally harvested pl ants, including timber, as well as anyone who exports, transports, sells, receives, acquires or pur chases such products in the United States, may be prosecuted. \u2014USDA Fact Sheet 80 | defending federal programs sian Federal Forestry Agency. The Division al so spoke about the Lacey Act at four workshops in China funded by the U.S. Agency for Inte rnational Development fo r government officials and representatives of the wood products industry . We also have been provided funding by the State Department and U.S. Agen cy for International Developm ent to implement multi-year programs in Brazil, Russia, Peru, and Honduras to provide training on the Lacey Act and com\u00ad bating illegal logging. We participated in negotiations led by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative of the envi\u00ad ronment chapter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Agreement with eight Asian and South American countries. The Division attended and supported the U.S. delegation at meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. And ENRD, with colleagues from EPA, began a program to provide training to judges in Chile on adjudicating environ\u00ad mental enforcement cases. Protecting the Interests of the United Stat es in Litigation Involving Third Parties At times, ENRD participates as amicus curiae in cases in which the United States is not a party in order to protect the interests of the United States and its component agencies. We filed briefs in a number of such proceedings in fisc al year 2011. An example is the case of Morrison Enterprises, L.L.C. v. Dravo Corp. In that case, the Eighth Circ uit issued a decision interpret\u00ad ing a key provision of CERCLA as ad vocated by the United States. In United States v. Atlantic Research , the Supreme Court held that a potentially liable private party who has voluntarily cleaned up hazardous substances at a site can se ek to recover the costs of response from other potentially liable parties through an action un der section 107 of CERCLA. The Supreme Court decision did not address whether a potentially liable party that wa s compelled to clean up a site under an administrative settlement or consent decree, and thus may seek contribution under the plain language of CERCLA section 113, also may seek to recover co sts under section 107. Following the Supreme Court's decision, the Division filed numerous amicus briefs on behalf of EPA in district courts and courts of appeals ar guing that such parties cannot seek to recover costs under section 107. The underlying concern is avoiding an interpre tation of CERCLA that would undermine the contribution protection that CERCLA provides to parties that reach set\u00ad tlements with the federal government to resolve their liability for cleani ng up hazardous waste sites. In Morrison , the Eighth Circuit held, consiste nt with its prior decision in Atlantic Re- search (before the case reached the Supreme Court) and arguments made by ENRD in its amicus brief, that CERCLA section 113 provid es the exclusive remedy for a party who incurs response costs under an administrative settlem ent or consent decree. The Second and Third Circuits, and many district courts, have now in terpreted this CERCLA provision as the United States construes it. Other important cases in which the Di vision filed amicus briefs include PPL Montana, L.L.C. v. State of Montana (a U.S. Supreme Court case addressing the question of whether the Montana Supreme Court erred in concluding that riverbed s occupied by hydroelect ric facilities are the defending federal prog rams | 81 property of the State of Montana because they were navigable for title purposes at the time Montana became a state) and Northwest Environmental Defense Center v. Brown (a Ninth Circuit case involving EPA regulations addressing what silvicultural activities are subject to CWA National Pollutant Discharge Eliminat ion System permitting requirements). The Division also conducts the Department's review of citize n-suit complaints and consent judgments under the CAA and CWA. Those statutes contain provisions allowing citizens to file suit for violations of those stat utes, and require that citizen-suit complaints and consent judg\u00ad ments be served on the Departme nt and EPA. When served with complaints, we offer our as\u00ad sistance to counsel for the parties, and we revi ew all consent judgments to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the relevant st atute and are consistent with the statute's pur\u00ad poses. The case of State of New York v. ExxonMobil is illustrative. In concert with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, we reviewed and negotiated amend\u00ad ments to a proposed consent decree in a suit filed by the State of New York under state and fed\u00ad eral law (including the citizen-suit provisions of RCRA and the CWA) for civil penalties and natural resource damages arising ou t of an oil spill at Exxon's oil refining and storage facilities in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Under the terms of th e consent decree, Exxon agreed to pay over $6 million to the State of New York for damages and pe nalties, as well as $19.5 million to fund en\u00ad vironmental benefit projects. After identifying several aspects of the proposed consent decree that were cause for concern for EPA and the federal natural resour ce trustees, we worked with the parties to develop amendments that would addr ess those areas of concern. Plaintiffs ulti\u00ad mately lodged a revised proposed consent decree, and after the United States filed its com\u00adments, the court entered the decree in March 2011. 82 | defending federal programs Greenpoint Site defending federal prog rams | 83 The Environment and Natural Resources Division makes a unique and important contribution to national security while ensuring robust co mpliance with the country's environmental and natural resources laws. Increasingly, the Divisi on is responsible for defending agency actions that support the security of the United States, including actions to expand the domestic energy portfolio to a broad range of energy sources and reduce the nation's dependence on fossil fuel. Facilitating Military Modernization Plans Two years ago, the Division facilitated interagency discussions under the direction of an Inter- agency Policy Committee chaired by the White House Council on Environmental Quality and the National Security Council to address legal, policy, and environmental concerns associated with three critical military redevelopment pr ojects that will affect Guam and the Common\u00ad wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Covered actions include the relocation of U.S. Marines Corps troops and facilities presently stat ioned on Okinawa, Japan; construction of a deep-draft wharf with shoreside facilities for berthing a U.S. Navy transient nuclear-powered aircraft carrier; and establishment of a U.S. Army Air and Missile Defense Task Force. In September 2010, the Department of Defense signed a Record of Decision concerning the three projects, thus marking the successful conclusi on of the federal interagency problem-solving process. As part of the decision-making proces s, EPA ultimately concluded that the final Envi\u00ad ronmental Impact Statement prepared by the Defense Department, with our assistance, con\u00adtains an adequate discussion of the environmental impacts of the projects and proposes a miti\u00adgation plan that, if successfully implemented, will avoid unsatisf actory public health and envi\u00ad ronmental impacts. This will allow the Defense Department to move forward with the projects in a way that will promote the United States' long-term strategic interests and benefit the com\u00ad munity at large. Subsequently, in fiscal year 2011, the Di vision successfully defended a lawsuit, Guam Preserva - tion Trust v. Gregory, brought by a coalition of historic preservation groups and local commu\u00ad nity organizations asserting claims against the Navy under the National Historic Preservation Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, and NEPA . Plaintiffs challenged the Navy's selection 84 | promoting national secu rity and military preparedness of the Pagat Point area, which has cultural sign ificance to the indigenous Chamorro people, for Marine Corps training and firing ranges as part of the Department of Defense's relocation of troops to Guam from Okinawa. The district co urt agreed with the Navy's argument that the litigation should be dismissed as moot based on the Navy's decision to prepare additional NEPA documentation before making a site-specific selection for the training ranges. Defending the Department of Energy's Programs, Research, and Prerogatives Los Alamos Study Group v. U.S. Dep't of Energy was a case brought by an anti-nuclear advo\u00ad cacy group that alleged the Department of Ener gy and the National Nuclear Security Admini\u00ad stration (NNSA) violated NEPA by failing to prepare a \"new\" Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for changes in design for construction of the multi-billion dollar Chemistry and Metal\u00ad lurgy Research Replacement Nuclear Facility (C MRR-NF) at the Los Alamos National Labora\u00ad tory in New Mexico. The CMRR-NF is a key component of the nation's security infrastructure and efforts to ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal in the 21st century. As we had argued, the district court dismissed the case un der the doctrine of prudential mootness due to NNSA's initiation of a supplemental EIS process. In the alternative, the court found that ripe\u00adness was an equally valid ground for dismissal because the NEPA process is not yet complete. \"New facilities, such as the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement building . . ., along with materials consolidation, means that the nation's special nuclear materials inventory can be protected to meet the security challe nges of the 21st century.\" \u2014Los Alamos National Laboratory Radiological Laboratory/Utility/Office Building, Chem istry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Project Los Alamos National Laboratory Image Furthering the Administration' s Renewable Energy Agenda One component of the Administration's efforts to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil is expansion of cleaner domestic sources of energy in the form of wind and solar power and renewable fuels. The Division is actively defend ing challenges to permits and rights of way is\u00ad sued by BLM to promote the development of re newable energy projects on western public promoting national security and mi litary preparedness | 85 lands. We successfully defeated motions for temporary restraining orde rs and/or preliminary injunctions for the Ivanpah Solar Project, Blythe Solar Project, and Sunrise Powerlink trans\u00ad mission project in California. The Divisi on also successfully opposed efforts in Western Water- sheds Project v. BLM to preliminarily enjoin the Spring Va lley Wind Project located in Nevada. This represented the first decision on a wind en ergy project sited on federal land. The court concluded that the public has a strong interest in this project because \"Congress and the Presi\u00ad dent have clearly articula ted that clean energy is a necessary part of America's future and it is important to Nevada's economic and clean energy goals.\" Finall y, we are working closely with BLM to defend the permit issued for the Cape Wi nd Project, America's first offshore wind project.

In December 2010, the D.C. Circuit found not only that EPA acted reasonably in com\u00ad bining the 2009 and 2010 quantities in the 2010 regulation, but also that the regulation was not impermissibly retroactive. In November 20 11, the Supreme Court declined to grant a peti\u00ad tion for writ of certiorari in the case. Defending Dredging Projects Necessary for National Defense and Economic Vitality In Phippsburg Shellfish Conservation Comm'n v. Army Corps of Eng'rs , the Division success\u00ad fully defended against a challenge to a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dredging project that was critical to the delivery of the U.S.S. Spruance , a billion-dollar guided missile destroyer, from the Bath Iron Works in Kennebec, Maine, to the possession of the United States Navy. Delay in the delivery of the destroyer would have had a ripple effect on training and assignments for multiple ships implicating military training readiness. In July 20 11, the district court issued an promoting national secu rity and military prepar edness | 87 order denying plaintiffs' motion fo r a preliminary injunction. In ruling in favor of the Corps, the court gave particular attention to balancin g the potential for environmental harm with the public's strong interest in national defense and in the continued economic vitality of the Bath Iron Works. Plaintiffs subsequent ly dismissed their case voluntarily after the dredging occurred. U.S.S. Spruance Navy Photo Supporting the Strategic Border Initiative and Securing the Nation's Borders In 2007, Congress mandated construction of fencing and related infrastructure at multiple points along the United States-Mexico border in order to enhance domestic security by curtail\u00ading smuggling, drug trafficking, and illegal immi gration. The Division is working closely with local U.S. Attorneys' Offices, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Corps to facilitate land acquisitions necessary for the construction of 225 miles of fencin g (the Strategic Border Initiative). This has required acquisition by eminent domain of nearly 400 land parcels in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California and extensive work to obtain timely possession for construction purposes and to address widespread title and survey issues. The Division has helped resolve 160 cases (most from fiscal year 2009 forward), and has trials scheduled next year on four of the most prec edent-setting cases with valuatio n disputes of more than $100 million. In fiscal year 2011, for exampl e, we brought to a successful conclusion United States v. 88 | promoting national secu rity and military preparedness View of 6.09 Acres of Land Situated in Cameron County, Texas 6.09 Acres of Land Situated in Cameron County, Texas, and Rollins M. Koppel, Trustee , a condemnation action filed in Texas on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security. The landowner's appraisers opined a value of over $13,500,000; the parties reached an agreed set\u00ad tlement of $4,995,000. The Division also filed over a dozen cases, on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security and the General Services Administration, on an expedited basis, for the modernization and ex\u00ad pansion of various land ports of entry in Main e, New York, Texas, and Washington. Virtually all of these cases have been resolved, and on terms favorable to the United States. Acquiring Additional Property to Improve Military Preparedness and National Security We also acquire lands or review title to lands needed to fulfill other critical military and home\u00adland security functions. The following cases illustrate this work in fiscal year 2011: \u2014 In United States v. 2,560 Acres of Land in Im perial County, California, and Donald Craw- ford , the Division filed a condemnation on behalf of the U.S. Navy to acquire privately owned land located within El Centro Naval Air Facility. The Navy had previously leased this property, promoting national security and military prepar edness | 89 El Cwhich contains portions of a strafing range and the main target for air-to\u00ad ground bombing practice at the facility. The United States condemned fee title in September 2011, deposi ting estimated just compensation of $1,280,000. Trial is ex\u00ad pected in late 2012 or early 2013. \u2014 In February 2011, the United States deposited estimated just compensation of $4,363,000 in the case of United States v. 1,136.526 Acres of Land, in Goliad County, Texas . This is a condemnation action on behalf of the Department of Defense fo r acquisition of an air\u00ad strip to be used in Navy training. entro Naval Air Facility Navy Photo \u2014 Th e Division issued a preliminary title opinio n for the Department of Homeland Security acquisition by donation from the State of Kans as of 45.84 acres and 6 appurtenant easements located in Manhattan, Kansas. This will be th e site of a new $450,000,000 National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility. \u2014 We also issued a preliminary opinion of title for a joint U.S. Air Force/Trust for Public Land acquisition of a conservation easement adjacent to Beale Air Force base in Yuba County, Cali\u00ad fornia, for consideration of $1,593,681. The ac quisition is occurring under a federal program that protects military operations from encroaching development. \u2014 Finally, ENRD issued another pr eliminary title opinion for 16 .840 acres located in Glynn County, Georgia. This land is to be acquired for development of an addition to the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Camp Beale opened in October 1942, as a training site for the 13th Armored and the 81st and 96th Infantry Divisions.

In connection with the third Tribal Nations Conference sponsored by th e White House in 2011, Pr esident Obama stated: \"I believe we are seeing a turning point in the re lationship between our nations, and I promise to do everything I can to fi ght for a brighter future for First Americans and all Americans.\" Attorney General Holder has reaffirmed the Department of Justice's commitment to \"building and sustaining healthy and safe na\u00ad tive communities; renewing our nation's enduring promise to American Indians and Alaska Natives; and respecting the sovereignty and self- determination of tribal governments.\" Vigilant protection of tribal sover\u00ad eignty, tribal lands and resources, and tr ibal treaty rights is at the heart of ENRD's core mission and is a top priority for us. ENRD's work related to Indian tribes and their members is multi-faceted: \u2014 Tod ay, the United States holds almo st 60 million acres of land in trust for federally recognized tribes and individual tribal members. The Department of the Interior and ENRD, working with federally recog\u00ad nized tribes, seek to protect these lands and associated resources from trespass, impairment, and encumbrance. \u2014 The Division brings suits on behalf of the United States to protect tribal rights and resources. The rights and resources at issue in our cases are tribal water rights, the abil\u00ad ity to acquire reservation land, and treaty-protected hunting and fishing rights, among others. \u2014 The Division also defends against challenges to statutes and federal agency actions de\u00ad signed to protect tribal interests. \u2014 We bring cases to address environmental contamination affecting Indian tribes. Many tribal communities may be disproportionately affe cted by pollution of the air, water, and land, including the effects of climat e change. This also raises environmental justice issues. President Obama, White House Tribal Nations Conference, Washington D.C. December 2010 White House Photo 92 | protecting Indian resources \u2014 In addition, the D epartment of Justice defends claims asserted by Indian tribes against the United States on grounds that the United States has not properly managed the tribes' monetary and natural resources held in trust by the United States. Indian tribes also may be parties to cases challenging the actions of fede ral resource management agencies. I n fiscal year 2011, we continue d our efforts to ensure that this work is conducted in the most effective manner, and with careful consideratio n of the government-to-government relation\u00ad ship between the United States and federally recognized tribes. We have achieved significant successes. In particular: \u2014 ENRD h as increased outreach to tribal leader s and communities to better understand their concerns, and we are working more closely with them in carrying out our important tribal re\u00ad sponsibilities. \u2014 The Division is actively engaged with the Department of the Interior and tribes in identify\u00ad ing, developing, and prosecuting affirmative case s (including through amicus participation) in multiple areas, including tribal water rights, reservation boundari es, and tribal jurisdiction and sovereignty. We also are taking steps to address uncertainty re garding Interior's trust acquisi\u00ad tion authority created by recent Supreme Court case law. \u2014 With other responsible federal agencies, ENRD is exploring ways to improve environmental compliance in and around Indian Country. \u2014 With the Departments of the Interior and the Treasury, we are explor ing opportunities for resolution of tribal trust cases in an expedited, fair, and just manner, and have successfully re\u00ad solved cases. The Division has developed and is implementing expedite d settlement processes in tribal trust litigation. Th e remainder of this chapter describes specific ENRD activities in each of these areas. Working Closely with Tribal Leaders and Communities In the past year, ENRD senior management tr aveled around the country--from Arizona to Alaska, and from Montana to South Dakota--to meet with tribal leaders, visit tribal lands, and hear about and see first-hand their unique en vironmental and natural resources challenges, including the effects of climate change on tribal lands and fishing grounds, and increased pres\u00ad sures for development on sacr ed sites. For example: \u2014 In September 2011, Assistant At torney General Moreno and U.S. Attorney Michael Cotter attended the North Dakota United States Attorney's Office's Environmental Enforcement Training Conference in Bismarck, North Dakota. At this conference, Assistant Attorney Gen\u00ad eral Moreno and U.S. Attorney Timothy Purdon, along with representatives from EPA, pro\u00ad vided training on environmental enforcement actions to federal, state, local and tribal law en\u00ad forcement officers, and environmental investigators. protecting Indian resources | 93 Attorney General Eric Holder, U. S. Attorney for South Dakota Brendan Johnson, President of the Oglala Sioux Tribe John Yellow Bird Steele, U.S. Attorn ey for Oregon Dwight Holton, and Assistant Attorney General Ignacia S. Moreno in South Dakota \u2014 In July 2011, the Department held the Joint Native American Issues Subcommit\u00ad tee and Attorney General's Advisory Com\u00ad mittee meeting in South Dakota, and tribes from that state discussed their public safety, environmental, and other concerns with the Department's senior leadership. \u2014 In April 2011, Assistant Attorney Gen\u00ad eral Moreno, ENRD senior staff, and U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke met with Navajo Nation officials to discuss environmental and natural resource issues of concern to that tribe. \u2014 In February 2011, Assistant Attorney General Moreno and ENRD staff joined U.S. Attorney Michael Cotter and Montana Attorney General Steve Bullock in Helena, Montana, to attend the Joint Environmental Enforcement Training. Representatives from EPA, the Mo ntana Department of Environmental Quality, ENRD's Environmental Crimes Section, and the Montana U.S. Attorney's Office provided training on environmental enforcement actions to state, local, and tribal law enforcement offi\u00ad cers, and environmental inspectors and regulators. \u2014 In December 2011, Assistant Attorney General Moreno and senior ENRD staff participated in the third White House Tribal Nations Conference. Representatives from every federally rec\u00ad ognized tribe were invited to attend the meeting. Assistant Attorney General Moreno was part of a panel that discussed tribal land, cultural resources and awareness, natural resources, and numerous other issues. Colorado River Supporting Tribal Recognition and Sovereignty Indian T ribes The Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT) include four tribes:The Division has continued its the Mohave, Chemehuevi, Hopi, and Navajo. longstanding efforts to support The CRIT Reservation was created in 1865 by the federal tribal jurisdiction and sovereignty. government for \"Indians of the Colorado River and its For example, in Water Wheel tributaries,\" originally for the Mohave and Chemehuevi, who Camp Recreation Area, Inc. v. had inhabited the area for centur ies.

After CRIT obtained an eviction order and monetary judgment in tribal court against the company and its principal owner, both filed an action in federal district court arguing that the tribal court lacked jurisdiction. While the district cour t found that the tribal court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the tribe's claims only as to the comp any, the Ninth Circuit held that the tribal court had jurisdiction as to the claims against both th e company and its owner. Consistent with the argument made by the Division, the Ninth Circui t concluded that the trib e's authority to regu\u00ad late non-member use of tribal land is an inhe rent part of its power to exclude and that the tribe's adjudicatory authority was coextensive with its regulatory authority over the land. Preserving the Culture and Religion of Federally Recognized Indian Tribes While bald and golden eagles are protected under federal law, such birds also are important to the religious and cultural life of many Indian tribes. The United States has a strong interest both in protecting eagles and in ensuring that members of federa lly recognized tribes can prac\u00ad tice their religion to the greatest extent possible. The Division works closely with FWS to balance these competing interests by defending the rights of feder\u00adally recognized tribes and their members to have exclusive access to feathers for religious purposes and by prosecuting anyone (Indians and non-Indians alike) who illegally kills or trades in eagles or eagle parts. Golden Eagle USFWS Photo Bald Eagle USFWS Photo An important example of this defensive work is United States v. Wilgus , a case in which ENRD secured a favorable outcome after over ten years of litigation in trial and appellate courts. The United States charged Wilgus, a practitioner of the Native American religion who is not a mem\u00ad ber of a federally recognized tribe, with unlawful possession of 141 eagle feathers in violation of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (the Eagle Act). The district court dismissed the charges, holding that the Eagle Act's prohibition against possessing eagle feathers violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Ac t (RFRA). The RFRA prohibits the federal government from substantially burdening the religious freedom of individuals unless it does so to support a com\u00ad pelling government interest thro ugh the least restrictive means. In March 2011, the Tenth Cir\u00ad cuit reversed, joining the Ninth and Eleventh Ci rcuits in upholding against RFRA claims the Eagle Act and its implementing regulations, wh ich permit only member s of federally recog\u00ad nized tribes to possess and use eagle feathers fo r religious purposes. The Tenth Circuit's deci\u00ad sion clarified the contours of the government's compelling interest in preserving Native Ameri\u00adcan culture and religion, holding that such intere st relates specifically to federally recognized protecting Indian resources | 95 Indian tribes. The court held that the current regulatory scheme both furthers the govern\u00ad ment's compelling interest in protecting eagles and furthers its compelling interest in preserv\u00ad ing tribal religion, by \"do[ing] its best to guarantee that those tribes, which share a unique and constitutionally-protected relati onship with the federal governme nt, will receive as much of a very scarce resource (eagle feathers and parts) as possible.\" The Tenth Circuit found the cur\u00ad rent regulatory scheme to be the least restri ctive means by which the government could pro\u00ad mote these compelling but so mewhat competing interests. Defending Tribal and Federal Interests in Water Adjudications The Division continues to assert water rights claims for the benefit of federally recognized Indian tribes and their members in 29 com\u00ad\"T his Administration's support for four water rights settlements in a single plex water rights adjudications in nearly every Congress is unprecedented.

These settlements include the Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement, the Aamodt Litiga\u00ad tion Settlement Act, and the Navajo-San Juan River Basin Settlement in New Mexico; the Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement in Mon\u00ad tana; and the White Mountain Apache Tribal Settlement in Arizona. Each settlement is uniquely adapted to the needs of the tribes and non-Indians involved in the particular river basins, but they all share the common features of providing welcome resolutions of complex water rights controversies that have Five Landmark Indian Water Rights Settlements Approved by Congress in 2009-2010 Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement (New Mexico) Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act (New Mexico) Navajo-San Juan River Basin Settlement (New Mexico) Crow Tribe Water Rights Settlement (Montana) White Mountain Apache Tribal Settlement (Arizona) existed for decades and of ensuring that the tribes have access to water on their reservations. These settlements also provide certainty as to th e nature and extent of tribal water rights, and thereby promote economic development both on-reservation and in the adjacent, often rural, communities. Settlements are not possible in every case due to the exigencies of particular cases. In those situations, resolution of these complex water issu es falls to the adjudicating court or agency. The Division continues to have considerable succes s in achieving a just re solution of tribal wa\u00ad ter rights claims through adjudication. In the Klamath Basin Adjudication in Oregon, for ex\u00ad ample, the Division prevailed before a state admi nistrative law judge on its claims for the bene\u00ad fit of the Klamath Tribes. After eight years of litigation, including extensive discovery and lengthy evidentiary proceedings, the judge ruled in favor of the United States on all issues in six water rights cases, affirming sufficient water righ ts to support productive habitat for fish, wild\u00ad life, and edible plants on the Klamath Reservation in southern Oregon. Upholding Authority to Acquire Land in Trust for Tribes The Division continued to have considerable success in defending the Department of the Inte\u00adrior's authority to take land into trust for trib es. The following cases are examples of this im\u00ad portant work: \u2014 Th e Division obtained dismissals, in whole or in part, of three suits challenging the acquisi\u00ad tion in trust of land for the Sisseton and Yank ton Sioux Tribes, includin g claims that the Bu\u00ad reau of Indian Affairs has a structural bias and challenges to the constitutional authority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust. \u2014 In a case involving the Karuk Indian Tribe, th e court dismissed an action challenging DOI's decision to accept land into trust for the benefit of the tribe. The district court in California granted the Division's motion for summary judgme nt, interpreting an im portant aspect of the agency's trust land acquisit ion policy deferentially. \u2014 The Division also successfully defended the timi ng and substance of a decision to take land into trust in Glendale, Arizona, for the Tohono O'odham Nation in four lawsuits filed in the District of Columbia and Arizona. Addressing the Supreme Court's Carcieri Decision In 2009, in Carcieri v. Salazar , the Supreme Court limited Interior's trust land acquisition au\u00ad thority to those tribes that were \"under fede ral jurisdiction\" when the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted in 1934. The decision created uncertainty regarding Interior's trust acquisi\u00ad tion authority, resulting in a backlog of trust applications. The Division has worked closely with Interior to develop a new framework for decision in trust land acquisition cases. The agency is now actively addressing its backlog. protecting Indian resources | 97 Litigating the Status of Tribal Land Holdings In fiscal year 2011, we continued to defend rese rvation boundaries and the status of tribal land holdings in various cases. For example: \u2014 Th e Yankton Sioux Tribe filed an action seekin g a declaration that its reservation had not been diminished beyond the extent delineated in a 1998 Supreme Court case. The Eighth Cir\u00ad cuit held that the reservation had not been disest ablished in its entirety, but that it was dimin\u00ad ished to the extent that fee or trust lands passed out of Indian ownership. The State of South Dakota and various other parties filed petitions asking the Supreme Court to review the dises\u00ad tablishment ruling, and the Yankton Sioux Tribe filed a conditional cross-petition seeking re\u00ad view of the partial diminishment ruling. In May 2011, the United States filed a brief opposing a petition for a writ of certiorari. Critically, th e Supreme Court's denial of certiorari preserves the existence of a reservation for the tribe. \u2014 In a case of first impression, the Division secure d dismissal of a case that raised the issue of the applicability of local stormw ater management fees to Indian trust lands. The Wisconsin Oneida Tribe sued the Village of Hobart, Wisconsin, in district court seeking to prevent the vil\u00ad lage from assessing a stormwater fee on tribal trust land. The village filed a third-party com\u00ad plaint against the United States, alleging that the United States is liable for the fee. The court granted ENRD's motion to dismiss, finding that the village had failed to state a claim under the APA because it had not specifically sought payment from the United States. The lawsuit re\u00adsumed once the Department of the Interior took final agency action in October 2011 by declin\u00ad ing a request for payment. Addressing Environmental Issues Affecting Tribes The Division is working with EPA, DOI, the Depa rtment of Agriculture, and the Indian Health Service to develop a coordinated approach to en vironmental issues affecting tribes. The Divi\u00ad sion also has brought these important issues to the attention of a newly developed interagency working group on Indian law, and anticipates co ntinuing to work with this group to address tribal environmental problems that require interagency coordination. In addition, through the Department of Justice's National Indian Country Training Initiative, ENRD is developing a training program for tr ibal and federal law enforcement officials and prosecutors on enforcing environmen tal and wildlife laws that affect tribal lands. The goals of the training are to develop trib al capacity to protect its own lands and resources, strengthen tribal self-government and autonomy, and promote federal-tribal communication and partner\u00ad ship in pollution and wildlife enforcement. We are working closely with other federal agencies and with tribal partners to develop practical trai ning that will help tribal officials work with their federal counterparts to protect tribal lan ds from the effects of pollution on or off those lands. One of the themes will be the need to strike a careful balance between strong enforce\u00ad ment and the preservation of Native American cultural and religious practices. 98 | protecting Indian resources In fiscal year 2011, we continued to bring and resolve environmental enforcement actions on and adjacent to Indian reservations. The following case resolutions are illustrative: \u2014 The health of tribal residents of the Spokane Indian Reservation will be protected by the settlement reached in United States v. Newmont USA, Ltd . The mining companies in this case agreed to the cleanup of the Midnite Mine Superfund Site, located on the Spokane Indian Res\u00ad ervation in northeastern Washington.

This settle- ment . . . gives the Spokane Tribe a role in working with EPA to ensure that the cleanup protects human health and the environment on the Reservation.\" \u2014Ignacia S. Moreno United States v. Newmont USA, Inc. Press Release \u2014 In September 2011, the court entered a consent decree in United States v. Hecla, Midnite Mine Superfund Site EPA Photo Ltd., under which Hecla paid more than $260 million for CERCLA cost recovery and na tural resources damages to the United States, the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, and the State of Idaho to resolve its liability in connection with the immense Coeur d'Alene Basin Superfund Site (a lso known as the Bunker Hill Mining and Met\u00ad allurgical Complex Superfund Site) in Idaho. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe and the State of Idaho were co-plaintiffs. Sixty-million dollars of the relief goes toward natural resource damages for joint federal, state, and tribal resources; $4 million goes toward the tribe's past costs; and $2 million goes toward a state and tribal manageme nt plan for Lake Coeur d'Alene. The consent decree concludes litigation that wa s filed more than 15 years ago. Coeur d'Alene Basin The Coeur d'Alene Basin is one of the largest areas of historic mining in the worl d. Since the late 1880s, mining activities in the Upper Coeu r d'Alene Basin contributed an es timated 100 million tons of mine waste to the river system. Many of the Basin communities we re built on mine wastes . Until as late as 1968, tailings were deposited direct ly into the river. Over time, these wastes have been distributed throughout more than 160 mi les of the Coeur d'Alene and Spoka ne Rivers, lakes, and floodplains. \u2014EPA Fact Sheet protecting Indian resources | 99 100 | protecting Indian resources Defending Against Tribal and Individua l Indian Breach-of-Trust Claims The Division also is charged with representing the United States in civil litigation brought by tribes and their members against the United States , including claims that the United States has breached its trust responsibility. We strive to de fend the United States in ways that are fair to all parties and respectful of tribal sovereig nty and government-to-government relations. The Division is defending the United States and its two primarily affected agencies, the Depart\u00ad ments of the Interior and Treasury, in 72 cases pe nding in federal district courts in the District of Columbia and Oklahoma and in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (CFC) as of the end of fiscal year 2011. In these cases, 110 tribes allege that the federal government has breached its trust duties and responsibilities to them by failing to provide the tribes with historical trust account\u00ad ings and by mismanaging the tribes' trust funds and non-monetary trust assets. The tribes seek court orders requiring Interior and Trea sury to furnish trust accountings and pay dam\u00ad ages exceeding $1.4 billion for the government's alleged mismanagement of tribal trust funds, lands, and other natural resources. The Division is pursuing a strategy of constructive engagement in the tribal trust cases. It is litigating certain cases to final judgment, wherev er necessary or appropriate, while also work\u00ad ing cooperatively with tribes and Interior and Treasury to resolve other cases through formal alternative dispute resolution or informal settle ment processes, to the extent possible. Work\u00ad ing with DOI, ENRD has taken the lead in deve loping expedited settle ment methodologies in support of a large-scale effort to settle tribal trust cases with over 90 tribes. In 2011, the Division negotiated or helped nego tiate settlements in cases brought by the Osage Nation, the Ponca Tribe of Oklahoma, and th e Sokaogon Chippewa Indian Community. The In April 2012, Attorney General Eric Holder announces the settlement of breach-of-trust lawsuits filed by more than 40 federally recognized American Indian tribes against the United States. settlement with the Osage Nation included a pa yment of $380 million to compensate the tribe for its claims of historical losses to its trust fu nds and interest income, as well as agreement to implement measures that will lead to strengthened management of the tribe's trust assets and improved communications between Interior and the tribe. Lawyers for most of the tribes that had brou ght trust accounting and trust mismanagement cases against the United States wrote letters to the President in September 2009, after the public announcement of the settlement of the Cobell v. Salazar litigation, seeking to engage the United States in expedited settlement discussi ons regarding the tribes' trust claims. Since September 2009, several of the tr ibes have dropped out of the in formal coalition, while the remaining tribes--called the \"SPO A group\" (\"Settlement Proposal to Obama Administration\")-\u00ad have proceeded with numerous informal settleme nt discussions with the United States (which, among other things, have included limited and focused data productions). Those informal settlement discussions continue in fiscal year 2012. In Wolfchild v. United States , the Division secured a denial of a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court. The U.S. Court of Appe als for the Federal Circuit had reversed a U.S. Court of Federal Claims' holding that the Bureau of Indian Affairs had breached a trust with 20,000 alleged descendants of Indians by transfe rring land to three tribes in Minnesota. The claims for money damages were in the hundreds of millions of dollars, premised in part on damages from the Indian gaming re venue that the plaintiffs claimed they should have received. On remand, we secured a partially favorable decision further limi ting the possible liability exposure. Limiting Duplicative Breach-of-Trust Claims Against the United States Many Indian tribes have sued the United States for mismanagement of tribal trust property and funds by filing claims in both federal district court and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. A statute enacted by Congress in the 1860s, now co dified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500, was designed to prohibit multiple lawsuits agai nst the federal government by providing that the Court of Fed\u00ad eral Claims lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate a lawsuit in that court if another lawsuit was pend\u00ad ing in federal district court based on the same op erative facts. The Federal Circuit Court of Ap\u00ad peals, which oversees the Court of Federal Claims, had given a narrow construction to section 1500, holding that the Tohono O'odham Nation co uld maintain suits in both courts simultane\u00ad ously where different relief was so ught in each court. In a 7-1 decision issued in June 2011, United States v. Tohono O'odham Nation , the Supreme Court reversed. The Court held that section 1500 precludes Court of Federal Claims' jurisdiction if the Court of Federal Claims suit and the suit in the other court \"are based on su bstantially the same operative facts, regardless of the relief sought in each suit.\" Followin g the Supreme Court's deci sion, the Division filed motions to dismiss in 25 Court of Federal Claims ' cases for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under section 1500, and it prevailed in 14 cases. Ten cases are still awaiting rulings. protecting Indian resources | 101 102 | protecting Indian resources Defining the U.S. Role as Trustee for Indian Tribes in th e Context of Tribal Trust Litigation In another lawsuit for alleged mismanagement of tribal trust resources and funds, the Jicarilla Apache Nation sought discovery of documents that the United States said were protected from disclosure based upon the attorney client pr ivilege because the docu ments provided advice from Interior or Justice Depart ment attorneys regarding the management of tribal assets. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims held that the United States' assertion of privilege was subject to an exception, known as the fiduciary exception, because the United States was acting in a fidu\u00ad ciary capacity on behalf of the Indian tribes in the management of tribal resources. The Fed\u00ad eral Circuit agreed with the lower court, holding that the fiduciary exception was applicable. In another 7-1 decision is sued in June 2011, United States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation , the Su\u00ad preme Court reversed. The Court assumed that a fiduciary exception to the attorney client privilege exists at common law, bu t held that it did not apply to the United States as trustee for Indian tribes. The Court reasoned that the United States is not akin to a private trustee in its dealings with Indian tribes. Rather, the nature of the relationship between the United States and tribes is defined by statute and regulation. The Court concluded that the tribe was not the \"real client\" of the United States as the United States had its own independent interests in exe\u00ad cuting federal law. It also concluded that the United States does not have the same disclosure obligations as a private trustee. Defending Against Miscellaneous Other Tribal Claims The Division also prevailed agains t tribal claims in several cases that set important precedents for determining when it is approp riate to hold the United States liable. Several cases involved multi-million dollar claims against the public fisc. In Samish v. United States , the tribe se\u00ad cured federal recognition as an Indian tribe in 1996, but contended it should have been recog\u00ad nized since 1969. Plaintiffs brought claims for federal program monies the tribe did not receive when it was not recognized. We prevailed both at the Court of Federal Claims and at the Fed\u00ad eral Circuit, with the courts ho lding that that statutory langua ge authorizing the money was not mandating. We secured dismissal in San Carlos Apache Tribe v. United States , a case seeking a $10 million claim for inadequate representation by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the De\u00ad partment of Justice of the tribe's water rights claim. We prevailed on a defense based on the statute of limitations, creating strong precedent on \"first accrual\" not being delayed pending final resolution of a state water rights adjudication. We also secured a very favorable opinion in Klamath Claims Committee v. United States , concerning a taking and damages claim for the destruction of the Chiloquin Dam and treaty fishing rights. Litigating the Question of Where Tribal-Court Judgments May Be Enforced In June 2011, the Supreme Court also denied a petition for a writ of certiorari in Miccosukee Tribe of Indians v. Kraus-Anderson Constr. Co . While state courts are often called upon to recognize and enforce tribal-court judgments, this case involved a scenario in which the Micco\u00ad sukee Tribe asked a federal district court to enforce a favorable tribal-court judgment entered against a non-Indian opponent. The district cour t held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the Miccosukee Tribe's action to enforce a tribal-court judgment entered in its favor against Kraus-Anderson. It declined, however, to recognize the judgment because it concluded that Kraus-Anderson had been denied due process when the Tribal Business Committee had disallowed a discretionary appeal to the Tribal Co urt of Appeals. On appeal, the Eleventh Cir\u00ad cuit concluded that subject matter jurisdiction wa s lacking. In its pe tition, the Miccosukee Tribe argued that there was federal question juri sdiction over the action, a position that Kraus- Anderson also took in its brief in support of this petition. Our amicus br ief, which was filed in May 2011 at the invitation of the Supreme Court, argued that the Eleventh Circuit's holding was correct as in most instances, including here, the action to enforce the tribal-court judgment does not raise a federal question. Defending Bureau of Indian Affairs Progr am Decisions and Congressional Direction as to the Distribution of Tribal Judgment Funds The Division successfully defend ed actions taken by the Bureau of Indian Affairs regarding two large tribal judgment funds held in the U.S. Treasury. In Different Horse v. Salazar, individual Indians sought disgorgement of the Black Hill s Judgment Fund and ot her Sioux Nation Judg\u00ad ment Funds totaling over $1 billion dollars being held in trust for the various Sioux tribes. The tribes have been opposed to using or distributing the funds. The distri ct court granted our mo\u00ad tion to dismiss the case because the tribes were indispensable parties and the individuals lacked standing. At issue in Timbisha Shoshone Tribe v. Salazar was the proper distribution of a fund set aside for the benefit of the nations and tribes constituting the Western Shoshone Identifiable Group, of which the Timbisha Shos hone Tribe is a member. In August 1977, the Indian Claims Commission determined that the United States should pay the Western Sho\u00adshone Identifiable Group approxim ately $26 million in compensation for the taking of a large area of the Western Shoshone aboriginal homeland in Nevada and California. The money re\u00ad mained in the custody of the Treasury Department and grew to a size of $185 million. Individ\u00ad ual Indians and some of the tribes that comprise the Identifiable Group sought distribution of the fund, while other tribes and many of their members, including the Timbisha, opposed any distribution. Congress, with the support of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, directed in the West\u00ad ern Shoshone Claims Distribution Act that all of the funds be dist ributed per capita to all indi\u00ad vidual Indians who are members of Western Shoshone tribes, with none of the proceeds going directly to the tribes. We secu red dismissal of the constitutional challenge to the act. The dis\u00ad trict court rejected claims brought by the Timbis ha Shoshone Tribe that this distribution vio\u00ad lated the Fifth Amendment and Equal Protection Clause, concluding that Congress had a ra\u00ad tional basis for this distribution scheme. protecting Indian resources | 103 People photo \u2014 John retirement; ISM in- stallation; 100th Anniv; etc. Promoting Staff Quality of Life and Career Growth For the third year in a row, ENRD was named the \"Best Place to Work in the Federal Govern\u00ad ment\" out of 240 agency subcompo nents surveyed.

During fiscal year 2011, the Divi sion took various steps to advance these goals: \u2014 Th e number of approved telework agreements wi thin the Division nearly septupled. Telework is an alternative work arrangement for employees that allows the conduct of some of their work at an alternative worksite away from the Division's typically used office. (The fed\u00ad eral government is a leader in the use of innova tive workplace flexibilitie s, including telework. Congress passed the Telework Enhancemen t Act of 2010 to encourage its use.) \u2014 On July 15, 2011, ENRD issued the Environment and Natural Resources Division Diver - sity Manag ement Plan . On April 30, 2010, the A ttorney General issued the Department-wide Diversity Management Plan to improve the effectiveness of the Department's efforts to recruit, hire, retain, and develop employees. The Divisi on prepared and submitted its plan in accor\u00ad 104 | supporting the division's staff dance with the Department's plan. The ENRD pl an includes an assessment of ENRD's current diversity efforts as well as statem ents of goals and strategies to continue efforts to reflect the American public by drawing the ENRD workforce from all segments of society. \u2014 During the past year, to accommodate Depart ment-wide hiring restrictions while continu\u00ad ing to provide the best possible support for ENRD 's litigation mission, the Office of the Assis\u00ad tant Attorney General authorized filling 18 support staff vacancies from within the Division's ranks. This allowed high-performing ENRD staf f to compete for and be rewarded with oppor\u00ad tunities that offered higher promotion potentials than their existing jobs. \u2014 In October 2011, Assistant Attorney General Mo reno issued Directive No. 2011-04, entitled \"Procedures for Appointing Senior Counsel and Senior Attorneys in the Environment and Natural R esources Division.\" The goal of the directive is to make t he selection of these roles transparent, consistent, and fair throughout the Division. (\"Senior Counsel\" and \"Senior Attor\u00ad ney\" positions apply at the GS-15 level and are ti tles indicatin g that an attorney's experience warrants special recognition that may or may not carry supervisory responsibilities. These positions should not be confused with \"Senior Le vel Attorneys,\" the allocation of which is ap\u00ad proved by the Office of Personnel Management.) \u2014 Last year, the Assistant Attorn ey General approved several other delegations empowering lower levels of Division manage ment to consent to use of a U.S. magistrate judge or designa\u00ad tion of a U.S. magistrate judge as a special ma ster (Directive No. 2011-06); to approve certain de minimis amendments to state court water rights decrees for federally recognized Indian tribes (Directive No. 2011-07); to approve briefs for filing in certain petition-for-review actions under the Hobbs Act (Directive No. 2011-03); and to make unanimous no-certiorari recom\u00admendations to the Solicitor General (Directive No. 2011-02). \u2014 Early this year, the Assistant Attorney General appointed the Division's Attorney Skills Development Coordinator. The Department-wide Diversity Management Plan directs each Department component to appoint an Attorney Skills Development Coordinator, who will work with management to establish a skills-based program aimed at developing the com petencies and talents of attorneys in the components. supporting the division 's staff | 105 Conserving Financial Resources While Su pporting the Department's Key Litigation Careful stewardship of resources enabled the Division to provide vital support for key case work, particularly the massive and time- sensitive Deepwater Horizo n litigation. For this case alone, the Division's Office of Litigation Support processed over 40 million documents-\u00ad comprising 30+ terabyte s of data--and organ\u00ad ized over 14,000 deposition and trial exhibits. Simultaneously, we continued to manage the contractor and in-house document and data processing services for the large and complex initiatives that continue d alongside the Deepwa\u00ad ter Horizon litigation, discussed throughout this document. Our litigation support staff provided varying levels of support to over 300 cases an d matters during the year. We estimate that the Division avoide d costs of over $5 million by processing documents on-site, in the litigation support com\u00ad puter lab, when we had the ability to do so. In this era of declining federal budgets, Assi stant Attorney General Moreno also appointed a cross-section of staff to serve on a \"$AVE Committee.\" The $AVE Committee identified several -million dollars in cost-saving options that the Division is now implementing. Greening the Division In 2011, we achieved a substantial 15% reduction in energy use as compared to previous years in the Patrick Henry Building (PHB). The Division is the primary tenant of PHB. This marked decrease was largely attributable to two initiatives led by the Division's Greening the Govern\u00ad ment (GtG) Committee. From December 2010 to April 2011, more than 1,800 motion- activated light sensors were installed in PHB office s and public areas at the Division's request. The fiscal year also saw the continuation of th e GtG Committee initiative to remove the middle bulbs in hallway ceiling fixtures throughout PHB. These changes, along with other improve\u00ad ments such as reducing by half the number of the Division's fax machines and installing water- saving aerators that reduced the building's wa ter usage by over 20%, have qualified PHB for certification as an Energy Star building. ENRD is also working with building management to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmenta l Design (LEED) certification for PHB due to these energy savings. In January 2011, ENRD implemented environmenta lly friendly changes to its printing prac\u00ad tices, including defaulting to double-sided pr inting and copying for the new convenience copi\u00ad ers, and switching to a new recycled toner ca rtridge program that sa ved ENRD over $16,000 between June and October 2011. In coordinati on with these improvements, the GtG Recycling Subcommittee developed and distributed updated best management practices for paper use and recycling. This guidance was publicized on the ENRD intranet, which also features best practices for energy use and computer power management. ENRD Earth Day 2011 Marvin Gaye Park The Division also held its 8th annual Earth Day ser\u00ad vice celebration at Marvin Gaye Park in April 2011, helping the park to plant trees, remove trash, gar\u00ad den, and landscape. Improving the Security and Usability of the Division's Information Technology Systems Information technology (IT) security continues to be at the forefront of government and public concern. ENRD has made th is critical issue a priority, even in an era of declining resources. Our technology staff ma intained a \"green\" report card throughout the year, keeping up with ever-increasing requirements to strengthen IT infrastructure and soft\u00ad ware. ENRD also became one of the first divisions to upload contractor security data onto the Department's system last year, facilitating the sharing of re sources between components and ensuring that personnel security regulations and standards are being uniformly applied within the Department. The Division also expanded the use and capability of some of our older information technology systems and designed or moved others to web-ba sed platforms, making them easier for Divi\u00ad sion staff to navigate. For example, we upgraded ENRD's Wiki, enhancing the ability of ENRD personnel to create and edit any number of interlinked web pages to collaborate and share information on Division-relevant projects. We also made critical operational upgrades to ENRD's Case Management System and Human Resources Information System. supporting the division's staff | 107 "}
