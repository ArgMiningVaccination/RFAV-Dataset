A recent estimate indicates, \"Americans are spending some $6 billion annually on nutritional supplements, and the market is growing by 20% every year\" (Zahn, 1997). Of these supplements, the increase in herbal remedy use is most dramatic. Zahn holds that the increase can be attributed to the widely held belief that herbal substances are healthy and harmless because of their natural origins (1997). Unfortunately, research on these supplements, herbal or otherwise, has not transmitted to the public as quickly as the diet enhancers themselves. The phenomenon leaves many consumers misguided by skewed advertising and Dietary pills manufacturers emphasize that their supplements are intended to intensify the effects of exercise and diet. In contradiction, some doctors think these cannot deliver so much impact and will only shrink the consumers' wallet. They are pointing out to the lack of strong evidence that could stand the claim they can aid weight loss successfully.

Americans are turning to herbal supplements in record numbers as a means of attaining their dietary needs and goals. One of the best selling herbal supplements on the market is Metabolife 356\u00e2 (http://www.metabolife.com/news/100199.htm).

Holistic Medicine Holistic Medicine, commonly referred to as \"Alternative Medicine\", is a vast and rapidly growing new scientific field. It is derived mainly from ancient, traditional methods of healing that have often been practiced in the East for centuries. These include a variety of techniques from herbal healing to acupuncture to homeopathy to energy channeling. Due to the large number of methods that are covered by the term, there are various definitions of Holistic Medicine. However, all literature seems to agree that Alternative Medicine, is exactly what the name suggests: an 'alternative' approach to healing and medicine. It is a more personal move toward health care, which attempts to connect the mind, body and spirit. A natural Garcinia Cambogia Supplement, such as LivingVita's Pure Garcinia Cambogia Extract, is safe to take and has been effective in clinical studies. The most famous clinical study was done by the Current Therapeutic Research\u00ae journal. Scientists used Garcinia Cambogia with HCA to study it's weight loss effects. They found that it causes significant weight loss, lowers food intake and body weight gain, as well as tackling factors such as cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides, and serum leptin levels.

Herbal medicines are great alternative for commercially manufactured medicines available in the market. The major reason why herbal medicine differ from modern medicine is because they are produced with 100% natural content. Therefore the plant extract has all the medicinal values that are as effective as modern medicine. Commercially prepared drugs show results quickly but have numerous side effects. However herbal medicines don't show any side Alternative Medicine Although \"Alternative\" or \"Complementary\" medicine has been kept on the fringes of the medical sciences in the past, it is becoming increasingly more popular, and more reputable. Alternative medicines are those medical systems which are not taught to or practiced by most conventional medical doctors. Alternative medicines seemingly have always existed, changing and conforming to the current climate of society. There seems to be an almost endless number of alternative medicines, each with their own method of gaining perfect health. Often people who are dissatisfied with conventional medicine turn to alternative medicine for their medical needs. Many similarities link the diverse extremities of alternative medicine. These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
