Is it true that some carry a risk of autism? I don't want to give my child any vaccines that carry the risk, and that he doesn't really need. (but I will vaccinate him with the necessary vaccines, like measles and polio) 6 Answers [Dr. George L. Blum](/Expert/2023175-George-L-Blum)Pediatrician Franklin, MI None of the immunizations for children and adults that are used now have no more than 1 in a million side effects. Recent studies show that those who received MMR have fewer cases of autism than the average population. [Dr. Antonio Figueroa](/Expert/3173579-Antonio-Figueroa)Pediatrician Brownsville, TX Vaccines are important for prevention of transmitted disease, some has side effects like fever, swollen of the site of administration and very rare serious complications like in the past with oral polio! It is more the benefits rather than side effects. There are many studies than didn't find relationship vaccines with autism! [Dr. Juliana O. Opong](/Expert/18878-Juliana-O-Opong)Pediatrician Bakersfield, CA Vaccines are not at all harmful. No vaccines cause autism. The study that raised this concern was not replicated and therefore withdrawn. The vaccines have been so effective in reducing some of the infectious illnesses that we are almost beginning to believe that the illnesses are non existent. That is an illusion and now we have a measles outbreak in the US. A preventable disease is resurging in this country [Margarita M. Martinez-Cruzado](/Expert/8135428-Margarita-M-Martinez-Cruzado)Pediatrician San Juan, Puerto Rico No. It is not true that some vaccines carry a risk of autism. None of them carry a risk of autism. [Dr. Norris Sheldon Payne](/Expert/2631089-Norris-Sheldon-Payne)Pediatrician Dallas, TX No, vaccines are NOT potentially harmful to your child. On the contrary, every vaccine recommended by the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics prevent diseases that can can disability or even death to your child. There is NO chance of autism from any vaccine. Thank you for your question. It is a very important one. [Dr. Susan Lynn Robbins](/Expert/621264-Susan-Lynn-Robbins)Pediatrician Hattiesburg, Mississippi There is no scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism. There is much greater rick from death of the disease they are preventing than getting the vaccine. ]There has been a resurgence of measles and chickenpox because of children not getting vaccinated. There is a vaccine side affect sheet that can be printed from CDC website about each vaccine. I recommend the schedule from the American Academy of Pediatrics. "}
