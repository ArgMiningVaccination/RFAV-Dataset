Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies at Dana- Farber Cancer Institute is dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for cancer patients and families by incorporating complementary medicine into traditional cancer care. The Center provides affordable clinical services for pediatric and adult patients and their families, educates and empowers patients about their use, and conducts peer -reviewed research.Mission StatementClinical Services Offered at Zakim Center Integrative Medicine Consults Integrative Nutritional Consults Group: Music Therapy Expressive Arts Therapy QiGong Meditation yogaPain Severity And Interference Pain Severity Pain Interference 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0 0 4 8 9 12 WeekMeanHISTORY 2003 -The International Society of Integrative Oncology (SIO) was founded through a joint effort of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, The Memorial Sloan Kettery Cancer Center and the American Cancer SocietyIntegrative Oncology We have come a long way But We still have a ways to go.... medical and health care practices outside the realm of conventional medicine, which are yet to be validated using scientific methodsWhat Is CAM?

Formal evaluation of CAM is vital to confirm potentially clinically meaningful benefits. Acupuncture appears to be safe for this population Conducting rigorous and controlled acupuncture studies during a chemotherapy period is challenging, but important.Acupuncture for Chemotherapy- Induced Peripheral Neuropathy: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial Weidong Lu, MB, MPH, PHD Jennifer Ligibel, MD David S. Rosenthal, MD Anita Giobbie-Hurder, MS Laura Shockro & Kelly Stecker Zakim Center & Breast Cancer Oncology Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School July 6, 2015Background Chemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most common side effects of taxane chemotherapy. Symptoms of CIPN: paresthesia and pain of extremities. Incidence rates of CIPN in breast cancer rage from 30% to 97% with adjuvant taxanes. Results in loss of physical function, difficulty in ADL's, decreased QOL, dose reductions and termination of treatment No established therapy is currently available for this condition .Prevalence of chemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy: A systematic review and (6.4- 53.5) 6 months (2014) 2461-247031 patients Paclitaxel 70.8% (95% CI = 43.5-98.1)Acupuncture A number of small studies have looked at acupuncture as a potential treatment of CIPN -A RCT (n=64) reported response rate of 88% for paclitaxel -specific CIPN -Studies to date not breast cancer specific. Potential mechanism of action for acupuncture and CIPN -Suppression of local and central inflammation -opioid system activation -nerve fiber regenerationCase Report Joined the study from Nov. 25, 2014 to January 14, 2015 Pain scores at the beginning: 9 out of 10 both hands and feet Acupuncture 18 sessions Pain scores at the end of the study: 3 out of 10 (hands); 5 out of 10 (feet) Continued acupuncture post study Pain scores: 2 out of 10 (hands); 4 out of 10 (feet) as of June 30, 2015 The patient says: \" I have tried everything and nothing works for my pain.\" \"After acupuncture, I can feel my toes and fingers. It is wonderful!\" Previous Acupuncture Studies on CIPN A systematic review evaluated 7 acupuncture RCTs on CIPN -Franconi et al. Evid Based Complement Alternat Med ,2013 One RCT from China (n = 64): 67% overall response response Zhongguo Zhen Jiu30:2010 Another non-RCT trial (n=47), a significant increase of nerve amplitude in sural and tibial nerves measured by NCS test (response: 76% vs. 15%) -Schroeder et al. Acupunct Med, 2011 However, poor quality design in general and non-breast cancer specific Select Inclusion Criteria 1. Stage I -III Breast Cancer 2. Completion of adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy (as single agents or in combination with platins or HER -2 directed therapy). 3. Presence of grade I or greater neuropathy 4. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 5. hematological function: neutrophil count >1.0 x109/L, platelet count >50x109/L 6. Patients who are on a stable dose of prescription medications or dietary supplements for CIPN and still symptomatic as defined above will be allowed to participate in the studyOutcome Measures The Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ) The Functional Assessment of Cancer Neurotoxicity (FACT/NTX )subscale The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Cancer (QLQ - C30) (version 3.0) EORTC QLQ Chemotherapy -induced Peripheral Neuropathy 20 questionnaire (CIPN 20) Patient Medication Log. Blood drawStatistical Considerations Primary Aim : Evaluate the impact of acupuncture on PNQ score by comparing changes from baseline between acupuncture and usual care arms at the end of week 8. The response rate is defined as the proportion of patients in whom there is a one unit or greater reduction in PNQ score between baseline and week 8.
