However, most comparisons do not address selection effects for those who are vaccinated and with which vaccine. We report evidence on large selection effects, and use a novel method to control for these effects. Instead of directly studying COVID-19 mortality, we study the COVID-19 excess mortality percentage (CEMP), defined as the COVID-19 deaths divided by non-COVID-19 natural deaths for the same population, converted to a percentage. The CEMP measure uses non-COVID-19 natural deaths to proxy for population health and control for selection effects. We report the relative mortality risk (RMR) for each vaccine relative to the unvaccinated population and to the other vaccine, using linked mortality and vaccination records for all adults in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, from 1 April 2021 through 30 June 2022. For two-dose vaccinees aged 60+, RMRs for Pfizer vaccinees were consistently over twice those for Moderna, and averaged 248% of Moderna (95% CI = 175%,353%). In the Omicron period, Pfizer RMR was 57% versus 23% for Moderna. Both vaccines demonstrated waning of two-dose effectiveness over time, especially for ages 60+. For booster recipients, the Pfizer-Moderna gap is much smaller and statistically insignificant. A possible explanation for the Moderna advantage for older persons is the higher Moderna dose of 100 g, versus 30 g for Pfizer. Younger persons (aged 18-59) were well-protected against death by two doses of either vaccine, and highly protected by three doses (no deaths among over 100,000 vaccinees). These results support the importance of a booster dose for ages 60+, especially for Pfizer recipients. They suggest, but do not prove, that a larger vaccine dose may be appropriate for older persons than for younger persons.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-05-11", "cleaned_text": "Selection Effects and COVID-19 Mortality Risk after Pfizer vs. Moderna Vaccination: Evidence from Linked Mortality and Vaccination Records [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11050971](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11050971) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-11-00971), [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00971), [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00971)]. Prior research comparing the two vaccines, reviewed in the Discussion Section, is limited and mixed, but suggests a nod to Moderna because it wanes more slowly. [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00971)]. In prior work, we provide evidence for strong selection effects on which persons are vaccinated; two-dose vaccinees are healthier than the unvaccinated, and three-dose vaccinees are generally healthier than two-dose vaccinees [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00971)]. Here, we extend that work and provide evidence for important selection effects in which vaccine people receive. We then study RMR for each vaccine versus the unvaccinated, and compare the two mRNA vaccines, controlling for these selection effects. [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00971), [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00971), [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00971), [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00971)]. However, many studies report results [ [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00971), [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00971), [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00971), [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00971), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00971), [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00971), [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00971)]. Most studies that report vaccine-specific results have limited controls for individual characteristics, often only age and gender; use research designs that are prone to selection effects, often a test-negative design, which compares people with positive COVID-19 tests to controls who test negative; and/or cover limited time periods or populations (e.g., US veterans). After controlling for selection effects, and in contrast to the mixed results from these studies, we find evidence of a large mortality-reduction advantage for Moderna over Pfizer for two-dose vaccinees, aged 60+. Both vaccines provide similar protection against mortality for younger ages, and after a booster dose. [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00971), [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00971)]. There is also evidence for influenza that the elderly benefit from a larger vaccine dose that compensates for their weaker immune systems [ [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00971), [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00971), [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00971), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00971), [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00971)]. This pattern could plausibly hold for the COVID-19 vaccines, and could explain the observed Moderna advantage for ages 60+. [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00971), [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00971), [21](#B21-vaccines-11-00971)]. We use the natural mortality rate from causes other than COVID-19 (non-COVID-19 NMR) as a proxy for unobserved health and thus background mortality risk, within population groups defined by age, gender, vaccination status, and other characteristics. We use a related measure, the COVID-19 excess mortality percentage (CEMP) (defined as the COVID-19 mortality rate divided by the non-COVID-19 NMR, converted to a percentage) as our principal outcome measure. This measure is available on a population-wide basis and performs well in predicting COVID-19 mortality for unvaccinated populations. In this study, we use the CEMP measure to assess RMRs for Pfizer and Moderna vaccinees versus the unvaccinated, and the relative effectiveness of each vaccine. 2. Data and Methods [Supplemental Materials](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)for further details on our text-based algorithm. [Supplemental Materials Table S1](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)compares our COVID-19 death counts to those obtained using ICD-10 codes assigned by the NCHS. [Supplemental Materials Table S2](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)). We treat vaccination as effective against mortality beginning 30 days after receipt, to allow for time from vaccination to full effectiveness against infection, plus the typical several-week lag from infection to death. [Extended Methods Section in the Supplemental Materials](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)for additional details on variable definitions. We report results for the following three time periods: pre-booster period (1 April-30 September 2021), Delta period (1 December 2021, below \"4Q-2021\"), and Omicron period (1 January-30 June 2022), but provide results by calendar quarters in the [Supplemental Materials](#app1-vaccines-11-00971). We study two-dose vaccinees in each time period, and three-dose vaccinees beginning 4Q-2021, when booster doses became available. Booster availability began in late September 2021, but was initially limited primarily to persons aged 60+. Broader booster availability began in December 2021. [22](#B22-vaccines-11-00971)], gender, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White (\"White\") versus other), and education (high-school or less versus college education or more). Using additional predictors was not feasible given the limited number of deaths of vaccinees. [Supplemental Materials Figure S5](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)). 3. Results 3.1. Study Population and Evidence on Selection Effects [Supplemental Materials Table S2](#app1-vaccines-11-00971), we provide information on the vaccination and natural mortality counts for Milwaukee adults during our sample period. Of 542,152 adult vaccinees, we excluded 94,221 because they did not receive two or three Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, and 5843 immune-compromised persons. This left a sample of 442,088 Pfizer or Moderna vaccinees, as well as 179,366 unvaccinated persons. Overall, through June 2022, around 74% of Milwaukee County adults received at least one dose, of whom 82% received two Pfizer or two Moderna doses; of these two-dose vaccinees, 57% received a third dose of the same vaccine. Among mRNA vaccine recipients, 66% received Pfizer. Only a small percentage of vaccinees received J&J or different vaccine types across doses. [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00971-t001)and [Supplemental Materials Figure S1](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)for sample selection details. [Table 1](#vaccines-11-00971-t001)provides summary statistics for the sample of 8250 natural deaths. There are large differences in various characteristics between the unvaccinated and vaccinated, between Pfizer and Moderna vaccinees, and between two-dose and three-dose vaccinees. Relative to two-dose recipients, the unvaccinated are younger, much less likely to be White, more likely to be male, and less educated. Relative to two-dose recipients, three-dose recipients are older, more likely to be White, and better educated. Moderna vaccinees are older than Pfizer vaccinees and more likely to be White. These differences provide initial evidence on the existence of selection effects. [Supplemental Materials, Table S10](#app1-vaccines-11-00971), the existence of large selection effects within finer age groups. For all ages, vaccinees are substantially healthier (less likely to die of other natural causes) than the unvaccinated, and three-dose recipients are healthier than two-dose recipients. For ages 60+, Pfizer vaccinees are much healthier than Moderna vaccinees. For two-dose vaccinees over the full sample period, non-COVID-19 NMR for Pfizer vaccinees is 52.6% of that three-dose period, non-COVID-19 56.0% of COVID-19 deaths, non-COVID-19 natural deaths, CEMP (the ratio of the two), Pfizer and Moderna RMRs versus the unvaccinated, and the Pfizer/Moderna ratio, in groups defined by age range (18-39, 40-59, 60-79, and 80+), number of doses, and vaccine for the following three time periods: pre-booster (April-September 2021) with Alpha and Delta as the dominant virus variants; October-December 2021, with Delta dominant but boosters available; and Delta and Omicron variants, and potential differences in RMR between variants. Some death counts in individual cells are small, so confidence intervals for RMRs and Pfizer/Moderna ratios are wide. 3.3. Three-Dose RMRs and the Three-Dose Pfizer/Moderna Ratio [Figure 1](#vaccines-11-00971-f001)summarizes in graphical form the principal RMR results for ages 60+ from [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00971-t002). It shows RMR data points by time period for two-dose Pfizer recipients, two-dose Moderna recipients, and during the booster period, for three-dose Pfizer and three-dose Moderna recipients, all versus the unvaccinated. The upward slopes over time for two-dose vaccinees confirm waning vaccine effectiveness over time. The gap between the Pfizer and Moderna lines for two-dose vaccinees shows the Moderna advantage over Pfizer. The solid lines for three dose recipients are well below the two-dose lines and thus illustrate the value of the third booster dose in reducing mortality, for both vaccines. The gap between the two-dose and three-dose lines provides a measure of the mortality risk reduction from a booster. The Figure also shows that RMRs for both vaccines are similar after three doses. The reduction in RMR from a third dose is larger for Pfizer than for Moderna; reflecting higher Pfizer two-dose RMRs but similar three-dose Multivariate Estimates [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00971-t003), we use a multivariate logistic regression model to predict the Pfizer/Moderna ratio for two- and three-dose recipients, for the same sample as in [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00971-t002). Over the full sample period, for two-dose 60+, the Pfizer/Moderna ratio (CI = 182%,366%; p < 0.001). This estimate is very close to the 248% (CI = 175%,353%) estimate from the simpler comparisons in [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00971-t002). For each subperiod, the multivariate estimates from [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00971-t003)are again similar to those from [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00971-t002). Thus, the additional covariates included in the multivariate model do not strongly affect the results from [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00971-t002), in which mortality for two-dose Pfizer recipients age 60+ is over twice that for Moderna recipients. [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00971-t003), for three-dose vaccinees aged 60+ over the full booster period, the Pfizer/Moderna ratio was 135% (not statistically different from 100%). This is also similar to the results presented in [Table 2](#vaccines-11-00971-t002), for which the full-booster-period estimate is 134% (CI = 63%, 283%). [Table 3](#vaccines-11-00971-t003)reports results using the following limited covariates to preserve the regression degrees of freedom: gender, age, age2, and days since last vaccine dose (to allow for waning). However, point estimates are similar in regressions, which also control for race/ethnicity, education, and Materials Table S4](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)). the multivariate estimates provides evidence that the CEMP denominator is effective at controlling for population health and thus for COVID-19 risk, even without controlling for additional covariates. 3.5. Robustness Checks [Table S5](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)) or exclude the immune-compromised, defined more broadly than in the text ( [Table S6](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)). The results for this ratio are similar for men and women ( [Table S7](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)), and for White populations versus non-White populations ( [Table S8](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)). 4. Discussion 4.1. [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00971), [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00971), [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00971), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00971), [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00971), [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00971)]. report separate results for homologous versus heterologous vaccination. Among the studies of homologous vaccination that distinguish between vaccine types, some do not find substantial differences between Pfizer and Moderna. Others find differences, sometimes similar in magnitude to those reported, but do not highlight them. Only one study, limited to U.S. veterans, includes the Omicron-dominant period (only a short part of that period), or studies separately three-dose vaccinees [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00971)]. [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00971)]. They thus find a Pfizer/Moderna ratio similar to ours, but their abstract states only that \"Both vaccines were highly effective across all age groups.\" Lytras et al. (2022) study Greece through the year-end of 2021 and find a nearly 3:1 Moderna advantage against mortality, but this result must be extracted from a supplemental figure; the text (at 5048) reports \"only marginal differences between vaccines in effectiveness.\" [ [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00971)] Mayr et al. (2022) report a Moderna advantage in reducing hospitalization risk, and an apparent advantage for a combined ICU-or-death outcome, but the small sample size \"precluded statistically significant comparisons.\" [ [33](#B33-vaccines-11-00971)] A study of Czechia through November 2021 reports two-dose RMR, 7-8 months after of Pfizer vs. 12% for Moderna (2022) [ [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00971)]. The review by Black and Thaw (2022) reports a Moderna advantage against mortality after waning (at least 120 days after vaccination) during the Delta-dominant period, with midpoint RMR estimates from multiple studies of 13.3% for Pfizer vs. 9.2% for Moderna [ [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00971)]. Other studies find smaller differences. Islam et al. (2022) study the pre-booster period; they report an insignificant Moderna advantage for a combined hospitalization-or-death outcome during the first 90 days after vaccination [ [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00971)]. Several studies of U.S. veterans find no significant Pfizer-vs-Moderna [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00971), 4.3. Results for Waning and Absolute RMR versus Unvaccinated 4.4. The Value of mRNA Boosters, Especially for Pfizer [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00971)]. One Israeli study reported 10% RMR for three-versus-two-doses for ages 50+ [ [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00971)]; a second reports three-versus-two-dose RMR of 6.8% for ages [ [24](#B24-vaccines-11-00971)]; a third reports three-versus-two-dose RMR of 19% across all ages [ [41](#B41-vaccines-11-00971)]. In contrast, our results imply three-versus-two-dose RMRs of 23% for Pfizer and 39% [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00971), [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00971)]. [Supplemental Materials Table S2 and Figure S4](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)) are broadly similar to those observed nationally. Also, although we are the first to highlight the Moderna advantage over Pfizer for two-dose vaccinees, we are not the first to find a substantial Moderna advantage; We confirmed that non-COVID-19 natural mortality rates in 2019, prior to COVID-19, strongly predict COVID-19 mortality rates in 2020, when COVID-19 vaccines were not available, for population groups defined by age, gender, and race/ethnicity ( [Supplemental Materials Figure S5](#app1-vaccines-11-00971); Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.94). [44](#B44-vaccines-11-00971), [45](#B45-vaccines-11-00971)]. However, we coded COVID-19 deaths based on text fields in death certificates to reduce miscoding ( [Supplemental Materials Table S1](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)). For our sample, the rate of non-COVID-19 natural mortality during the study period was similar to that predicted by extrapolating natural mortality rates from the pre-pandemic period ( [Supplemental Materials Figure S3](#app1-vaccines-11-00971)). Any miscoding of COVID-19 as non-COVID-19 natural deaths will reduce CEMP estimates, but we have no reason to expect this to produce bias in the Pfizer/Moderna ratio. 6.

The Figure shows increased two-dose RMRs over time, especially during the Omicron period, higher RMRs for Pfizer than for Moderna two-dose recipients, the reduction in RMRs for both vaccines from a booster dose, and similar RMRs for both vaccines after a booster dose. |Vaccination Status| 2 Doses||Pfizer 2 non-COVID-19 deaths, COVID-19 excess mortality percentage (CEMP), RMR relative to the unvaccinated population for vaccinees with indicated vaccine types (Pfizer = P; Moderna = M), and Pfizer/Moderna ratio of RMRs, by number of doses. Vaccine doses are considered effective 14 days after receipt. RMR for a comparison of two groups is the ratio of CEMP for group 1 to CEMP for group 2. Sample is adult decedents in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, excluding immune-compromised persons, who were unvaccinated or received two or three Pfizer or Moderna doses. Due to the nature of the sample, CEMP ratios and RMRs are effectively weighted by natural mortality rates. *, **, *** indicates p < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively; significant results are (at p < 0.05 or 0.05 or better) in boldface.
