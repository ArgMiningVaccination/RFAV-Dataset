The start of the 2016-17 academic year ushers in a number of exciting enhancements to our curriculum and our teaching and learning spaces. The year kicks off with the arrival of our newest students, members of the Class of 2020, and the launch of our mobile Medicine Education (mMedEd) initiative. mMedEd uses an iPad platform to deliver course materials and learning resources directly to students' iPad Home screen; it supports interactive teaching and learning activities; provides on the go access to learning tools, reference materials and productivity apps; allows access and interactions with the electronic medical record; supports a campus-wide sustainability initiative to reduce copy and paper costs; and provides a platform for innovation in medical educa- tion. Members of the Class of 2020 are the first to receive iPads upon entering the Stony Brook SOM. Other exciting enhancements include renovations to the HSC Library, expansion of the Clinical and Surgical Skills Centers, and a new Medical Student Lounge. Space in the library has been reconfig-ured to support mMedEd and collaborative small-group learning. A new retractable wall between the two computer classrooms allows for an open configuration that can seat 140 students. The library classrooms also received technology upgrades that include classroom audio/video, small-group areas with shared monitors, and a test-taking area for students with testing accommodations. The current Clinical Simulation Center (CSC) is approximately 6.000 square feet and consists of 10 patient exam rooms and 2 simulation labs. The adjacent Surgical Skills Center (SSC) offers an additional 1,800 square feet of space. The CSC/SSC uses simulation technology and state- of-the-art medical technologies to support the education, training, and evaluation of students and healthcare professionals. Current plans for expansion of the CSC/SSC include an increase in the number of available exam rooms, simulation rooms, debriefing rooms and task training areas. This will allow for the growth of simulation training into many areas of health care. In conjunction with the expansion of the CSC/SSC and reconfiguration of the space on the second level of the HSC, students will enjoy a new medical student lounge. A new academic year, a new class of students, numerous new technologies, and new spaces. It is indeed, an exciting time for our School of Medicine community. I cannot think of a better start to the careers of 132 extremely talented individuals, who will soon earn the privilege and honor of being called doctor.

Stony Brook HOME relies on its medical student volunteers! 7The Scholarly Concentrations Program (SCP) The Scholarly Concentrations Program is a four-year track opportunity for medical students to engage in and attain recognition for scholarly pursuits in related areas of medicine. Under this Program, students have the opportunity to do academic explora-tion in (1) Basic, Translational & Clinical Research, (2) Global Health, (3) Medical Humanities & Ethics, (4) Medical Education, and (5) Social Science. The program aims to align the areas of interest of students with the academic mission of the School providing a longitudinal area of work to the student experience at the School of Medicine. For many students, this period has been extremely helpful in shaping career goals and in building an academic track record attractive to residencies. The specif-ic goals of the Scholarly Concentrations Program are: 1. To provide encouragement, impetus, and support for engaging in additional extracurricular scholarly pursuits aligned with one's own area of interest 2. To facilitate the attainment of valuable career experience in areas and projects related to medicine as a complement to students' didactic medical education. 3. To provide special recognition to students who engage in such scholarly pursuits and meet the stan- dard requirements of the program A Research Day is held every year in the spring to give graduating students an opportunity to present the results of their research in an oral and/or poster presentation. A research award is given to an outstanding student chosen by the SCP Committee as part of the graduation festivities. You can learn more about this program online at: https://medicine.stony- brookmedicine.edu/ugme/education/Scholarly8The combined efforts of our medical students and key faculty leaders at Stony Brook Medicine and its Regional Clinical Campus at Winthrop University Hospital have created an exciting new series of programs committed to maintaining and enhancing our student wellness throughout their time here in medical school. The program has been named MeSH, Medical Student Health, Happiness, and Humanism. The overall program includes a variety of programs designed to allow our students to take care of themselves while going through the rigors of their medical education. Some of the programs included are yoga, mindfulness, learning and practicing skills of written reflection, sharing their emotional reactions from their clinical rotations through faculty mentor led Learning Communities, and a number of clubs and other activities designed to further our students' wellbeing. Each campus has a student organized oversite task force who monitor existing activities and plan for additional events depending on student need. Initial determination of the type of available resources was determined through a needs assess - ment completed by all students in the medical school. The medical school together with its Regional Camus have placed this new program as a high priority for its students' best welfare and have included it in its Strategic Planning for the schools' overall commitment to enhancing the professional identity formation for its students.

Sincerely, Jack Fuhrer, MDAssociate Dean for Admissions School of Medicine - Committee on Admissions 10June 26 marked the end of the third year that the interprofessional course titled \"Working Together: Interprofessional Conversations on Cultural Diversity\" has been offered to students in the Schools of Nursing, Medicine and a new addition this year the School of Social Welfare. This elective course was originally created and developed based on a Presidential Mini Grant awarded in 2013 to Drs. Lee Xippolitos, PhD, RN, the Dean of the School of Nursing and Latha Chandran, MD, MPH, the Vice Dean of the School of Medicine. Since its inception in June, 2014 a total of 21 medical students, 29 registered nurs - ing students and 1 social welfare student have participated in this 2-week elective. The overall goals of this course is to provide healthcare trainees the opportunity to: (a) Engage self and others to constructively manage disagree - ments about values, roles, goals, and actions that arise among healthcare professionals, (b) Reflect on individual and team performance for individual, as well as team, performance improvement, (c) Embrace the cultural diversity and individual differences that characterize patients, populations, and the health care team, and (d) Respect the unique cultures, values, roles/ responsibilities, and expertise of other health professions. Working in inter - professional teams from day 1, students attend four onsite face-to-face sessions including one day in the Clinical Skills Center that cover topics such as: (1) The Significance of the Interprofessional Team and Healthcare Disparities, (2) Interprofessional Communication, (3) Cultural Competency and Conflict Resolution, and (4) Interprofessional Patient Safety and Quality Care. In between sessions, students are expected to complete pre-assigned readings and write self and group reflections online. Feedback from students have been positive one student commented \"Just the concept of getting medical students and nurses interacting and working together as early as possible. It's great hearing opinions from people in other disciplines and it was a very eye opening experience. If I am successful at becoming a doctor that works well with nurses and the rest of the healthcare team, this course is probably the biggest reason.\" Next steps to promote interprofessional learning are currently underway as the Deans and key fac - ulty from the health sciences schools (School of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Social Welfare, Health Technology and Management) met for the first time in May, 2016 and will continue to meet regularly on a monthly basis to begin the planning of systematic and formal interprofessional experi - ences across the five schools which hopefully will start as early as fall of 2016.
