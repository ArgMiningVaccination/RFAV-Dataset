Life is such a balancing act: balance of head and heart, balance of family and work, balance of business and social and the balance of our spiritual and physical worlds. We live in two worlds at once: our physical, or material world, where the focus is on things, facts, logistics, organization, planning and accomplishing. We are in this physical world, but we are actually spiritual beings who are anchored here by our physical body. A key to balance is having a feeling of ourselves as the souls we are on planet earth. This feeling is not an outside theory or philosophy but comes from our own experiences. When we truly understand ourselves as the souls we are, we can relax and enjoy the journey.

When you know and live from this understanding, life becomes smoother and richer. You can be involved in the physical world, but not caught in the challenges and lessons. It's all Spiritual In the end, even the physical is spiritual. Our life in this physical world is an opportunity to learn, grow and evolve.
