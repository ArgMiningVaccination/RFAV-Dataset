It is an invitation to soften and open; to notice all of the stories that you tell yourself. It is both an ancient art and a modern science that teaches you to sink below the things that you have thought to be true. Meditation is to sit without any intention of interfering with whatever arises in your awareness. When we cease to struggle against our thoughts, emotions, feelings and our physical discomfort, we sink down into the truth of who we really are...we find that still place that is our true nature. Meditation is a coming home. It has been referenced since the beginning of recorded history, in nearly every culture of the world. People meditate for a variety of reasons: To relieve stress, to hone their mental capacity, to encourage better health, and to grow. Many sages and saints teach that meditation is an essential tool to encourage the evolution of consciousness. It helps you to grow into being the fullest expression of your authentic, divine self. We are all here for a reason. Sometimes we hide from ourselves. Meditation is a practice that lifts the veil from your mind, so that you are able to truly know yourself and live the life that you are here to live. I have been practicing meditation for over 30 years. What began as a curiosity in my childhood as a student of martial arts, expanded into a passion as I grew into an adult. I have always been interested in the taoist idea of balance as the guiding principle in life. I studied massage at the Oregon school of massage, Traditional Chinese medicine at the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine, Five element style acupuncture with Lonny Jarrett, Vendanta with Amritanandamayi, Zen buddhism with Adyashanti, and Qi gong with masters Liu He, and Huixian Chen. I have also studied the esoteric teachings of Christian, Jewish and Sufi mystics. I have been amazed to experience how each of these seemingly different paths all teach a very similar ideal of cultivating presence as the most effective way of coming to know the divine. I weave together my knowledge of different spiritual paths with a fascination for science, and personal experience. I have been teaching Qi gong and meditation for over 15 years. All are welcome in this class, whether you are new to meditation or have been meditating for years. Classes are typically 75 minutes long and include a 30-40 minute talk about mindfulness, 10 minutes of guided meditation and 30 minutes of silent meditation.
