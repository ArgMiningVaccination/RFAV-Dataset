Guests will need to provide proof of vaccination before embarkation and must have received both doses of the vaccine if recommended by the manufacturer by that timeline. [The vaccine requirement augments the company's comprehensive Crystal Clean+ 4.0 measures, including negative Covid-19 tests for both guests and crew, temperature checks at the terminal prior to boarding, a nimble mask policy, social distancing guidelines, enhanced cleaning and disinfection measures, reduced capacity and more.](https://news.gtp.gr/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/crystal_clean_3_1080x1080.jpg) \"The vaccine requirement is simply the best way to ensure the safest possible Crystal Experience for all on board,\" said Crystal Interim President and CEO Jack Anderson, adding that the company's guests and travel partners agree. According to a recent Cruise Critic survey of cruisers, more than 80 percent of respondents would cruise if a vaccine were required. Crystal has voluntarily paused operations through May 2021 for its River fleet; into June for its Ocean ships; through August 1 for Crystal Esprit and through August for Crystal Endeavor, allowing most travelers sufficient time to get fully vaccinated before Crystal's resumption of sailing. In addition to providing verified documentation of their COVID-19 vaccine at the time of boarding, guests will complete an online form acknowledging the requirement before their cruise tickets will be issued. Crystal crew to get vaccinated Crystal's crew, who hail from dozens of countries around the world, will be expected to be vaccinated as well when the company resumes sailing, however, this may not be a viable option for all crew members given their age and/or the availability of vaccines in their home countries. As part of the company's Crystal Clean+ 4.0 measures, crew members will be tested for Covid-19 prior to leaving their home location to join the ship and must receive a negative result. They will also take a Covid-19 test at embarkation; quarantine for seven days upon arrival; be tested again at the end of that seven-day period and must receive a negative result before beginning their duties. According to Jack Anderson, when vaccines are widely available, they will be a requirement of employment for crew which must be completed at least 14 days prior to service.
