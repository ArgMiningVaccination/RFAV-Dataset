This gentle approach addresses mind, body and spirit. Your wellness will be evaluated through the lens of Eastern and Western practices, and we'll develop a treatment plan that is customized to you. Your treatment will primarily be Zen Shiatsu but we will integrate theories from Traditional Chinese Medicine, Massage Therapy, Physical Therapy, Yoga, Meditation, Qigong and Reiki. Zen Shiatsu is a Japanese style bodywork rooted in Tradition Chinese Medicine with the goal of obtaining physical and emotional harmony and balance. This subtle yet powerful work is non-invasive and drug free. It's acupressure. It's similar to acupuncture but without the needles, traversing the same Chinese Meridians and acupoints and utilizing the pressure of fingers, palms, elbows or even knees. You will receive stretches and movements similar to yoga. Treatment is full body, on the table and fully clothed. Shiatsu helps with many different health concerns including stress, anxiety, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, depression, low energy, trauma, irregular menses, gastrointestinal issues, headaches, palpitations, insomnia and even sports injuries. The list goes on. Let's restore the balance. Contact me to book your appointment. Marie Sian, AOBTA-CP, "}
