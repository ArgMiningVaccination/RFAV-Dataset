All Rights Reserved. Vocera COVID -19 Use Case Library Our Vocera \u00ae COVID -19 Response Task Force has compiled simple configurations of our technology that customers can use to make communication more efficient and potentially more effective in this pandemic. Some of these use cases were defined and put into production by our customers. Others come from our own ideas and experience. All begin by defining a scenario in which a customer would find themselves during these unprecedented times. Our service and support teams at Vocera can help you implement many of these use cases at no cost if you don't have time or are not sure how. Large deployments of some more complex use cases may require a paid services engagement; ask about our special COVID -19 prici ng promotions.

All Rights Reserved. Improv e Capacity and Throughput with Safe Patient Flow 1. Communicate safely and efficiently while wearing PPE. Staff can wear the Vocera Smartbadge or Badge under PPE , with or without a wired or Bluetooth headset, to communicate safely throughout a shift and preserve PPE. Enable hot word detection on the Smartba dge so staff can say, \"OK Vocera\" to initiate communication completely hands -free. Staff receiving a message on the Smartbadge or Badge can say, \"Play text messages\" and the Vocera Genie will recite the message. Staff can respond to the message verbally us ing the \"Record a message\" command . 2. Prepare ED staff for an incoming COVID -19 patient. Configure your solution so EMS can communicate with ED staff while in transit with a suspected COVID -19 patient. Examples include an EMT using a Vocera smartphone app to call the ED charge nurse on his or her Vocera Smartbadge or smartphone app. The ED charge nurse can instruct the EMT to bring the patient to the negative pressure room and send an urgent broadcast to the incident response team (i.e., \"Code 19: ETA 7 min utes, ED Bay 4\"). Care team members can don PPE prior to the patient's arrival . 3. Safely admit and triage a walk -in patient who is possibly COVID -19 positive. If a walk -in patient is showing COVID -19 symptoms, the triage nurse can send an Urgent Broadcast ( i.e. \"Code 19 Triage Area\") to the appropriate response team from their Vocera Smartbadge or Badge while wearing PPE . 4. Mobilize response teams. Communicate urgent information quickly to a specific group, such as a COVID -19 response team, without overhead paging. A user can send a message using a Vocera template or place a call from their Vocera Smartbadge, Badge, or smartphone app. For example, an EMT en route to the hospital with a suspected COVID -19 patient can tell the COVID -19 response team they're co ming. The response team can then prepare for the incoming patient . 5. Mobilize your COVID -19 leadership team. Quickly communicate urgent information to your leadership group by configuring message templates. For example, send an urgent request to join a conference call, or updates on triage area backlog. 3 \u00a92021 Vocera Communications. All Rights Reserved. 6. Accelerate room turnover workflows . Configure your system so that a bed cleaning request alert is sent to Housekeeping/EVS to clean the room as soon as staff enter patient discharge or transfer information into the electronic health record. Housekeeping/EVS receives a bed cleaning request on their Vocera S martbadge or Badge and is prompted to verbally respond when the cleaning is in progress and complete. Responses from Housekeeping/EVS can automatically update the status in the electronic health record in real time . Find People Easily in Quickly Changing Environments 1. Offload the need to remember who's working on the COVID -19 team. Use the On -Call Schedule feature for COVID -19 team scheduling.

Unify staff wo rking in a multi -campus environment. Address Book entries can be defined for specific hospital sites within a health system, or they can be assigned for the entire health system - the Global Site. By assigning roles and specialty information to entries in the Global Address Book, anyone within the health system can reach individuals by name, role, or specialty from their Vocera Smartbadge, Badge, or smartphone app. For example, a community -based physician whose patient is hospitalized at a health system's m ain campus can easily connect with the on -call physician of the team caring for the patient. Similarly, if a referring physician needs to locate and contact an appropriate subspecialist for a question or consultation, information within the directory can h elp speed that process. 4. Enable instant communication with COVID -19 specific teams. Enable users to quickly and easily call or send a message to all members of a COVID -19 response group.
