The complaints that Dr. Suhas hears on a daily basis, from high body weight, low energy, and poor sleep, to headaches, unexplained congestion, and depression, all have a surprising common denominator: a weak digestive \"fire.\" Drawing on traditional Indian practices and principles, The Hot Belly Diet shows you how to optimize your digestive powers to foster rapid weight loss and vibrant health. At the core of this three-phase diet that makes lunch the most important meal of the day is a dish called khichadi (pronounced kitch-a-de)\u2014a completely nutritious but incredibly easy-to-make meal that helps clear out your \"ama,\" or the digestive sludge that antagonizes weight loss, provokes hormonal imbalances, and ultimately triggers inflammation\u2014the root cause of virtually all disease. This unique book also explains what foods are incompatible (milk and eggs, for example), why the sensation of hunger is essential, and how to time your meals throughout the day to avoid snacking. The Hot Belly Diet changes your relationship with food to make healthy eating\u2014and living\u2014effortless. Whether you're suffering from a chronic condition, looking to prevent future illness, or just want to feel your best every day, The Hot Belly Diet will re-establish your body's natural balance, creating a thinner, healthier, and happier you.
