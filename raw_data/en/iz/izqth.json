This plan may help prevent illness based on your current health and risk factors. Keep in mind that the AWV is not a head-to-toe physical. Also, this service is similar to but separate from the one-time [Welcome to Medicare preventive visit](https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-covered-services/preventive-services/welcome-to-medicare-preventive-visit). Eligibility Medicare Part B covers the Annual Wellness Visit if: - You have had Part B for over 12 months - And, you have not received an AWV in the past 12 months Additionally, you cannot receive your AWV within the same year as your Welcome to Medicare preventive visit.

This means you pay nothing (no deductible or coinsurance). Medicare Advantage Plans are required to cover AWVs [without applying deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance](https://www.medicareinteractive.org/get-answers/medicare-covered-services/preventive-services/preventive-services-overview) when you see an in-network provider and meet Medicare's eligibility requirements for the service. During the course of your AWV, your provider may discover and need to investigate or treat a new or existing problem. This additional care is considered diagnostic, meaning your provider is treating you because of certain symptoms or risk factors. Medicare may bill you for any diagnostic care you receive during a preventive visit. "}
