Mutations present in this virus strain might lead to false negative PCR /molecular test r esults in a test that your office or laboratory provider may be using. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed specific guidelines for manufacturers that outline each company's responsibility to test its product's reliability i n the face of novel variants. These guidelines are publicly available on the FDA's website. Neither ADPH nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has jurisdiction or authority over these processes. Using data submitted by manufacturers an d based on the specific mechanism of the test, the FDA can release preliminary guidance on tests that may fail to detect a novel SARS -CoV-2 variant. These tests are listed on the FDA's website and are subject to change based on further investigation or wi th the development of future variants. ADPH recommends that all facilities offer ing testing regularly check the FDA's website to determine if the test applicable to you may be subject to further review or may be likely to fail. If this is discovered, it is recommended that you contact the manufacturer and consider using a different testing option until further review has been accomplished. This verification is the responsibility of the manufacturer, not the FDA, the CDC, or ADPH.

After careful review, the committee unanimous ly reco mmend ed that individuals prefer entially rece ive an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine over Johnson & Johnson's COVID -19 vaccine due to the rare risk of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) . This aligns with recommendations from other countries such as Canad a and the United Kingdom. Currently, there is a plentiful supply of mRNA vaccines in the U.S. The committee did reaffirm that receiving any vaccine is better than being unvaccinated and that individuals who are unable or unwilling to receive an mRNA vac cine will continue to have access to Johnson & Johnson's COVID -19 vaccine after a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits with their provider "}
