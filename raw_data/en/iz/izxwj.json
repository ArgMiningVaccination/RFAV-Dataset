The categorisation of a product is determined by its ingredients, its purpose for use and the manner in which it is presented in the market. Ingredients Products categorised as dietary supplements, supplemented foods, cosmetics, or related products are not permitted to contain ingredients scheduled as Controlled Drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 or scheduled as prescription medicines, restricted (pharmacist-only) medicines or pharmacy-only medicines under the Medicines Act 1981. [Medsafe's searchable database](../profs/class/classintro.asp) can be used to check whether an ingredient is scheduled under the Medicines Act. When searching for a substance in the schedule remember to check synonyms if the initial seach gives a \"not found\" result. Lists of Controlled Drugs can be found in Schedules at the end of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Purpose for use A fundamental consideration is whether you intend your product to have a therapeutic purpose. [The definition of therapeutic purpose in the Medicines Act is wide.](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1981/0118/latest/DLM55001.html) If a therapeutic purpose is intended for your product, and is not a medical device, it will be a medicine or related product. If you intend marketing a product as a \"complementary health care product\", \"natural health product\", or dietary supplement, you should first determine whether you intend it to have a therapeutic purpose. The following should be considered: - Whether the product contains a scheduled substance. A substance that has been scheduled under the medicine legislation is regarded as a medicine when provided for administration or application to humans. [Scheduled substances can be searched on our website.](../profs/class/classintro.asp) - Marketing materials, including; - the product label statements and claims, - websites, - depictions and context of advertising, for example advertising depicting a pharmacist selling a product to a patient could suggest it has a therapeutic purpose, - education sessions, - testimonials, - provision of, references to or links to information about past or present traditional use, - social media posts and use of influencer generated material, - television, radio, digital and print media. [Whether the product meets the definition of a medicine in the Medicines Act.](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1981/0118/latest/DLM54687.html) - The expected use of the product. Therapeutic claims are not permitted for products supplied as dietary supplements, supplemented foods or cosmetics. Independent advice is available on whether a claim implies a therapeutic purpose. The Association of New Zealand Advertisers offers a [ Therapeutic Advertising Pre-vetting Service (TAPS)](http://www.anza.co.nz/Category?Action=View&Category_id=262). For a fee an adjudicator will assess labels and advertising material and advise if it is compliant with NZ legislation. TAPS also offer advice on how statements could be modified to avoid non-compliance with the Medicines Act 1981. Alternatively there are a number of regulatory affairs consultants who specialise in advertising compliance. [A list is available on this web site](consultants.asp). Another useful resource is the [ TAPS website](http://www.anza.co.nz/Category?Action=View&Category_id=265). This website contains some guidelines on therapeutic claims and provides examples of claims that do not imply a therapeutic purpose. Other sources of information Distributors wishing to import unprocessed plant or animal material, should contact [ NZ Biosecurity](http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/) to determine which import standards apply. The [New Zealand Customs Service](http://www.customs.govt.nz/) is also able to advise on the requirements for commercial importation. Copies of all the New Zealand Acts and Regulations discussed above may be downloaded for free from [www.legislation.govt.nz ](http://www.legislation.govt.nz) The following can be used to determine the appropriate regulatory coverage for a product.
