P.22 P.26ACCELERATING PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH Lurie Cancer Center receives $11 million National Cancer Institute grantPRICELESS GIFTS 1 Donor, 7 Organs, 5 Recipients, 34 hours FALL 2015 1This fall we received a four-year, $27.2 million Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), renewing the Northwest- ern University Clinical and Translational Sciences (NUCATS) Institute. The grant recognizes NUCATS' stellar work, and will allow us to continue accelerating transla-tional research across six Northwestern University schools, with three clinical partners, including Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Chil- dren's Hospital of Chicago and the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. Since 2007, NUCATS has served more than 3,000 investigators and assisted in the publica- tion of nearly 1,000 scientific papers. NUCATS supports translational research from inception to dissemination. For example, NUCATS research studio consulta- tions identify resources to support new grant applications; the Multidisciplinary Mentored Career Development (KL2) program ensures protected time for faculty mentored research and training; and Galter Health Sciences Library helps disseminate and assess the impact of findings. Feinberg supports the NUCATS infra- structure made available to our investigators, but this new funding will enable further innovation, breaking down barriers in the translational research pipeline and helping transform discoveries into real-world treatments. We're accelerating our ability to advance discovery and put that knowledge into the hands of physicians. One of the main goals of our CTSA, aligned with the NIH's focus on speeding up the clinical trial process, is to integrate research into clinical care systems, with the goal that every clinical encounter becomes an opportunity for research and learning to improve human health. While that may sound ambitious, it is within our grasp: With the CTSA's support, we also have access to an extremely mature data platform, the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW), which contains information on 4.9 million patients, collected in partnership with our main clinical partner, Northwestern Memorial HealthCare. \"Every clinical encounter becomes an opportu- nity for research\" means that we are working to gather patient information and make sure it is accurately entered it into electronic health records (EHR), leading to more accurate reports about diseases with less effort. These improvements will allow us to be predictive and preventive, selecting treatments providing the best possible outcomes. We know that the NMEDW can be leveraged in this way because Sanjiv Shah, '00 MD, a cardiologist and scientist at Feinberg, has already demonstrated it. With NUCATS's help (as was highlighted in the Summer 2015 issue of Northwestern Medicine Magazine), Dr. Shah obtained information about hard-to-find patients with specific types of heart failure for his research. Using nearly eight years of NMEDW data, he uncovered three distinct types of patients with the condition, each requiring different protocols. Before this discovery, these patients were all treated with the same approach and by different specialists. Today, they are referred to his clinic. That kind of precision medicine is possible when you develop a data platform enabling continuous learning. Emilie Powell, MD, '09 GME, an emer- gency physician and Feinberg assistant professor, also united clinical and data- mining expertise to investigate emergency department sepsis. Utilizing the NMEDW, she identified 376 patients with sepsis, and developed a detailed simulation that she tested in real emergency departments. Her findings are already being used to help train Northwestern Medicine Leadership Northwestern Medicine emergency medicine residents. This research shows how innovative use of informatics can create a linkage between our clinical, research and teaching activities, advancing scientific discovery while training the next generation of clinical leaders. Bing Ho, MD, MPH, a transplant nephrolo- gist at the Kovler Organ Transplantation Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and a Feinberg assistant professor, enlisted NMEDW to develop a dashboard to quickly analyze kidney transplant data. This dashboard has already led to improvement in patient and allograft survival. This innovation shows how aligning Feinberg's leading-edge research with world-class clinical resources results in the rapid development of tech- niques improving the lives of patients. Accelerating clinical research doesn't stop once new knowledge is uncovered: Our Galter Health Sciences Library, part of our CTSA, can assess and disseminate findings so other scientists can use our discoveries to benefit patients. Galter's Metrics and Impact Core assesses research impact, and optimizes visibility and research dissemina- tion. Although EHRs have not always been designed with research in mind, a team of informatics experts is available to support clinical research data collection, including through EHR-based informatics consultations. Our scientists and physician-scientists are at the forefront of their fields; leverag- ing the resources of NUCATS and the CSTA means that we are better equipped than ever before to generate groundbreaking discoveries that drive medicine. It is an exciting time for clinical medicine and research at Northwestern Medicine. With warm regards, Eric G. Neilson, MD Vice President for Medical Affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine 2 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINEThe Sunshine Charitable Foundation recently pledged to create the Bunning Chair for Food Allergy Research within the Department of Medicine's Division of Allergy/Immunology at Feinberg.

Remember, there is no substitute for competence; that civility costs nothing and buys everything; manage your biases... be caring, be compassionate.\" Founders' Day, held this year on August 14, is an annual celebra- tion honoring Feinberg's founders and welcoming the entering class of first-year medical students to the medical profession. At the beginning of the ceremony, Eric G. Neilson, MD, vice president for Medical Affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean, wel-comed guests. \"The founders conceived and introduced a new model of education with standards that have attracted students for over 156 years, who have become outstanding physicians, scientists and leaders,\" Dr. Neilson said. He asked students to consider what they might do to improve the profession and human health beyond the individual patient. \"This is an important question deserving your attention over the next few years,\" explained Dr. Neilson. \"Rest assured that within the broad opportunities at Feinberg, you'll find a problem to solve. Feinberg, as it always has, will prepare you well for whatever path you choose to follow.\" Second-year medical students and mentors presented each member of the Class of 2019 with his or her white coat. \"It's great to get our white coats and have a physical symbol of the first step in our journey to become physicians,\" said Javier Suarez, a first-year medical student. \"I am looking forward to starting the year and learning new things in science, as well as treating patients in the future.\" Kaitlyn Sacotte, another first-year medical student, said she enjoyed being presented her white coat by second-year student Taylor Sutcliffe. \"It was great to have someone there to welcome you and usher you into the profession,\" Sacotte said. \"I'm looking forward to not only learning about medicine, but also getting to know my classmates.\" Brianna Knoll, president of the Medical School Student Senate and a third-year medical student, presented the Student Senate Service Awards to second-year students, in recognition of their community service and leadership at the local, national and WRITTEN BY: Sarah Plumridge international levels. Selected by their peers, award recipients were: John Campo, Srivar- shini Cherukupalli, Anthony Garcia, Noelle Martinez and Andy Nian. Before attending the Nathan Smith Davis Founders' Day reception, sponsored by the Medical Alumni Association, students recited the Declaration of Geneva, the modern-day equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath. \"The ceremony really made me feel initiated into a profession,\" said Jessica Quaggin-Smith, a first-year medical student. \"As we put on our white coats together, I felt like I was a part of a community.\" KEYNOTE SPEAKER CLYDE YANCY, MD, STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPETENCE, CIVILITY AND COMPASSION IN MEDICINE.

This summer, chief medical residents partic- ipated in the first Chief Resident Retreat, hosted by the Feinberg Academy of Medical Educators (FAME) and the McGaw Medical Center of Northwestern University, learning about topics including conflict resolution, leadership, negotiation and work-life balance. FAME, established in 2009, plays a critical role at Northwestern Medicine in the recognition and support of outstanding medical educators. Since being appointed as director of FAME in 2014, Michael Gisondi, MD, associate professor of Emergency Medicine, has grown the academy's membership to more than 80 members and developed new programming, with an emphasis on further supporting graduate medical education activities. \"We had never done a chief medical retreat before, and it was a good opportunity for FAME members to gather around certain topics that were familiar and give them an opportunity to teach residents,\" says Dr. Gisondi. \"We train people to be great teachers.\" Other new programing this year includes the Today's Innovations in Medical Educa- tion (TIME) lecture series, a monthly series that highlights advances in technology, new teaching and emerging best practices in health professions education. The inaugural TIME lecture featured Seth Trueger, MD, MPH, assistant professor at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. He touted the advantages of WRITTEN BY: Sarah Plumridge using Twitter as a platform for dialogue among physicians and identified opportuni- ties to incorporate social media in teaching activities. He also demonstrated how to use the platform. Other TIME presentations have taught attendees how to use a smartphone app that was developed by faculty in the Department of Surgery to document learner competency, and how to increase learner engagement by incorporating the flipped classroom, where the typical lecture and homework elements of a course are reversed. In the future, Dr. Gisondi says he also hopes to develop a certificate program in medical education. Each year FAME hosts Medical Education Day, an annual celebration of teaching and medical education scholarship, featuring workshops, presentations and awards. Highlights of this year's event, held on September 25, included ultra-short didactic lectures and moderated research presenta- tions, along with workshops on designing and writing curriculum, developing objective structured clinical examination cases and creating interactive educational sessions. \"We had a number of wonderful present- ers in the program,\" says Dr. Gisondi. FAME created a new set of teaching awards this year to \"honor the folks on the ground, who are doing the hard work and teaching in the threads, the elements and the phases,\" according to Dr. Gisondi. Threads, elements and phases are three of the components of Feinberg's medical education curriculum. The event recognized 69 faculty promotions, 16 teaching awards, five presentation winners and 24 new inductees to the academy. MICHAEL GISONDI, MD, HAS BIG PLANS FOR ENHANCING MEDICAL EDUCATION AT FEINBERG. 8 MAGAZINE.NM.ORG First Physician Director Heads CME at Feinberg As the first medical director of Feinberg's Office of Continuing Medical Education (CME), Clara Schroedl, '06 MD, '09 GME, instructor of Medicine in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, will oversee plans to expand and improve current education offerings through innovation and technology. Also on her agenda will be the office's upcoming reaccreditation. \"It's an exciting time for us,\" says Dr. Schroedl. \"CME has never had a medical director before, so I hope to provide some new insight and ideas for innovation, in addition to continuing to do what we already do and deliver.\" Feinberg's CME program offers and provides credit for live events such as conferences and regularly scheduled series, including grand rounds and journal clubs. In 2014, the office accredited 1,897 live courses, 97 series, 11 live Internet courses and 41 enduring materials. It also served nearly 40,000 physicians, from Northwest-ern and far beyond. The medical school has \"Accreditation with Commendation\" status by the Accredi- tation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) through March 31, 2017. To again achieve this highest level of ACCME accreditation, Feinberg must demonstrate the values and attributes necessary to make the greatest impact on health care, patient outcomes and physi- cian practice. \"As we look ahead to our reaccredita- tion, we will be highlighting our efforts to integrate CME into professional practice, identify and overcome barriers to high quality education, build bridges with our community and integrate our efforts into the institutional framework of quality improvement,\" she says. WRITTEN BY: Sarah Plumridge Representatives from multiple sub- specialties at the medical school, the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago participate on the CME review committee. Reviewing applications for CME activities, the committee ensures they are of the highest quality and free from commercial bias. Additionally, the group looks for activities that incorporate active learning, such as hands-on demon- strations or simulation and small group breakout sessions. As physician certification maintenance evolves, the office plans to integrate the American Board of Internal Medicine's Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program and accredited CME. \"As the Northwestern community grows, we hope to engage our affiliates and be the best resource possible for our health care provider's continuing professional development,\" says Dr. Schroedl. \"Northwestern providers are located all over the Chicagoland area. We want to grow our program to meet the needs of all of these learners.\" Dr. Schroedl plans to develop more online content and bring more innovative teaching techniques to CME, including simulation modules, audience response systems and small-group learning. \"You can always sit down in a classroom and listen to a lecture, but there are other exciting, more innovative ways to provide education and we can study those inter- ventions to see if they are making a difference in patient outcomes and physician performance,\" she says. \"Using simulation can improve the cognitive, technical and professional skills of our healthcare providers.\" NEW CME DIRECTOR CLARA SCHROEDL'S FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WILL BE TO OVERSEE THE OFFICE'S REACCREDITATION. FALL 2015 9CAMPUS NEWS Research Briefs Protein Found to Control Inflammatory ResponseData Mining DNA for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Genes Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has been passed down in many families for generations \u2014 causing reproductive and metabolic health problems for millions of women. Yet, its cause remains unknown. PCOS affects seven to 10 percent of reproductive-age women worldwide with symptoms such as increased male-pattern hair growth, weight gain, irregular periods and infertility. A new Northwestern Medicine genome-wide association study of PCOS \u2014 the first of its kind to focus on women of European ancestry \u2014 has provided important new insights. Using the DNA of thousands of women and genotyping nearly 700,000 genetic markers from each individual, an international team led by North- western Medicine investigators has identified two new genetic susceptibility regions that appear to be unique to European women, as well as one region also present in Chinese women. Most importantly, one of these new regions contains the gene for the pituitary hormone gonadotropin, FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), providing evidence that disruption in this ovarian function-regulating pathway plays an essential role in the develop- ment of PCOS. The study was published in Nature Communications.\"Identifying the genes associated with PCOS gives us clues about the biological pathways that cause the disorder,\" says senior author Andrea Dunaif, MD, Charles F. Kettering Professor of Endo- crinology and Metabolism. As a result of previous research from Dr. Dunaif's lab, PCOS also is associated with insulin resistance and is now recognized as a leading risk factor for type-2 diabetes in young women. This study was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health Medicine study shows that a protein called POP1 prevents severe inflammation and, potentially, diseases caused by excessive inflammatory responses. The paper, pub- lished in Immunity, describes how POP1 blocks a pro-inflammatory mediator called IL-1b. \"Inflammation is controlled by a complex network of regulators that is still poorly understood,\" says senior author Christian Stehlik, PhD, John P. Gallagher Research Professor of Rheumatology. \"Here, we describe a novel inhibitor of the inflammatory response.\" Stehlik worked with co-senior author Andrea Dorfleutner, PhD, research assistant professor of Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology and a team headed by postdoctoral fellow Lucia de Almeida, PhD. They found that mice expressing POP1 were protected from systemic inflammation. Those mice also recovered more quickly than controls from inflammatory diseases, including peritonitis, sepsis and cryopyrinopathy. Interestingly, the scientists also discovered that human patients with cryopyrinopathy and sepsis have less POP1 in their immune cells than others. The scientists believe that treatments based on POP1 could improve many inflammatory diseases. This research was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant CA060553; Skin Disease Research Center grant AR057216; American Heart Association grant 13GRNT17110117; an ATS/Scleroderma Foundation; and British Heart Foundation grant RG/10/15/28578. 10 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINEMitochondria work like a power plant inside cells to regulate energy supply. When mitochondrial health is destroyed a lot can go wrong, especially when the attacker is associated with fatal diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In a new study, Northwestern Medicine scientists showed direct mitochondrial destruction by a protein from the FUS gene, one of the genes associated with ALS, as well as frontotemporal lobar Unexpected Link to ALS and Dementia Northwestern Medicine scientists have helped develop an implant- able device that detects early breast cancer metastatic cells, a method that may enable physicians to identify cancer spreading in patients while treatments are still viable. In a study published in Nature Communications, the scientists demonstrated that small, spongy scaffolds implanted into breast Implant Detects Spreading Cancer Cells Earlydegeneration (FTLD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. This damage seems to occur early on in disease progression, making mitochondrial health an emerging area of interest for scientists developing early diagnostic tools and therapies. The discovery was published in PLOS Genetics in September.\"FUS mitochondrial localization is toxic to neurons, contributing to neurodegeneration,\" says Jane Wu, MD, PhD, Dr. Charles L. Mix Research Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. \"We are actively working on developing new diagnostic tools based on mitochondrial damage for neurological diseases. We hope that earlier diagnosis before the disease progresses to an irreversible stage is critical for successful treatment.\" Early diagnosis will allow scientists to develop therapeutic approaches that enhance patients' quality of life and possibly reduce fatalities. This was an interdisciplinary collaboration among scientists from Feinberg and the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Nanjing University. The Chinese team was funded by Ministry of Science and Technology - China 973 Projects (2010CB529603 & 2013CB917803, 2010CB529603) and NSFC grant (91132710). The Feinberg team was supported by the ALS Therapy Alliance and National Institutes of Health grants NIA P30 AG13854, R56NS074763, U54 CA151880 and RO1AG033004. cancer mouse models could recruit and capture cancer cells released from primary tumor sites early in the metastatic process, before the cells impact additional organs. \"We set out to create a sort of decoy \u2014 a device that's more attractive to cancer cells than other parts of the patient's body,\" says senior author Lonnie Shea, PhD, adjunct professor of Fertil- ity Preservation in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The scientists envision that the scaffold could be implanted just beneath the skin of patients who have a high risk of cancer recurrence. Physicians could then monitor it for an early indica- tion that malignant cells are circulating in the bloodstream. In the study, cancer cells spread to the lungs 88 percent slower in mice with the implants. The scientists designed the scaffold to take advantage of the immune system, which has been shown to mediate metastasis in several cancers. The immune system perceives that the scaffold is a foreign object in the body and sends immune cells to ward it off. Doing so lures cancer cells to the scaffold, too. This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant R01CA173745 and the Northwestern H Foundation Cancer Research Award. FALL 2015 11Northwestern researchers use every means possible to fight HIV/AIDSWRITTEN BY: Cheryl SooHoo 14 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINEIn June 1981 the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention published a report about a mysterious illness affecting young homosexual men in Los Angeles. The cause of the unfamiliar disease, eventually dubbed AIDS, would come to light in 1984 with the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Over a relatively short period of time, extraordinary advances in antiretro- viral therapy (ART) transformed HIV/AIDS from a universally fatal disease into a chronic condition. Now some 1.2 million Americans are living with the virus, according to the latest statistics from the CDC. At the dawn of the HIV epidemic, Northwestern University researchers were at the forefront of understanding the virus, developing therapies to combat AIDS and preventing new infections. Before HIV was even discovered, Northwestern became one of the founding sites in 1983 for the landmark Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) \u2014 the first and longest running study of the natural history of AIDS. In 2008 the journal Science listed Northwestern among the top 10 institutions making the biggest impact on fighting the disease. Today the battle still rages on, with multidisciplinary experts on both campuses working to prevent and perhaps, even cure HIV, which infects some 40,000 new individuals each year and leads to the premature aging of those with long- term exposure to the virus and ART. The depth and breadth of HIV/AIDS research at Northwestern Medicine continues to expand and evolve. Our basic, clinical and translational scientists routinely publish in the field's top peer- reviewed journals and successfully compete for highly coveted National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants. Here's just a sampling of how Northwestern investigators are working to defeat this still deadly and widespread global disease. A UNITED FRONT With the largest HIV-infected population in the world, South Africa maintains a solid lead, but Chicago is unfortunately catching up in the ratings game \u2014 of recently diagnosed HIV infections, that is. In the United States, young men who have sex with men (YMSM) have the highest rate of new cases reported each year. In Chicago, HIV infection in this demographic group (ages 16-29) is rising at a disturbing five percent annually, with most cases occurring in black gay men. Feinberg School of Medicine investigators hope to reverse this trend with the support of a recent $6.25 million NIH grant awarded to Northwestern Medicine and other Chicago-area academic, municipal and community partners in August. The federal funding will support the creation of the Third Coast Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) to quell the HIV epidemic among young men in the Windy City. Richard D'Aquila, MD, CFAR director, head of the Northwestern HIV Translational Research Center and Howard Taylor Ricketts Professor of Medicine, has worked on a number of groundbreaking projects during his long career. This May, he and Harry Taylor, PhD, research assistant professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases, detailed in PLOS Pathogens an exciting discovery: how to take advantage of HIV's sugar fix as the virus can't live without it. In laboratory in vitro studies, researchers found a small molecule that blocks the virus' access to sugar and other nutrients in HIV-invaded 1.2 40 THOUSAND NEW HIV INFECTIONS EVERY YEAR MILLION AMERICANS LIVE WITHHIV/AIDS 5% ANNUAL INCREASE OF YMSM HIVINFECTIONS FALL 2015 15FEATURE: FROM BEGINNING TO HOPEFUL END BRIAN MUSTANSKI, PHD ROMANCE GONE VIRAL What does love have to do with HIV? Perhaps a great deal, according to Brian Mustanski, PhD, director of a recently launched Northwest- ern University-wide Institute for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and Wellbeing. \"It was often assumed that casual hookups put young gay men at the highest risk of HIV infection,\" says the co-director of CFAR and associate professor of Medical Social Sciences, who studies mental and behavioral factors as they relate to HIV/AIDS in young gay and bisexual men. \"Our research revealed that HIV transmission appears more likely to occur among individuals involved in serious romantic relationships. It's hard to have love without trust, and it's hard to self-protect when you have that trust. Understanding this tension allows us to develop and put into place interventions that address the compatibility of romance and HIV prevention.\" A translational behavioral scientist, Mustanski conducts research projects focused on HIV and LGBT health. The data he collects ultimately leads to novel HIV prevention tactics such as text messaging and social media to reach a younger generation of people at risk. He serves as the principal investigator of RADAR, a study aimed at identifying and understanding the connections among sexually transmitted diseases like HIV, alcohol and drug immune cells. This sugar-free diet prevented the virus from replicating itself in human cells, without harming the cells in vitro. Another significant research effort in the D'Aquila lab focuses on novel drug therapies to boost a defensive immune system protein called APOBEC3G (or A3 for short) to achieve sustained remission after ART stops or, optimistically speaking, a cure. He and his colleagues discovered that more ample stores of cellular A3 appear to enable one percent of HIV-infected individuals to control the virus naturally and without antiviral drugs. First published in 2013 in PLOS ONE, this finding has important implications for shortening ART, which, along with continuing chronic inflammation caused by the virus, may contribute to the premature onset of health problems such as heart disease and stroke in this patient population. Cross-campus collaborations have proven fruitful. Chisu Song, PhD, research assistant professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases, partnered with investigator Gary Schiltz, PhD, at the Center for Molecular Innovation and Drug Discovery on the Evanston campus and D'Aquila to discover small molecules that increase cell A3 in vitro. The hope is that this will keep A3 from being depleted after HIV infection, and enable more of those infected to control HIV off of antiretroviral therapy. Planning to launch testing of promising A3 boosters discovered at NU in mice and then monkey models in 2016, Dr. D'Aquila sees the new CFAR as a valuable asset in accelerating research toward helping the other 99 percent of those with HIV control their disease off drug therapy. \"The center will reach out to a segment of the population now contracting the virus,\" says the professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases. \"This effort will provide us with the very individuals who we think would benefit most from new strategies for cure or sustained remission: the young people who are now becoming infected.\" RICHARD D'AQUILA, MD use and romantic or sexual patterns over time in YMSM. Supported by an $8.7 million five-year grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse awarded in 2014, this major research endeavor employs a multilevel approach, from looking at the micro level of genetics of the virus to the macro level of sexual and social networks. \"Not only are we creating one of the largest longitudinal studies of young gay and bisexual men and their romantic partners,\" says Mustanski, \"but we are also creating new ways to integrate across different social science and biomedical pieces involved in driving new HIV infections.\" PREVENTIVE MEASURES Tried and true methods to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV exist to keep the virus at bay. Condoms, abstinence or popping an oral antiviral pill once a day work well \u2014 when used. The problem? Not enough of those at most risk for contracting the virus take the necessary precautions to safeguard themselves and others. Building another defense against HIV infection, Northwestern Medicine scientists have recently embarked on an extensive multidisciplinary endeavor to develop an innovative implantable drug system. They hope to design a subcutaneous implant that will automatically deliver a controlled dose of antiretroviral medication such as cabotegravir and last for up to a year. Supported by a recently awarded $17.5 million National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) grant, biomedical engineer Patrick Kiser, PhD, and immunologist Thomas Hope, PhD, are co-PIs of the Sustained Long-Acting Protection Against HIV (SLAP HIV) program aimed at protecting individuals who need it most. \"The virus frequently targets the dispossessed, the uninformed or those who think they are invincible,\" says Kiser, associate professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Biomedical Engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering. \"We need more tools to decrease transmission rates. HIV is an insidious virus. You can't take your eye off of it for a moment.\" A viable vaccine for HIV has remained elusive since its discovery more than three 16 MAGAZINE.NM.ORG THOMAS HOPE, PHD PATRICK KISER, PHD decades ago. The virus' uncanny ability to thwart the immune system has stymied scientists the world over. Hope, professor of Cell and Molecular Biology, Obstetrics and Gynecology and Biomedical Engineering, has focused his work on mucus and its potential role in fighting invading pathogens such as HIV. Found in many areas of the human body, mucus contains antibodies produced by our immune system to create a protective barrier. The Hope laboratory has studied how HIV moves in this environment, searching for molecules that might offer the best defense against the virus. The investigators recently discovered tight binding sites in antibodies residing in mucin, the protein that makes up mucus, which tether pathogens and then allow the mucus to expel them. This finding has the potential to advance progress toward a vaccine. Says Hope, \"By understanding how some antibodies interact with certain mucin, we might be able to identify approaches that will move us closer to developing an effective vaccination against HIV.\" STEVEN WOLINSKY, MD GENOMICS OF HIV HIV thoroughly takes advantage of its infected host. It targets the very immune response that would normally kill it to replicate or lie dormant for years. Taking advantage of human proteins, HIV invades immune cells and convinces the host DNA to help it copy itself over and over again. But not every host or person is a willing participant based on their unique genetic makeup. \"In our lab, we seek host cell genetic variants that protect some people from HIV infection or disease progression,\" says Steven Wolinsky, MD, '82 GME, chief of Infectious Diseases and Samuel J. Sackett Professor of Medicine. \"Natural variations in the expression levels of human proteins typically borrowed by the virus can hinder HIV replication and significantly impact how the immune system fights off the virus.\" The Wolinsky laboratory studies the extent of human genetic variations that influence HIV/AIDS susceptibility by analyzing the genomes of hundreds of HIV-infected patients. Better understanding how our DNA contributes to the evolution of the virus and development of AIDS and other diseases could lead to potential drug targets and improvements in patient care. A renowned HIV researcher and principal investi- gator of the prestigious Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study since 2000, Wolinsky has witnessed the great strides made in fighting the disease, but more still needs to be accomplished. \"Although advancements have made it possible for people with HIV to live much longer lives, they are aging faster and developing health problems more often seen in uninfected people 10 or 20 years their senior,\" he says. \"Through MACS and the efforts of investigators at Northwestern and around the world, we hope to better manage the care and treatment of people living with HIV/ AIDS and move closer to a functional cure.\" VISUALIZING THE SOCIAL NETWORKS OF YMSM IN CHICAGO PROVIDES IMPORTANT CLUES TO UNDER- STANDING PATTERNS OF HIV TRANSMISSION AND DEVELOPING PREVENTION TACTICS.

Lesniak, MD, MHCM, never imagined he would become a physician because he saw that his mother, an obstetrician and gynecologist, was often rushing off at all hours to deliver babies. With a zeal for languages and culture, stoked by his family's eventual moves to Munich, Germany, and then to Chicago when he was a teenager, he thought he'd pursue a career in international law. But as an undergraduate at Harvard University, he came to realize that legal \"paperwork\" appealed to him much less than the science and human interaction of medicine. Today, as a world-renowned neurosurgeon and brain cancer researcher, Dr. Lesniak embraces the long hours of his profession because he loves what he does. \"I can't imagine doing anything else in life,\" says the new chair of the Department of Neurological Surgery at the Feinberg School of Medicine, who investigates biological approaches to attacking Patient- Centered Innovationmalignant brain tumors and works to translate that research into clinical thera- pies for his patients. Lesniak developed his passion for neurosurgical oncology while a student at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Nudged by his mentor, Catherine D. DeAngelis, MD, MPH, the fourth-year student served a month-long neurosurgical rotation under two Hopkins professors involved in cutting-edge research: then- neurosurgery chair Donlin M. Long, MD, PhD, and current chair Henry Brem, MD. \"I fell in love with the profession, mostly because of the people; I was fascinated by what they did,\" says Dr. Lesniak, noting that Dr. Brem had been leading clinical trials on the breakthrough drug Gliadel, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1996 for treating patients with recurring gliomas. \"I thought, 'Here is a field where you can focus on a certain disease, you can actually do research, and you can run clinical trials and do something amazing.'\" He stayed at Hopkins to complete in 2002 both a six-year neurosurgery residency and a two-year fellowship in neurosurgical oncology and immunology. Since then, Lesniak has become a leading researcher of glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive primary brain cancer. Acclaimed also for his surgical skills and patient care, he has received multiple FALL 2015 19accolades, including repeated listings in Castle Connolly's \"America's Top Doctors,\" and this year, the National Institutes of Health \"Outstanding Investigator Award.\" Currently the principal investigator or co-investigator of eight NIH-funded studies, totaling more than $25 million in grant support, Lesniak comes to North-western after 12 years at the University of Chicago, where he was a tenured professor of neurosurgery and neurology and the director of the Neuro-Oncology Research Laboratories. With more than 175 peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters, he collaborates with and mentors other oncological researchers in the fight against primary and metastatic brain cancer. \"I am absolutely thrilled to be here,\" says Lesniak, Michael J. Marchese Profes- sor at Feinberg. \"I think Northwestern is the vision of the future of medicine in this country. The amount of effort that is being dedicated to invest in people and the delivery of care and the science is unprec- edented. This is one of the reasons I wanted to be a part of it.\" BENCH TO BEDSIDE Lesniak describes his research as broad because it encompasses four domains: stem cell biology, nanotechnology, gene therapy and immunotherapy. \"In my opinion, those are four major areas where a lot of the biologically-based discoveries will be made,\" he says. \"This doesn't negate the importance of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. But my interest has been in these biologically-driven agents and developing them with the FDA for use in clinical trials.\" Fascinated by immunotherapy since his residency at Hopkins, Dr. Lesniak has been investigating what makes brain tumors immunosuppressant and why the immune system is weak in the context of brain cancer. Several years ago, he and his colleagues, as well as other research teams around the country, identified that the over-accumulation of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Tregs), especially thymus-derived natural Tregs, plays a key role in immunotherapeutic failure in patients who have glioblastoma multiforme. FEATURE: PATIENT-CENTERED INNOVATION A postdoctoral fellow mentored by Dr. Lesniak at the University of Chicago, Derek A. Wainwright, PhD, who is now an assis- tant professor, conducted research indicating that a tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme influences Tregs levels in malignant tumors. \"Once we identified this pathway and published our findings, we then worked with a pharmaceutical company that has an agent that inhibits this pathway to start a Phase I clinical trial,\" Dr. Lesniak explains. In the realm of stem cell biology, he points to work he has done over the past five years in conjunction with Karen Aboody, MD, who co-leads the developmen- tal cancer therapeutics program at City of Hope in California. In this venture sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Drs. Lesniak and Aboody have been developing a neural stem cell-based therapy for delivering an oncolytic virus to brain tumors. \"Karen and I have championed this to the FDA at numerous levels,\" says Dr. Lesniak, noting that he is about to finalize the investi- gational new drug (IND) application. \"I think we're going to have a trial in a year or two.\" The nanotechnology segment of his research remains in earlier stages. Initially working with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Lesniak and his team developed a way to target malignant cells using inorganic titanium dioxide nanoparticles, a photoreactive material that can bond with biomolecules. Linked to an antibody, these nanoparticles bind specifically to cancer cells and will interfere with their mitochon- dria, potentially destroying them when exposed to focused visible light. \"We're working on this line of research now with a group from the University of Cambridge \u2014 in terms of both optimizing the nanoparticles and building a machine that can actually deliver the magnetic field,\" Dr. Lesniak says. In addition to research and other facets of his career \u2014 teaching, writing and now, increasingly, administration \u2014 Lesniak maintains a robust neurosurgical practice.

I want to be a resource to everyone involved in coordinating a patient's care.\" At the University of Chicago, after clearing multiple hurdles, Dr. Lesniak even started an innovative, new pet therapy program: oncology patients could bring their own dogs to the hospital. \"I've had many patients who've been more concerned about being in a hospital for too long because they didn't know what was happening to their dog or cat,\" he explains. \"That was quite striking. If we are really taking care of people and their needs, and their needs include maintaining bonds, why should pets be treated differently? We need to recognize that they are an impor- tant part of providing care.\" A lifelong dog lover himself, Lesniak lives with a Portuguese water dog named Milo. His four-legged friend accompanied him to campus at the University of Chicago, initially to participate in a colleague's research project on canine interaction and patient stress levels. PROMOTING POSITIVE MORALE As head of neurosurgery at Northwestern, Dr. Lesniak, who is 45 and radiates youthful energy, says his priority is to create a positive work atmosphere that focuses on patients and their needs. \"We spend most of our day at work \u2014 10, 12 and sometimes 16 hours,\" he observes. \"By the time you get home, you may have only a couple of hours to spend with your loved ones before going to sleep. \"So it is very important for us to have a healthy working environment \u2014 collegial, enthusiastic, supportive, productive \u2014 which translates into happy people at home, who come back to work and actually want to be here. When we do that, we take that positive attitude to our patients.\" involves intracranial surgery to remove both benign and malignant tumors, including skull-based and pituitary tumors. He has performed many awake craniotomies when tumors reside close to critical functional locations in the brain. COMPASSIONATE, PERSONALIZED CARE With a warm and personable demeanor, Dr. Lesniak consistently earns high marks on physician-rating websites for his bedside manner and willingness to spend time with patients, as well as his diagnostic and surgical skills, promptness and follow-up care. \"When people call with a diagnosis of a brain tumor, it is one of the scariest moments in their lives... My philosophy has always been that we are here to make this experience as easy as possible on them,\" he says. Unless in the operating room all day or away from Chicago, \"I see people on their schedule, not mine.\" Another key aspect of his care approach is that he educates patients about their condition and provides options. \"Many patients I see with malignant brain cancer,\" notes Dr. Lesniak, \"come to me simply because they've not been given any hope or options.\" For patients diagnosed with malignant brain cancer, the standard of care is tumor resection, followed by chemotherapy with temozolomide and radiation therapy. \"If you look at the two-year survival of patients who are on these therapies, it's about 25 percent,\" says Dr. Lesniak. \"But without them, the survival rate drops to single digits.\" He hopes the biological therapies he is working to develop will significantly improve the prognosis for such patients. \"I think Northwestern is the vision of the future of medicine in this country.\" FALL 2015 21PRICELESS GIFTS DONOR RECIPIENTSORGANS HOURS 22 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINEWRITTEN BY: Martha O'Connell It's a huge adrenaline rush when an organ transplant is imminent\u2014 starting when that first call comes and a highly orchestrated process begins. But few hospitals can do everything right seven times\u2014all at the same time. Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH) answered this call last summer when Gift of Hope, the organ procurement organization for Illinois and northwest Indiana, notified them that seven organs from one donor were available if recipients matched. NMH and Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago had five very sick people who desperately needed them. Without hesitation, 120 clinicians and staff quickly responded to make sure every one of these transplants happened. \"Let's do it!\" exclaimed Juan Caicedo, MD, associate professor of Surgery, when he learned two kidneys and a pancreas were available. Ability to accelerate on a dime characterizes all the transplant teams, but their ability to conquer logistical and treatment challenges was also the reason why the lives of these five recipients changed dramatically over two days. To respect patient privacy, many names, dates and other identifying details are omitted from this story. It is important to note that everyone involved honors the donor and family who gave a heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and pancreas so that others might live. Gift of Hope made its first call to the liver team at 6:53 a.m., followed up with calls to the other transplant teams. Those notifica-tions set many moving parts of the process in motion and raised questions requiring immediate answers. Can the organ be brought to the recipient's hospital fast enough? Is the patient ready for transplant right now? Can the patient get to the hospital in time? When organs become available, many hospitals are notified but ultimately decline or are not selected for various reasons. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) authorizes a hospital as the primary acceptor of an organ when that facility has an available patient who is ranked at the top of the priority list, and the capability to perform transplants under tight constraints. Undaunted by the mass mobilization effort ahead, Northwestern accepted all the organs. \"Logistical details can make or break a transplant. All the health providers here had a tremendous commitment to make sure logistics did not prevent us from offering healthy organs to our patients,\" says Malcolm DeCamp Jr., MD, chief of the Division of JUAN CAICEDO Associate Professor of Surgery, Division of Organ Trans - plantationMALCOLM DECAMP Chief of the Division of Thoracic Surgery + Fowler McCormick Professor of Surgery CHRIS MALAISRIE Associate Professor of Surgery, Division of Cardiac Surgery PAM LEHNER Blood Bank Resource Coordinator ANTON SKARO Associate Professor of Surgery, Division of Organ Trans - plantation 1 Donor, 7 Organs, 5 Recipients, 34 hours FALL 2015 23FEATURE: PRICELESS GIFTS Thoracic Surgery and Fowler McCormick Professor of Surgery, who performed the bilateral lung transplant. SHIFT TO HIGH GEAR Three procurement teams were the first to hit the ground running to the local hospital where Gift of Hope staffs were caring for the donor. Teams of fellows, surgeons and nurses assessed the organs' functions and appearances to judge if they were viable for transplant. Then, they procured and specially packed the organs in coolers and started the tense trip back to downtown Chicago. Meanwhile, clinicians left their homes and assembled at NMH into five operating room teams, five anesthesia teams, three perfusion teams, three ICU teams, along with staff from three labs, pharmacy, housekeeping, pathology, radiology, social services, patient transfer and the blood bank. They waited, fixated on the moment when the organs would reach the ORs. Surgeons for each procedure served as point persons during the entire process for each organ, but absolute trust between team members kept events moving along smoothly. Numerous phone calls between all the teams at different locations monitored progress and enabled decisions about when to set the next step in motion, including when to put patients to sleep so anesthesia time was minimized. First stop for all transplant organs was NMH's blood bank, where identifiers were electronically and manually cross checked to ensure blood type and immune compatibilities. Blood supply was also issued for each procedure, and the organs were sent to the ORs. \"We keep our eyes on things very stringently, and this case got tricky because we got all the organs within about 45 minutes, which is a lot in a short time. We had one UNOS number for the same donor, and we had to make sure the right organ got to the right patient,\" explains Pam Lehner, MT (ASCP) SBB, Blood Bank resource coordinator. After the organs were released to the ORs, surgical teams inspected them again and began \"benching\" the organs. A process lasting up to several hours, benching means organs are prepared by trimming or extending vasculature to fit into the recipient's anatomy. For each team, the real euphoria began at milestones during each procedure when the kidney started to make urine, the heart beat, the smooth red liver produced bile and the lungs took a breath. \"You start with this limp, white lung. Then when you start to pass blood through it, it pinks up right away and it is one of the most beautiful things in medicine,\" Dr. DeCamp says. In multi-organ transplant, the heart is always harvested first, and the team with Chris Malaisrie, MD, associate professor of Surgery in the Division of Cardiac Surgery, was the first to save a life. \"It was 3 in the morning, but we were all standing there feeling really ecstatic when the heart rate monitor sounded a regular rhythm. We've done this so many times, and every time is so exhilarating.\" SUCCESSIVE SUCCESS Leveraging close proximity and expertise, pediatric patients at Lurie Children's Hospital and adults at NMH benefit from the Northwestern University Affiliated Transplant Centers (NUATC) program. The program enables Northwestern physicians to provide transplant care for pediatric patients, life-long follow-up and cooperative research between the institutions. Unlike the heart and lungs, abdominal organs have a longer \"shelf life\" with preservation before transplant. To take advantage of both available kidneys, Dr. Caicedo did back-to-back procedures. He transplanted one kidney in a patient at Lurie Children's Hospital, crossed the second-floor bridge linking to NMH and immediately prepped to transplant the pancreas and second kidney.TWO DAYS MANY LIVES CHANGED FOREVER 6:00 A.M. 9:00 A.M. 12:00 P.M. 3:00 P.M. 6:00 P.M.HEART LUNGS LIVER KIDNEY KIDNEY+PANCREASDAY1 Initial call from Gift of Hope KEY Patient arrives in OR Primary acceptance of organOrgan arrives in OR 24 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGorgan, restoring blood flow and watching it come back to life knowing what this means for your patient,\" says Anton Skaro, MD, PhD, associate professor of Surgery, who gave software developer Willy Jin a new liver. Jin, 42, remembers when transplant coordinator Aly Yoder, RN, called him the night of his wedding anniversary to tell him a healthy liver was available. \"Then it all came together at once, so quickly. I was very emotional at the time. I know that there were a lot of people involved, even if I did not meet all of them.\" Well into post-op, Jin feels his energy coming back and he is healing very well. \"Everybody says, 'I hope you are feeling better,' and that is very encouraging.\" Immediately after the procedure, he met another organ recipient recovering post-op, and they remain in touch. By UNOS standards, pulling off five simultaneous transplants is extraordinary. Last year, there were only 11 times when seven organs from the same donor were transplanted at one medical center. Northwestern enhanced its capability to save lives when it started its Lung Transplantation Program on Independence Day 2014. Adding this program meant that multiple organs from the same donor would likely become available. Northwestern prepared by creating additional transplant teams. Performing seven organ transplants on five people simultane- ously is an example of why Northwestern ranks among the nation's top transplant programs, as measured by volumes and patient outcomes. In 2014, NUATC led the country in the number of living donor liver transplants. The same year, NUATC teams performed the most pancreas and living donor kidney transplants in Illinois. One-year patient and graft (organ) survival rates compare very favorably with national statistics. \"I think it says a lot about all of us that we do this on a regular basis,\" says Dr. Skaro, \"and we love it.\" Kim Ostrander, an RN on the abdominal transplant team, was one of several nurses who circulated between NMH's OR and families in the waiting room to update them every two hours. \"It was a great feeling to help a patient who was dying from organ failure. I feel like this every time I help with a transplant,\" Ostrander says. When all the transplants were completed, nearly everyone had been working for 20-plus hours straight. Tired, yet elated that five patients had a new lease on life, the teams called it a day. For the morning shift just arriving, the day was beginning and the ORs were ready. PRODUCTIVE NIGHTS Most transplants take place at night into early morning during unpredictable times. Transplant experts accept this lifestyle because this mission is so important to them and they want to perform innovative treatments. \"Other medical professionals may not exactly envy our sched- ules, but there is nothing cooler in medicine than unclamping an \"It was a great feeling to help a patient who was dying from organ failure.

To help answer the most pressing questions about a disease that affects so many, Northwestern Medicine scientists have received a five-year, $11 million grant from the National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute (NCI) to lead a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) in prostate cancer. The SPORE comes with demanding requirements, notably completing four stud- ies that span the full translational research spectrum during the funding period. \"The whole philosophy of a SPORE grant is that you have to take basic science from the research bench and move it to the patient's bedside in five years,\" says William Catalona, william catalona, mdMD, principal investigator of the program. \"Many projects could never qualify because you won't see results in such an accelerated timeline. We're driven to apply this research to help patients as soon as we can.\" The NCI supports SPOREs devoted to 18 different organs and systems across the body, from the brain to the lungs, breast, kidneys, skin and so on. The program is highly competitive: Northwestern has one of only eight prostate SPOREs in the country, and the only SPORE of any kind in Illinois. Northwestern's program was first funded in 2001 and renewed in 2009. The brand- new grant represents an updated research agenda, with new collaborative projects that will be carried out by scientists and clinicians at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, the University of Chicago and NorthShore University HealthSystem. IDENTIFYING HIGH-RISK DISEASE The team's research focuses on two urgent issues in prostate cancer today. The first is differentiating between patients who have aggressive disease that requires immediate treatment and those who have milder disease that can be monitored with active surveillance, an approach involving regular tests to see if the cancer is growing to a point where it should be treated. \"A big controversy in the field is that there might be over-diagnosis and over- treatment of some patients who really don't need to be treated,\" says Dr. Catalona, who is also a professor of Urology at Feinberg. \"But the problem with putting patients who appear to have low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance is that up to 40 percent of them actually have areas of cancer that are much more aggressive than you think.\" Previous studies show that patients whose aggressive prostate cancer is treated too late \u2014 usually with surgery or radiation therapy \u2014 are cured in just half of all cases, highlighting the need for a better way of identifying them in the first place. In one of the SPORE projects, Dr. Catalona and collaborators from the University of California, San Francisco and NorthShore will study patients' germline genetic variants for differences in their inherited DNA. Using patient blood or saliva 17% 3%of all men will develop prostate cancerof all men will die from prostate cancerfig. 1Lurie Cancer Center Receives $11 Million National Cancer Institute GrantWRITTEN BY: Nora Dunne FALL 2015 27FEATURE: ACCELERATING PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH samples, the scientists hope to determine the genetic factors correlated with failed active surveillance. Ideally, the project will help clinicians decide which patients need therapy right away. \"Knowing which variants can predict who is going to fail and who is going to succeed in active surveillance will also give us clues about the cell signaling pathways that are associated with the aggressive cancer,\" he says. \"These pathways could be targets for new therapies.\" DEVELOPING BETTER THERAPIES The second urgent need is better treatment options for patients whose prostate cancer persists against all available therapies. When active surveillance, surgery and radiation don't work, clinicians treat advanced-stage prostate cancer with hormonal therapy. This strategy isn't curative; it just slows the disease for a while. Cancer that has become resistant to hormonal therapy is called castrate-resistant prostate cancer \u2014 it's this disease that kills three percent of U.S. men. \"When hormonal drugs stop working, the only thing we have left is chemo- therapy, which can prolong life just three or four months,\" explains Dr. Catalona. \"Castrate-resistant prostate cancer is the second leading cancer killer after lung cancer. It's a major health problem. Our SPORE's other three projects are all focused on developing ways to reverse this using precision medicine approaches.\" One project, led by Jindan Yu, MD, PhD, associate professor of Hematology/Oncology in the Department of Medicine, aims to block prostate cancer progression by restoring the function of a protein called FOXA1, which is decreased in castration-resistant prostate cancer. The gene that encodes this protein is mutated in up to 10 percent of patients with the cancer. \"We pinpointed two essential signaling pathways that are downstream of FOXA1, which may be targeted through a combi- nation of therapeutic approaches,\" says Dr. Yu. \"Our study will evaluate the efficacy of this drug combination in metastatic prostate cancer, with the ultimate goal to provide targeted therapy to patients with FOXA1 dysfunction.\" Sarki Abdulkadir, MD, PhD, John T. Grayhack, MD, Professor of Urological Research, leads the next project. He previously found that the development of some aggressive prostate cancers involves alterations in specific genes. With investigators at the University of Southern California, he identified that a protein called the EHPB4 receptor is important for this cancer cell growth and survival. \"We are using a novel inhibitor of EHPB4 as a drug to investigate treatment of therapy-resistant prostate cancer in animal models and in an early-stage clinical trial in humans,\" says Dr. Abdulkadir. The final project, led by Suzanne Conzen, MD, and Russell Szmulewitz, MD, both from the University of Chicago's Comprehensive Cancer Center, will focus on the function of the body's stress hormone receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor. Past research has shown that prostate cancers express receptors that respond to androgens \u2014 male sex hormones such as testosterone \u2014 and stress hormones such as cortisol. \"We will examine whether targeting the pro-tumor effects of these two receptors simultaneously can improve tumor shrink-age compared to current treatment that primarily targets the androgen receptor,\" explains Dr. Conzen. \"Collaboration between the University of Chicago and Northwest- ern will increase the breadth of expertise at the individual institutions so that we can make meaningful progress in advanced prostate cancer biology and treatment.\" RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS Under previous SPORE grant cycles, North-western investigators already took strides to improve the current state of prostate cancer. \"We built a repository of specimens containing thousands of tissue, blood and DNA samples from patients to share with researchers,\" says Robin Leikin, '83 PhD, scientific administrator of the grant. \"We also developed a more accurate blood test to identify prostate cancer and educated more than 4,000 men about cancer risk at screening events.\" In the next phase of research\u2014and beyond\u2014the team hopes to accomplish much more. Their model for prostate cancer could even extend to other diseases in the future. \"The prostate SPORE grant is an honor and a reflection of the strength of our programs in the Lurie Cancer Center,\" says Leonidas Platanias, MD, PhD, director of the center. \"We are now working to develop other SPORE applications in brain tumors, leukemia and breast cancer.\" control restoring the protein foxa1 may help to stop life-threatening tumor metastasis in advanced prostate cancer.foxa1 expressing e-cad foxa1gapdh fig. 2 control fox a1 pc3m \"prostate cancer is the second leading cancer killer after lung cancer. \" - william catalona, md 28 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGDear Fellow Alumni: \"What do we do now?\" Robert Redford's line in the last scene of his 1972 satirical comedy, \"The Candidate,\" when he wins the U.S. presidential election is apt now not only because it's election season, but also because it's a key question for our Medical Alumni Association Board of Directors (MAAB) and all of us alumni. And the opportunities are exciting. Dean Eric Neilson and his senior staff want more active involvement by alumni, and the MAAB is positioning itself to do just that. Dr. Jim Kelly, Board president-elect and chair of our Engagement Committee, is recruiting 40 additional alums to help achieve key objectives, including more representation from younger alumni and better geographic alignment with where our alums reside. In August, Jim Kelly, Rishi Reddy (chair, Mentoring), Jeff Sherman (chair, Strategic Initiatives), David Win- chester (immediate past president) and I met with Dr. Alan Krensky (vice dean for Development and Alumni Relations), Larry Kuhn (assistant dean for Development) and ML Farrell (director, Alumni Relations) in Chicago to discuss the future trajectory of the Board and its central purpose: What does the medical school mean to alumni and what is our mission as MAAB members? \"Alumni record of successful alums\" and \"strong alumni support of students and scholarships\" were central themes we discussed, which have also been evident in your survey responses.

In fact, given the current demands, I have realized burnout is an almost inevi- table response. Something needs to be done about it. Burnout impacts not only physicians and their family but also their patients. Patients suffer because a disabled doctor can't deliver the best care. Sure he can go through the motions, can prescribe the appropriate meds, but that's all he does. And patients intuitively sense his lack of commitment. A magical placebo effect occurs between an engaged doctor and a sick patient. \"Hands on\" was how the profession referred to this phenomenon. The physical touch of a committed physician was thought to promote healing, to give the patient confidence in his care. Maybe this practice strikes us as a little hokey today, but the general principle still holds true. Patients need to believe in their doctor. An empathetic touch can make all the difference and also be the key to medical success. Danielle Ofri exemplifies this point in her book, What Doctor's Feel, when she notes that the rate of severe diabetic complications in patients of doctors who rate high on a standard empathy scale is a remarkable 40 percent better than those cared for by physicians with low empathy scores. Ofri observes that this difference is comparable \"to the benefits seen with the most intensive medical therapy.\" The tragedy of burnout is that it effaces genuine empathy, spirituality and commitment. Nietze put it best: \"Physician, heal thyself: then wilt thou also heal thy patient.\" At some point in almost every physi- cian's career, there has been a powerful desire to help others. When suffering burnout, many of us become so disillu-sioned by our failure to achieve these aspirations that our passion is replaced by a strong contempt for the profession we chose and once loved. My goal is to reignite that flame for others, as I have been able to do for myself, and give physicians a chance to rediscover a sense of joy, pleasure and fulfillment from this noble profession. Time was baffling. It seemed like just yesterday, I sat in a posh auditorium in Chicago as an enthusiastic young adult during my first day of medical school orientation at Northwestern in 1995. Eighteen years later I was a 43-year-old burned-out physician, practicing in Boise, Idaho, doing Google searches on the most effective way to end my life. During my time of maximum burnout, I observed that I was becoming the type of physician that I never wanted to be: impatient and sarcastic, occasionally dismissive of my patients. I made caustic jokes about some patients in the lunchroom. I was not happy. As I learned about the problem of physician burnout, I came to recognize I was not alone. While researching the topic for a book, I realized physician burnout is not some psychological abnormality to be embarrassed to speak about in public \u2014 quite the contrary. For example, survey results in the past five years show 87 percent of American physicians experience burnout symptoms. On the extreme spectrum, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, female physicians have a successful suicide rate of 250 to 400 percent higher than their counterparts in the general population. Something very alarming is going on in the American health- care system today. Increasing time constraints, burgeoning bureaucracy, increased patient expectations, and technological Dr. Tom Murphy recently published a book: Physician Burnout: A Guide to Recognition and Recovery . His website is also dedicated to the issue: tommurphymd.com. One Doctor's Journey to Recovery Tom Murphy, '00 MD FALL 2015 35WARD ROUNDS\u00ae NEWS: ALUMNI PROFILE In medical school, Alexander Javois, '88 MD, loved reading EKGs. This attraction led him to a career in pediatric cardiology and to become an expert on the use of catheterization techniques to treat congenital heart diseases. Currently a pediatric interventional cardiologist at Advocate Children's Hospital at Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Ill., Dr. Javois remembers spending his spare time on Saturday mornings at Feinberg reading EKGs, which he then would hand off to cardiolo- gists to mark up and show him his mistakes. \"I found it fascinating to be able to look at 10 seconds of heart rhythms and have the EKG tell so much about the health of a patient,\" he explains. Later, during his pediatric rotation, Dr. Javois decided to pursue a career in pediatric cardiology. \"I was fascinated by the uniqueness of different types of birth defects of the heart that are seen in pediatric patients, rather than treating adult heart disease,\" he says. Dr. Javois also found the idea of watching children grow up to fulfill a life after treatment rewarding, and over the course of his Alumnus Develops Innovative Procedure for Congenital Heart Disease By Sarah Plumridge 36 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGcareer, he felt he could continually offer more options to children to make a healthier heart, many of them non-surgical. When not in class or on rotations, Javois also enjoyed participating in intramural sports with the dentistry students and has fond memories of living in the on-campus dorms. \"I remember going to the end of my hallway in Abbott Hall and studying there with a $10 million view of Lake Michigan,\" he says. After graduating with his medical degree from the Feinberg School of Medicine, Dr. Javois completed his residency in pediatrics at St. Louis Children's Hospital, which is affiliated with Washington University, and his fellowship in pediatric cardiology at Advocate Christ Hospital and Medical Center in Illinois. CATHETERS INSTEAD OF SURGERY As a pediatric interventional cardiologist, he treats birth defects of the heart by using catheters to insert an implant to prop open or seal vessels, which often elimi- nates the need for surgery. In 2003, an Illinois couple came to Dr. Javois when they learned their son, Ian, had one of the most life-threatening heart birth defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) with intact atrial septum. In HLHS, the left side of the heart is underdeveloped and can't effectively pump blood through the body, leaving the right side of the heart to do all of the work. 38 people who would be in the room during the surgery, including anesthesiologists, nurses and technicians. \"We were all nervous up to the last moment, but we rehearsed so much that when the day came everything fell into place naturally,\" recalls Dr. Javois. \"The nature of dealing with children with birth defects and critically ill children prepared us over the years to handle crises, and the team approached this case beautifully.\" He attributes the success of Ian's outcome to being prepared, having great teamwork and the quick turnaround enabled by back-to-back procedures in the catheter lab. \"Ian looks like any other 12-year-old, and he is active in school and gym class. I have four daughters, and Ian is like the son I never had,\" says the physician who still sees the pre-teen for periodic check-ups. Since then, Dr. Javois has performed the procedure 12 times and has continued to refine the process to make it more efficient. He and his team wrote a case study that was published in Catheterization and Cardiovas- cular Interventions, which led Dr. Javois to act as a consultant to other physicians from around the world to help them apply his approach to their own patients. \"It is very rewarding to know that other people have adopted it,\" he admits. \"It is a lot of fun to hear their stories and their approach. That's the academic nature of our practice, to share ideas in literature and in life.\" While babies are still in their mother's womb, they normally have an opening between the left and right sides of the heart that closes a few days after birth. Having HLHS with intact atrial septum meant that immediately after Ian was born, he would have no way of getting oxygen- rich blood to the rest of his body. After reviewing the scientific literature on this defect, Dr. Javois began to develop a plan. \"People had addressed this issue without a lot of luck,\" he explains. \"The usual treatment is to transfer babies with this defect to the NICU after being born and stabilize them before treating them. There is no way to stabilize a child who is dying, who can't get oxygenated blood to the body.\" Dr. Javois thought, \"Why not have Ian's mother deliver the baby in the catheter lab?\" That approach would allow him to perform an atrial septostomy on Ian right away. In atrial septostomy a small hole is created between the upper two chambers of the heart. To prepare for the procedure, Javois did extensive planning and enlisted the help of \"I found it fascinating to be able to look at 10 seconds of heart rhythms and have the EKG tell me so much about the health of a patient.\" FALL 2015 37Since joining Health Volunteers Overseas (HVO) in 2006, Antoinette (Toni) Sander, PT, DPT, '87 MS, CLT-LANA, has literally traveled the world educating local thera- pists in best practices for physical therapy, then has worked side by side with those clinicians in a patient setting to reinforce the lecture material. \"The mission of HVO is to change global health through education,\" says Sander, whose three professional passions are physical therapy (PT), education and travel. Her first jaunt was to Lima, Peru, where for two weeks she taught a course she developed on lumbar spine, hip and sacroiliac dysfunction. The intrepid traveler returned to Lima in 2007 for one week to present a series of lectures on rehabilitation for post-arthroscopic knee and shoulder surgery. Most of Sander's excursions abroad have lasted two or three weeks, including trips to India, Haiti and Myanmar (formerly Burma). In late 2013 and early 2014, however, she spent six months in Rwanda, where she developed a 60-hour course in lumbar and cervical spine rehabilitation. \"It was gratifying to observe how the therapists changed from a generic diagnosis and treatment to assessing the patient from a functional perspective and then designing a treatment to fit a particular patient.\" Sander visited Haiti twice, in 2011 and 2012, where she helped train rehabilitation technicians. \"These were small groups of high school graduates who desired work in rehabilitation and ended up working at community hospitals and clinics,\" she says. People seek PT for pain and movement difficulties that can be orthopaedically- or neurologically-based. For instance, because Rwanda is heavily agricultural, \"we saw a lot of people with back pain and neck pain from working in the fields, as well as from riding motorcycles and walking and carrying heavy WARD ROUNDS\u00ae NEWS: ALUMNI PROFILE PHYSICAL THERAPYGLOBALAMBASSADOR \u2014 BY BOB KRONEMYER BEING A HEALTH VOLUNTEER HAS TAKEN TONI SANDER AND HUSBAND BERNIE AROUND THE WORLD.

Rwanda and other resource-poor countries, \"also have many developmental disabilities in children that need care.\" In addition, trauma is prevalent in most of these countries, due to motorcycle accidents or post-earthquake (Haiti) or post-genocide (Rwanda). \"Although the genocide in Rwanda occurred 20 years ago, people there still have problems that keep them from moving,\" she explains. \"Amputees are a very big population, not just in Rwanda but around the world.\" Throughout all her travels with HVO, Sander has been well received by the local clinicians. \"They are very appreciative, and in some cases question why I, as a volunteer, would come so far to teach them,\" she says. Likewise, local patients consider a foreign visitor \"as a sort of a clinical expert, so patients are highly respectful and truly feel special if they are evaluated and treated by you.\" Often, Sander does not speak the language of her foreign patients; hence, a translator is required. It is more probable that a foreign clinician will speak English. Sander, an associate professor emerita in the Department of Physical Therapy and Human Movement Sciences at Feinberg, first became interested in PT in the early 1960s, while a junior at a small Catholic high school in Oklahoma. \"My mother introduced me to a woman physician who actually mentioned physical therapy,\" recalls Sander. \"I had not really heard of physical therapy but began to explore the field over the next year, including visiting some local PT departments. Ultimately, I pursued a BS degree in physical therapy from St. Louis University.\" Prior to 1984, the year Sander enrolled in the master's program in orthopaedic physical therapy at Northwestern, she worked mostly as a staff physical therapist at clinics in Missouri, New Jersey and the Chicago area. \"Northwestern upgraded my skills and clinical thinking, plus bolstered my confidence in patient care,\" explains Sander, who returned to campus in 1994 as a contract lecturer in PT. She became a full-time assistant professor at Northwestern in 2001, followed by an associate professor in 2009. Meanwhile, Sander received an online doctorate in physical therapy from Arizona School of Health Sciences in 2005. She retired from Northwestern in 2011 but continued to teach a course in lymphedema and wound management that she helped develop until 2013. She continues to work with faculty in research and manuscript writing, primarily in the global health arena. Over the decades, \"technology has certainly changed,\" she says. \"The faculty did not communicate by email at the beginning. But now our students have iPads and we have eliminated paper handouts.\" Pupils and faculty now have the Internet as a valuable resource. \"All these technologic advances produce strong and committed therapists to serve their community.\" Sander's PT clinical practice, which spanned three decades, focused on orthopaedic, oncology and lymphedema (limb swelling) management. Among her distinctions are a 2009 Oncology Section Student Research Award for exercise behaviors in breast cancer survivors, sponsored by the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA); and this past April, the Donna Frownfelter Community Achievement Award, from the Northwest- ern Alumni Association, for overseas and community service. \"To do overseas travel, you need a spirit of adventure and a strong sense of flexibility and adaptation to whatever you find,\" says Sander, who plans to continue traveling with HVO. \"The rewards are that you are immersed in another culture. You can make lifelong friends. Also, you find that medical care, even in resource-limited countries, can be deliv- ered with compassion and effectiveness.\" Sander has been married to husband Bernie for 47 years. The couple has four children and nine grandchildren. \"My family is also a big part of my life,\" she says. \u2014 \"TO DO OVERSEAS TRAVEL, YOU NEED A SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE AND A STRONG SENSE OF FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTATION TO WHATEVER YOU FIND \" \u2014 FALL 2015 39Donald Dean Barnes, '76 PT, of Clear Lake, Iowa, died Aug. 21, 2015.

With it, he single-handedly built the first clinical department in the city at St. Luke's Hospital in the early part of the 20th century and introduced heart patients to their first EKG tests. The prominent cardiologist joined forces with like-minded physicians to discuss the creation of a heart association in Chicago. The early precursor of the Chicago Heart Association, the Association for the Prevention and Relief of Heart Disease was launched in May 1922. Active in professional societies and editor-in-chief of the Archives of Internal Medicine, Dr. Gilbert always remained loyal to the purple and white as a leader, teacher and mentor.

This record-breaking feat represents a 4 percent increase over last year's $593.9 million. Most rewarding for the medical school is that more than $400 million of that funding came from sponsored awards invested in principal investigators at Feinberg. Northwest- ern received a record of nearly $300 million from the National Institutes of Health. \"The scientists on our medical school faculty are at the forefront of their respective fields, and continued recognition of their groundbreaking work by a wide variety of funding agencies is another sign of our growing reputation as a preeminent university for innovative research and discovery,\" says Eric G. Neil- son, MD, vice president for medical affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean at Feinberg. \"I have no doubt that as we expand our research enterprise and recruit talented leaders to our faculty funding will continue to increase.\"Galter Library Undergoes Makeover The medical school will begin renovations next spring to physically transform the spaces of the Galter Health Sciences Library to meet the needs of the 21st century. \"Our library is integral to the dissemination of research and the comprehension of impact,\" said Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, MD, ScM, senior associate dean for clinical and translational research and chair of the Department of Preventive Medicine, who spoke at an October 14 presentation of the library's plans for the future. Architectural plans call for problem-based and team-based learning rooms, as well as 24-hour study spaces for students. Furniture selection will be based on feedback gleaned from a student survey and could include standing desks and semi- enclosed study pods. The historical reading room and Dollie's Corner, a welcoming space for reading or studying, will not be altered during the renovation. Today with data being collected in every way possible, biomedi- cal data and information has become critical to advancing research and education. Over the past year and a half, the Galter Library has adapted to the needs of its users by organizing its core service areas to focus on: digital systems and collections services; research and information services; and user services.
