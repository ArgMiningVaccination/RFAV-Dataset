Shirodhara is a good solution if you're considering getting away from all the stress-related problems. Dr Chaitali Deshmukh, an Ayurvedic consultant at Birla says, \"The ayurvedic practice of Shirodhara has a number of relaxing and restorative effects on the body and mind. The idea for this all-encompassing approach to health originated in India many years ago. Doshas, or balanced life energies, are brought about within the body. It calms the mind, which causes a variety of diseases relating to the mind. Simply put, many people can benefit from this old Ayurvedic practice.\" Talking to the HelathSite, Dr Chaitali further sheds light on the importance and benefits of Shirodhara in Ayurveda. Shirodhara is a Sanskrit term that means \"Shiro\" as in head and \"Dhara\" as in flow. This Ayurvedic ancient practice has no adverse effects and numerous potential advantages. Any kind of liquid, including milk, water, or oil, can be poured across the forehead in this fashion. Numerous issues like stress, anxiety, and [ insomnia](https://www.thehealthsite.com/diseases-conditions/diabetes/is-insomnia-a-risk-factor-for-type-2-diabetes-heres-what-you-need-to-know-848182/) might be improved by it. You can go to sleep like a baby thanks to this practice, which helps to divert your thoughts from your worry, says Dr Chaitali. To create a state of harmony between the mind, body, and soul, it operates in both psychological and physiological ways. Shirodhara aids in the removal of hormones or toxins that cause stress and excessive mental activity. Allowing the oils to pour into the forehead calms the mind and leaves the head feeling peaceful and thought-free. It controls the pituitary gland, which treats diseases like insomnia, or sleep deprivation. It chemically relaxes the nerves around the skull, improving brain blood flow and elevating serotonin levels, which makes you feel happy and healthy, explains Dr Chaitali. It is a tried-and-true technique for treating a range of problems that individuals today encounter. There are numerous factors that can add stress to our daily lives because we are busy individuals living in this contemporary environment.

While too much Pitta can lead to aggravation, headaches, irritability, and other negative emotions. There are various health benefits of Shirodhara.
