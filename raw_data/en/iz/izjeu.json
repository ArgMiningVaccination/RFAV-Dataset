When Congress passed the Social Security Act in 1935, it contained the initial key landmark legislation which established Title V. This legislation is the origin of the federal g overnment's pledge of support to s tates and their efforts to extend and improve health and welfare services for mothe rs and children throughout the nation. To date, the Title V federal -state partnership continues to provide a dynamic program to improve the health of all mothers and children, including children with special health care needs (CSHCN). A. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) is the principal focus within Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for all Maternal and Child Health (MCH) activities within the Department of Health a nd Human Services (HHS ). MCHB's mission is to improve the health of America's mothers, children and families. We envision an America where all children and families are healthy and thriving. To achieve its mission, MCHB directs resources towards a combination of integrated public health services and coordinated systems of care for the MCH population . Within the MCHB , the Division of State and Community Health (DSCH) has the administrative responsibility for the Title V MCH Services Block Grant to States Program (hereafter referred to as the MCH Block Grant) . DSCH is committed to being the Bureau's main line of commun ication with states and communities, in order to consult and work closely with both of these groups and others who have an interest in and contribute to the provision of a wide range of MCH programs and community -based service systems. B. Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant (Title V) Under Title V, MCHB administers a Block Grant and competitive Discretionary Grants. The purpose of the MCH Block Grant is to create federal/state partnerships in 59 states and jurisdictions for developing service sys tems that address MCH challenges , such as : Significantly reducing infant mortality; Providing comprehensive care for all women before, during, and after pregnancy and childbirth; Providing preventive and primary care services for infants, children, and adolescents; Providing comprehensive care for children and adolescents with special health care needs; Immunizing all children; Reducing adolescent pregnancy; Preventing injury and violence; Putting into community practice national standards and guidelines for prenatal care, for healthy and safe childcare, and for the health supervision of infants, children, and adolescents; 4 Assuring access to care for all mothers and children; and Meeting the nutritional and developmental needs of mother s, children and families. Under Title V, MCHB also administers two types of Federal Discretionary Grants, Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) and Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS) grants. SPRANS funds projects (through grants, contracts, and other mechanisms) in research, training, genetic services and newborn screening/follow -up, sickle cell disease, hemophilia, and MCH improvement. CISS projects (through grants, contracts, and other mechanisms) seek to increase the capacity for service delivery at the local level and to foster formation of comprehensive, integrated, community level service systems for mothers and children . In addition to SPRANS and CISS grants, the MCHB also administers the following categorical programs: Emergency Medical Services for Children; Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Demonstration Program; Healthy Start Initiative; Universal Newborn Hearing Screening ; Heritable Disorder Program Autism; Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program; and Family to F amily Health Information Centers In recent years, some state Title V programs have begun to utilize the life course model as an organizing framework for add ressing identified MCH needs . The life course approach points to broad social, economic, and environmental factors as underlying contributors to health and social outcomes. This approach also focuses on persistent inequalities in the health and well- being of individuals and ho w th e interplay of risk and protective factors at critical points of time can influence an individual's health across his/her lifespan and potentially across generations . C. Maternal and Child Health Block Grant (State Formula Grants) Since its original authorization in 1935, Title V of the Social Security Act has been amended several t imes to reflect the increasing national interest in maternal and child health and well- being. One of the first changes occurred when Title V was converted to a block grant program as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981. This change resulted in the consolidation of seven categorical programs into a single block grant. These programs included: Maternal and Child Health and S ervices for Children with Special Health Care Needs ; Supplemental S ecurity Income for children with disabilities ; Lead -based paint poisoning prevention programs; Genetic disease programs ; Sudden i nfant death syndrome programs ; 5 Hemophilia treatment centers; and Adolescent pregnancy grants. Another significant change in the Title V MCH Block Grant came as a result of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1989 , which specified new requirements for accountability. The amendments enacted under OBRA introduced stricter requirements for the use of f ederal funds and for s tate planning and reporting. Congress sought to balance the flexibility of the block grant with greater accountability, by requiring State Title V programs to report their progress on key MCH indicators and other program information. Thus, the block grant legislation emphasizes accountability while providing states with appropriate flexibility to respond to state -specific MCH needs and to develop targeted interventions and solut ions for address ing them . This theme of assisting s tates in the design and implementation of MCH programs to meet state and local needs, while at the same time asking them to account for the use of federal/s tate Title V funds, was embodied in the req uirements contained in the Guidance documents for the state MCH B lock Grant Application s/Annual Reports. In 1993 the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA ), Public Law 103 -62, required federal agencies to establish measurable goals that could be reported as part of the budgetary process. For the first time, funding decisions were linked directly with performance. Among its purposes, G PRA is intended to \"...improve F ederal program effectiveness and public accountability by promoting a new focus o n results, service quality, and customer satisfaction.\" GPRA requires each f ederal agency to develop comprehensive strategic plans, annual performance plans with measurable goals and objectives, and annual reports on actual performance compared to perform ance goals. The MCHB effort to respond to GPRA requirements coincided with other planned improvements to the MCH B lock Grant Guidance. As a result, the MCH B lock Grant Application/Annual Report and forms contained in the 1997 edition of the Maternal and Child Health Services Title V Block Grant Program - Guidance and Forms for the Title V Application/Annual Report served to ensure that the s tates and jurisdictions could clearly, concisely, and accurately tell their MCH \"stories.\" This Application/Annual Report became the basis by which MCHB met its GPRA reporting requirements for the MCH Block Grant to States Program. In 1996, the MCHB began a process of programmatic assessments and planning activities aimed at improving th e Title V MCH Block Grant Application/Annual Report G uidance document for states . Since that time, the Maternal and Child Health Services Title V Block Grant Program - Guidance and Forms for the Title V Application/Annual Report (Guidance) has been revised seven times . Updated Guidance documents are submitted to and approv ed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prior to their release . Revisions to each subsequent edition of the Guidance have considered chang es in MCH priorities , availability of new national data sources and opportunities for refin ing a nd streamlin ing the A pplication/Annual Report preparation and submission process for states. The r educed burden that resulted from this latter commitment was largely achieved through efficiencies that were created by t he electronic reporting vehicle for the state MCH B lock Grant Applications/Annual R eports , specifically the Title V Information System (TVIS.) 6 D. Title V Information System The development of an electronic reporting package in 1996 was a significant milestone for the State MCH Block Grant s. Advances in technology allowed for the development of an electronic information system (TVIS) within the next several years. The TVIS is designed to capture the performance data and other program and financial information contained in the s tate Applications/Annual Reports. While descriptive information is available on state Title V - supported efforts, state MCH partnership efforts and other program- specific initiatives of the state in meeting its MCH needs, TVIS primarily serves as an online, Web -accessible interface for the submission of the 59 state and jurisdictional Title V MCH Block Grant Application s/Annual Report s each year by July 15th. Developed in conjunction with the program requirements outlined in the Title V MCH Block Grant Application/Annual Report Guidance , the TVIS is available to the public on the World Wide Web at: https:/ /mchdata.hrsa.gov/TVISReports/ . Over the years, the TVIS has increasingly become recognized as a powerful and useful tool for a number of audiences. The transformational changes to the MCH Block Grant outlined in this revised Application/Annual Report Gu idance mandate the development of a new data collection and web report system for the TVIS . HRSA is providing funding support for a contract to develop , implement and operate this new information system. Integrated with HRSA's grants management system (i.e., the HRSA Electronic Handbooks (EHB), ) the T VIS makes available to the public through its web reports the key financial, program, performance, and health indicator data reported by s tates in the ir yearly MCH Block Grant Applications/Annual Reports . Examples of the data that are collected include : information on populations served; budget and expenditure breakdowns by source of funding, service and program; program data, such as individuals served and breakdowns of MCH populations ; other state data (OSD ); and performance and outcome measure data for the national and state measures. Reporting on performance relative to the national measures is used to assess national progress in key MCH priority areas and to facilitate the Bureau's annual GPRA report ing. 7 Overview of the Framework The national performance measure framework is based on a three -tiered performance measure system: National Outcome Measures (NOMs), National Performance Measures (NPMs), and Evidence -based or - informed Strategy Measures (ESMs). In brief, NOMs are the ulti mate health outcomes that Title V is attempting to improve. The NPMs are considered to be more directly modifiable by state Title V program efforts, and influence NOMs. ESMs are developed by states to capture their evidence -based or informed programmatic efforts to affect NPMs and in turn NOMs. The framework is intended to better highlight the impact of Title V investments and provides states with flexibility in selecting NPMs and developing state performance measures (SPMs) and ESMs to address the s tate's priority needs. This guidance reduces the minimum number of required NPM selections to five ; at least one in each population domain. It also increases flexibility for states to select as many NPMs and SPMs as needed to reflect priority needs identifie d from the five -year needs assessment. Title V Performance Measure Framework Evaluation Logic Model Measures were considered as NOMs, which primarily reflect ultimate or longer- term indicators of population health status or quality systems of care, if they met one or more of the following criteria: it was mandated by the Title V legislation that the data be collected; it was considered a sentinel health marker for women, infants, or children; it was a major focus of either the Title V legislation or Title V activities; it was considered an important health condition to monitor because the prevalence was increasing, but the reasons for the increase were unclear; or there was a recognized need to move the MCH field forward in this area, even if there was not yet a consensus on how to measure the construct. The latter were considered ESMs Evidence - based/informed Strategy MeasuresNPMs National Performance MeasuresNOMs National Outcome Measures Process Inputs/OutputsShort, Medium Term OutcomesLong Term OutcomesAPPENDIX B : PERFORMANCE MEASURE FRAMEWORK 8 developmental outcome measures. A total of 25 NOMs were selected with three new additions in the updated guidance: teen births, postpartum depression, and forgone health care. Measures were considered as NPMs, or short/medium term indicators of health behaviors or health care access/quality, if they met one or more of the following criteria: there was a large investment of resources as determined by the s tate narratives; it was considered modifiable through Title V activities; a state could delineate measurable activities to address the performance measures; significant disparities existed among population groups; research had indicated that the condition or activity had large societal costs; or research had indicated that the promotion of certain behaviors, practices or policies had improved outcomes. There also had to be evidence that an NPM was associated with at least one of the NOMs (see Table 2 in this Appendix) for evidence -based or informed linkages between NPMs and NOMs). However, it is important to recognize that N OMs are multifactorial and i mprovement in a given NPM may not necessarily result in i mprovement of the associated NOM. Fifteen NPMs were identified for the Title V MCH Services Block Grant. In this updated guidance, two additional indicators of a safe sleep environment will be tracked for states that select this NPM. The ESMs are the key to understandi ng how a State Title V program tracks programmatic investments or inputs designed to impa ct the NPMs. In the framework, s tates select evidence - based or evidence -informed strategies and activities designed to impact the NPMs; States then create ESMs to track State Title V strategies and inputs contained in the State Action Plan. The development of ESMs is guided through an examination of evidenced- based or evidence- informed strategies, and determining what components are practical, meaningful, measurable, and achievable. The main criteria for ESMs are being meaningfully related to the selected NPM through scientific evidence or theory and being measurable by the state with improvement achievable in multiple years of the five -year reporting cycle. States c an determine the number of ESMs that they will use for addressing the selected NPMs but there is a required minimum of one ESM for each NPM. States may also add, modify, replace, or retire ESMs over the five -year reporting cycle, as new strategies or meas urement methods emerge, objectives are achieved without further room for improvement, or the strategy did not produce intended results. The 15 NPMs address key national MCH priority areas in five MCH population health domains: 1) Health; 2) Perinatal/Infant Health; 3) Child Health; 4) CSHCN; and 5) Adolescent Health. The five MCH population health domains are contained within the three legislatively -defined MCH populations [Section 505(a)(1).] The first two domains are include d under \"preventive and primary care services for pregnant women, mothers and infants up to age one,\" which is the first of the three defined MCH populations. Child and adolescent health are included in the second defined MCH population, specifically \"pre ventive and primary care services for children.\" Services for CSHCN is the third legislatively -defined MCH population. Presented in the table below are the 15 NPMs and the corresponding MCH Population domain(s) and applicable subgroup options for ESMs. 9 Table 1. NPMs and MCH Population Domains NPM # National Performance Measures MCH Population Domains ESM Subgroup Options (if applicable) 1 Well-woman visit Women/Maternal Health 2 Low-risk cesarean delivery Women/Maternal Risk-appropriate perinatal care Perinatal/Infant Health 4 Breastfeeding Perinatal/Infant Health 5 Safe sleep Perinatal/Infant Health 6 Developmental screening Child Health 7 Injury hospitalization Child Health and/or Adolescent Health Children 0 through 9 Adolescents 10 through 19 All Children 0 through 19 8 Physical activity Child Health and/or Adolescent Health Children 6 through 11 Adolescents 12 through 17 All Children 6 through 17 9 Bullying Adolescent Health 10 Adolescent well -visit Adolescent Health 11 Medical home Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN), Child and Adolescent Health CSHCN CSHCN and non -CSHCN 12 Transition Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) and Adolescent Health CSHCN CSHCN and non -CSHCN 13 Preventive dental visit - Pregnancy Preventive dental visit - Child/Adolescent Women/Maternal Health, Child Health, and/or Adolescent Health Pregnant women Children 0 through 5 Children 6 through 11 Adolescents 12 through 17 All Children 0 through 17 14 Smoking - Pregnancy Smoking - Household Women/Maternal Health, Child Health, and/or Adolescent Health Pregnant women Children 0 through 5 Children 6 through 11 Adolescents 12 through 17 All Children 0 through 17 15 Adequate insurance Child Health, Adolescent Health, and/or Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) All Children CSHCN The NPMs incorporate two significant concepts: first, Title V is responsible for promoting the health of all mothers and children, which includes an emphasis on CSHCN and their families; and second, the development of life course theory has indicated that there are critical stages, beginning before a child is born and continuing throughout life, which can influence lifelong health and wellbeing (see Table 3 in this Appendix for a crosswalk of NPM/NOMs and AMCHP Lifecourse Indicators). In implementing this framework, states will choose a minimum five out of 15 NPMs for its Title V program to address during the current five -year needs assessment cycle, at least one in each MCH population domain. To promote flexibility, each MCH population domain contains at least three NPM options . The same measure selected in will only count once toward the minimum of five. There are no mandatory NPMs and no maximum for the number of NPMs that a state can select. Thus, a state is not required to make any changes to its current NPM selections and the state may continue to implement the State Action Plan that was established for the current reporting cycle. For example, if a state selects a compound measure such as NPM #14 in Women/Maternal Health and Child Health, it would only count once towards the minimum of five NPMs, and another measure would need to be selected in either Women/Maternal or Child Health to satisfy the requirement of one measure in each population domain. Injury hospitalization, physical activity, medical home, preventive dental visit, household smoking, and adequate insurance can be selected for either the Child or the Adolescent Health domains , or both, because the age ranges span both domains. It is recognized that the strategies and accompanying ESMs may be different, depending on the children's ages, for injury hospitalization, physical activity, preventive dental visit, and household smoking; therefore, these measures have various subgroup options for specifying the focus of ESMs. Given their particular importance for CSHCN, medical home and transition must include a focus on CSHCN, even if they are selected within the Child and/or Adolescent Health domain. When selecting NPMs it is important that the alignment of the NPMs to the state identified priorities is clear. If the priority does not align with a NPM, the state should develop a state performance measure (SPM). The minimum of five N PMs allows states flexibility, and ensures that the selected NPMs and chosen SPMs together reflect the state's identified priority needs. While the SPM is not part of the national performance measurement framework, it is a critical component in addressing priorities. States can select as many SPMs as they need to address their MCH priority needs. A sixth domain, Cross -Cutting/Systems Building, refers to public health system issues that impact all MCH population groups. This domain does not contain any NPMs but allows states to develop unique SPMs to address priority areas that cut across all population health domains. Example SPM topics may include but are not limited to: Family partnership activities acros s all population health domains ; Social dete rminants of health ; Workforce development ; and Enhancement of data infrastructure . Implementation of Measurement National Outcome Measures NOMs are longer- term and/or legislatively required indicators, many of which may be influenced by NPMs (see Table 2) and are important to monitor and assess as a core function of public health that may stimulate program and policy action. Thus, NOMs should be tracked to 11 understand the MCH population's health, and are important for the development of the needs assessment and selection of NPMs. Changes in NOM indicators, which may result from improvement in NPMs, can be discussed in the appropriate population domain section of the narrative , but there is not a reporting requirement for this discussion. Data for NOMs will be prepopulated, where possible. States do not provide performance objectives for NOMs. National Performance Measures Once NPMs are selected, a state will track the five NPMs throughout the five -year reporting cycle. States are encouraged not to change the selected NPMs during the five -year reporting cycle. If a state determines that a NPM needs to be changed, clear justification must be provided. In an effort to reduce state burden, annual performance data (indicator/numerator/ denominator) for the NOMs and the NPMs will be prepopulated by MCHB from national data sources, as available, and provided to the states for their use in preparing the yearly Title V MCH Block Grant Applications/Annual Reports. Data will be provided overall by year to facilitate objective -setting and performance monitoring, as well as by various demographic stratifiers (e.g. age, race/ethnicity, education, urban/rural residence) to identify priority populations for targeting strategies and programmatic interventions. I f a state selects a NPM which is not part of the national data source, the state can develop its own detail sheet and report its data for the measure. However, the definition and data that are collected must match the definition and measure of the nationa l data source. In the first reporting year of this G uidance, a s tate will select a minimum of five NPMs to complete the current five -year needs assessment cycle ending in FY 2020. States will continue using the determined performance objectives from the previous guidance until FY 2020. Performance objectives for future years can be changed for individual NPMs based on ongoing needs assessment efforts and performance monitoring. Other Guidelines for NPMs Use of Provisional Data: States may, but are not required to, include more timely provis ional data if they choose. Providing this data will not replace the prepopulated final data provided for the measures. Lacking a National Data Source: States can choose a measure if they do not have the data source noted on the detail sheet, as long as they provide the indicator, numerator and denominator data as defined on the detail sheet. For Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System ( PRAMS ), states will be able to submit their PRAMS or PRAMS -like data to TVIS following the same definition for a given measure if CDC cannot furnish it. The same situation may apply to other data sources; for example, not all states with hospital discharge data furnish it to AHRQ. If a state provides its own data from a different source, this should be annotated in a field note. 12 Integrated Measures (NPM #13 and NPM #14): The integrated measures of preventive dental visit and smoking have two distinct measures, one in pregnancy and one for children/adolescents. States may select these NPMs for one or more of the following MCH population domains: Women/Maternal Health ; Child Health ; Adolescent Health. If a state selects one of these NPMs for Women/Maternal Health ( #13.1 and NPM # 14.1 ) and also for Adolescent Health ( NPM #13.1 and NPM #14.1 ), states will be expected to develop multiple ESMs, at least one for each measure. Evidence- based or - informed Strategy Measures Developed by the state, ESMs are measures that quantify and assess the outputs of State Title V s trategies and inputs identified in the State Action Plan. The development of ESMs is guided through an examination of evidenced- based or evidence- informed strategies, and determining which components are meaningful, measurable, and achievable. The main criteria for ESMs is that they are meaningfully related to the selected NPM through scientific evidence or theory , and they are measurable by the state with improvement achievable in multiple years or throughout the five -year reporting cycle. Mo st issues in MCH are multifactorial ; therefore, states are strongly encouraged to develop multiple strategies, each with a related ESM, to impact a selected NPM. Given that ESMs capture state programmatic efforts, it is recommended that states develop cor responding ESMs for strategies in which they are investing the most activity and/or funding. However, states are only required to have at least one active ESM for each of the NPMs selected. The key for selecting an effective strategy to impact an NPM is identifying evidence -based or - informed practices. Since the initiation of the MCH Block Grant transformation in 2015, MCHB has supported a variety of technical assistance efforts to support States in the identification and implementation of evidence -based or -informed MCH program strategies and measures . For example, MCHB funded the Strengthen the Evidence Base for MCH Programs initiative at The Johns Hopkins University (http://semch.org/about.html ). This partnership initiative promotes an \"evidence -informed\" approach , which th e McMaster group defines as \"the purposeful and systematic use of the best available evidence to inform the assessment of various options and related decision making in practice, program development, and policy making.\"1 Consistent with this approach, the initiative has developed a continuum of evidence model that helps states to use the best available MCH science while also encouraging innovation in evidence - informed programming (http://www.semch.org/rating -the-evidence.html). Evidence -based strategies are generally those that have either moderate evidence or are scientifically rigorous, while evidence -informed are those that have emerging evidence or are based on expert opinion . \"Evidence -informed \" is meant to convey that there is information suggesting that a certain strategy could be effective in addressing a NPM. These are strategies that have not yet 1 McMaster University. Health Evidence Glossary. Available http://www.healthevidenc e.org/glossary.aspx#E , Accessed 9/9/15 13 been rigorously tested or evaluated but that incorporate a theoretical model from other effective public health practices or apply a novel approach grounded in scientific theory. This continuum and its rationale is shown in the following figure. The Evidence Continuum For each category of evidence noted above, the table below provides a descriptive statement and criteria. Evidence Ratings (Adapted from RWJ What Works for Health)2 Rating Explanation Scientifically Rigorous Strategies with this rating are most likely to make a difference. These strategies have been tested in many robust studies with consistently positive results. Moderate Evidence Strategies with this rating are likely to work, but further research is needed to confirm effects. These strategies have been tested more than once and results trend positive overall. Expert Opinion Strategies with this rating are recommended by credible, impartial experts and are consistent with accepted theoretical frameworks. However, the strategies have limited resear ch documenting effects; further research, often with stronger designs, is needed to confirm effects. Emerging Evidence Strategies with this rating have limited research documenting effects. These strategies need further research, often with stronger desi gns, to confirm effects. Mixed Evidence Strategies with this rating have been tested more than once and results are inconsistent or trend negative; further research is needed to confirm effects. Evidence Against Strategies with this rating are not good investments. These strategies have been tested in many robust studies, are not effective and sometimes produce harmful results. Beyond scientific evidence of effectiveness, additional considerations of reach, feasibility, sustainability, and transferability should be considered in terms of likely impact. It is important to note that there may be a need for states to adapt strategies based on differences in populations and settings, available resources and other considerations. 2 Adapted from the Robert Wood Johnson What Works for Health project.

A given strategy should be based on , or informed by , evidence of effective practice in direct relation to improving the NPM rather than a strategy that has an indirect relationship . An example of an indirect relation are efforts to improve the content or quality of well- woman or adolescent visits as a strategy for improving access or utilization. While the ESMs may be either directly or indirectly related to the NPM, states/jurisdictions are encouraged to select at least one ESM that directly corresponds to the selected NPM. The strategy should be relevant to state priorities and tailored or adapted for contextual settings and population groups where applicable. It is similarly critical for the strategy to be feasible for the state to implement within the five -year cycle and involve stakeholder input or buy -in from partners who may be instrumental in successfully executing the strategy or tracking output. The strategy should also have potential for improvement (i.e. not already or nearly accomplished). ESM Checklist Check if Answer is Yes 1: The strategy is meaningful The strategy is evidence -based/informed in direct relation to the NPM The strategy is relevant to state priorities and context The strategy is feasible and involved stakeholder input or buy -in The strategy has potential for improvement 2: The strategy output is measurable as an ESM The ESM is a number, %, rate, count, yes/no* The ESM is well -defined and specific Data are available to measure and track the ESM over time The ESM can show incremental change over time 3: Improvement in the ESM is achievable Improvement attainable over multiple assessments Sensitive to change within a defined time period *Quantitative measures are recommended over qualitative yes/no measures to quantify strategy outputs and show im provement over time in relation to the NPM. Once the state identifies a strategy it intends to use, the state will develop and operationalize the outputs of this strategy as a measure or ESM. Given that ESMs are intended to measure progress over time, they should be quantifiable (e.g., number, percent, rate, count), well-defined and specific (i.e., specifically defined indicator, numerator, and denominator), and there should be data available to measure and track the ESM with incremental change over time. The setting of improvement objectives marks the final phase of ESM development and offers an important check that improvement in the ESM is expected and attainable over multiple assessments within a reasonable time period. Objectives should reflect an improvement goal over multiple years of the five -year reporting cycle rather than a static 15 objective over time. Sample strategies, measures, and objectives for NPM #5 are provided within the publication by Kogan et al (2015).3 While yes/no measures are acceptable, quantitative measures are preferred to capture greater detail on strategy outputs and show more than a single improvement over time. A yes/no indicator tends to either capture a single activity toward a broader strategy that is achieved in one year and lacks future opportunity for improvement over multiple assessments or a very broad policy change that may not show progress for many years. In both cases, multi- year improvement in the ESM is not attainable due to a yes/no specification. Ideally, there should be annual and incremental improvements shown over time in an ESM that can be examined in relation to changes in the corresponding NPM. For example, a state may sele ct an evidence -informed strategy of improving provider training on a particular topic. This could be broken down into smaller activities, such as identifying or developing a training curriculum and then administering or promoting the training, but these activities are part of a broader strategy that could be tracked consistently over time with an indicator of the number or percentage of providers who received training. Activities may be discussed in the narrative section to provide context to any ESM. To further strengthen incremental improvement potential, the ESM could reference the receipt of training within the past 3 to 5 years since the number trained in a given year may not increase over time and lack an appropriate improvement objective. Another example involves a strategy of implementing a policy or program. Similar to the example above, a yes/no measure lacks potential to show improvement over multiple assessments and, in this case, progress may or may not be achievable in a reasonable period . When a yes/no option is being considered, it is best to identify and track fidelity to the policy/program goal through a quantitative measure with potential for incremental improvement through additional activities or to assure intended results after impl ementation. For example, a strategy for a policy change to increase Medicaid eligibility may not be achievable for many years but the goal of the strategy to improve Medicaid enrollment (#/% enrolled) could be directly assessed and show progress over multiple years through additional activities, such as outreach and enrollment, both before and after a Medicaid policy or procedural change. States have provided strong examples of well -defined and well -written ESMs, which demonstrate that states have examined the evidence- base for a strategy, determined the appropriate way to measure the strategy, and developed improvement objectives. For the annual reports covered under this G uidance, as new ESMs are introduced, s tates will develop a detail sheet for each ESM, which they will submit as part of their Application/Annual 3 : Kogan MD, Dykton C, Hirai AH, Bethell I, Cano CE, Downing -Futrell SL, Lu MC. A new performance measurement system for maternal and child health in the United States. Matern Child Health J. 2015 May;19(5):945- 57. https ://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC44 28536 16 Report. On the detail sheet, states will define the: (1) measures; (2) goal; (3) indicator, numerator, and denominator; (4) data source; and (5) significa nce. States will track performance for the ESMs that were established for this five -year needs assessment cycle. States will determine performance objectives for each of the ESMs for application years FY 2019 - FY 2020. These objectives can b e revised, as needed, for future reporting years. Data for the ESMs (i.e., numerator/denominator) will be entered annually by the state. During the five-year reporting cycle, ESMs may be added, modified, replaced, or retired, as new strategies or measure ment methods emerge, objectives are achieved without further room for improvement, or the strategy did not produce intended results. States should work closely with family partnerships as they revise/develop the ESMs for their selected NPMs. For purpose s of the MCH Block Grant, family partnership is defined as patients, families, their representatives, and health professionals working in active partnership at various levels across the health care system - direct care, organizational design , governance an d policy making - to improve health and health care. 4 This partnership is accomplished through the intentional practice of working with families for the ultimate goal of positive outcomes in all areas through the life course. Relevant resources include, but are not limited to, the National Consensus Standards for Systems of Care for Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs , authored by the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs (AMCHP, 2014) and available a t: http://www.lpfch.org/sites/default/files/field/publications/developing_structure_and_process _-_white_paper_and_s tandards.pdf ; a series of reports and case studies entitled, Sustaining and Diversifying Family Engagement in Title V MCH and CYSHCN Programs (AMCHP, 2016); and other resources that are available through Family Voices. Working with the Measures States Currently Have As noted, this G uidance reduces the minimum number of required NPM selections to five, with at least one in each population domain. States have the option to continue using measures selected in the previous guidance , provided the NPMs selected only count once toward the minimum of five. With a reduced number of NPMs , states have increased flexibility and may choose to retire up to three NPMs (out of the eight selected NPMs ) from the previous Guidance to better address the state's priorities. If retiring measures , the state should provide reasoning in their FY 2019 application for the retired measure. Selecting New Measures The reduced number of NPMs allows states more flexibility in developing SPMs that align with the state's priorities. States also have the opportunity to develop SPMs that will specifically 4 Carman K., Dardess, P., Maurer, M ., Sofaer, S., Adams, K., Bechte l, C., Sweeney, J. \"Patient and Family Engagement: A framework for understanding the elements and developing interventions and policies.\" Health Affairs . 2013; 32:223- 231. 17 impact infrastructure through the Cross -cutting/Systems Building domain to improve the areas impacting multiple population domains like family partnership and data infrastructure . When selecting new measures it is important that the following checklist items have been satisfied. Measure Checklist Check if Answer is Yes A minimum of 5 NPMs is selected There is at least one NPM selected for each population health domain *NPM #7, #8, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15 selected in multiple domains count once toward the minimum of five There is a NPM/SPM for each state priority All selected NPMs/SPMs have clear alignment with the state priorities State Performance and Outcome Measures To address state priorities not addressed by the National Performance Measures, the State Performance Measures (SPMs) can be dev eloped. There is no minimum or maximum number of SPMs required. As mentioned earlier, the combination of NPMs with state -developed SPMs allows the state flexibility to reflect its priority needs from the most recent F ive-Year Needs Assessment. For the d eveloped SPMs , states will continue with the performance objectives for five years ( FY 2018 -FY 2022) for each of the measures. States may revise their SPM objectives in future years' Applications/Annual Reports. The development of the SPMs coincides with the selection of NPMs and the development of the state ESMs. States will also develop detail sheets on these measures, which will define the: (1) measure; (2) goal; (3) indicator, numerator, and denominator; (4) data source; and (5) significance. States will track their developed SPMs throughout the five -year reporting cycle. Data for the SPMs (i.e., indicator/numerator/denominator) will be entered annually by the state. A state can retire a SPM during the five -year reporting cycle and replace it with another SPM based on its MCH priority needs. States are not required to develop ESMs for SPMs. A state may also develop (but is not required to develop) one or more State Outcome Measures (SOMs) based on its MCH priorities, as determined by the fin dings of the Five -Year Needs Assessment, provided that none of the NOMs address the same priority area for the state. A SOM should be linked with a performance measure to show the impact of performance on the intended outcome. States will track the SOMs during the five -year reporting cycle and the SOM can be retired if the state chooses. Data for the SOMs (i.e., indicator/numerator/ denominator) will be entered annually by the state. 18 Table 2.

Increase the proportion of pregnant women who receive prenatal care beginning in the first trimester . (Baseline: 70.8 % of females delivering a live birth received prenatal care beginning in the first trimester in 2007, Target: 77.9%) DATA SOURCES and DATA ISSUES National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) SIGNIFICANCE Early prenatal care is essential for identification of maternal disease and risks for complications of pregnancy or birth. This can help ensure that women with complex problems, chronic illness, or other risks are seen by specialists. Early prenatal care can also provide important education and counseling on modifiable risks in pregnancy, including smoking, drinking, and inadequate or excessive weight gain. Although early high- quality prenatal care is essential, particularly for women with chronic conditions or other risk factors, it may not be sufficient to assure optimal pregnancy outcomes. Efforts to improve pregnancy out comes and the health of mothers and infants should begin prior to conception, whether before a first or subsequent pregnancy. As many women are not aware of being pregnant at first, it is important to establish healthy behaviors and achieve optimal health well before pregnancy. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Rises in chronic conditions, including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, are likely to have contributed to this increase. Minority women and particularly non- Hispanic black women have higher rates of severe maternal morbidity. Non- Hispan ic Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native women had 2.1, 1.3, 1.2, and 1.7 times, respectively, higher rates of severe morbidity compared with non- Hispanic white women.

Reduce the rate of maternal mortality. (Baseline:12.7 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2007, Target: 11.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) DATA SOURCES and DATA ISSUES National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) for states and territories United Nations Maternal Mortality Estimation Interagency Group for the Freely Associated States in the Pacific Basin SIGNIFICANCE Maternal mortality is a sentinal indicator of health and health care quality worldwide. After a century of general improvement, the U.S. maternal mortality rate more than doubled over the past decade. Although most of this increase was likely due to chan ges in the ascertainment and identification of maternal deaths, at least part of the increase appears to be real and may be attributable to increases in chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. There are also significant raci al disparities with Black women having rates of maternal mortality at least 3 times that of White women. Maternal deaths can be prevented or reduced both by improving underlying maternal health as well as health care quality for leading causes of maternal death, such as hemmorhage and preeclampsia.

(Baseline: 8.2% in 2007, Target 7.8%) DATA SOURCES and DATA ISSUES National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) SIGNIFICANCE Low birth weight infants include pre-term infants and infants with intrauterine growth retardation. Some risk factors for low birth weight babies include: chronic health conditions, inadequate weight gain, both young and old maternal age, poverty, smoking, substance abuse, and multiple births. Low birth weight infants are more likely than normal weight infants to die in the first year of life and to experience long- range physical and developmental health problems. In 2013, 65% of all infant deaths occurred to the 8% of low birth weight i nfants and over half (53%) of all infant deaths occurred to the 1.4% of very low birth weight infants. Infants born to non- Hispanic Black women have the highest rates of low birth weight, particularly very low birth weight, with levels that are about two or more times greater than for infants born to women of other race and ethnic groups.

DEFINITION Numerator: Number of live births before 37 weeks of complete gestation Denominator: Number of live births Units: 100 Text: Percent HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 OBJECTIVE Identical to Maternal, Infant, and Child Health (MICH) Objective 9.1: Reduce total preterm births (PTB). (Baseline:10.4% in 2007, Target 9.4%) DATA SOURCES and DATA ISSUES National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) SIGNIFICANCE Babies born preterm, before 37 completed weeks of gestation, are at greater risk of immediate life- threatening health problems, as well as long- term complications and developmental delays. Currently, about 1 in every 10 infants are born prematurely. Preter m birth is a leading cause of infant death and childhood disability, accounting for at least a third of all infant deaths. Although the risk of complications is greatest among those babies who are born the earliest, even those babies born \"late preterm\" (34 to 36 weeks' gestation) and \"early term\" (37, 38 weeks' gestation) are more likely than full - term babies to experience morbidity and mortality. Infants born to non- Hispanic Black women have the highest rates of preterm birth, particularly early preterm birth, with levels that are at least 1.5 times those for infants born to women of other race and ethnic groups. Risk factors include chronic conditions, obesity, substance use, poverty, short birth intervals, and multiple births. Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention.

(Baseline: 6.6 fetal and infant deaths per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths occurred dur ing the perinatal period, 28 weeks gestation to 7 days after birth, in 2005; Target: 5.9 perinatal deaths per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths) DATA SOURCES and DATA ISSUES National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) SIGNIFICANCE Perinatal mortality is a reflection of the health of the pregnant woman and newborn as well as the quality of perinatal care. Risk factors for perinatal mortality include smoking during pregnancy, maternal obesity, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes, infections and previous poor pregnancy outcome. In 2013, the rate of perinatal mortality was 6.24 perinatal deaths per 1,000 live births and fetal deaths. The perinatal mortality rate is particularly high for non- Hispanic Black women. In 2013, the rate for non- Hispanic black women (10.75) was the highest among the racial and ethnic groups, and was more than twice the rate for non- Hispanic white women (5.25).

(Baseline: 6.7 infant deaths per 1,000 live births within the first year of life in 2006, Target: 6.0 infant deaths per 1,000 live births) DATA SOURCES and DATA ISSUES National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) for states and territorities United Nations Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation for the Freely Associated States in the Pacific Basin SIGNIFICANCE Infant mortality, or the death of a child within the first year of life, is a sentinel measure of population health that reflects the underlying well -being of mothers and families, as well as the broader community and social environment that cultivate health and access to health- promoting resources. After a period of stagnation from 2000 to 2005, the U.S. infant mortality rate has continued to decline to record low levels below 6 per 1,000 live births. However, significant disparities continue to persist between racial groups, especially for infants born to non- Hispanic black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Puerto Rican women. The infant mortality rate among non- Hispanic blacks is more than twice that of non- Hispanic whites. Leading causes of infant mortality include prematurity, birth defects, and sudden unexpected infant deaths. Infant mortality continues to be an extremely complex health issue with many medical, social, and economic determinants.

DEFINITION Numerator: Number of deaths to infants under 28 days Denominator: Number of live births Units: 1,000 Text: Rate HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 OBJECTIVE Identical to Maternal, Infant, and Child Health (MICH) Objective 1.4: Reduce the rate of neonatal deaths (within the first 28 days of life). (Baseline: 4.5 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births occurred within the first 28 days of life in 2006, Target: 4.1 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births) DATA SOURCES and DATA ISSUES National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) for states and territorities United Nations Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation for the Freely Associated States in the Pacific Basin SIGNIFICANCE Neonatal deaths, within the first month of life, account for approximately two- thirds of all infant deaths in the U.S. Neonatal mortality is related to gestational age, low birth weight, congenital malformations and health problems originating in the perinatal period, such as infections or birth trauma. A significant disparity exists in neonatal deaths between racial groups, especially for infants born to Black women. Non- Hispanic black women had the highest neonatal mortality rate in 2013 at 7.46, 2.2 times that for non- Hispanic white women (3.34). Neonatal mortality rates were also higher for P uerto Rican (4.23), American Indian/Alaska Native (4.11), and Mexican women (3.51) than for non- Hispanic white women.

DEFINITION Numerator: Number of deaths due to preterm -related causes. Causes are defined as preterm -related if 75% or more of infants whose deaths were attributed to that cause were born at at less than 37 weeks of gestation, and the cause of death was a direct consequence of preterm bi rth based on a clinical evaluation and review of the literature. This includes low birth weight, several maternal complications, respiratory distress, bacterial sepsis, etc. To be included as a preterm -related death, the infant must have been born preter m (<37 completed weeks of gestation) with the underlying cause of death assigned to one of the following Units: 100,000 Text: Rate HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 OBJECTIVE Related to Maternal, Infant, and Child Health (MICH) Objective 1.3: Reduce the rate of all infant deaths (within 1 year). (Baseline: 6.7 infant deaths per 1,000 live births within the first year of life in 2006, Target: 6.0 infant deaths per 1,000 live births) DATA SOURCES and DATA ISSUES National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) SIGNIFICANCE Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality, accounting for approximately one- third of all infant deaths. Preterm -related mortality can be prevented both by reducing preterm birth as well as improving access to risk -appropriate perinatal care for infants born prematurely. Similar to preterm birth and overall infant mortality, there are significant racial/ethnic disparities in preterm -related mortality. In 2013, the preterm -related mortality rates were highest for infants born to non- Hispanic blac k and Puerto Rican women (3 and 1.5 times higher than non -Hispanic white women). Preterm -related deaths account for over half of the overall infant mortality gap between non- Hispanic blacks and non- Hispanic whites and almost all of the gap between Puerto- Ricans and non- Hispanic whites.

(Baseline: .93 per 1,000 live births in 2006, Target: .84 infant deaths per 1,000 live births) DATA SOURCES and DATA ISSUES National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) SIGNIFICANCE Sleep -related SUIDs are the leading cause of death in infants from one month up to one year (postneonatal deaths) and account for approximately 15% of all infant deaths. SUID rates vary greatly by race and ethnicity. In 2013, SUID rates were highest for i nfants born to non- Hispanic black mothers and American Indian/Alaska Native (173 and 170 SUIDs per 100,000 live births, respectively); these rates were more than twice the rate among infants born to non- Hispanic whites (85 SUIDs per 100,000 live births). S UIDs account for 33% of the overall infant mortality gap between American Indian/Alaska Native and non- Hispanic whites and 15% of the gap between non-Hispanic blacks and non- Hispanic whites. To reduce SUIDs, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends s afe sleep practices, such as placing babies to sleep on their backs on a separate firm sleep surface without soft objects or loose bedding, as well as other protective practices such as breastfeeding and smoking cessation.

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) represents the severe end of FASDs, and is characterized by abnormal facial features (e.g., smooth ridge between nose and upper lip), lower than average height or weight, and central nervous system pr oblems that create deficits in learning, memory, attention, communication, vision, and/or hearing. FASDs are preventable through abstinence from alcohol among pregnant women. Early diagnosis and intervention programs are critical to improve developmental outcomes for children with FAS.

Symptoms of NAS include fever, diarrhea, irritability, trembling, and increased muscle tone. Along with a rise in prescription drug abuse, the incidence of NAS nearly tripled over the past decade with substantial increases in health care costs. Prevention strategies exist along the continuum from preconception, prenatal, postpartum, and infant/childhood stages to help avert substance- exposed pregnancies and improve outcomes for infants born with NAS.

(Developmental) Increase the proportion of children who are ready for school in all five domains of healthy development: physical development, social -emotional development, approaches to learning, language, and cogni tive development. DATA SOURCES and DATA ISSUES National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH). SIGNIFICANCE The early years are a critical period where experiences impact structural development of the brain and neurobiological pathways for functional development. Although early experiences do not determine children's ongoing development, interventions around school readiness and early childhood education can act as a protective factor against the future onset of adult disease and disability . Studies have shown that children's literacy and numeracy skills at school entry are a good predictor of later academic achievement , high levels of education and secur e employment. Social gradients in language and literacy, communication and socioemotional functioning emerge early for children across socioeconomic backgrounds, and these differences persist into the school years. There are also disparities in the US as t o who participates in an early childhood program. C hildren at risk of poor developmental and educational outcomes benefit from attending high- quality education and care programs in the years before school.

DATA SOURCES and DATA ISSUES National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) SIGNIFICANCE Tooth decay (cavities) is among the most common chronic conditions of childhood. Untreated tooth decay can lead to pain and infections which may result in problems with eating, speaking, learning and playing. Children with poor oral health tend to miss more school and get lower grades than those who do not. Tooth decay can be prevented through recommended preventive dental care, including flouride varnish and dental sealants, community water flouridation, and oral hygeine practices, including brushing and flossing.

Teenage drivers have crash rates that are nearly three times those of drivers older than 20 years. Factors related to lack of driving experience and maturity contribute to motor vehicle mortality, such as driving too fast, violating traffic signals, alcohol use and presence of other teenage passengers. Motor vehicle death rates greatly increase during the teen years and stay high into early adulthood. Males are nearly twice as l ikely as females to die in motor vehicle accidents. Non- Hispanic white male and American Indian/Alaskan male adolescents have the highest motor vehicle mortality rate among 15- 19 year olds. Child Trends: Data Bank.

Although they represented less than 2% of all births in 2010, VLBW infants accounted for 53% of all infant deaths, with a risk of death over 100 times higher than that of normal birth weight infants (2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds). VLBW infants are significantly more likely to survive and thrive when born in a facility with a level -III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), a subspecialty facility equipped to handle hi gh-risk neonates. In 2012, the AAP provided updated guidelines on the definitions of neonatal levels of care to include Level I (basic care), Level II (specialty care), and Levels III and IV (subspecialty intensive care) based on the availability of appro priate personnel, physical space, equipment, and organization.

Sleep- related SUIDs include Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), unknown cause, and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed. Due to heightened risk of SIDS when infants are placed to sleep in side (lateral) or stomach (prone) sleep posit ions, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has long recommended the back (supi ne) sleep position. In 2011, AAP expanded its recommendations to help reduce the risk of all sleep -related deaths through a safe sleep environment that includes use of the back -sleep position, on a separate firm sleep surface (room -sharing without bed sharing), and without loose bedding. http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/128/5/1030 71 PERFORMAN CE MEASURE 6 Percent of children, ages 9 through 35 months, who received a d evelopmental screening using a parent -completed screening tool in the past year GOAL To increase the percent of children who receive a developmental screening.

E stimates suggest nearly 30% of American adolescents reported at least moderate bullying experiences as the bully, the victim, or both. B ullying experiences are associate d with a number of behavioral, emotional, and physical adjustment problems. Adolescents who bully others tend to exhibit other defiant and delinquent behaviors, have poor school performance, be more likely to drop- out of school, and are more likely to bri ng weapons to school. Victims of bullying tend to report feelings of depression, anxiety, low self -esteem, and isolation; poor school performance; suicidal ideation; and suicide attempts. Bullying victims who also perpetrate bullying (i.e., bully -victims ) may exhibit the poorest functioning, in comparison with either victims or bullies. Emotional and behavioral problems experienced by victims, bullies, and bully -victims may continue into adulthood and produce long- term negative outcomes, including low sel f-esteem and self -worth, depression, antisocial behavior, vandalism, drug use and abuse, criminal behavior, gang membership, and suicidal ideation. www.stopbullying.gov 76 PERFORMANCE MEASURE 10 Percent of adolescents, ages 12 through 17, with a preventive medical visit in the past year GOAL To increase the percent of adolescents who have a preventive medical visit.

(Baseline: 68.7%, Target: 75.6%) DATA SOURCES and DATA ISSUES National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) MCH POPULATION DOMAIN Adolescent Health SIGNIFICANCE Adolescence is a period of major physical, psychological, and social development. As adolescents move from childhood to adulthood, they assume individual responsibility for health habits, and those who have chronic health problems take on a greater role in managing those c onditions. Initiation of risky behaviors , such as unsafe sexual activity, unsafe driving, and substance use , is a critical health issue during adolescence, as adolescents try on adult roles and behaviors. An annual preventive well visit may help adolescents adopt or maintain healthy habits and behaviors, avoid health damaging behaviors, manage chronic conditions, and prevent disease. The Bright Futures guidelines recommends that adolescents have an annual checkup from age 11 through 21 . The visit should cover a comprehensive set of preventive services, such as a physical examination, immunizations, and discussion of health related behaviors including healthy eating, physical activity, substance use, sexual behavior, violence, and motor vehicl e safety.

The Needs Assessment process includes the collection and examination of information about the state's capacity and infrastructure, needs and desired outcomes for the MCH population, and legislative mandates, etc. This information is utilized to determine priority goals, develop a plan of action, and to allocate funds and resources. The Needs Assessment is a collaborative proces s that should include the HRSA/MCHB, the state Department of Health, families, practitioners, the community, and other agencies and organizations within each state and jurisdiction that have an interest in the well- being of the MCH population. Title V of the Social Security Act requires states to conduct a statewide Needs Assessment every five years. States will report on the next Five -year Needs Assessment in calendar year 2020 as part of the FY 2021 MCH Block Grant Application process. Rather than subm itting a comprehensive \"stand -alone document\", as was required prior to 2015, states now submit a Five-year Needs Assessment Summary that concisely describes the process and findings. As the Needs Assessment document may serve multiple purposes, a state m ay wish to develop a more comprehensive document to meets its broader needs. This document cannot be submitted in place of the required Five -year Needs Assessment Summary, but states may include a URL, if the document is posted online, in the Five -year Ne eds Assessment Summary or they may submit the document as an attachment to the Application/Annual Report in the electronic application system. Over the five -year reporting period, states are encouraged to continuously revisit the Five -Year Needs Assessmen t Summary and to provide updates, as needed, in the interim year Applications/Annual Reports. Furthermore, it is expected that states will have ongoing communication with stakeholders and partners throughout the Needs Assessment process and continue to engage with such partners during the interim reporting years. The primary goal of the statewide Needs Assessment is to improve MCH outcomes and to strengthen its state, local and community partnerships for addressing the needs of its MCH population. The fo llowing figure illustrates the continuity of the Needs Assessment process and its relationship to the planning and monitoring functions of Title V and the population that it serves. 84 A brief description of the steps involved in the Public Health Planning Cycle to inform ongoing needs assessment is presented in the following sections. 1. Engage Stakeholders As depicted, the starting point for the Needs Assessment process is to engage stakeholders . Engaging stakeholders and strengthening partnerships is a continuous and on -going activity. The state needs strong partnerships with its stakeholders throughout t he Needs Assessment process. Effective coalitions can help the state to realistically assess needs and identify desired outcomes and mandates, assess strengths and examine capacity, select priorities, seek resources, set performance State MCH Block Grant Needs Assessment, Planning, Implementation and Monitoring Process 85 objectives, develop an action plan, allocate resources, and monitor progress for impact on targeted outcomes. 2. Assess Needs and Identify Desired Outcomes and Mandates The second stage in the process is to assess needs of the MCH population groups using the Title V National Outcome Measures (NOMs), national, state and strategy performance measures and other available state -level quantitative and qualitative data. States should assess MCH population needs based on the following five population health domains: 1) Women/Maternal Health; 2) Perinatal/Infant Health; 3) Child Health; 4) Adolescent Health; and 5) Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN). These population health domains fall with the three MCH population groups that are defined in Section 505(a)(1) of the Title V legislation. The anticipated outcome of this assessment is to identify community/system needs and desired outcomes by specific MCH population groups. In addition, the s tate will need to identify needs and desired outcomes for cross -cutting and syste ms issues. The state will also need to identify legislative, political, community -driven, financial, and/or other internal and external mandates which may go beyond the findings identified through the Needs Assessment process but are priorities for implem entation within the state. 3. Examine Strengths and Capacity The third stage in the Needs Assessment process is examining strengths and capacity . This stage involves examining the state's capacity to engage in various activities, including conducting the s tatewide Five -year Needs Assessment and collecting/reporting annual performance data based on the five identified MCH population health domains and the types of MCH services provided. This stage involves describing and assessing the state's current resources, activities, and services as well as the state's ability to continue to provide quality services by each of the three MCH service levels. These levels include 1) Direct Services; 2) Enabling Services; and 3) Public Health Services and Systems. The anticipated outcome is a better understanding of the relationship of the state's existing program/system capacity to its identified strengths and needs. This examination ma y reveal strengths and weaknesses in capacity not previously identified. 4. Select Priorities In the select priorities stage, each state examines the identified needs and matches them to the desired outcomes, required mandates and level of existing capacity . As a result, states will select seven to ten priority areas for targeted focus in promoting continued improvement and progress. Examples of inputs include: the Needs 86 Assessment process, the opinions of stakeholders, the examination of program capacity and the political priorities within the s tate. The anticipated outcome is the development of a set of priority needs (between seven and ten), which are unique to the individual state based on its Needs Assessment findings. Priorities identified should address areas in which the state believes there is reasonable opportunity for a focused programmatic effort (e.g., new or enhanced interventions, initiatives, or systems of care) to lead to an improved outcome. 5. Set Performance Objectives Setting performan ce objectives consists of two phases. In the first phase, each state will develop action strategies to address their identified priority needs. Based on the priority needs and program strategies developed, the state will select five National Performance Measures (NPMs), Evidence -based or -informed Strategy Measures (ESMs) for addressing each of the selected NPMs and State Performance Measures (SPMs). SPMs should be based on the state's identified MCH priorities and target those priority needs that are no t fully addressed by the selected NPMs and their related ESMs. Secondly, the state will set five -year targets (i.e., performance objectives) for the five selected NPMs, the ESMs and the SPMs. The anticipated results of this stage are the identification of NOMs, NPMs, ESMs and SPMs that directly relate to the s tate priorities and establish a level of accountability for achieving measureable progress. 6. Develop an Action Plan The next stage is to develop an action plan, which involves the planning and identification of specific activities for implementing the program strategies which were developed in Stage 5 to address the identified priority needs and selected national/state measures. In developing an Action Plan, st ates will create the Five -year State Action Plan Table. As a planning tool, states will have flexibility in how they format the Table provided that the information is organized around the five identified population health domains. At a minimum, the Five -year State Action Plan Table should include the relevant priority needs, key strategies and measures (i.e., NOMs, NPMs, SPMs and ESMs) for each of the MCH health domains. Based on the identified priorities, measures and strategies, the state will develop a five -year program plan that includes specific activities for achieving the targeted outcomes and performance specific to each health domain. In developing the Action Plan, the state shall complete a Five -year State Action Plan Table as part of the first year Application/Annual Report in the five year cycle. This Table is a tool to assist states in aligning their program strategies, NPMs, SPMs and ESMs with the priority needs that were identified in the Five -year Needs Assessment. Updates to the strateg ies, activities and measures will be provided by the state, as 87 needed, in subsequent interim year Applications/Annual Reports. Figure 4 in Part Two, Section II of the Application/Annual Report Guidance depicts the steps involved in the developme nt of, and the annual reporting on, the implementation of the Five -year State Action Plan. 7. Seek and Allocate Resources Following the identification of program activities is the allocation of resources stage. In this stage, the focus is on the funding o f planned activities to address state priorities. Inputs include the five -year State Action Plan, current budgets, political priorities, and partnerships. The anticipated outcome is the development of a program budget and plan that directs available reso urces towards the activities identified in Stage Six as the most important for addressing the state's priorities. 8. Monitor Progress for Impact on Outcomes In monitoring progress for impact on outcomes , the states examine the results of their efforts to se e if there has been improvement. Inputs include NOMs, NPMs, SPMs and ESMs, performance objectives and other quantitative and qualitative information. Potential outcomes may include altered activities and shifting of resource allocations to address current levels of performance and availability of resources. Feedback loops between various stages of the process allow for continuous input and re -evaluation of the outputs. 9. Report Back to Stakeholders This final step assures accountability to the stakeholders and partners who have worked with the MCH staff throughout the Needs Assessment process. It also assures the continued involvement of all stakeholders and partners in the ongoing Needs Assessment processes. 88 APPENDIX F : ASSURANCES AND CERTIFICATIONS View Burden Statement OMB Number: 4040 -0007 Expiration Date: 06130/2014 ASSURANCES - NON -CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 15 minutes per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

SIGNATURE OF AUTHORIZED CERTIFYING OFFICIAL TITLE APPLICANT ORGANIZATION DATE SUBMITTED 90 HHS -5161 -1 (08/2007 ) CERTIFICATIONS OMB Approval No. 0990 -0317 1. CERTIF1CATION REGARDING LOBBYING Title 31, United States Code, Section 1352, entitled \"Limitation on use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracting and financial transactions,\" generally prohibits recipients of Federal grants and cooperative agreements from using Federal (appropriated) funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government in connection with a SPECIFIC grant or cooperative agreement. Section 1352 also requires that each person who requests or receives a Federal grant or cooperative agreement must disclose lobbying undertaken with non-Federal (non-appropriated) funds. These requirements apply to grants and cooperative agreements EXCEEDING $100,000 in total costs (45 CFR Part 93). By signing and submitting this application, the applicant is providing certification set out in Appendix A to 45 CFR Part 93. 2. CERTIF1CATION REGARDING PROGRAM FRAUD CIVIL REMEDIES ACT (PFCRA ) The authorized official signing for the applicant organization certifies that the statements herein are true, complete, and accurate to the best of his or her knowledge, and that he or she is aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or claims may subject him or her to criminal, civil, or administrative penalties. The official signing agrees that the applicant organization will comply with the HHS terms and conditions of award if a grant is awarded as a result of this application. 3. CERTIF1CATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE Public Law 103-227, also known as the Pro-Children Act of 1994 (Act), requires that smoking not be permitted in any portion of any indoor facility owned or leased or contracted for by an entity and used routinely or regularly for the provision of health, day care, early childhood development services, education or library services to children under the age of 18, if the services are funded by Federal programs either directly or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee. The law also applies to children's services that are provided in indoor facilities that are constructed, operated, or maintained with such Federal funds. The law does not apply to children's services provided in private residence, portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment, service providers whose sole source of applicable Federal funds is Medicare or Medicaid, or facilities where WIC coupons are redeemed.

To access the Glossary, click on: ( https://www.mchnavigator.org/documents/Glossary_of_MCH_Terms_and_Acronyms_2012 - 11-17.pdf ). This project is administered by Georgetown University through funding provided by the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB.) The MCH Navigator is a learning portal for MCH professionals, students, and others working to improve the health and well- being of women, children, adole scents, and families. Definitions included in this Glossary are intended to supplement the broader set of terms that are included in the MCH Navigator Glossary. The following list of terms and their definitions have specific relevance to the Stat e Title V MCH Block Grant s. MCH Working Framework: MCH Pyramid of Services 95 As depicted on the Revised MCH Pyramid, the working framework for the MCH Block Grant aligns with the 10 MCH Essential Services and consists of three levels. Definitions are provided below for each level of service. In developing systems of care, s tates should assure that they are family -centered, c ommunity -based and culturally competent. Direct Services - Direct services are preventive, primary, or specialty clinical services to pregnant women and children, including children with special health care needs, where MCH Services Block Grant funds are used to reimburse or fund providers for these services through a formal process similar to paying a medical billing claim or managed care contracts. State reporting on direct services should not include the costs of clinical services which are delivered with Title V dollars but reimbursed by Medicaid, CHIP or other public or private payers. Examples include, but are not limited to, preventive, primary or specialty care visits, emergency department visits, in patient services, outpatient and inpatient mental and behavioral health services, prescription drugs, occupational and physical therapy, speech therapy, durable medical equipment and medical supplies, medical foods, dental care, and vision care. Enabling Services - Enabling services are non -clinical services (i.e., not included as direct or public health services) that enable individuals to access health care and improve health outcomes where MCH Services Block Grant funds are used to finance these servic es. Enabling services include, but are not limited to: case management, care coordination, referrals, translation/interpretation, transportation, eligibility assistance, health education for individuals or families, environmental health risk reduction, he alth literacy, and outreach. State reporting on enabling services should not include the costs for enabling services that are reimbursed by Medicaid, CHIP, or other public and private payers. This category may include salary and operational support to a clinic that enable individuals to access health care or improve health outcomes. Examples include the salary of a public health nurse who provides prenatal care in a local clinic or compensation provided to a specialist pediatrician who provides services for children with special health care needs. Public Health Services and Systems - Public health services and systems are activities and infrastructure to carry out the core public health functions of assessment, assurance, and policy development, and the 10 essential public health services. Examples include the development of standards and guidelines, needs assessment, program planning, implementation, and evaluation, policy development, quality assurance and improvement, workforce development, and population -based disease prevention and health promotion campaigns for services such as newborn screening, immunization, injury prevention, safe -sleep education and anti-smoking. State reporting on public health services and systems should not include cos ts for direct clinical preventive services, such as immunization, newborn screening tests, or smoking cessation. Number of Individuals and Percentage of Populations Served by Title V (Form 5) Form 5a, Count of Individuals Served by Title V , enables the s tate to track and report on the number of who received an individually -delivered service funded in part or in full by the Title V 96 program within the top two levels of the MCH Pyramid (direct and enabling services). This includes individuals receiving serv ices funded by total Federal and State dollars reported on line 8 of Form 2, and should align with the combined totals on Form 3a and 3b for direct and enabling services. Data sources are typically reimbursement or individual client records. Pregnant wom en may also receive non -pregnancy related services and be counted in other participant categories (i.e. children ages one ( 1) through 21 and others). All remaining categories are mutually exclusive with CSHCN reported as a subset of all children ages one (1) through 21. Within each reporting category, the count of individuals served should be unduplicated to the fullest extent possible. Examples of direct and enabling services by participant category that Title V may fund in part or in full are provided below. Pregnant women (through 60 days postpartum) - payment for prenatal, delivery, or postpartum care, case management, insurance eligibility assistance . Infants (less than age one) - payment for well child visits, immunization, case management . Child ren ages one ( 1) through 21, including CSHCN - payment for well child visits, immunization, dental sealants, school -based health center services, specialty care services and care coordination . Others (women and men over 21) - payment for well- woman visits, education or family - centered care provided to parents/guardians of children. Form 5b, Total Percentage of Populations Served by Title V , enables the s tate to track and report on the total percentage who received a Title V -supported service within all levels of the MCH Pyramid (direct services, enabling services, and public health services and systems). The purpose of this form is to better capture the breadth of the State's Title V program and its reach in serving the MCH population. Included in t his reporting are all individuals and populations served by the total Federal and State dollars , as reported on line 8 of Form 2 , and the combined totals on Form 3a and 3b for all service levels. Non -Title V programs that provide direct and enabling services (e.g., WIC and Home Visiting) may be included if Title V funds or staff time are used to promote or enhance services. (Individual services that are Title V-funded may also be counted in Form 5a.) To avoid duplication, numerators for the percentage estimate should focus on the programs and services that have the largest reach for a given population, which generally involves the public health services and s ystems level of the MCH Pyramid. Approximate denominators for each population group will be provided to facilitate percentage estimation. Within public health services and systems, only those reached by activities directly connected to promoting the acce ss or quality of specific population -based services and systems should be counted. Examples of these public health services and systems activities, as well as direct/enabling service partnerships, are provided below by participant category. Pregnant women (through 60 days postpartum) Develop and/or maintain a system of risk -appropriate perinatal care designations and transfer protocols (count 100%) . 97 Fund local health departments to engage provider groups and promote screening for perinatal depression , smoking or substance use (count number or percent of births in funded counties). Partner with Medicaid or other health plans to implement a policy/procedural change to reduce low -risk cesarean delivery or promote smoking cessation (count number or % served by Medicaid or other health plans) . Outreach to hospitals to institute a safe sleep or baby friendly policy, distribute educational materials, or participate in a QI collaborative (count number or % of births in participating hospitals) . Partner with WI C or home visiting programs to provide staff training or otherwise promote education, screening, or referrals on smoking cessation or preventive dental services (count number or % of pregnant/postpartum women served) . Infants (less than age one) Administer, develop guidelines/standards/policies, or otherwise assure the newborn screening program (count 100%) . Develop and/or maintain a system of risk -appropriate perinatal care designations and transfer protocols (count 100%). Outreach to hospitals t o institute a safe sleep or baby friendly policy, distribute educational materials, or participate in a QI collaborative (count number or % of infants served ). Partner with WIC or home visiting programs to provide staff training or otherwise promote educat ion/counseling on safe sleep practices (count number or % of pregnant/postpartum women served) . Implement a statewide campaign to promote safe sleep practices (count number of Web hits). Children ages one (1) through 21, including CSHCN Develop and main tain a statewide registry for developmental screening and follow -up (count number of children age one (1) through 5) . Develop or promote school -based injury prevention, oral health, or physical activity programs (count number of children in participating schools) . Partner with Medicaid, health plans, pediatric practices, or schools to implement a policy/procedural change, QI collaborative, or other campaign to promote the adolescent well visit (count number of adolescents enrolled or served by plan/practic e/school) . Fund local health departments to promote and advance the medical home model among all pediatric providers (count number of children in local counties). Develop and maintain a comprehensive system of services for CSHCN (count number of CSHCN served; if percentage served is lower than other population -based services for all children, report service percentage for all children as CSHCN are not excluded from general services) . 98 Others (women and men over age 21) Implement a statewide campaign to promote the well -woman visit (count number of web hits) Partner with WIC or Home Visiting to improve screening/counseling for smoking cessation (count number of women with a child age one (1) or more to avoid duplication with pregnant women) Partner to promote family engagement services (count number of parents over 21 served) Title V Program Administration Administrative Title V Funds - The amount of funds the s tate uses for the management of the Title V allocation. This amount is limited by statute to 10 percent of the Federal Title V allotment. Capacity - Program capacity includes delivery systems, workforce, policies, and support systems (e.g., training, research, technical assistance, and information systems) and other infrastructure needed to m aintain service delivery and policy making activities. Program capacity results measure the strength of the human and material resources necessary to meet public health obligations. As program capacity sets the stage for other activities, program capacit y results are closely related to the results for process, health outcome, and risk factors. Program capacity results should answe r the question, \"What does the s tate need to achieve the results we want?\" Budget Period - Grant period for which funds are available for use by the state. For the MCH Block Grant, th e budget period is 24 month s, beginning on October 1 of the federal fiscal year in which the funds are awarded and ending on September 30 of the following federal fiscal year. Children - A child from age one (1) through 21 years. Data Systems Development - Development of data management systems (electronic or other) or linking of existing databases to support s tates' ability to collect, tabulate, analyze, and report data accurately. Early Neonatal Period - Period covered by the first week after birth or an age of less than seven days. Federal Allocation - The funding provided to the s tates under the Federal Title V Block Grant in any given fiscal year; applies specifically to the Application Face Sheet (SF-424) and Form 2. Federal Fiscal Year: The federal government 's fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30 of the following year. 99 Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) - Federal legislation enacted in 1993 that requires Federal agencies to develop strategic plans, prepare annual plans setting performance goals, and report annually on actual performance. Infants - Children in their first year of life ( <365 days). Jurisdictions - The following nine jurisdictions receive Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant Program funding: the District of Columbia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau and the U.S. territories of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Life Course Theory (LCT) - A conceptual framework that helps explain health and disease patterns , particularly health disparities , across populations and over time. Instead of focusing on differences in health patterns based on one disease or condition at a time, LCT points to broad social, economic and environmental factors as underlying causes of persistent inequalities in health for a wide range of diseases and conditions across population groups. LCT is population focused, and firmly rooted in social determinants and social equity models. Though not often explicitly state d, LCT is also community (or \"place\") focused, since social, economic and environmental patterns are closely linked to community and neighborhood settings. 7 Local - Funds derived from local health jurisdictions within the s tate, which are used for MCH program activities and reported on the Application Face Sheet (SF 424) and Form 2. Low Income - An individual or family with an income that is determined to be below the income official federal poverty line, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget and revis ed annually in accordance with section 673(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981. [Title V, Sec. 501 (b)(2)] Maintenance of Effort - State will maintain the level of funds being provided solely by such state for maternal and child health programs at a level at least equal to the level provided in FY 1989. Needs Assessment - A process to understand the strengths and needs of the health service system within a community or population. For maternal and child health purposes, needs assessment efforts consider the following components: 1) health status, 2) health service utilization, 3) health systems capacity, and 4) population/ community characteristics and contextual characteristics. Neonatal Period - period covered by the first month after birth or an age of less than 28 days . 7 https://mchb.hrsa.gov/training/lifecourse.asp 100 Newborn - A recently born infant, usually less than one month old. Objectives - A statement of intention with which actual achievement and results can be measured and compared. SMART objectives are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time -phased. See also Objectives and Performance Objectives within the Performance Measurement Section. Other Federal Funds - Federal funds other than the Title V Block Grant that are under the control of the person responsible for administration of the Title V program and reported on the Application Face Sheet (SF 424) and Form 2.

Pregnant Woman - A female from the time that she conceives to 60 days after birth, delivery, or expulsion of fetus. Prenatal - Occurring or existing before birth, referring to both the care of the woman during pregnancy and the growth and development of the fetus. Priority Needs - Title V legislation direct states to conduct a statewide, comprehensive MCH Needs Assessment every five years to identify the need for preventive and primary care services for pregnant women, mothers, infants, children and children with special health c are needs. From this assessment, states select seven to ten priorities for focused programmatic efforts over the five -year reporting cycle. Program Income - Funds collected by State MCH agencies from sources generated by the State's MCH program to include insurance payments, Medicaid reimbursements, HMO payments, etc., as reported on the Application Face Sheet [SF 424] and Form 2. State - Terminology used in this Guidance to reference the 50 s tates and the nine jurisdictions. (See also \"Jurisdictions\" ) State Funds - The s tate's required matching funds (including overmatch) in any given year, as reported on the Application Face Sheet [SF 424] and Form 2. 101 Strategies - General approaches taken to achieve objectives: activities are specific actions to implement the strategies. For example, a strategy may be to improve provider training with activities that could include developing a training module, delivering or promoting the training, and monitoring utilization and/or knowledge improvement. Program activities for implementing the identified program strategies are discussed and updated annually as part of the State Action Plan narrative. Technical Assistance (TA) - The process of providing advice, assistance, and training by an expert with specific technical/content knowledge to address an identified need. Technical Assistance relationships are program- focused, and may use an interactive, on- site/hands -on approac h as well as telephone or email assistance. Technical Assist ance delivery is short in duration, customized to meet the needs of the client, and offers prescriptive solutions to a specific issue. Title V of the Social Security Act - The authorizing legis lation for the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant to States Program.

(Sec. 2101. [42 U.S.C. 1397aa ]) Total MCH Funding - All of the MCH funds administered by a State MCH program. Included in this sum total are: 1) the Federal Title V Block grant allocation; 2) the Applicant's funds, which consists of the unobligated balance from the previous year's MCH Block Grant alloc ation, the state's total matching funds for the Title V allocation (match and overmatch); 3) the Local 102 funds, which are the total amount of MCH dedicated funds fr om local government within the state); 4) Other Federal funds (monies other than the Title V B lock Grant that are under the control of the person responsible for administration of the Title V program), and 5) Program Income (funds collected by State MCH agencies from insurance payments, Medicaid, HMO's, private grants, etc.) Unobligated Balance - The amount of unexpended funds from the previous project period for Title V MCH Block Grant, as reported as Applicant funds on the Application Face Sheet [SF 424] and as Unobligated Balance on Form 2. Performance Measurement Evidence -based or - Informed Strategy Measure (ESM) -Developed by the s tate, ESMs assess the outputs of State Title V strategies and activities contained in the State Action Plan. The development of ESMs is guided through an examination of evidenced- based or evidence- informed strateg ies, and determining what components are meaningful, measurable, and achievable. The main criteria for ESMs are in being meaningfully related to the selected NPM through scientific evidence or theory and being measurable by the state with improvement achievable in multiple years of the five -year reporting cycle. Evidence -based or - Informed Strategy Measure (ESM) O bjectives - The objectives for activities and interventions that drive the achievement of higher -level objectives by the State Title V program. Objectives - The yardsticks by which an agency can measure its efforts to accomplish a goal. (See also Performance Objectives) Outcome Measure - The ultimate focus and desired result of any set of public health program activities and interventions is a n improved health and well -being outcome. Health and well - being outcomes are usually longer term and tied to the ultimate program goal. Morbidity and mortality statistics are indicators of achievement of health outcomes. Other outcomes reflect commonly accepted indicators of a highly functioning system of care for children with special health care needs and their families, positive outcomes, outcomes which are legislatively mandated or are a legislative focus, outcomes where the prevalence is increasing, and developmental outcomes where a fully established measure d oes not exist. Performance Indicator - The statistical or quantitative value that expresses the result of a performance objective. Performance Measure - An intermediate outcome on the path toward a longer term outcome measure of health and well- being that is used to more directly assess the impact of a program. Positive health behaviors and access to quality health care are common intermediate outcomes that may lead to health, reduced morbidity and mortality, or highly functioning systems of care. 103 For example, to reduce infant mortality, State Title V programs may work to promote safe sleep practices or access to quality well- woman care. The performance measure is phrased as a quantitative indicator, such as a rate or percentage. For example, \"P ercentage of infants placed to sleep on their backs. \" Performance Measurement - The collection of data on, recording of, or tabulation of results or achievements, usually for comparison to a benchmark. Performance Objectives - A statement of intention with which actual achievement and results can be measured and compared. Performance objective statements clearly describe what is to be achieved, when it is to be achieved, the extent of the achievement, and the target populations. For example: \"Increase the percentage of infants placed to sleep on their backs in State X by 10% over the next 5 years.\" Risk Factors - Public health activities and programs that focus on reduction of scientifically established direct causes of, and contributors to, morbidity and mortality (i.e., risk factors) are essential steps toward achieving desired health outcomes. Changes in behavior or physiological conditions are the indicators of achievement of risk factor results. Results focused on risk factors tend to be intermediate term. Risk factor results should answer the question, \"Why should the s tate address this risk factor (i.e., what health outcome will this result support)?\" Risk Factor Objectives - Objectives that describe an improvement in risk factors (usually behavioral or physiological) that are associated with morbidity and mortality. Targets - An aspired outcome that is explicitly stated, e.g. \"Attain 90% of timeliness in reporting\" or \"Achieve 100% completeness of reporting \", etc. In this Guidance, \"Targets\" is often used interchangeably with \"Objectives.\" Collaborative Learning, Innovation and Quality Improvement Aim Statement - A written measureable description of desired outcomes used in a quality improvement initiative. A strong AIM statement outlines what is to be accomplished, quantifies the changes that are to be achieved a nd sets a date by which the goals will be reached. Blueprint for Change - A tool to help define action steps for a team's strategic priorities. CoIIN versus COIN - The Collaborative Impro vement and Innovation Network (CoIIN) initiative extends the Coll aboration Innovation Network (COIN) model to include the concept of improvement in recognition of the need to strengthen existing investments in maternal and infant health as well as to develop innovative, new approaches. 104 Collaborative Innovation Network (COIN) - A cyberteam of self -motivated people with a collective vision, enabled by the Web to collaborate in achieving a common goal by sharing ideas, information and work.8 Collaborative Learning - Projects using this model enable learners of different abilities and interests to work jointly in small groups to complete a project or solve a problem. Collective Impact - A concept that provides a framework for bringing diverse people and organizations together in a structured way to achieve social change.9 Driver Diagram - A logic chart that organizes the different aspects of an improvement project so key interventions and relationships between these interventions may be clearly understood by all involved. Infant Mortality CoIIN Framework - A framework that presents a theory of the relationships between (1) key domains of influence (e.g., engaged leadership or innovation), (2) the periods of engagement, and (3) the strategies priorities that will be employed to reduce infant mortality rates in the U.S. Learning Collaborative - A group of individuals or organizations that come together for a defined period of time to work together to improve process relevant to a specific topic. Members of a learning collaborative generally agree upon a shared set of data to measure and meet regularly to learn from each other and project experts. Learning Sessions - Members of learning collaboratives generally agree to a regular schedule of multi -day meetings throughout the collaborative. These meetings may be in person or virtual. The learning sessions allow Collaborative faculty and partners to share latest res earch or important information on the topic of the collaborative, and they allow participants to share their work and to learn from each other. Perinatal Periods of Risk (PPOR ) - Both a community approach and an analytic framework for investigating and addressing high infant mortality rates in urban settings. The overall intent of the PPOR approach is to develop a simple method that can be used by communities to mobilize and prioritize prevention efforts. PPOR brings community stakeholders together to build consensus, support and partnership around infant mortality rates. 10 Primary Drivers - Found in the CoIIN framework and driver diagrams, drivers are system components, factors or broad improvement areas that contribute directly to achieving the stated outcome. For example, if the outcome is reducing infant mortality, a strategic 8 Gloor, Peter A. \"Swarm Creativity.\" Competitive Advantage through Collaborative Innovation Network s.

(See Strategic Priorities.) Potential Action/Change Concept - Actionable s teps for change targeted at improving specific processes, often originating from brainstorming sessions with the team and evidence -based best practices. Quality Improvement in Public Health - The use of a deliberate and defined improvement process, whic h is focused on activities that are responsive to community needs and improving population health. This effort is continuous and ongoing to achieve measureable improvements in the efficiency, effectiveness, performance, accountability, outcomes and other indicators of quality in services or processes, which achieve equity and improve the health of the community. Strategic Priorities - Found in the CoIIN framework and driver diagrams, these priorities are system components, factors or broad improvement are as that contribute directly to achieving the stated outcome. For example, if the outcome is reducing infant mortality, a strategic priority/primary driver might be to improve access to and quality of prenatal care for women. Family Partnership Cultural Competence - A set of values, behaviors, attitudes, and practices within a system, organization, program or among individuals and which enables them to work effectively cross culturally. Further, cultural competence refers to the ability to honor and res pect the beliefs, language, inter- personal styles and behaviors of individuals and families receiv ing services, as well as staff who are providing such services . Culturally Sensitive - The recognition and understanding that different cultures may have different concepts and practices with regard to health care; the respect of those differences and the development of approaches to health care with those differences in mind. Family Partnership - For purposes of the MCH Block Grant, family partnership is defined as patients, families, their representatives, and health professionals working in active partnership at various levels across the health care system \u2014direct care, organizational design and governance, and policy making \u2014to improve health and health c are. 11 This partnership is accomplished through the intentional practice of working with families for the ultimate goal of positive outcomes in all areas through the life course.

Mortality Rate - The number of deaths occurring in a particular population dur ing a specific time period, as calculated by the number of deaths in that group (numerator) divided by the total population (denominator) and expressed as per 1,000 live births (infant mortality rate only) or per 100,000 population, generally at mid -year. National Improvement Partnership Network (NIPN) - A networ k of s tates who have an Improvement Partnership (IP), which is a durable collaborative of public and private partners that use the science of quality improvement and a systems approach to improve health care infrastructure and practice. Established in 2009, NIPN is led by the Vermont Child Health Improvement Program (VCHIP). National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) - Sponsored by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the NSCH examines the physical and emotional health status and health service needs and utilization patterns of children ages 0-17 years of age. Special emphasis is placed on factors that may relate to well- being of children, incl uding medical homes, family interactions, parental health, school and after- school experiences, and safe neighborhoods. The NSCH was fielded three times as a telephone -based survey, in 2003, 200 7 and 2011- 2012, yielding both s tate- and nationally -represen tative data. In 2016, the NSCH underwent a significant redesign, becoming an annual address -based mailed survey with a web- based response option that merged content from the previous NSCH and National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS -CSHCN). https://mchb.hrsa.gov/data/national -surveys National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS -CSHCN) - This survey was sponsored by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and Services Administration.

Additional information is available at: https://mchb.hrsa.gov/data/national - surveys . Newborn Screening (NBS) - The process of testing newborn babies for some serio us, but treatable, conditions. Four million newborns each year are tested for conditions on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (a set of conditions recommended by the Secretary of HHS for NBS) that are not apparent at birth but require early interven tion and treatment to mitigate brain and organ damage, severe illness, and life -threatening complications associated with these conditions. NBS can include a heel stick, hearing screen, and pulse oximetry. The conditions that newborn babies are screened for varies by state. When a newborn screening result is out -of-range , further diagnostic testing is required to confirm or specify the results. Newborn Screening Long -term Follow -up - Comprises the assurance and provision of ongoing quality chronic dise ase management, condition -specific treatment, and age -appropriate care throughout the lifespan of individuals identified with a condition included in newborn screening. Newborn Screening Short -term Follow -up - The process of ensuring that all newborns are screened, that an appropriate follow -up caregiver is informed of results, that confirmatory testing has been completed, and that the infant has received a diagnosis and, if necessary, treatment is initiated . Preventive Services - Activities aimed at reducing the incidence of health problems or disease prevalence in the community, or the personal risk factors for such diseases or conditions. Preventive Oral Health Services - Activities that aim to improve and maintain good oral health and function by reducing the onset and/or development of oral diseases or deformities and the occurrence of oro -facial injuries. Examples of preventive oral health services include, but are not limited to, oral hygiene instructions, fluoride treatm ent, and Dental Sealants. Primary Care/Primary Care Services - The provision of comprehensive personal health services that include health maintenance and preventive services, initial assessment of health problems, treatment of uncomplicated and diagnosed chronic health problems, and the overall management of an individual's or family's health care services. Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) - The RUSP is a list of disorders that are recommended by the Secretary of the Department of Healt h and Hu man Services (HHS) for states to screen as part of their s tate universal newborn screening (NBS) programs. Disorders on the RUSP are chosen based on evidence that supports the potential net benefit of screening, the ability of states to screen for the disorder, and the availability of effective treatments. It i s recommended that every newborn be screened for all disorders on the RUSP. Most s tates screen for the majority of disorders on the RUSP; newer conditions are still in process of adoption. Some states also screen for additional disorders. Although s tates ultimately 111 determine what disorders their NBS program will screen for, the RUSP establishes a standardized list of disorders that have been supported by the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children and the Secretary of HHS. Safe Infant Sleep Environment - Infant is placed to sleep on its back, in its own crib without blankets or soft items or bed -sharing.
