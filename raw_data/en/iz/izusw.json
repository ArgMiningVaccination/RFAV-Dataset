Spiritual Healing invokes a power that is intangible. This universal energy is both subtle and powerful, is the essence of all created and living things and is often described as Light, Life Force or the Vital Force. Many Spiritual Healers act as conduits or channels for this healing energy and once they have tuned in to their client and understand what needs to be healed, the practitioner can then direct it in such a way that it brings about benefit and relief for the client.
