About 2 in 5 Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetime, and about 1 in 4 Canadians will die of cancer. In 2014, it is estimated that 191,300 Canadians will develop cancer, and 76,600 will die of cancer. More than half of new cancer cases (52%) will be lung, breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, causing more cancer deaths among Canadians than the other three major cancer types combined. Despite this large impact, there has been a substantial drop in the lung cancer death rate (especially for men) over the past 25 years, which has driven a decline in the overall cancer death rate. Slightly more men than women get cancer in Canada, and the vast majority (89%) of Canadians who develop cancer are over the age of 50. However, cancer can occur at any age. Its impact at a younger age can be particularly devastating. According to Statistics Canada, in 2009, cancer was the leading cause of disease-related death in children under the age of 15 years. Overall, the five-year relative survival ratio for people diagnosed with cancer is 63%, but it ranges widely by the type of cancer. Some cancers have very high five-year relative survival ratios, including thyroid cancer (98%). Other cancers have consistently low five-year relative survival ratios, such as pancreatic cancer (8%). 810,045 Canadians were alive at the beginning of 2009 with a cancer diagnosed in the previous 10 years 1 in 4 Canadians will die from cancer 63% The likelihood, in Canada, of surviving at leas t 5 years after a cancer diagnosis compared to the survival of comparable people in the general population 76,600 Canadians will die of cancer in 2014 2 in 5 Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetime 191,300 Canadians will be diagnosed with cancer in 20147 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014As of January 2009, 810,045 Canadians had been diagnosed with cancer within the previous 10 years and were still alive on that date. This means that about 2.4% of the Canadian population was living with, or beyond, a cancer diagnosis in the decade leading up to 2009. This year's publication also features an in-depth analysis of skin cancer in Canada (Chapter 7: Special topic: Skin cancers). Skin cancer takes a significant toll in Canada related to the high burden of annual cases, social impact and costs associated with its treatment. In 2014, it is estimated that 6,500 new cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma and 76,100 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) will be diagnosed, making skin cancer the most common type of cancer in Canada. In addition, an estimated 1,050 deaths due to melanoma and 440 deaths due to NMSC are expected in 2014. To slow the rising rates of melanoma in Canada, efforts are needed to encourage better protection from the sun and from artificial sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The lack of sun safety awareness and sun protective behaviours of Canadians are a cause for concern and emphasize the need for clear and consistent sun safety messages for the public. The lack of good nationwide data on NMSC hinders our understanding of the magnitude of the skin cancer burden in Canada and our ability to adequately plan for future healthcare resource needs. Measuring the cancer burden in Canada is vital for health policy, and it helps decision-makers assess the type and allocation of health resources needed. The data are also essential in focusing prevention efforts, in both primary prevention of cancer and secondary prevention, allowing more effective treatment of certain cancers through earlier detection. Finally, these statistics can be useful for prioritizing services to help Canadians and their families who have been affected by cancer and who may need supportive care after their treatment has ended. We hope that our readers think critically about what these numbers mean and how they can be used to improve survival, develop better overall care for those with cancer and reduce cancer incidence in Canada. Executive Summary 8 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014About this publication Canadian Cancer Statistics is part of an annual series that began in 1987. It has been developed by cancer surveillance experts on the Canadian Cancer Statistics Advisory Committee who were brought together by the Canadian Cancer Society, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Statistics Canada. In addition to these organizations, members of this committee are from the Canadian Council of Cancer Registries, Canadian Partnership Against Cancer and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as researchers based in universities and provincial or territorial cancer agencies. Purpose and intended audience The aim of this annual publication is to provide detailed information regarding incidence, mortality, survival and other measures of cancer burden for the most common types of cancer. Data are presented by sex, age and province or territory. Trends over time are also examined. The publication is designed to help health professionals, policy-makers and researchers identify and make decisions about new areas for investigation. The media, educators and members of the public with an interest in cancer will also find this publication valuable. Format This publication is organized as follows: The I ntroduction provides an overview of cancer in Canada by describing the health and economic challenges posed by the disease, the potential role prevention can play in addressing the cancer burden and the value of surveillance in cancer control efforts in Canada. Chap ters 1 and 2 describe the incidence of cancer in Canada overall by age, sex, province and over time. Chap ters 3 and 4 examine the mortality associated with cancer in Canada by age, sex, province and over time. Chap ter 5 focuses on relative survival for cancer in Canada by age, sex, province and over time. Chap ter 6 describes the prevalence of cancer in Canada by examining the number of cancer cases and the number of people affected by cancer who are still alive. Chap ter 7 is a special topic that explores the epidemiology of skin cancer (both melanoma and non-melanoma), its risk factors, challenges in prevention and new developments related to the control of this disease in Canada. In future editions, this chapter will feature other emerging or prominent issues on cancer, which are selected annually based on criteria that include data availability, recent trends and feedback from our readers through evaluation forms . The ap pendices provide the actual (not projected) data for new cancer cases and deaths, as well as additional information on data sources and projection methods. They also discuss caveats to the analyses presented in this publication and provide a listing of previously covered special topics, which are available in past editions of this publication. The la st section of this publication (For further information ) includes contact information for partner organizations and the provincial and territorial cancer registries.The Introduction and Chapters 1 to 7 conclude with a list of other relevant resources, including links to online databases for additional analyses. Analysis and production The Chronic Disease Surveillance and Monitoring Division of the Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention (CCDP) at the Public Health Agency of Canada conducted the data analyses on incidence, mortality, probability and trends presented in this publication. The Health Statistics Division of Statistics Canada conducted the analyses on survival and prevalence presented in this publication. Provincial and territorial cancer registries were consulted regarding the cancer incidence and mortality estimates for their own jurisdictions. The Canadian Cancer Society supports the production of this publication with charitable funds. Ms Monika Dixon coordinated the production process and provided administrative support from the initial planning through to release. A note on data The main sources of data for this publication are the Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR), National Cancer Incidence Reporting System (NCIRS), Canadian Vital Statistics - Death database (CVS: D) and population life tables, censuses and forecasts. Pro vincial and territorial cancer registries collect clinical and demographic data on newly diagnosed cancer cases for people residing in the province or territory. These data are reported annually to Statistics Canada and added to the CCR.9 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014 Pro vincial and territorial registrars of vital statistics collect demographic and cause-of-death information for people who die in their province or territory. These data are reported annually to Statistics Canada and added to the CVS: D. Can cer cases included in the analysis include only invasive primary cancers (with the exception of in situ bladder, which is considered invasive for surveillance reporting) and are defined according to ICD-O-3 (1) and ICD-10(2) classifications, unless otherwise noted. Non-m epithelial neoplasms, NOS; and basal and squamous) are not included (except in Chapter 7) because most provincial and territorial cancer registries do not collect incidence data on this type of cancer. Canada-wide non-melanoma skin cancer estimates are based on data from four provinces only and are shown in select tables. This publication examines approximately 20 cancer types, which represent the vast majority of cancers that occur in Canada. For practical considerations of space and data quality, the less common cancers are excluded from this publication. Information on cancer types not covered here may be found through reports and databases from Statistics Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada.Actual and estimated data This publication strives to provide the most up-to-date data. However, because time is required for reporting, collating, verifying, analyzing and publishing surveillance data, the most recent information available is several years behind the current year. Actual cancer incidence data reported in this publication are for the period 1985 to 2010. Data for 1992 to 2010 were obtained from the CCR, except for Quebec data from 2008 to 2010, which were received in a summary format from the Quebec Cancer Registry. Actual mortality data are for the period 1985 to 2009 for all provinces and territories. Short-term statistical projections provide an estimate of cancer incidence and mortality for recent years (see Appendix II: Data sources and methods ). Incidence is projected for 2011 to 2014 for all provinces and territories. Mortality is projected for 2010 to 2014. Because the CCR is a dynamic database, estimates may be updated as new data become available. Projected data are derived using statistical models; therefore, they should be considered as estimates only and approached with caution. Moreover, models can produce estimates that vary considerably from year to year. For this reason, using the estimates to track year-to-year changes (such as comparing estimates to those from prior editions of this publication) can be misleading and is discouraged.Tables A1 and A2 list a larger number of cancer types than other tables in the publication. In addition, Tables A3 to A6 provide actual incidence and mortality counts and age-standardized rates for selected cancers by province and territory. Because of the small populations of the territories, only five-year averages (2006 to 2010 for incidence and 2005 to 2009 for mortality) are provided. For information on how to access the most recent available data, refer to the additional sources of information listed at the end of each chapter or contact the respective cancer registries (see a list of Canadian Cancer Registries).

Cancer is the leading cause of death in Canada (Figure A), responsible for nearly 30% of all deaths, followed by cardiovascular diseases (heart disease and cerebrovascular diseases) and chronic lower respiratory diseases. (1) Cancer is also the leading cause of premature death, as measured by potential years of life lost (PYLL). PYLL provides an alternative measure to death rates by taking into account average life expectancy and giving more weight to deaths that occur among younger people. In 2009, cancer represented 33% of the PYLL due to disease compared to 11 other causes of premature death (Figure B). Generally, PYLL is higher for cancers that are more common, have an earlier age of onset and more quickly lead to death. In both sexes, lung cancer was responsible for 27% of the premature deaths caused by cancer (see online Table W1). With regard to the most common cancers in women and men, the PYLL from female breast cancer (94,700) far exceeded that from prostate cancer (35,600), reflecting the relatively younger age at which women die from breast cancer. Note: The total of all deaths in 2011 in Canada was 242,074. Adapted from: Statistics Canada.

In 2000, cancer was the fourth most costly disease in Canada, accounting for $17.4 billion. These costs include $2.6 billion in direct healthcare costs, which included physician and hospital expenses, and $14.8 billion in indirect costs from lost productivity and premature death. (2) Due to our aging population, these costs are likely to increase. Although many individuals who survive a cancer diagnosis continue to live productive and rewarding lives, the cancer experience presents many physical, emotional and spiritual challenges that can persist long after the disease is treated.FIGuRE B Selected causes of death and their associated potential years of life lost (PYLL), Canada, 2009 Males Females 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600HIVCongenital are displayed in decreasing order of total PYLL for both males and females combined and are calculated based on life expectancy based on 2007-2009 all-cause mortality rates.

For breast cancer deaths, the orange line represents the number of deaths that would have occurred if the death rate had remained the same as in 1986. Analysis by: Canadian Cancer Society Data source: Canadian Vital Statistics Death database at Statistics CanadaDespite these ongoing challenges, much progress has been made in the fight against cancer. Today, more is known about what causes cancer, how it develops and how best to treat it. More is also known about how we can improve the quality of life of people living with cancer and cancer survivors, as well as the lives of their families and caregivers. One example of progress is seen in the drop in the cancer mortality rate. It is estimated that since 1988 when the cancer mortality rate peaked in Canada, over 126,000 deaths have been avoided (Figure C) as a result of cancer prevention and control efforts. Many of the avoided deaths were related to lung and breast cancers. Over 19,000 deaths were avoided (mainly in men) since the lung cancer death rate peaked in 1988, largely reflecting the control of tobacco use among Canadians. Close to 24,000 deaths were avoided since the female breast cancer death rate peaked in 1986, reflecting, in part, the role of breast cancer screening in women and advances in breast cancer treatment (see Chapter 3 for further details). Cancer surveillance can help inform cancer prevention and control. Canada is one of the few nations in the world with a national population-based cancer registry that covers the entire population. The information gained from the national and provincial cancer registries is valuable for monitoring cancer patterns and serves as a source of data for cancer control planning, healthcare resource allocation and research. Surveillance data are also essential to help focus both primary prevention efforts (through reducing risk factors and promoting protective factors) and secondary prevention efforts (which have the goal of improving survival through the earlier detection of cancers and treatment of cancer precursors). To this end, the annual Canadian Cancer Statistics publication aims to provide the most current summary of key cancer surveillance indicators.Deaths (in thousands)All cancers, 1988-2009 Year of death126,043 cancer deaths avoided 0102030405060708090100 2009 2004 1999 1994 1989 1984 1980 Deaths (in thousands)Lung cancer, 1988-2009 Year of death19,363 lung cancer deaths avoided 0510152025 2009 2004 1999 1994 1989 1984 1980 Deaths (in thousands)Female breast cancer, 1986-2009 Year of death23,721 breast cancer deaths avoided 012345678 Expected deathsObserved deaths Expected deathsObserved deaths Expected deathsObserved deaths2009 2004 1999 1994 1989 1984 198013 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Data from the Canadian Cancer Statistics show that Canada compares favourably to other countries on several measures, such as relative survival and mortality rates. Comparable cancer indicators for different countries can be found through various international resources, including the GLOBOCAN database, (3) the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents publication,(4) the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership(5) and the CONCORD studies on cancer survival.(6) The World Health Organization suggests that prevention offers the most cost-effective, long-term strategy for controlling cancer and other non-communicable diseases. (7) Reducing the risk of cancer can be achieved through many of the following approaches: Avo iding smoking - Tobacco is responsible for nearly one-quarter of cancer deaths worldwide, making it the single greatest avoidable risk factor for cancer. (7) Fol lowing a healthy lifestyle - Eating a diet high in vegetables and fruits, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active can prevent about one-third of the 12 major cancers worldwide, according to the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund. (8) Red ucing alcohol consumption - Alcohol is a risk factor for many different types of cancer and the risk of cancer increases with the amount of alcohol consumed. (7) Avo iding overexposure to sunlight and not using tanning beds or sun lamps - Limiting time in midday sun, wearing protective clothing, seeking shade and using sunscreen can help reduce the risk of skin cancer, while still allowing people to receive the health benefits of sun exposure. Indoor tanning does not provide a safe alternative to the sun and should be avoided. Avo id infections, environmental and occupational carcinogens - Vaccines, testing and awareness can help reduce, respectively, the risk of some infections associated with cancer (e.g., human papillomavirus and hepatitis B and C), environmental causes of cancer (e.g., radon) and occupational carcinogens (e.g., industrial chemicals). (7)According to Statistics Canada, the Canadian population is projected to increase from 33.7 million in 2009 to as much as 43.8 million people by 2036 (in a medium-growth scenario). The number of seniors is expected to more than double (to as high as 10.9 million) during this time period. (9) Increases in the number of new cancer cases in Canada over the past 30 years can largely be attributed to the aging and growing population. In Figure D, the lowest solid line represents the total number of new cancer cases or cancer deaths that would have occurred each year if the population size and age structure remained the same as they were in 1985. Thus, this line measures the effect of changes in cancer risk and cancer control practices. There is very little increase in cancer incidence as a result of changes in cancer risk or changes in cancer control practices. The uppermost line represents the number of new cases or deaths that actually occurred once the impact of population growth and aging are taken into account. With such population factors expected to continue into the foreseeable future, the Canadian healthcare system is expected to face greater demand for cancer screening as well as diagnostic and treatment services.Introduction14 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Introduction FIGuRE D Trends in new cases and deaths for all cancers and ages, attributed to changes in cancer risk and cancer control practices, population growth and aging population, both sexes, Canada, 1985-2014 Note: New cases exclude non-melanoma skin neoplasms, NOS; and basal and squamous).

Highlights It is exp ected that 2 in 5 Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetimes. Males have a 45% lifetime probability (or a 1 in 2.2 chance) of developing cancer. Females have a 41% lifetime probability (or a 1 in 2.4 chance) of developing cancer. An est imated 191,300 new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed in Canada in 2014. More than half of these cases (52%) will be lung, breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. Fro m 2001 to 2010, the overall age-standardized incidence rate rose by 0.5% per year for females. Since 2006, incidence decreased by 1.3% per year for males. Som e of the overall increase in the incidence rate is related to increased detection, while decreases correspond in part to previous declines in major risk factors, such as tobacco use or alcohol consumption. Since 2006, l ung cancer incidence in females is no longer increasing. Incr eases in the number of new cases over the past 30 years can largely be attributed to a growing and aging population, rather than to an increase in cancer risk. Given current population trends, increases in cancer incidence are expected to continue. Increases in incidence have implications for screening, diagnostic and treatment services. Incr eased prevention efforts could reduce incidence rates or result in earlier diagnosis and treatment, thereby helping to improve survival rates and decrease mortality.Introduction Each hour, an estimated 22 people will be diagnosed with cancer in Canada in 2014. The number of new cases of cancer each year (the incidence) is an important measure of cancer burden on the Canadian population and healthcare system. Trends in incidence rates can be used to predict the future burden of cancer. This information is essential in ensuring adequate screening, diagnostic and treatment services, as well as directing future cancer prevention, control and research programs. Probability of developing cancer For both sexes combined, the lifetime probability of developing cancer is 1 in 2.3 (data not shown). The probability of developing a specific type of cancer depends on many factors, including the population characteristics (e.g., demographics), prevalence of risk factors (e.g., smoking, obesity), life expectancy and others. This probability reflects the average experience of people in Canada and does not take into account individual behaviours and risk factors. The Canadian population is aging. (1) Like many other developed countries, Canada now has a greater proportion of people who are seniors. Seniors represent the fastest-growing age group in Canada. As a result, it is expected that a growing number of people will be diagnosed with diseases related to aging, such as cancer. In Canada, 1 in 2.2 males and 1 in 2.4 females (approximately 2 in 5 Canadians) are expected to develop cancer in their lifetime (Figure 1.1).CHAPTER 1 45% (1 in 2.2) 41% (1 in 2.4)FemalesMalesFIGuRE 1.1 Lifetime probability of developing cancer, Canada, 2009 Analysis by: Chronic Disease Surveillance and Monitoring Division, CCDP , Public Health Agency of Canada Data sources: Canadian Cancer Registry, Vital Statistics Death databases at Statistics Canada and Quebec Cancer Registry (2008-2010)17 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014The probability of developing cancer varies by cancer type for males and females. As sh own in Table 1.1, Canadian males are most likely to develop prostate cancer, with 1 in 8 males expected to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. After prostate cancer, males have the highest probability of developing lung cancer, with 1 in 12 males expected to be diagnosed in their lifetime, followed by colorectal cancer, with 1 in 13 males expected to develop colorectal cancer in their lifetime. Can adian females are most likely to develop breast cancer, with 1 in 9 females expected to develop breast cancer in their lifetime. One in 14 females is likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer, and 1 in 16 females is likely to be diagnosed with colorectal cancer during their lifetime.New cases of cancer in 2014 An estimated 191,300 new cases of cancer, as well as an estimated 76,100 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancers (neoplasms, NOS; epithelial neoplasms, NOS; and basal and squamous), are expected to be diagnosed in 2014 (Table 1.2). Four c ancers - prostate, breast, lung and colorectal - together are expected to account for more than half (52%) of all cancers diagnosed in Canada in 2014. As sh own in Figure 1.2, the leading cancers are prostate cancer for males (23,600 expected new cases, or 24% of all new male cases) and breast cancer for females (24,400 expected new cases, or 26% of all new female cases). In ma les, colorectal cancer is now the second most common cancer followed by lung cancer, each accounting for approximately 14% of all new male cases. In females, lung cancer is the second most common cancer, representing 13% of all new female cases followed by colorectal cancer representing approximately 12% of all new female cases.CHAPTER 1 n Incidence: How many people in Canada get cancer?

The data here are presented over a lifetime, but probability can also be calculated as the chance of developing cancer at a specific point in time, such as by age 30 or over the next 10 years. The probability of developing cancer is expressed as a percentage or as a chance (e.g., a 1 in 5 chance)18 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014trends over time Between 1985 and 2014, the number of new cancer cases rose steadily (Figure 1.3). However, age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) have decreased for males and increased slightly for females. In ma les, brief peaks in the number of new cancer cases in the early 1990s and early 2000s reflect the underlying trend in the prostate cancer incidence rate, the leading type of cancer in Canadian men. Amo ng females, the recent slight increase in the overall cancer incidence rate primarily reflects the steady rise in melanoma, thyroid and uterine cancer incidence rates.

Annual percent change (APC) The estimated change in the rate of new cases (incidence) from one year to the next over a defined period of time, reported as a percentage. Along with the changepoint (the year in which the APC changed), the APC is useful for examining trends. Incidence The number of new cases of cancer in a given year. Statistical significance Refers to a number or a relationship that is unlikely to occur simply by chance; in other words, a statistic that is reliable.CHAPTER 1 n Incidence: How many people in Canada get cancer? 19 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014trends for selected cancers Tables 1.3 and 1.4 show the ASIR for selected cancers in males and females over 30 years. Table 1.5 shows the annual percent change (APC). Figures 1.4 and 1.5 show, among males and females, the five most common cancers and those with the largest statistically significant increases or decreases in APC (of at least 2% per year). These cancers are discussed below. Bladder cancer Bladder cancer predominantly affects Canadians over the age of 70 years and occurs more commonly in the Atlantic provinces. Between 2001 and 2010, the incidence rate in males has fallen slightly (by 0.5% per year). Little or no change has been seen for the incidence rate in females. According to one US study, (2) tobacco smoking, particularly cigarette smoking, accounts for approximately 50% of all bladder cancers in both males and females. Occupational exposure to certain chemicals is the second most important risk factor for bladder cancer. Exposure to aromatic amines (especially beta-naphthylamine, benzidine, 4-aminobiphenyl and 4-o-toluidine), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and diesel engine exhaust is also found to increase the risk for bladder cancer.

Analysis by: Chronic Disease Surveillance and Monitoring Division, CCDP , Public Health Agency of Canada Data sources: Canadian Cancer Registry, National Cancer Incidence Reporting System databases at Statistics Canada and Quebec Cancer Registry (2008-2010)CHAPTER 1 n Incidence: How many people in Canada get cancer? 20 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Breast cancer The breast cancer incidence rate rose through the early 1990s. This increase in the incidence rate is due in part to increased opportunistic mammography screening that was done before organized provincial screening programs were implemented from 1988 onward. Since 1988, the rates have fluctuated. The reasons for these fluctuations are unclear, but they likely have to do with continued participation in mammography screening and long-term changes in hormonal factors, such as early age at menarche, breastfeeding, late age at menopause, oral contraceptive use and late age at full-term pregnancy. (4) The decrease in incidence that occurred around 2002 may reflect the reduced use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) among post-menopausal women. (5) Since 2004, breast cancer incidence rates have stabilized. This is consistent with recent reports from the US. (6) Body of uterus (uterine cancer) The majority of cancers of the uterus occur in the endometrium or lining of the uterus. Incidence rates of uterine cancer have increased by 2.6% per year among women since 2004. This is consistent with recent reports from the US. (6) Exposure to estrogen appears to increase risk for uterine cancer. Risk factors include exposure to unopposed estrogen therapies, never giving birth, starting menstruation at an earlier age or going through menopause at a later age. Other risk factors include being overweight or obese, a genetic predisposition, diabetes, endometrial hyperplasia chronic anovulation, previous pelvic radiation, tumours 20100 806040120140160 (per ColorectalLung Females of UterusMelanomaBladderThyroidLarynxLiver 0 051015202530 51015202530ASIR (per 100,000) Estimated Estimated2014 2009 2004 1999 1994 1989 1985 2014 2009 2004 1999 1994 1989 1985FIGuRE 1.5 Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) for selected* cancers, females, Canada, 1985-2014 * Five most frequent cancers (both sexes combined) and cancers with a statistically significant change in incidence rate of at least 2% per year (see T able 1.5). Note: Rates are age-standardized to the 1991 Canadian population. See Table 1.4 for data points. Actual data for incidence were available to 2010. The range of scales differs widely between the figures. Analysis by: Chronic Disease Surveillance and Monitoring Division, CCDPC, Public Health Agency of Canada Data sources: Canadian Cancer Registry, National Cancer Incidence Reporting System databases at Statistics Canada and Quebec Cancer Registry (2008-2010)CHAPTER 1 n Incidence: How many people in Canada get cancer? 21 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Colorectal cancer Starting from the mid-1980s, incidence rates declined for both sexes until the mid-1990s (although this decline was more prominent for females). Incidence rates then rose through 2000, only to decline slightly thereafter. Screening for colorectal cancer can identify and remove precancerous polyps, which can in turn reduce incidence. As of 2010, all provinces had announced or started implementing organized screening programs, although screening rates remain low. (7) Colorectal cancer is linked to several modifiable risk factors including obesity, physical inactivity, consumption of red and processed meat and smoking. (8,9) Larynx cancer Incidence rates of larynx cancer decreased significantly from 2001 to 2010 for both males (2.9% per year) and females (3.5% per year). As cancer of the larynx is most strongly associated with smoking (10) and alcohol,(11) declines in incidence rates reflect decreasing trends in these risk factors.(12,13) Liver cancer The incidence rate of liver cancer increased significantly for males (2.3% per year) and females (2.4% per year). These increases may be at least partially explained by rising immigration from regions of the world where risk factors for liver cancer, such as hepatitis B and C infection and exposure to aflatoxin, are more common. (14) Lung cancer In males, the incidence rate of lung cancer began to level off in the mid-1980s and has since been declining (2.0% per year in recent years). Among females, the incidence rate for lung cancer is no longer increasing since 2006. The incidence rate of lung cancer remains higher among males (59 per 100,000) than females (48 per 100,000), although rates among younger adults appear to be converging. (15) The differences in lung cancer incidence rates among males and females reflect past differences in tobacco use. According to the 2012 Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey, the smoking prevalence for Canadians age 15 and over is 16.1% in both sexes combined. (12) In males, a drop in smoking began in the mid-1960s, preceding the drop in lung cancer incidence by about 20 years. In females, tobacco consumption began to drop in the mid-1980s, suggesting that lung cancer incidence rates in women should also begin to decrease in the next two decades. Melanoma Incidence rates of melanoma have increased in both men and women over the past several decades, with recent increases of 2.2% per year in men between 2001 and 2010, and 2.6% per year among women between 2003 and 2010. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation through exposure to sunlight, tanning beds and sun lamps appears to be a major risk factor for melanoma. Other risk factors include number and type of moles, having a fair complexion, personal and family history of skin cancer, a weakened immune system and a history of severe blistering sunburn (see Chapter 7: Skin cancers ). Prostate cancer The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is not currently recommended in Canada as a population-based screening test. Despite uncertainty about the benefits and risks of prostate cancer testing, use of the PSA test is widespread. (16) In Canada, the incidence rate of prostate cancer peaked in 1993 and 2001. Each of these peaks was followed by a decline. These peaks are compatible with two waves of intensified screening activity using the PSA test. Since 2006, the age-standardized incidence rate has been declining (3.2% per year). Stomach cancer Incidence rates of stomach cancer continue to decline in both males (2.3% per year) and females (1.3% per year). Current rates are about half of what they were in 1985. This decline may be due to long-term improvements in diets (17) and decreases in smoking and heavy alcohol use.(18) The declining incidence rates of stomach cancer may also be related to the more recent recognition and treatment of infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori , an important risk factor for stomach cancer. (19) thyroid cancer The incidence rate of thyroid cancer is the most rapidly increasing incidence rate among all major cancers. There was a 6.2% per year increase in males since 2001 and a 4.3% per year increase in females between 2005 and 2010. The rise may be due to several reasons. More frequent use of diagnostic testing, including ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may mean that more earlier stage, asymptomatic thyroid cancers are being diagnosed. (20) Exposure to diagnostic ionizing radiation has likely increased over time and this could promote the initiation of new tumours. (21) Finally, the increase could be spurred by exposure to a yet unidentified risk factor.CHAPTER 1 n Incidence: How many people in Canada get cancer? 22 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014What do these statistics mean? Generally, the incidence rate for all cancers combined in males has been stable over the past two decades. In contrast, the incidence rate for all cancers combined in females has continued to increase. This increase is in part driven by the rise in melanoma, thyroid and uterine cancer incidence. While the incidence rates for individual cancer types can be better explained by changes in risk factors and prevention efforts, the overall trend reflects the cumulative impact of the changes seen for each type of cancer. Given that so much of the increase in cancer incidence over the past 30 years is due to an aging population, this increase can be expected to continue as the population continues to age. With the rising incidence of cancer, there will be a commensurate increase in the need for diagnostic, treatment and support services in the healthcare system. It will also be important to develop early strategies to address the cancers that are now showing significant increase in incidence, such as liver and thyroid cancers. Primary prevention efforts should be improved to reduce the impact of risk factors, such as tobacco use or obesity. A sustained focus on screening for breast, colorectal and cervical cancers will help catch and more effectively treat these cancers earlier in their course.For more information Publications Kachuri L, De P , Ellison LF , Semenciw R.

Highlights Mor e cases of cancer are diagnosed in males under the age of 19 and over the age of 59 than in females in the same age groups. Can adians over the age of 50 represent 89% of all new cancer cases. Nearly half of all new cases (43%) will occur in individuals aged 70 years or older. A variet y of factors, including cancer type and age, influence treatment needs for people with cancer. For example, treatment decisions may be different for people nearing the end of their lives. Canadians in the prime of their lives may have specific needs for supportive services to help them balance their work and family responsibilities. Can cer incidence decreases from east to west across the country. The highest incidence rates are generally found in the Atlantic provinces and Quebec, while the lowest incidence rates are in British Columbia. Correlating incidence data with regional risk factor information, such as tobacco use or obesity rates, could help better target regional and local prevention efforts. Introduction Cancer strikes males and females, young and old, and those in different regions across Canada on a decidedly uneven basis. This chapter examines incidence by sex, age and geographic region to see how cancer affects people in Canada. Incidence by sex Prostate and breast cancer are the most frequently diagnosed cancers for males and females respectively, followed by lung and colorectal cancers. Overall, more males are diagnosed with cancer than females: 51% of all new cases are diagnosed in males; 49% of all new cases are diagnosed in females (Table 2.1). trends over time Figure 2.1 shows that the incidence rates for both males and females changed between 1985 and 2014. The ov erall cancer incidence rate for males of all ages rose until the early 1990s. Since 1993, there has been a decline in the incidence rate in males. Amo ng females, the overall cancer incidence rate has been increasing slowly since the early 1990s. This increase reflects a rise primarily of lung cancer, but it also represents an increase in thyroid and kidney cancers, as well as leukemia and melanoma. Incidence by age Cancer primarily affects Canadians over the age of 50: 89% of all new cases are diagnosed in people in this age group. For both males and females, the median age of cancer diagnosis is between 65 and 69 years of age. As shown in Table 2.1, it is estimated that in 2014:CHAPTER 2 0 100200300400500600 0 100200300400500600Males Females Incidence MortalityIncidenceMortalityRate (per 100,000) 2014 2010 2005 2000 1995 1990 1985FIGuRE 2.1 Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates for all cancers combined, by sex, Canada, 1985-2014 Analysis by: Chronic Disease Surveillance and Monitoring Division, CCDP , Public Health Agency of Canada Data sources: Canadian Cancer Registry, National Cancer Incidence Reporting system, Canadian Vital Statistics Death databases at Statistics Canada and Quebec Cancer Registry (2008-2010)Note: Rates are age- standardized to the 1991 Canadian population. Actual incidence data were available to 2010. Actual data for mortality were available to 2009. Dashed lines represent estimated rates.29 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014 43% of al l new cases will occur in people aged 70 years or older. 28% of al l new cases will occur in people aged 60-69 years. 18% of al l new cases will occur in people aged 50-59 years. Less t han 1% of all new cases will occur in children and youth aged 0-19 years. Although this represents a small percentage of new cancer cases, a cancer diagnosis has a significant impact on these children and their families. The largest proportion of diagnoses of new cases from the most common cancers occurs in older adults (Table 2.2). App roximately half (53%) of all newly diagnosed cases of lung and colorectal cancer will occur among people aged 70 years or older. It is important to note that the overall cancer incidence rate in males aged 70 and older has been dropping over time, primarily due to a declining rate of lung cancer from decreased tobacco use in past decades. (1) Bre ast cancer occurs primarily in females 50-69 years of age (52%). Approximately 30% of cases will be diagnosed in females over the age of 69, while 18% of cases will occur in females under age 50. Pros tate cancer will be diagnosed most frequently in males aged 60-69 years (40%). Children, adolescents and young adults Cancers in children (0-14 years of age, see Appendix Table A7) differ from those occurring in adults in both their site of origin and their behaviour. Generally, tumours in children often grow rapidly and frequently spread to other parts of the body. Relative to adults, cancers in children include a higher proportion of blood and lymphatic malignancies, most commonly leukemia. To account for these differences, a separate classification scheme of diagnostic groupings has been created. (2)Adolescents and young adults (15-29 years of age, see Appendix Table A8) represent a transitional phase in that some tumours closely resemble those in childhood, while many others have characteristics seen in older populations. Consequently, diagnosis and treatment within this age group can be challenging with limited advancements in overall survival in recent years.Figure 2.2 shows that the distribution of new cancer cases is quite different between older and younger age groups. Betw een 2006 and 2010, the most commonly diagnosed childhood cancer was leukemia, which accounted for 32% of all newly diagnosed cases, followed by cancers of the central nervous system (CNS) and lymphomas (19% and 11% respectively).CHAPTER 2 n Incidence by sex, age and geography: Who gets cancer in Canada? % of cases (5%)Breast (4%)Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (4%)FIGuRE 2.2 Distribution of new cancer cases for selected cancers by age group, Canada, 2006-2010 N is the total number of cases over 5 years (2006-2010) for each age group; CNS=centr al nervous system; PNC=peripheral nervous cell tumours. Note: Cancers in children (ages 0-14 years) are classified according to ICCC-3. (2) Analysis by: Chronic Disease Surveillance and Monitoring Division, CCDP , Public Health Agency of Canada Data sources: Canadian Cancer Registry database at Statistics Canada and Quebec Cancer Registry (2008-2010)30 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014 New c ancer cases among older adolescents and young adults aged 15-29 years accounted for 1.5% of all new cancer cases. The most commonly diagnosed cancers in this age group were testicular and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in males and thyroid and melanoma in females, as well as Hodgkin lymphoma in both sexes. Amo ng older ages, the distribution of cancers is observed to resemble noted patterns in previously published reports. For both sexes combined, the most common cancers for 30-49, 50-69 and 70+ age groups were breast (25%), prostate (17%) and lung (17%), respectively. After age 50, breast, colorectal, lung and prostate account for over 50% of all new cancer cases.trends over time Incidence rates differ between sexes according to age. Specifically, females in the four age groups between 20 and 59 years have consistently higher incidence rates than males over time (Figure 2.3). Incidence by geographic region The estimated numbers of new cases for all cancers combined by province and territory for 2014 are shown in Figure 2.4, with data in Table 2.3. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) shows a declining trend moving from east to west in Canada, with the highest incidence rates in the Atlantic provinces and Quebec and the lowest rates in British Columbia.Age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) The number of new cases of cancer per 100,000 people, standardized to the age structure of the 1991 Canadian population to account for changes in age distribution over time. In this section, age standardization is used to adjust for differences in age distributions among the provinces and territories, which allows for more accurate comparisons. Province or territory Refers to the province or territory of a person's permanent residence at the time of cancer diagnosis. The most recent actual data for provinces and territories are available to 2010 (see Tables A3 and A4 in Appendix I: Actual data for new cases and deaths ).

Analysis by: Chronic Disease Surveillance and Monitoring Division, CCDP , Public Health Agency of Canada Data sources: Canadian Cancer Registry, National Cancer Incidence Reporting System databases at Statistics Canada and Quebec Cancer Registry (2008-2010)CHAPTER 2 n Incidence by sex, age and geography: Who gets cancer in Canada?31 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Estimated new cases (Table 2.4) and ASIR (Table 2.5) for specific cancer types show that there are geographic differences for males and females. Pros tate cancer incidence rates vary greatly among the provinces, possibly due to variations in PSA testing across the country. Amo ng males, lung cancer incidence rates are estimated to be highest in Quebec and lowest in British Columbia. This difference in incidence rates is linked in large part to the prevalence of smoking in each province. Colo rectal cancer incidence rates for both males and females are highest in Newfoundland and Labrador. For females, high rates are also seen in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Manitoba. The lowest rates for both sexes are in British Columbia. Apa rt from Newfoundland and Labrador, breast cancer incidence rates appear to be fairly consistent across the country, with no discernible geographic pattern. The lower rate in Newfoundland and Labrador may be related to incomplete registration of all breast cancers. Geographic variations in incidence rates may be due to differences in modifiable risk factors, such as unhealthy diet, smoking, obesity and physical inactivity. Differences in incidence rates may also be related to different provincial or territorial programs or procedures for the diagnosis and early detection of cancer, such as approved screening programs and the availability of diagnostic services. Other factors may impact the interpretation of variations in projected rates among the provinces, including the following: FIGuRE 2.4 Geographic distribution of estimated new cancer cases and age-standardized incidence rates (ASIR) by province and territory, both sexes, Canada, 2014 420.2 per 100,000 (6,100 new cases)424.4 per 100,000 (5,000 new cases)405.9 per 100,000 (900 new cases) 364.8 per 100,000 (150 new cases) 433.7 per 100,000 (3,400 new cases) 414.2 per 100,000 (49,100 new cases)343.6 per 100,000 (130 new cases) 360.9 per 100,000 (24,300 new cases) 367.3 per 100,000 (16,500 new cases) 376.8 per 100,000 (5,400 new cases)389.9 per 100,000 (6,500 new cases) 402.2 per 100,000 (73,800 new cases)386.9 per 100,000 (70 new cases) Analysis by: Chronic Disease Surveillance and Monitoring Division, CCDP , Public Health Agency of Canada Data sources: Canadian Cancer Registry database at Statistics Canada and Quebec Cancer Registry (2008-2010) CHAPTER 2 n Incidence by sex, age and geography: Who gets cancer in Canada?32 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014 Can cer frequency - When a cancer is rare or the population is small, the estimated number of new cases of a cancer type may be subject to greater statistical variation. Can cer registration method - While the registration of new cancer cases is generally very good across the country, there are exceptions. Incomplete registration is mainly linked to the unavailability and inaccuracy of death certificate data and specific diagnostic information in some provinces. Meth od of projection - The selected method of projection (Nordpred Power5 regression model or five-year average) for provincial data can vary across provinces and across cancer types (see Tables A12 and A13 in Appendix II: Data sources and methods). Avai lability of in situ cases - The large variation seen in bladder cancer incidence rates among the provinces is likely due to differences in reporting of in situ cases, especially in Ontario, where such cases were not collected until recently and were not available for this publication. What do these statistics mean? This chapter shows a distinct picture of cancer distribution in Canada by presenting incidence estimates by sex, age and geographic region. These data can support informed decision-making to ensure that healthcare services meet the needs of a specific population and identify opportunities to target prevention and cancer control initiatives. For example, nearly half of all people diagnosed with cancer will be over the age of 70, and it must be recognized that evidence-based treatment guidelines may vary by age.The data indicate that females are more likely than males to be diagnosed with cancer in the prime of their lives (between the ages of 20 and 59 years), which reflects patterns for specific cancers, such as breast and thyroid. The priorities of people with cancer and their needs for services can be expected to vary at different points in the age continuum. Finally, cancer incidence rates across the country vary, with higher rates in the east and lower rates in the west. To better target prevention efforts, these data can be correlated with data on risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol consumption, physical inactivity or obesity rates.

Highlights An est imated 76,600 Canadians are expected to die of cancer in 2014. It is exp ected that 1 in 4 Canadians will die of cancer. Males have a 29% lifetime probability (approximately a 1 in 3.5 chance) of dying from cancer. Females have a 24% lifetime probability (approximately a 1 in 4.2 chance) of dying from cancer. Betw een 2001 and 2009, overall age-standardized mortality rates declined by 1.9% per year for males. A similar decline of 1.2% per year for females was seen between 2002 and 2009. On average, mortality rates declined by at least 2% per year for the following cancers: colorectal, lung and prostate cancers in males; breast, ovary and cervical cancers in females; and larynx, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and stomach cancers in both sexes. Betw een 2000 and 2009, liver cancer mortality rates increased in both males and females. The mo rtality rate has been increasing for lung cancer in females, although the rate of increase is slowing and may be stabilizing. Introduction Each hour, an estimated nine people will die of cancer in Canada, in 2014. Monitoring cancer deaths over time allows us to measure progress in reducing cancer deaths and contemplate the implications of changing patterns on the Canadian healthcare system.Probability of dying from cancer The probability of dying from cancer is 1 in 3.8 (data not shown). The chance of dying from cancer differs slightly by sex (see Figure 3.1). As shown in Table 3.1, males have a 29% chance (or 1 in 3.5 chance) of dying from cancer. Lung cancer is the most likely cause of cancer death, with a 1 in 13 chance. Prostate cancer is the next most likely cause of cancer death, with a 1 in 28 chance. Colorectal cancer is the third most likely cause of cancer death, with a 1 in 28 chance.Table 3.1 also shows that females in Canada have a 24% chance (or a 1 in 4.2 chance) of dying from cancer. Lung cancer is the most likely cause of cancer death in females, with a 1 in 17 chance. Females have a 1 in 30 chance of dying from breast cancer, followed by a 1 in 32 chance of dying from colorectal cancer. CHAPTER 3 29% (1 in 3.5) 24% (1 in 4.2)FemalesMalesFIGuRE 3.1 Lifetime probability of dying from cancer, Canada, 2009 Analysis by: Chronic Disease Surveillance and Monitoring Division, CCDP , Public Health Agency of Canada Data source: Canadian Vital Statistics Death database at Statistics Canada38 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Deaths from cancer in 2014 An estimated 76,600 Canadians are expected to die from cancer in 2014 (Table 3.2). Lung , colorectal, breast and prostate cancers account for approximately 50% of all cancer deaths combined in each sex (Figure 3.2). Although it is much less commonly diagnosed than many other cancers, pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in both sexes because of its low survival rate. Lung c ancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both sexes. It is responsible for approximately equal proportions of all cancer deaths in both males and females. Colo rectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death for males and the third most common cause of cancer death for females. Bre ast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in females. Pros tate cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in males.Age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) The number of cancer deaths per 100,000 people, standardized to the age structure of the 1991 Canadian population to account for changes in age distribution over time. Annual percent change (APC) The estimated change in the rate of cancer deaths (mortality) from one year to the next over a defined period of time, reported as a percentage. Along with the changepoint (the year in which the APC changed), the APC is useful for examining trends. Mortality The number of deaths due to cancer in a given year. Probability The chance a person has of dying from cancer measured over a period of time. The probability of dying from cancer is expressed as a percentage or as a chance (e.g., a 1 in 5 chance). Statistical significance Refers to a number or a relationship that is unlikely to occur simply by chance; in other words, a statistic that is reliable.CHAPTER 3 n Mortality: How many people in Canada die of cancer?

During this period, age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) for some cancers have varied between the sexes (Figures 3.3-3.5). For males, the mortality rate for all cancers has been decreasing after it reached a peak in 1988. This is largely due to decreases in mortality rates for lung cancer and, to a lesser extent, decreases in deaths from colorectal and prostate cancers. For females, the cancer mortality rate for all cancers has also declined, but to a lesser degree than for males. The ASMR for females has dropped since the mid-1990s as a result of declines in the mortality rates for breast and colorectal cancers. Since the early 2000s, the mortality rate for non- Hodgkin lymphoma has declined for both sexes. Cancer mortality rates continue to increase for liver cancer in both sexes. Lung cancer mortality in females continues to increase (although the rate of increase is slowing).

These cancers are discussed below. Breast cancer The female breast cancer death rate has been declining since the mid-1980s. After its peak in 1986, the age-standardized mortality rate has fallen 43%, from 32.0 deaths per 100,000 in 1986 to a projected rate of 18.4 deaths per 100,000 in 2014. The downward trend has accelerated to 2.4% per year since 2000, which is likely due to a combination of increased mammography screening (1) and the use of more effective therapies following breast cancer surgery.(2,3) The breast cancer mortality rate in Canada is the lowest it has been since 1950, with similar declines observed in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia.

The decrease in mortality rate has followed the reduction in the cervical cancer incidence rate over the same period of time. The latter is largely the result of Pap test screening, (5) which has helped detect precancerous and malignant lesions at an earlier stage when treatment is more effective. Colorectal cancer The death rate from colorectal cancer continues to decline for both males (2.7% per year since 2004) and females (1.8% per year since 2000). This is likely due to improvements in treatments (particularly chemotherapy). Larynx cancer Deaths due to larynx cancer have been declining in both males (4.7% per year) and females (4.0% per year) since 2000. The trend in mortality rates has followed the reduction in the larynx cancer incidence rate during the same time period. Liver cancer Between 2000 and 2009, the mortality rate of liver cancer has increased significantly for both males (3.2% per year) and females (2.0% per year). The upward trend in mortality rates has followed the increase in liver cancer incidence rates. 01040 30 2050 01040 302050 ASMR (per 100,000) Females Estimated2014 2009 2004 1999 1994 1989 1985 2014 2009 2004 1999 1994 1989 1985 FIGuRE 3.5 Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) for selected* cancers, females, Canada, 1985-2014 * Five most frequent causes of cancer death (both sexes combined) and cancers with a statistically significant change in mortality rate of at least 2% per year (see T able 3.5).

The mortality rate for females shows a slight but statistically significant increase (0.6% per year between 2000 and 2009). The rate of increase is slowing. The death rate in females is expected to begin to decline in the future, similar to the trend in the female lung cancer death rate seen in the US. (6) Despite the diverging trends, males are projected to continue to have a higher mortality rate of lung cancer (47.2 per 100,000) than females (35.6 per 100,000) in 2014. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) Mortality rates for NHL have declined for both males (2.5% per year) and females (2.7% per year) since 2000. Declines in mortality may reflect recent improvements in treatment, such as immunotherapy (e.g., rituximab). In addition, the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the late 1990s (7) for HIV infection has resulted in a decline of aggressive forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma attributable to HIV infection.Pancreatic cancer Mortality rates for pancreatic cancer have been stable in males and females. The mortality rates for pancreatic cancer closely reflect the incidence rates for this cancer due to the low survival. In other countries, trends in pancreatic cancer mortality rates have shown wide variation in the past decade. For example, the UK experienced decreases, (8) while the US showed increases of pancreatic cancer mortality rates.(9) Prostate cancer The mortality rate for prostate cancer rose slowly from 1985 to the mid-1990s, when it began to decline. Between 2001 and 2009, the mortality rate declined significantly (by 3.9% per year). This decline likely reflects improved treatment following the introduction of hormonal therapy for early and advanced-stage disease (10,11) and advances in radiation therapy.(12) The role that screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test played in the reduced mortality rate remains unclear. In 2009, two large randomized trials in the US and Europe that studied the use of PSA testing in males over the age of 55 reported conflicting results. (13,14) The ongoing follow-up of the men in these studies may help clarify the role of PSA testing in reducing deaths from prostate cancer.Stomach cancer Between 2000 and 2009, mortality rates for stomach cancer declined for both males (3.0% per year) and females (2.7% per year). Mortality rates for both males and females are now one-half or less than what they were in 1985. The trend in mortality rates has followed the reduction in the stomach cancer incidence rate during the same time period. What do these statistics mean? While the overall incidence rate of cancer has been slightly increasing in Canada, the overall cancer mortality rate has been decreasing. A decrease in the mortality rate for a specific cancer can result from a decrease in the incidence rate or an increase or improvement in the survival rate. For example, the relatively large reduction in mortality rates from lung, oral and larynx cancers reflect the reduction in smoking rates that led to a large reduction in cancer incidence rates, particularly among males. The decrease in the mortality rate for a specific cancer can also reflect the availability of better treatment options leading to improved or longer survival, particularly for cancers that are detected at an early stage of disease when they are most amenable to treatments. Although the ASMR for cancer mortality continues to decline, the actual number of cancer deaths continues to increase due to the growth and aging of the population. This has implications for health policy and resource planning.CHAPTER 3 n Mortality: How many people in Canada die of cancer? 43 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014 For further information Publications Kachuri L, De P , Ellison LF , Semenciw R.

CHAPTER 3 n Mortality: How many people in Canada die of cancer? 49 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Mortality by sex, age and geography: Who dies of cancer in Canada? Highlights Amo ng people under the age of 55 years, females account for a greater proportion of cancer deaths. Around age 55, the mortality rate for males surpasses that for females. In 2014, alm ost all cancer deaths in Canada (96%) will occur in people over the age of 50 years. Most of these cancer deaths (61%) will occur in people aged 70 years and over. The mo rtality rate has been decreasing to varying degrees for all age groups in males and for the under 70 age groups in females. Mor tality rates are highest in the Atlantic provinces and Quebec. They decline moving west across Canada. Var iations in mortality rates across different regions may reflect a number of factors, such as differences in access to and outcomes of cancer control activities (e.g., screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up). These differences may apply at regional and demographic (age and sex) levels. Introduction As with new diagnoses of cancer, cancer deaths are not distributed equally across sexes, ages and provinces or territories. Examining deaths of cancer by sex, age or geographic region provides a better sense of who is dying from cancer and can help direct cancer control services to address the needs of specific populations.Mortality by sex In 2014, it is estimated that 52% of all cancer deaths will occur among males and 48% among females. However, the distribution of cancer deaths between the sexes differs according to age. Among people aged 30-49 years and over 80 years, females represent a larger proportion of total cancer deaths than males (Table 4.1). This is mainly due to the varying age distributions of deaths from breast versus lung and colorectal cancer (Table 4.2).trends over time Figure 4.1 shows the long-term trend in mortality rates by sex. The mortality rate for all cancers combined has been decreasing for males and females since 1988. The decrease in mortality rate in males is largely due to reductions in lung cancer deaths (closely linked to decreases in smoking). The decrease in cancer deaths in females is attributed to declines in breast cancer mortality (most likely due to improvements in early detection and screening as well as improvements in treatment outcomes).CHAPTER 4 0 100200300400500600 0 100200300400500600Males Females Mortality IncidenceMortalityIncidenceRate (per 100,000) 2014 2009 2004 1999 1994 1989 1985FIGuRE 4.1 Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates for all cancers combined, by sex, Canada, 1985-2014 Analysis by: Chronic Disease Surveillance and Monitoring Division, CCDP , Public Health Agency of Canada Data sources: Canadian Cancer Registry, National Cancer Incidence Reporting System, Canadian Vital Statistics Death databases at Statistics Canada and Quebec Cancer Registry (2008-2010)Note: Rates are age- standardized to the 1991 Canadian population. Actual incidence data were available to 2010. Actual mortality data were available to 2009. Dashed lines represent estimated rates.50 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Mortality by age In 2014, over 95% of cancer deaths in Canada will occur in people over the age of 50 years, with the median age range for cancer deaths estimated to be 70-74 years for both sexes (see Table 4.1 for more details). In 2014 it is estimated that: Can adians aged 70 years or older will account for 47,000 cancer deaths (61% of all cancer deaths). Can adians aged 60-69 years will account for an additional 17,300 deaths (23% of all cancer deaths). Can adians aged 50-59 years will account for 8,900 deaths (12% of all cancer deaths). Older adults account for the largest proportion of deaths from the most common cancers (see Table 4.2): While t he majority of new breast cancer cases (70% of the total cases) occur in females under the age of 70, breast cancer deaths are proportionately lower (49% of the total breast cancer deaths) in that younger age group than in females aged 70 years and older. Breast cancer, however, represents a higher proportion of total cancer deaths in the younger age groups (22% of cancer deaths in 30-59 year old women versus 12% of cancer deaths for women 60+). Simil arly, prostate cancer will be diagnosed most frequently in males aged 60-69 years, but most prostate cancer deaths will occur in males aged 80 years and older. These mortality patterns likely reflect the often slow progression of the disease. Unli ke many other cancers where the number of deaths increases with age, deaths for lung cancer peak in people aged 70-79 years for both males and females. This peak occurs because the largest proportion of new cases is in the same age group (see Chapter 2) and survival is poor, so that deaths typically occur within a short period after diagnosis (see Chapter 5).Cancer deaths among children, adolescents and young adults Can cer deaths among older adolescents and young adults (aged 15-29 years) accounted for less than 0.5% of all cancer deaths in Canada. An average of 282 people in Canada between the ages of 15 and 29 die from cancer each year (see Appendix Table A9). Adolescent and young adult males are more likely to die of cancer than females of that age group. The male death rates are higher for every major cancer except for skin and genitourinary. Betw een 2005 and 2009, the leading causes of cancer deaths among children, adolescents and young adults were cancers of the central nervous system and brain, and leukemia. These two types of cancer accounted for over 60% of all childhood cancer deaths (ages 0-14) and 32% of all adolescent and young adult cancer deaths (ages 15-29) (see Figure 4.2).CHAPTER 4 n Mortality by sex, age and geography: Who dies of cancer in Canada? % of cancer deaths 0102030405060708090100 Distribution of cancer deaths for selected cancers by age group, Canada, 2005-2009 N is the total number of deaths over 5 years (2005-2009) for each age group; CNS=Central nervous system; PNC=Peripheral nervous cell tumours.

The age-standardized mortality rates for men aged 60-69, for example, has dropped by 38% from 800 per 100,000 in 1985 to 500 per 100,000 in 2014.

Analysis by: Chronic Disease Surveillance and Monitoring Division, CCDP , Public Health Agency of Canada Data source: Canadian Vital Statistics Death database at Statistics CanadaAge-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) The number of cancer deaths per 100,000 people, standardized to the age structure of the 1991 Canadian population to account for changes in age distribution over time. In this section, age standardization is used to adjust for differences in age distributions among the provinces and territories, which allows for more accurate comparisons. Province or territory Refers to the province or territory of a person's usual place of residence at the time of his/her death. The most recent actual data for provinces and territories are available to 2009 (see Tables A5 and A6 in Appendix I: Actual data for new cases and deaths ).CHAPTER 4 n Mortality by sex, age and geography: Who dies of cancer in Canada?52 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Mortality by geographic region The estimated number of cancer deaths for all cancers and both sexes combined by province and territory are shown in Table 4.3, with age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) shown in Figure 4.4. Similar to the pattern for incidence rates, the mortality rate for all cancers combined is highest in the Atlantic provinces and Quebec and lowest in western Canada. Estimated deaths (Table 4.4) and ASMR (Table 4.5) for specific cancer types show that there are several geographic differences: Lung c ancer mortality rates for both males and females are highest in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. The mortality rates for this cancer are lowest in British Columbia for both sexes and in Ontario and Alberta for females. This pattern closely mirrors tobacco smoking rate variations in those provinces. Colo rectal cancer mortality rates are highest in Newfoundland and Labrador for both males and females. The pr ostate cancer mortality rate is highest in Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The mortality rate for prostate cancer is lowest in Quebec (which also has the lowest incidence rate of prostate cancer among the provinces). Interprovincial variations in mortality rates could reflect variation in risk factors (smoking, obesity, etc.) and the availability and use of screening and early detection services.

Differences in cancer mortality rates by age, sex and geography can be driven by a broad range of factors. These factors include those that are inherent to the epidemiology of different cancers, particularly the age at which the cancer tends to occur in populations of males versus females (e.g., prostate cancer deaths typically occur in older males compared to breast cancer deaths that occur in relatively younger females). Modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity and environmental carcinogen exposure have a major impact on mortality rates as they do on incidence rates. Lung cancer mortality in men has dropped substantially over the last 20 years because of the sharp decline in smoking rates. Other factors, however, may be differences in access to cancer control interventions (such as screening and early detection) as well as variations in practice patterns between provinces and within age and sex groupings across provinces. There are likely also age and sex differences in response rate to cancer treatment, (2) which may contribute to variations in the mortality rate.For further information Publications Navaneelan T , Janz T.

CHAPTER 4 n Mortality by sex, age and geography: Who dies of cancer in Canada?58 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Relative survival: What is the likelihood of surviving cancer? Highlights For 2006 t o 2008, the five-year relative survival ratio (RSR) for people diagnosed with cancer was 63%. Five-y ear RSRs are highest for thyroid (98%), testicular (97%) and prostate (96%) cancers. They are lowest pancreatic (8%), esophageal (14%) and lung (17%) cancers. Five-y ear relative survival generally decreases with age. Peo ple diagnosed with cancer today have a better five-year relative survival than they did just over a decade ago. Between 1992 to 1994 and 2006 to 2008, the five-year relative survival for all cancers combined increased by 7.3 percentage points from 55.5% to 62.8%. Five-y ear conditional RSRs demonstrate that survival of people diagnosed with cancer generally improves with time since diagnosis. Between 2006 and 2008, the five-year RSR for all cancers combined increased from 63% when measured from the date of diagnosis to 81% when measured among those who survived the first year after a cancer diagnosis. Differen ces in age-standardized five-year RSRs across geographic regions and types of cancer help point to areas where greater effort is required to detect, diagnose and effectively treat cancer earlier. Introduction Five-year relative survival ratios (RSRs) provide a measure of disease severity and prognosis. Relative survival estimates, when examined across cancer types and geographic regions, can be used to establish priorities for improving prognosis. Examining these estimates over time, and in conjunction with cancer incidence and mortality trends, can also give important information about progress in cancer treatment and control. (1) Several factors can work together to influence the likelihood of surviving cancer. These factors include stage of the cancer at diagnosis and aggressiveness of the tumour, as well as the availability and quality of early detection, diagnostic and treatment services. In addition, factors such as age, sex, existence of other health conditions, socio-economic status and lifestyle can also affect survival. The RSR is a useful \"average\" indicator of survival (2) and does not reflect any individual's prognosis. It is based on the experiences of a group of people rather than a specific person's chance of surviving for a given period of time. Moreover, confidence intervals around survival estimates represent statistical variation rather than the range of possible prognoses for individual people with cancer. It is also important to remember that survival ratios do not distinguish among people who are free from cancer, in a state of relapse or still undergoing treatment. In addition, because survival statistics describe the survival experience of people diagnosed in the past, they do not reflect more recent advances in detection and treatment that could lead to improved cancer survival. Finally, five-year RSRs are different from five-year observed survival proportions (OSPs), which refer to the proportion of people with cancer, who are alive five years after their diagnosis. The current estimate for observed survival for all cancers combined is 56% (Table 5.1).CHAPTER 5 Confidence interval (CI) A range of values that provides an indication of the precision of an estimate. Confidence intervals are usually 95%, which means that one can be 95% confident the range contains the true value for the estimate of interest. Five-year relative survival ratio (RSR) The ratio of the observed survival in a group of people diagnosed with cancer to the expected survival in a comparable group of people - free from the cancer under study - in the general population. (3) In practice, the expected survival is typically estimated from general population life tables, which include those persons previously diagnosed with cancer. Relative survival estimates the excess mortality that may be attributed to the diagnosis. For example, a five-year RSR of 63% for a particular cancer means that people with that cancer have a 63% likelihood of surviving at least five years after diagnosis compared to their counterparts in the general population. Relative survival is the preferred measure for assessing population-based cancer survival. RSRs can be measured over various timeframes, but as is standard in other reports, five years has been chosen as the primary duration of analysis for this publication. Observed survival proportion (OSP) The proportion of people with cancer who are alive after a given period of time (e.g., five years) after diagnosis.59 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Five-year relative survival Table 5.1 shows the estimated five-year RSRs for people diagnosed with selected cancers in Canada between 2006 and 2008. For a ll cancers combined, the five-year RSR is 63%. The for pancreatic (8%), esophageal (14%) and lung (17%) cancers. For m ost of the cancers examined, the five-year RSRs tend to be higher among females. Other time periods commonly used to measure relative survival include 1, 3 and 10 years. For colorectal and lung cancers, RSRs demonstrate a general pattern of substantial decline in the first year after diagnosis (one-year RSR), a more gradual fall over the next two years (three-year RSR) and then smaller declines over the intervals from 3 to 5 years and to 10 years (Figure 5.1). Survival by sex Table 5.1 shows that the five-year RSR differed by more than five percentage points for four of the cancers examined. In all four cancer types, relative survival was better for females than for males: melanoma (92% vs. 85%), breast 14%).Survival by province Five-year RSRs are age-standardized to allow comparisons across provinces. Table 5.2 shows age-standardized five-year RSRs for the four most common cancer types (prostate, breast, colorectal and lung cancers). The following exceptions and caveats should be considered when examining these data: Can cer cases in Newfoundland and Labrador may be under-reported due to incomplete linkage of cancer incidence data with death data. Such under-reporting is likely to result in overestimation of survival because these missed cases tend to have less favourable survival. Consequently, survival ratios for Newfoundland and Labrador are not shown. Terr itorial estimates are not presented because there were too few cancer cases to calculate reliable estimates. Territorial cases are, however, included in the estimates for all of Canada. RSRs fo r Prince Edward Island are less precise than for other provinces because of the relatively small number of cancer cases in this province. Desp ite these constraints, several patterns are worth mentioning: The high est RSRs for prostate cancer are in Ontario (97%), New Brunswick (95%) and Nova Scotia (95%). The lowest RSRs for prostate cancer are in Manitoba (90%), Saskatchewan (91%) and Alberta (92%). There i s little provincial variation in RSRs for breast cancer. The RSRs f or colorectal cancer range from 60% to 62% in all provinces except Ontario (67%).CHAPTER 5 n Relative survival: What is the likelihood of surviving cancer?

The var iation across provinces may be related to differences in the following factors: the a vailability and patterns of use of screening, early detection and diagnostic services that affect how early cancer is diagnosed the a vailability of and access to specialized cancer treatments pop ulation attributes (such as socio-economic status and lifestyle factors) that affect survival pro vincial resources available to ensure registration of all cancers and up-to-date vital status information on registered casesSurvival by age at diagnosis Relative survival is generally poorer among those diagnosed with cancer at an older age. Poorer survival among older people may be because they receive less therapy due to the presence of other diseases or conditions that reduce the body's ability to tolerate and respond to cancer treatments. Older people may also receive less aggressive treatment, independent of any other conditions, due to their advanced age. (4) Table 5.3 shows the five-year RSRs for the four most common cancers by age group. RSRs fo r prostate cancer are consistently high (>95%) among males diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 79 years; lower RSRs are seen at older ages. The high est RSRs for female breast cancer (87%- 90%) are among people diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 79 years. Lower RSRs are seen for women at both younger (85%) and older (79%) ages. RSRs fo r colorectal cancer are consistent at 68% among people diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 69 years; RSRs then decrease with advancing age. For l ung cancer, the RSR decreases with advancing age. People aged 15-39 years at diagnosis have the highest RSR at 45%, while people aged 80-99 years have the lowest RSR at 10%.Trends over time Age-standardized RSRs are used to examine changes in relative survival over time. Figure 5.2 shows that there was substantial improvement in five-year relative survival between 1992 to 1994 and 2006 to 2008 for the most commonly diagnosed cancers of today. The RSR f or all cancers combined has risen by 7.3 percentage points to 62.8% in 2006 to 2008 from 55.5% in 1992 to 1994. The la rgest increases between the two time periods among the cancers presented are seen for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (16 percentage points) and leukemia (15 percentage points); multiple myeloma increased by 14 percentage points. A few fac tors have contributed to the increased relative survival for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. First is the advance in therapy, particularly the introduction of antibody therapy with rituximab. Second is the recent decrease in the number of cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The lower number of cases related to HIV is a consequence of improved treatment, specifically with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) developed in the late 1990s. (5) Age-s tandardized RSRs for prostate and colorectal cancers each increased by nine percentage points. Survival improvements in prostate and colorectal cancers are due to increased use of screening and early detection that have helped identify cancers at a treatable stage. There h as been virtually no change (less than one percentage point) for cancers of the bladder and body of uterus between 1992 to 1994 and 2006 to 2008.Age-standardized relative survival ratio (RSR) The RSR that would have occurred if the age distribution of the group of people with cancer under study had been the same as that of the standard population (e.g., all people diagnosed with that cancer in Canada between 2001 and 2005).CHAPTER 5 n Relative survival: What is the likelihood of surviving cancer?61 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Five-year conditional relative survival The five-year conditional RSR for people with cancer who have already survived one to three years after their diagnosis is often more meaningful for clinical management and prognosis than the five-year RSR measured from the date of diagnosis. Since the risk of death due to cancer is often greatest in the first few years after diagnosis, prognosis can substantially improve among people surviving one or more years. Thus, the five-year RSR measured at diagnosis no longer applies. (6,7) Table 5.4 presents five-year RSRs estimated from the date of cancer diagnosis and five-year conditional RSRs calculated using people who have survived the first, second, third, fourth and fifth year after a cancer diagnosis. Five-year conditional RSRs demonstrate that the survival experience of people diagnosed with cancer generally improves with time since diagnosis. The fiv e-year RSR for all cancers combined increased from 63% when measured from the date of diagnosis to 81% when measured among those who survived the first year after a cancer diagnosis. Conditional relative survival A measure that reflects the likelihood a person will survive an additional number of years (e.g., five years) once he or she has already survived a fixed number of years since a cancer diagnosis, compared to the expected survival in a comparable group of people - free from the cancer under study - in the general population. In practice, the expected survival is typically estimated from general population life tables, which include those persons previously diagnosed with cancer.

Excludes data from Ontario, which does not currently report in situ bladder cancers. Note: These data are based on people aged 15-99 years at diagnosis. \"All cancers\" excludes adolescent (15-19 years) bone cancers, which are dissimilar to those diagnosed in older adults, and non-melanoma skin cancers (neoplasms, NOS; epithelial neoplasms, NOS; and basal and squamous). Error bars refer to 95% confidence intervals. Analysis by: Health Statistics Division, Statistics Canada Data sources: Canadian Cancer Registry database and life tables at Statistics Canada62 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014 Each addi tional year survived resulted in further, although less dramatic, increases in the five-year conditional RSR. The imp act of time survived on the five-year conditional RSR varied by type of cancer. Cancers with low initial five-year RSRs (such as stomach, brain, liver, lung, esophagus and pancreas) showed the most dramatic increases in five-year conditional RSRs. Con versely, since the potential for improvement is limited for cancers that have an excellent prognosis at diagnosis, cancers with high initial five-year RSRs (such as thyroid, testis and prostate) showed little improvement in five-year conditional RSRs.Five-year childhood cancer (0 -14 years) survival Table 5.5 shows the estimated five-year OSPs for children, by childhood cancer diagnostic group and selected subgroups, (8) diagnosed with cancer in Canada between 2004 and 2008. Only OSPs are reported as the estimates of observed and relative survival for the age range 0-14 years are essentially the same. In general, survival for childhood cancer is higher than it is among adults. However, the rarity of childhood cancer results in less precise estimates, even when more years of data are considered. For a ll cancers combined, the five-year OSP is 83%. Amo ng specific diagnostic groups, five-year OSPs are highest for retinoblastoma and for other malignant epithelial neoplasms - both at 94%. The five-year OSP is also over 90% for lymphomas, germ cell tumours and other and unspecified neoplasms. Amo ng specific diagnostic groups, five-year OSPs are lowest for malignant bone tumours (70%), soft tissue (72%) and central nervous system (74%) cancers.What do these statistics mean? People diagnosed with cancer today have a better chance of surviving the next five years after their diagnosis than they did just over a decade ago. Despite this improvement in survival, some cancers continue to have lower RSRs than others because of the aggressiveness of the disease, the late stage at which they tend to be diagnosed or the lack of effective treatment options. Among the most common cancers, there is variation in age-standardized five-year RSRs across provinces for prostate, lung and colorectal cancers, while there is little provincial variation for breast cancer. These differences in five-year RSRs across geographic regions and types of cancer help point to areas where greater effort is required to detect, diagnose and treat cancer at an early stage, or where more research is needed to develop better treatments. Cancer stage at diagnosis is an important prognostic indicator that is available for the most common cancers from most provincial cancer registries. It is anticipated that cancer stage at diagnosis and its impact on survival will be reported in this publication in future years.CHAPTER 5 n Relative survival: What is the likelihood of surviving cancer?63 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014For more information Publications Ellison LF .

Highlights At th e beginning of 2009, a substantial number of people in Canada - just over 810,000 - had been diagnosed with cancer in the previous 10 years, (10-year person-based prevalence). Among these people, nearly 841,000 cancers were recorded (10-year tumour-based prevalence). Bre ast and prostate cancer accounted for 40% of the 10-year tumour-based prevalent cases. The 10-ye ar tumour-based prevalence peaked among males aged 70-79 years and females aged 60-69 years. This sex difference is due to the high prevalence of prostate and breast cancers in each of these age groups. The ma jority of 10-year tumour-based prevalent cases were diagnosed in the previous five years. Such affected individuals were either undergoing treatment, recovering from its effects or still dealing with the physical and emotional consequences of cancer. This has significant implications for the planning and development of interdisciplinary healthcare services.Introduction The ongoing rise in the annual number of new cancer diagnoses (due to a growing and aging population), combined with an improving survival rate for most types of cancer, has meant that a substantial number of people are living with and beyond their cancer diagnosis. This prevalent population of people with cancer and cancer survivors is likely to have unique healthcare needs during the course of their cancer journey. Thus, prevalence statistics are required to estimate the needs for ongoing healthcare (1) and support services that improve the quality of life for people with cancer, cancer survivors and their families. Recent diagnoses of cancer (within the past two years) include individuals who are either receiving primary treatment or recovering from its effects. People diagnosed in the more distant past (beyond two years) have likely completed their treatment but may still need clinical follow-up and supportive care. Person-based estimates of prevalence are intuitively easier to understand than tumour-based estimates, although they may underestimate the true impact of cancer because one person can have more than a single diagnosis of a primary cancer. It is also possible to examine limited-duration prevalence. In limited-duration prevalence, tumour- or person-based prevalence estimates are limited to, respectively, cancers or persons diagnosed within a specified period prior to the index date. Limited-duration prevalence is generally measured in two-, five- or 10-year periods prior to an index date.CHAPTER 6 Prevalence Population-based cancer prevalence can be measured by the number of living individuals previously diagnosed with cancer or by the number of cancer cases diagnosed in such individuals. Tumour-based estimates refer to the number of cancers diagnosed among individuals living with or beyond cancer on a specified date (index date). Person-based estimates refer to the number of individuals living with or beyond cancer on an index date.69 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014tumour-based prevalence Among Canadians alive on January 1, 2009, close to 841,000 cancers had been diagnosed in the previous 10 years (Table 6.1). These cases can be analyzed according to the type of cancer, the sex and age of the person and the amount of time since diagnosis. Prevalence by type of cancer Figure 6.1 shows that prostate and breast cancers together accounted for 40% of all 10-year prevalent cancers. Other common cancers included colorectal cancer (13% of all 10-year non-Hodgkin lymphoma (4%) and bladder cancer (4%). Prevalence reflects both the frequency of occurrence and prognosis for particular cancers. For example, even though the colorectal cancer incidence rate is lower than that of lung cancer, the colorectal 10-year cancer prevalence is 2.7 times greater, reflecting the poorer prognosis for lung cancer. Similarly, while melanoma accounts for 3% of all newly diagnosed cancer cases, it represents 5% of all 10-year prevalent cancer cases because of its high survival. Prevalence by sex Table 6.1 shows that 10-year tumour-based prevalence counts are similar among males and females for several types of cancer including lung, colorectal, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, pancreas, brain, multiple myeloma and Hodgkin lymphoma. On the other hand, large differences were seen between the sexes for other types of cancer, including bladder, thyroid, oral, stomach, liver, esophagus and larynx. These sex differences primarily result from differences in cancer incidence rather than observed survival.Prevalence by age Table 6.2 shows that the number of 10-year prevalence cases is generally highest in the 70-79 year age group. Exceptions include female breast cancer and all cancers combined among females - both of which peaked in the 60-69 year age group - as well as colorectal cancer among females (80 years or older age group).CHAPTER 6 n Prevalence: How many people diagnosed with cancer are alive today? FIGuRE 6.1 Distribution of 10-year tumour-based prevalence for selected cancers, Canada,* January 1, by: Health Statistics Division, Statistics Canada Data source: Canadian Cancer Registry database at Statistics Canada* During the estimation process, cases from Quebec were excluded because of issues in correctly ascertaining the vital status of cases. The presented estimates, however, are for all of Canada, including Quebec. These estimates assume that sex- and age-specific tumour-based prevalence proportions in Quebec are similar to the rest of Canada. Estimates for lung and bladder cancers may be lower than in previous editions of this publication because of the different method used to estimate Quebec's prevalence prior to 2013. For further details, see Appendix II, Data sources and methods.70 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Prevalence by duration Of the approximately 841,000 10-year prevalent cancer cases at the beginning of 2009, 29% had been diagnosed within the previous two years (2007 to 2008), 32% within the previous two to five years and 38% within the previous five to 10 years (Table 6.1). These data have implications for planning healthcare and supportive services. In th e first couple of years post diagnosis, individuals are likely receiving or recovering from treatment for their cancer. The thir d to fifth year after a cancer diagnosis is a period that typically requires close clinical follow-up for recurrence and supportive care. Indi viduals alive five to 10 years after a cancer diagnosis have likely completed their treatment but some may still require clinical monitoring.Figure 6.2 shows that the prevalence of certain types of cancer depends on the length of the period considered. For example: The pr evalence of breast cancer and prostate cancer rises with longer duration compared to other common cancers, such as colorectal and lung cancers. The po or prognosis for lung cancer cases means that proportionately fewer individuals with this cancer are alive beyond two years after diagnosis compared to most other cancers.Person-based prevalence Among Canadians alive on January 1, 2009, just over 810,000 had been diagnosed with cancer in the previous 10 years (Table 6.3). This number represents approximately 1 in 41 Canadians or 2.4% of the Canadian population (Table 6.4). More specifically, in the 10 years prior to January 1, 2009, among those alive: 1 in 94 males h ad been diagnosed with prostate cancer. 1 in 107 fema les had been diagnosed with breast cancer. 1 in 297 males a nd 1 in 351 females had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. 1 in 907 males a nd 1 in 813 females had been diagnosed with lung cancer.

The presented estimates, however, are for all of Canada, including Quebec. These estimates assume that sex- and age-specific tumour-based prevalence proportions in Quebec are similar to the rest of Canada. Estimates for lung cancer may be lower than in previous editions of this publication because of the different method used to estimate Quebec's prevalence prior to 2013. For further details, see Appendix II, Data sources and methods . Note: N is the total number of prevalent tumour cases for each cancer type. In the legend, 0 to 2 years refers to those diagnosed in 2007 and 2008; >2 to 5 years refers to those diagnosed between 2004 and 2006; >5 to 10 years refers to those diagnosed between 1999 and 2003.CHAPTER 6 n Prevalence: How many people diagnosed with cancer are alive today?71 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014 Some of the individuals included in these numbers were cancer-free, while others were newly or recently diagnosed and were undergoing treatment. What do these statistics mean? Knowing the prevalence of cancer is important for estimating and planning healthcare services for cancer. For example, those diagnosed with cancer within the past two years have different needs than those diagnosed between two and five, five and 10 or more than 10 years ago. (1,2) Earlier chapters and other sources(3) have shown ongoing increases in the number of newly diagnosed cancer cases in Canada and increases in survival from cancer. (4,5) The combined result of these factors is a rise in the number of people living with or beyond a cancer diagnosis. Long after the need for cancer treatment has passed, individuals may still require rehabilitation and supportive care services to address the physical, emotional and spiritual consequences of cancer. The growing demand for such services and the increased complexity of survivors' health needs are just two factors that need to be considered when planning and developing interdisciplinary healthcare.For more information Publications Ellison LF , Wilkins K .

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from overexposure to the sun or indoor tanning is the main risk factor for all types of skin cancers. Skin c ancer is the most common cancer in Canada. Together, melanoma and NMSC will account for nearly the same number of new cancer cases as the four major cancers combined (lung, breast, colorectal and prostate). NMSC alone accounts for at least 40% of all new cancer cases in Canada. In 2014, an es timated 6,500 new cases of melanoma and 76,100 cases of NMSC will occur in Canada. An estimated 1,050 deaths due to melanoma and 440 deaths due to NMSC are also expected that year. Betw een 1986 and 2010, the incidence rate of melanoma has increased significantly among men and women, rising 2% per year (from 9.0 to 14.7 cases per 100,000) in men and 1.5% per year (from 8.3 to 11.9 cases per 100,000) in women. The mortality rate from melanoma has also increased over time but not as strongly as the incidence rate. Bot h the incidence and mortality rates for melanoma are highest in older compared to younger Canadians. The fiv e-year relative survival rate for melanoma in men is 85% and in women it is 92%. Because of the very good survival for this cancer, it is estimated that 39,495 Canadians had been diagnosed with skin cancer in the 10 years prior to January 2009. In Ca nada, 77% of NMSC cases are BCC and 23% are SCC. The estimated incidence rates (per 100,000) for BCC is 120.7 and for SCC is 39.6 in both sexes. To slo w the rising rates of melanoma in Canada, greater efforts are needed to encourage sun protection and to restrict indoor tanning use. The bur den of NMSC is not well understood because they are not routinely reported as part of cancer surveillance. The ability to adequately plan for future healthcare resources will depend on more comprehensive data on NMSC. Introduction Skin cancer is the most common cancer in Canada, with an estimated 6,500 new cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma (hereafter called melanoma) and 76,100 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) expected to be diagnosed in 2014 (see Chapter 1). Together melanoma and NMSC will account for nearly the same number of new cancer cases as the four major cancers combined (lung, breast, colorectal, prostate). In addition, an estimated 1,050 deaths due to melanoma and 440 deaths due to NMSC are expected (see Chapter 3). Skin cancer is one of the most preventable types of cancer yet prevention efforts, as discussed later, have had limited success in Canada according to national sun surveys conducted over the past two decades. There are three main types of skin cancer, labelled according to the cell type from which they emerge. The more common but less deadly skin cancers are the non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC): squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Squamous cells are thin flat cells on the surface of the skin (Figure 7.1). SCC tends to be more aggressive than BCC. It is more likely to spread to fatty tissues under the skin, lymph nodes or distant parts of the body. squamous cellhair 7.1 Anatomy of the skin78 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Basal cells are round cells that lie under the squamous cells. They are made deep in the epidermis. Newly made basal cells push the older cells toward the surface of the skin, where they become squamous cells. BCC is usually slow growing. It is very rare for a BCC to spread to nearby lymph nodes or to distant parts of the body. However, if a BCC is left untreated, it can grow into nearby areas and spread to the bone or other tissues beneath the skin. Melanoma starts in the melanocytes, which are found deep in the epidermis, in between the basal cells (Figure 7.1). Melanocytes make melanin, which gives colour to skin. Thus, when skin is exposed to the sun, the melanocytes make more melanin, causing the skin to tan or, in some cases, to burn. Several points regarding the analysis for the chapter are worth noting (see Appendix II: Data sources and methods for more details on the methodology): Ana lyses are based on actual data (instead of projected data) for both melanoma and NMSC. Alt hough there are several types of skin cancer other than melanoma, BCC and SCC, they were not included in the chapter given that they represent a very small proportion of all skin cancers. All p rovincial cancer registries were approached for NMSC data but only a limited number of registries routinely collect the data because NMSC is not typically captured under surveillance. Those registries with fair to good data (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador) were included for analysis using their last 10 years of data. Mul tiple primary skin cancers are relatively common among people diagnosed with melanoma and NMSC. (1, 2) In this chapter we present both person- based and tumour-based analyses for melanoma. For NMSC, we selected the first BCC and the first SCC in an individual, with a maximum of one tumour of each type tabulated per person, as the basis for our analysis. When co mbined estimates of NMSC incidence rates are presented, they exclude Quebec since the low rates in that province may be a result of pathology reports not being available to the provincial registry for the period of interest. Surv ival data on NMSC were not available for two provinces - Saskatchewan and Quebec - and were excluded for Newfoundland and Labrador because these were artefactually high. Epidemiology of skin cancer Melanoma In 2010, nearly 5,500 Canadians were diagnosed with melanoma and over 1,000 died from it. Melanoma accounts for about 3% of all new cancer cases, placing it among the top 10 cancers diagnosed in Canada. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer but because most cases are identified early, it represents only 1.4% of all cancer deaths. Sex differences in incidence and mortality rates Melanoma is more common in males than females in Canada. One in 59 Canadian men will develop melanoma in their lifetime, and 1 in 290 will die from it. In contrast, slightly fewer women (1 in 73) will develop this cancer in their lifetime, and 1 in 395 will die from it (see Chapters 1 and 3). Melanoma accounted for 2.2% and 1.4% of all potential years of life lost due to cancer in 2009 among Canadian men and women respectively (see Introduction ).Age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) The number of new cases of cancer per 100,000 people, standardized to the age structure of the 1991 Canadian population to account for changes in age distribution over time. Age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) The number of cancer deaths per 100,000 people, standardized to the age structure of the 1991 Canadian population to account for changes in age distribution over time. Annual percent change (APC) The estimated change in the rate from one year to the next over a defined period of time, reported as a percentage. Along with the changepoint (the year in which the APC changed), the APC is useful for examining trends. Average annual percent change (AAPC) The average estimated change in the rate from one year to the next over a defined period of time, reported as a percentage. Along with the changepoint (the year in which the AAPC changed), the AAPC is useful for examining trends. When there is no change point, the AAPC is the same as the APC. Incidence The number of new cases of cancer in a given year. Mortality The number of deaths due to cancer in a given year.CHAPTER 7 n Special topic: Skin cancers79 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Trends in incidence The incidence of melanoma has increased significantly among males and females in Canada during the past 25 years. Among males, the ASIR increased an average of 2% per year between 1986 and 2010, from 9.0 to 14.7 cases per 100,000 (Figure 7.2). In females, the ASIR of melanoma increased an average of 1.5% per year over the same period, from 8.3 to 11.9 cases per 100,000, but the increase was accelerated during the last eight years at 2.6% per year. A previously published report of longer-term data showed similar trends over time. Between 1970 and 2007, an overall upward trend in the ASIR for males (AAPC 3.9%) and for females (AAPC 2.9%) has been observed. (3) The lifetime risk of developing melanoma also increased from 0.9% for men and 0.7% for women in 1993 (4) to 1.7% and 1.4% for men and women respectively in 2009 (see Chapter 1). Trends in mortality Mortality from melanoma has also increased significantly among males and females in Canada in the last 25 years. In males, the ASMR increased 1.2% per year between 1986 and 2009 from 2.3 to 3.2 per 100,000, while in females it increased an average of 0.4% per year during the same period from 1.3 to 1.6 per 100,000 (Figure 7.2). These trends confirm previous reports of rising melanoma AMSR. (3) Unlike most other cancers for which statistically significant decreases were observed in ASMR between 1970 and 2007, melanoma saw an increase in mortality with an AAPC of 2.3% for men and 0.8% for women, representing the second greatest increase in mortality rate since 1970 (after liver cancer in males and lung cancer in females).

The female AAPC for the incidence rate for the entire period between 1986 and 2010 is 1.5% per year.CHAPTER 7 n Special topic: Skin cancers80 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Age differences in incidence and mortality rates As with most cancers, the incidence rate of melanoma rises exponentially with age. Melanoma is very rare in children under 15 years of age, with less than 1 case per 100,000, and peaks in males between 85 and 90 years of age at approximately 85 cases per 100,000 (Figure 7.3). Until age 50, melanoma is slightly more common in females than males but the difference in incidence rates increases between the sexes after this age. By age 80, melanoma is twice as frequent in males compared to females. The incidence rate of melanoma in females peaks between 80 and 85 years of age at approximately 40 cases per 100,000. Mortality from melanoma is also more common in males compared to females and rises with age to over 30 deaths per 100,000 in males and nearly 20 deaths per 100,000 in females by 90 years of age (Figure 7.3).

Based on incidence data for Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador for 2011.CHAPTER 7 n Special topic: Skin cancers81 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Trends in incidence In general, the increase in incidence rate of melanoma is higher in older versus younger Canadians. Between 1986 and 2010, the increase in incidence rate was highest in males and females aged 75 years and older, at 4.1% and 2.9% per year, respectively (Figure 7.4). However, among females, a shorter period between 2004 and 2010 highlights a higher annual increase of 4.0% per year in those aged 55-64 years of age. There was no change in the ASIR of melanoma in males 15-29 years of age, or females 15-44 years old between 1986 and 2010. Trends in mortality Similar to incidence, the increase in mortality rate from melanoma is highest in older compared to younger Canadians. The increase in ASMR was highest in males and females aged 75 years and older at 3.4% and 1.9% per year, respectively, from 1986 to 2009 (Figure 7.5). There was no increase in the ASMR from melanoma for males and females 15-64 years old. In fact, the ASMR decreased significantly in males and females aged 30-44 years by 2.4% per year. Taken together, these historical and more recent data suggest varying degrees of increasing incidence rates over time, coinciding with possible changes in clothing trends, sun safety and surveillance.

The biggest discrepancy in ASIR between men and women was seen in Prince Edward Island, which had a rate of 28.8 per 100,000 for men and 12.7 per 100,000 for women. The Prince Edward Island rate for men (28.8 per 100,000) was the highest among all provinces. However, Newfoundland and Labrador had the highest annual change in the male ASIR, as measured by the annual percent change (APC) in incidence rate over the 24-year time period. More specifically, for men in Newfoundland and Labrador the APC was 5.7% per year, despite the province's ASIR in 2010 being considerably lower than that of Prince Edward Island. Saskatchewan had the lowest incidence rate for men at 9.5 per 100,000. The lowest incidence rate for women was found in Newfoundland and Labrador, followed closely by Quebec. Despite having among the lowest ASIR for women in Canada, the greatest incidence rate increase over time was seen in Quebec women, at 7.8% per year. In Quebec, because of the registry's dependence on hospital data, the numbers of microscopically confirmed melanoma are underestimated. More specifically, one study estimates this under-reporting at 14%.

Men in Nova Scotia had the highest reported ASMR in the country, while the lowest mortality rate was seen in Manitoba. The largest APC for men was in Newfoundland and Labrador (8.7% per year), while the lowest rate of change was in British Columbia.Manitoba had the lowest ASMR among Canadian jurisdictions for women, while Nova Scotia had the highest. Rates are not reported here for Prince Edward Island or for women in Newfoundland and Labrador due to the small number of annual deaths. Quebec had an ASMR similar to most other jurisdictions despite the fact that its ASIR was among the lowest. The greatest change in APC occurred in Manitoba at -1.6% per year, indicating a decrease over time. The highest increase in APC was 1.1% per year in Nova Scotia. International differences in incidence and mortality rates Worldwide, melanoma represents 4% of all skin cancers, but it is responsible for 80% of skin cancer deaths and 1%-2% of all cancer deaths. (7) According to global estimates for 2012, there were over 230,000 new cases of melanoma (3.0 per 100,000 age-standardized to the world population) and an estimated 55,000 related deaths (0.7 per 100,000 age-standardized to the world population). (8) The vast majority of melanoma cases (almost 85%) occur in Western countries where melanoma ranks as the sixth most frequently diagnosed cancer overall. (9) The ASIR of melanoma has steadily increased over the past 50 years in most fair-skinned populations. Europe (particularly Nordic countries), North America, Australia and New Zealand have the highest incidence rates reported worldwide compared to significantly lower rates in Asia. (9) Melanoma rates in North America (about 10-14 per 100,000 age-standardized to the world population) are less than half of that in Australia and New Zealand (about 35 per 100,000 age-standardized to the world population) but are still the second highest in the world. (8) The increasing ASIR in many Western countries might be partly explained by a higher proportion of thinner melanomas being diagnosed as a result of improved surveillance techniques, earlier diagnosis and growing awareness of skin cancer in some populations. (10) As in Canada, the greatest increase in ASIR over time in most developed countries are in males and females over the age of 65 years at diagnosis. Canada is probably most similar to Northern European countries with respect to melanoma incidence rates, although the pattern of higher incidence rates in European women than men is not seen in Canada. (9) Survival The short- and long-term prognoses for people diagnosed with melanoma are very good. Based on follow-up data from 2004 to 2008, the one-, five-, and 10-year predicted relative survival ratios (RSRs) are 97%, 89% and 86% respectively (Table 7.3). Provincial five-year RSRs resembled the national estimate except in Saskatchewan (82%). The survival advantage for women likely reflects the better response to melanoma treatment in women, the typically later stage of presentation of more advanced cancer in men or biologic differences between the sexes. (11, 12) As observed with most other cancer types, relative survival for those diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer decreases with advancing age. Overall, the age-standardized five-year RSR for melanoma has increased from 85% in 1992 to 1996 to 89% in 2004 to 2008 (Table 7.4). Increases tended to be higher in older than in younger age groups, whereas similar improvements occurred in men and women. Province-specific survival time trends were inconsistent. While the age-standardized five-year RSR increased from 83% to 89% in Ontario, it decreased from 87% to 82% in Saskatchewan. Several other provinces experienced little to no change.Observed survival The proportion of people with cancer who are alive after a given period of time (e.g., five years) after diagnosis. Five-year relative survival ratio (RSR) The ratio of the observed survival in a group of people diagnosed with cancer to the expected survival in a comparable group of people - free from the cancer under study - in the general population. (6) In practice, the expected survival is typically estimated from general population life tables, which include those people previously diagnosed with cancer. Relative survival estimates the excess mortality that may be attributed to the diagnosis. Relative survival is the preferred measure for assessing population-based cancer survival. Prevalence Population-based cancer prevalence can be measured by the number of living individuals previously diagnosed with cancer or by the number of cancer cases diagnosed in such individuals. Tumour-based estimates refer to the number of cancers diagnosed among individuals living with or beyond cancer on a specified date (index date). Person-based estimates refer to the number of individuals living with or beyond cancer on an index date.CHAPTER 7 n Special topic: Skin cancers84 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Analysis of conditional survival (see Chapter 5, Table 5.4) indicates a steady increase in five-year RSR for melanoma with each year survived since the time of diagnosis. Data on stage distribution of melanoma cases is not currently reported at the national level. Therefore, analyses of survival by stage are not currently available. However, data from the US Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program for 2002 to 2008 indicate that the five-year RSR for melanoma improves substantially when it is diagnosed at an earlier stage. This program reported the following RSRs by stage: localized stage was 98.2%; regional stage was 62.4%; distant stage was 15.1%; and unknown stage was 75.8%. (13) Other research has suggested that survival differs by anatomic site, whereby melanoma of the scalp and neck regions have a poorer prognosis than other body sites. (14)Prevalence As of January 1, 2009, it is estimated that approximately 39,500 Canadians (see Chapter 6, Table 6.3) had been diagnosed with melanoma in the previous 10 years. Despite higher annual melanoma incidence in men, 10-year prevalence counts were almost equally divided between males and females, most likely owing to the better survival of women compared to men. Figure 7.6 shows the distribution of the elapsed time people >5 to 10 years >2 to 5 years 0 to 2 yearsMales >5 to 10 years >2 to 5 years 0 to 2 yearsFemales 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,00045,000>5 to 10 years >2 to 5 years of of the skin by prevalence duration and sex, Canada,* January 1, 2009 Analysis by: Health Statistics Division, Statistics Canada Data source: Canadian Cancer Registry database at Statistics CanadaN is the total prevalence count. *During the estimation process, cases from Quebec were excluded because of issues in correctly ascertaining the vital status of cases. The presented estimates, however, are for all of Canada, including Quebec. These estimates assume that sex- and age-specific person-based prevalence proportions in Quebec are similar to the rest of Canada. Note: In the legend, 0 to 2 years refers to those diagnosed in 2007 and 2008; >2 to 5 years refers to those diagnosed between 2004 and 2006; >5 to 10 years refers to those diagnosed between 1999 and 2003.CHAPTER 7 n Special topic: Skin cancers85 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014diagnosis for these people (i.e., within the past two years, between two and five years ago and between five and 10 years ago). The large percentage of people diagnosed between five and 10 years previously reflects the very good survival associated with this cancer. Variations in melanoma prevalence by province (Table 7.5) largely reflect population size differences but also differences in rates of melanoma diagnosis and survival. In contrast, the age distribution of 10-year tumour-based prevalence (Table 7.6) largely reflects the incidence of melanoma in various age groups and the higher incidence of melanoma in older age cohorts, which has been previously described in other research. (4) Using 2005 data, a previous study estimated that the five-year melanoma prevalence proportion rose with advancing age in both sexes but was higher among Canadian females than males in those under the age of 50 but higher in males than females in all age groups over 50. (15) The prevalence proportion of melanoma cases has been increasing in Canada. The annual percent change in the 10-year prevalence proportion diagnosed between 2002 and 2008 was 2.7%, slightly above the 2.4% observed for all cancers combined. (16)Non-melanoma skin cancer NMSC accounts for at least 40% of all new cancer cases in Canada (see Chapter 1, Table 1.2). However, because it is not routinely captured as part of cancer surveillance in Canada and elsewhere, the annual number of NMSC cases is likely underestimated. Moreover, despite some provincial cancer registries in Canada routinely collecting data on new NMSC cases, the data may still underestimate the true burden of disease because of under-reporting by healthcare providers. The lifetime risk of NMSC has been previously estimated at 13% (roughly 1 in 8) for BCC and 5% (1 in 20) for SCC. (17) Sex differences in incidence Based on the most recent available data from five provinces, 77% of NMSC cases were BCC (13,655 cases) and 23% were SCC (4,015 cases) (Table 7.7). SCC was diagnosed more often in men (62%) than women, although BCC distribution was comparable in men and women. This finding generally agrees with previous reports. (17) The most common body site for both BCC and SCC in both sexes was the face, followed by the trunk for BCC and the upper limb (including shoulder) for SCC (Table 7.7). Other common body sites for SCC were the external ear, scalp and neck.Age differences in incidence rates Similar to melanoma, ASIR for BCC are higher in women than men up to the age of 50 years, at which time the incidence in men increases more rapidly than in women with a widening difference with advancing age (Figure 7.3). BCC rates peak in men between the ages of 80-85 years and slightly later for women, between the ages of 85-90 years. SCC incidence rates reach their peak at later ages for both men and women, peaking in men 85-90 years of age.CHAPTER 7 n Special topic: Skin cancers86 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Provincial differences in incidence rates Trends in incidence Four provinces (Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Newfound and Labrador) show an ASIR for BCC of 120.7 per 100,000 and for SCC of 39.6 per 100,000 in 2011 (Figure 7.7). Overall NMSC incidence rates by province show rates for most provinces ranging from 120 to 170 per 100,000 over the long term (Figure 7.7), with the exception of Quebec, where the rate appears to be low and is likely due to a greater degree of under-reporting in that province (Figure 7.7). Since 2002, ASIR appear to have declined in Alberta and Saskatchewan, increased in New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador and remained stable in Manitoba. In Quebec, an increasing ASIR since 2005 may reflect the improved collection of skin cancer data (for both melanoma and NMSC), as well as a general improvement in cancer record linkage in that province. Analysis of NMSC trends in several of these provinces are available for prior periods in the published literature. A study in New Brunswick estimated the NMSC incidence rate to be 179.2 per 100,000 in 2001, consisting of a high rate of BCC (138.4 per 100,000) and a relatively lower rate of SCC (40.8 per 100,000). (17) In Alberta, between 1988 and 2007, the BCC incidence rates rose from about 100 per 100,000 in 1988 to a peak of 130 per 100,000. The SCC incidence rate rose from 30 per 100,000 in 1988 to about 40 per 100,000 in 2007. (18) Data from Manitoba showed the BCC incidence rate increased from 36 per 100,000 in 1960 to 99 per 100,000 in 2000.

In British Columbia, between 1973 and 1987, BCC incidence rates increased from 70.7 to 120.4 per 100,000 in men and 61.5 to 92.2 per 100,000 in women.

Trends in mortality Mortality data for NMSC were not analyzed given the small annual number of deaths, which in 2014 are estimated to be 440 deaths (see Chapter 3, Table 3.2). Survival Survival for both BCC and SCC decreases slightly with advancing age (Table 7.8). The decrease is less pronounced compared to melanoma because of the better prognosis of NMSC, with age-specific five-year RSRs generally over 90%. The five-year RSR is better for BCC than SCC in both males and females. However, among SCC cases, survival is slightly better among females compared to males. Prevalence The standard approach for tabulating BCC and SCC is to count the first tumour of each type. However, some people have had both types of tumours diagnosed. The 17,670 tumours shown in Table 7.7 (13,655 BCC and 4,015 SCC cases) were diagnosed among 17,020 people. Five-year prevalence of NMSC was estimated using the age-specific incidence rates (from Figure 7.2) and the survival data (from Table 7.8) as being 1.1% for BCC and 0.35% for SCC for the population aged 30+ years. Previous estimates from Manitoba in 2004 suggest that the prevalence for all ages of NMSC in that province was 1.7% for BCC and 0.34% for SCC for all ages and that the prevalence of both BCC and SCC increases with age. (21)Risk factors Ultraviolet radiation Overexposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the most important cause of the three main forms of skin cancer examined in this chapter. (22) UVR accounts for an estimated 90% of melanoma cases in North America. (23) The most important source of UVR exposure is the sun \u2014 an exposure that can occur through either recreation or work. Exposure to non-solar sources of ultraviolet radiation is mainly through the use of tanning equipment. It is also possible to be exposed to non-solar sources of UVR as a part of treatment for skin disorders such as psoriasis or at work (e.g., welding arcs). The nature of UVR exposure most important to the development of skin cancer varies between the various forms of skin cancer (Table 7.9). Continuous exposure (such as outdoor work) is a more important risk factor for SCC, while intermittent, intense exposure is more important for melanoma. For BCC, both intensity and duration seem to have a role to play. For melanoma, intermittent, intense sun exposure during childhood or adolescence, along with a history of sunburn, shows the strongest association. The risk is especially high (over two-fold) among those with fair skin, red hair and multiple or atypical nevi. (24-28) Chronic sun exposure, such as occupational exposure, is not always associated with an increased risk of melanoma and is sometimes reported to inhibit melanoma. (25-27, 29) There is some indication that melanoma among young to middle-aged adults, especially when found on the trunk or legs, is more likely due to intermittent, intense sun exposure. Melanoma found on the head and neck, often due to chronic sun exposure, is more common in older adults and among mostly fair-skinned populations living at lower latitudes. (27, 28, 30, 31)The dose of UVR depends on both intensity of ambient UVR and personal behaviour (e.g., time in the sun and use of protection). Many factors, including location (latitude, altitude, weather), time of year and time of day, affect the amount of ambient UVR. The importance of location on incidence rates for skin cancer is better observed in fair-skinned populations living in areas of high ambient UVR, such as Australia and New Zealand. The role of behaviour is better observed in low-ambient UVR areas such as Norway. Exposed human skin can tan or burn - both are signs of damage to the underlying cells. A burn, in particular, is a marker of extensive damage that normal DNA repair mechanisms may not be able to repair. Sunburn at any age is an indicator of UVR overexposure (generally intermittent exposure) and increases the risk of skin cancer, particularly of melanoma. Psoralen UV A (PUV A) therapy, a standard treatment for psoriasis, involves clinical treatment of the skin with a psoralen (photosensitizing agent) followed by a controlled dose of irradiation with UVR, usually in the UV A wavelength band. The risks and benefits of this therapy are discussed with patients before they are offered treatment. An increased risk of squamous cell and possibly basal cell carcinoma exists with this treatment. Tanning beds and sun lamps Tanning equipment emits UVR similar to solar UVR but with higher intensity. (32, 33) Tanning beds and sun lamps are designed to produce rapid onset and deeply coloured tans, achievable by high-dose UV A and/or UVB radiation. The International Agency for Research on Cancer recently upgraded its classification of tanning beds and sun lamps from a probable carcinogen to a known carcinogen after examining new evidence. (34)CHAPTER 7 n Special topic: Skin cancers88 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Most studies find an increased risk of melanoma associated with the use of indoor tanning beds, and there is some evidence of a dose-response relationship. (35-38) The risk is consistently higher among those who started using sunbeds at an earlier age (38, 39) and for a longer time.(35) Among those who first used a sunbed before age 35, the risk of melanoma is increased by 59%. (38) Phenotype A number of pigmentary characteristics are associated with the risk of skin cancer. The main phenotypic risk factors for skin cancer are fair skin, blue or green eyes, red or blond hair, skin that freckles or burns easily, multiple naevi (over 50), and clinically atypical or dysplastic nevi. (31, 40) Multiple nevi and atypical/ dysplastic nevi are the strongest phenotypic risk factors associated with the development of melanoma and may increase risk up to seven-fold. (41, 42) Risk of melanoma associated with multiple or atypical nevi is highest for melanoma on the trunk or legs. (43, 44) Nevi most often arise during childhood and adolescence as a result of sun exposure. Some melanomas appear to arise in a pre-existing nevus. The relative risk of melanoma due to fair complexion, light eye colour, red or blond hair and skin that freckles and burns easily is generally between 1.5 and 2.5. (41, 43, 45) People with red hair usually have an increased risk of up to four-fold.(45) Family history A family history of melanoma, or having a first degree relative with melanoma, is associated with a two- to four-fold increase in risk of melanoma. (45-47) Familial melanoma accounts for 5% to 10% of cases and is often diagnosed at a younger age. A significant proportion of familial melanoma seems to be due to inherited mutations in two tumour suppressor genes: CDKN2A and CDK4. (48, 49)Variants in DNA repair genes in the skin, such as those with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), though rare, are also associated with an extremely elevated risk of melanoma. (50) A personal history of melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancer increases the risk of having melanoma by 5% to 10%. Immunosuppression related to organ transplantation, lymphoproliferative disease or HIV/AIDS also increases the risk of melanoma. (31, 51) Prevention and control The cornerstone of skin cancer prevention for the general public is through minimizing exposure to harmful levels of UVR. This means avoiding non-medical use of UVR sources such as tanning equipment and overexposure to the sun at times when the UVR is most harmful and using effective sun protection when exposed to sunlight. This stresses the importance of raising awareness of UVR exposure and sun safety behaviours in the general public. Long-term changes in factors such as cloud cover, absorbing aerosols and ozone can modify the UV Index, which is a measure of the strength of UVR from the sun. According to one analysis, there have been changes in UVR levels over time. Fluctuations in the mean erythemal UVR doses (i.e., the amount of UVR capable of producing sunburn) for Toronto, calculated from actual spectral UVR measurements and reconstructed from global solar radiation and ozone, show somewhat elevated mean UVR levels from 1990 to 2005 compared to 1965 to 1980. (52) A number of specific strategies are recommended for sun protection: At tim es of the year when the UV Index is typically 3 or more (e.g., spring, summer and early fall), outdoor activities should be planned outside of peak UVR hours (i.e., before 11 a.m. or after 4 p.m.). If ou tdoors for 15 minutes or more during peak UVR hours during the spring, summer and early fall, seeking shade and using personal protection (e.g., hats, clothing that covers much of the skin and sunscreen on exposed skin) is recommended. Hats should be broad brimmed to shade the face, ears and back of the neck. Use o f sunscreen that is labelled as broad spectrum and has an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 15 is recommended and should be applied generously to all areas of the skin not covered by clothing. A sunscreen with an SPF of 30 should be used if working outdoors or planning to be outside most of the day. It is particularly important to protect the skin of infants, young children and anyone with fair skin that tends to burn easily. A periodic review of sun safety messages and the evidence on which they are based is needed to ensure that the most effective recommendations are provided to the public. To this end, specific sun safety messages for the general public are currently undergoing expert review in Canada and are expected to be updated in the near future. Sun safety behaviours Two national surveys of Canadians' sun exposure and protective behaviours were conducted in 1996 and again in 2006. (53) According to the surveys, significantly more adults took a winter vacation to a sunny place in 2006 compared to 1996. Furthermore, they were more likely to spend at least two hours in the sun while on vacation. The proportion of adults who spent two or more hours in the summer sun during their leisure time also increased from 1996 to 2006.CHAPTER 7 n Special topic: Skin cancers89 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Despite these increases in sun exposure, there was no corresponding increase in the proportion of adults using any of the recommended forms of sun protection. In fact, significantly fewer Canadians reported wearing protective clothing and hats in 2006 compared to the decade earlier. In addition, fewer adults reported hearing about or seeing the UV Index, a key tool to help plan sun protective actions. (53) Indoor tanning According to the second national sun survey in 2006, over 25% of women aged 16-24 years used a tanning bed - a proportion that has increased from 1996. (53) As of the end of 2013, some provinces had implemented bans to restrict youth under the age of 19 years (or under 18 years in some jurisdictions) from using commercial indoor tanning devices - British Columbia, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador (some provinces have exceptions for prescribed health uses). A ban was also pending in Ontario. Restrictions on advertising and marketing of tanning services, and the display of approved health warnings, have also been implemented in some cases.A national ban on indoor tanning does not currently exist, but other measures to control the use of indoor tanning have been proposed. In 2014, Health Canada strengthened its health warnings about the dangers of tanning beds by making changes to the Radiation Emitting Devices Act. The Act now requires that a health warning label be attached to all ultraviolet-emitting tanning equipment, with the following messages: \"Not recommended for use by those under 18 years of age\"; and \"Tanning equipment can cause cancer. \" The label should also include a list of other health risks associated with tanning including risk factors such as skin type, photosensitivity and history of skin cancer. Over 20 other countries have now implemented controls to ban access to indoor tanning for those under the age of 18, with most legislated in the last five years. (54) In the United States, while there are over 30 states that have some controls related to indoor tanning, only five states have introduced state-wide bans for those under the age of 18. (55) Although there are no estimates of worldwide incidence and mortality due to indoor tanning, in the United Kingdom alone, an estimated 100 deaths per year occur from tanning bed or sun lamp use. (56) In Australia, tanning bed or sun lamp use accounts for an estimated 281 new melanomas, 43 melanoma-related deaths and 2,572 new cases of SCC per year and causes 1 in 6 melanomas in those aged 18-29 years. (57)Best practices - Australian case study In Australia, where melanoma incidence rates are among the highest in the world, the trend has been relatively stable and is even decreasing in younger age groups. Australia has had over 30 years of sun protection campaigns, and during this time, there has been a significant reduction in sunburn rates and preference for tanning. (58) This has come about due to a sustained investment in broad social marketing including paid TV campaigns. Where the TV campaigns appear to have had the most effect has been in encouraging sunscreen use and hat wearing and with more people choosing to have less skin exposed during summer months. (59) High-profile campaigns involving sunbed users who had developed melanoma coupled with tight legislative controls restricting use by those under 18 years old have led to a decrease in the number of sunbeds in some Australian cities of as much as 50% within three years. (60) By the beginning of 2015, all Australian states will have a total ban of all indoor artificial ultraviolet tanning devices in commercial premises, which makes them the second country in the world after Brazil to have taken such strong measures.CHAPTER 7 n Special topic: Skin cancers90 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Controversies associated with skin cancer Tanning Some people go to tanning salons to get a \"base tan\" before leaving on a sun-intensive holiday with the misperception that it will protect their skin from sunburn. But there is little evidence that this helps. Tanning under the sun or a sun lamp gives protection that is equivalent to an SPF of 3, (61) offering little benefit in terms of protection from the sun. Claims have been made that indoor tanning offers a controlled setting for tanning. However, indoor tanning burns are a common occurrence and pose a similar risk of melanoma to that seen from sunburn. (62) A one-year diary study involving 168 female tanning bed users demonstrated that 66.1% experienced at least one episode of sunburn, 50.5% reported two or more episodes and 36.3% reported sunburn three or more times. (63) The impact of indoor tanning as a skin cancer risk factor in youth is highlighted by its potentially addictive behaviour. (64) Some research on the continuance of tanning behaviour after a skin cancer diagnosis suggests that 1 in 7 (15%) individuals diagnosed with BCC continued to tan indoors following their cancer diagnosis. (65) Vitamin D Public awareness of the harms of overexposure to UVR is further complicated by messages on vitamin D, a necessary nutrient obtained from sun exposure. The use of tanning beds or sun lamps to increase vitamin D levels is not safe or recommended. (66) Taking a supplement is the safest option for maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D year-round. In the summer and into the fall months, brief periods of UVR exposure of up to 15 minutes in the midday sun can achieve adequate vitamin D levels. (67)There is some evidence that people who actively tan sometimes deliberately increase the time they spend in the sun with the aim of getting more vitamin D. (68) While it is accepted that some exposure to UVB radiation contributes to healthy vitamin D levels, there is no established \"safe\" threshold of UVB exposure that would preclude developing skin cancer. Similarly, it is not known exactly how much UVR exposure combined with vitamin D supplementation would maintain healthy vitamin D levels that would provide benefits beyond bone health. Evidence to date mostly shows a likely reduction in risk for colorectal cancer, whereas the impact is unclear for breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. (69-71) Costs Skin cancer bears a significant burden of disease in Canada related to the high burden of annual cases, social impact and costs associated with its treatment. According to estimates for 2004, the majority of the total economic burden of skin cancer in Canada was $532 million: $66 million in direct costs (primary care, hospital-based day surgery, hospital in-patient care) and $466 million in indirect costs (related to mortality and morbidity). (72) Of the $532 million in costs, 83.4% was attributable to melanoma and the remainder to the two major types of NMSC - 9.1% to BCC and 7.5% to SCC. It was estimated that the economic burden of skin cancer would rise to $922 million annually by 2031, with BCC and SCC accounting for an increasing proportion of costs compared to 2004 estimates.What do these statistics mean? Monitoring trends in the incidence and mortality of skin cancer is important for our understanding of the impact of preventive or early detection strategies but also to predict health service requirements and evaluating priorities for healthcare resources. To slow the rising rates of melanoma in Canada, greater efforts are needed to encourage sun protection and to restrict indoor tanning use. A long-term commitment to skin cancer prevention is needed by all stakeholders to ensure that reductions in skin cancer incidence and mortality can be achieved and sustained into the future. The lack of good nationwide data on NMSC and the inclusion of only the first occurrence of NMSC in our analysis minimize the true magnitude of the skin cancer burden in Canada. The ability to adequately plan for future healthcare resources will depend on more comprehensive data on NMSC. The high survival rates reported in this chapter support the benefits of early identification and treatment of both melanoma and NMSC, but these factors must complement prevention. The low awareness of sun safety and poor sun protective behaviours of Canadians are a cause for concern and have prompted a re-examination of sun safety messages for the public. Aside from greater public education and awareness, there may also be opportunities for greater community interventions such as providing more places that offer shade and encouraging greater use of the UV index when planning outdoor activities. Stronger policies on access to indoor tanning and restrictions on advertising and marketing of tanning services might also reduce the impact on skin cancer.CHAPTER 7 n Special topic: Skin cancers91 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014For further information McLean DI, Phillips N, Zhou Y , Gallagher R, Lee TK. 40-year trends in skin cancer in British Columbia, Canada, 1973 to 2003.

For ICD-10 codes, see Table A2.APPENDIX I: Actual data for new cases and deaths109 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014 Appendix ii: Data sources and methods Data sources Incidence data: The Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR) Actual cancer incidence data used in this publication cover the period of 1985 to 2010. Data for 1992 to 2010 were obtained from the CCR (1) (September 2012 CCR Tabulation Master File), except for Quebec 2008 to 2010 data, which were received in a summary format from the Quebec Cancer Registry. Data for earlier years were retrieved from the predecessor to the CCR, the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System (NCIRS). The NCIRS is a fixed, tumour-oriented database containing cases diagnosed as far back as 1969. Inciden ce data originate with the provincial and territorial cancer registries, which provide data annually to Statistics Canada for inclusion in the CCR. The CCR i s a person-oriented database that includes clinical and demographic information about residents of Canada newly diagnosed with cancer. The He alth Statistics Division at Statistics Canada maintains the CCR. It links data internally to identify duplicate person and tumour records. The Health Statistics Division also links cancer data with mortality data (described below) to ensure the completeness and correctness of vital status information. Both linking procedures optimize the accuracy of incidence, prevalence and survival statistics. Can cer diagnoses are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3). (2) Chap ter 7: Special topic: Skin cancers uses non- melanoma data received directly from the registries of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador. The specific provinces for which non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) data were available are presented in each table and figure. Unless described as a person-based analysis, the NMSC statistics are based on the first basal cell carcinoma and the first squamous cell carcinoma, with a maximum of one tumour of each type tabulated per person. There are a small number of skin cancers other than melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma that are not included in the special topic. Combined estimates of NMSC incidence rates excluded Quebec since the low Quebec rates may be a result of pathology reports not being available to the Registry for the period covered by this analysis. Survival data for NMSC were not available for Saskatchewan and Quebec and were not included for Newfoundland and Labrador because they were artefactually high.Mortality data: The Canadian Vital Statistics \u2014 Death database (CVS: D) The actual cancer mortality data cover the period of 1984 to 2009 and were obtained from the CVS: D.(3) Dea th records originate with the provincial and territorial registrars of vital statistics and are provided regularly to Statistics Canada for inclusion in the CVS: D. The CVS: D in cludes demographic and cause of death information for all Canadian residents and non-residents who died in Canada between 1950 and 2009. Information on non-residents is not used for this publication. Dat a are also included for Canadian residents who died in a small number of states within the Udnited States from which abstracted death data were received. Starting with the 2010 data year, this information is no longer available. The He alth Statistics Division at Statistics Canada maintains the CVS: D. Cau se of death is classified according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). (4) Can cer deaths are those for which some form of cancer, as certified by a physician, is the underlying cause of death.110 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Population data: the Census of Canada Pop ulation estimates for Canada and the provinces and territories are based on censuses conducted every five years from 1981 through to 2006. Int ercensal estimates prepared by Statistics Canada are used for the years between these censuses, and postcensal estimates are used for 2006 to 2012. (5) Pro jected population estimates are used for 2013 and 2014, as prepared by Statistics Canada under assumptions of medium growth (scenario M1). (6) The scenario M1 incorporates medium-growth and historical trends (1981 to 2008) of interprovincial migration. All p opulation estimates include non-permanent residents and are adjusted for net census under-coverage and Canadians returning from abroad. Life tables Life t ables are required to estimate relative survival. Sex-specific provincial life tables are produced by Statistics Canada. Expe cted survival data for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 were respectively derived from 2005 to 2007,(7) 2006 to 2008(8) and 2007 to 2009(9) complete life tables. The methodology used to produce these life tables(10) was retroactively employed to produce annual life tables from 1991 to 1993 to 2004 to 2006. (11) As com plete life tables were not available for Prince Edward Island or the territories, expected survival proportions for these areas were derived, up to the age of 99 years, from abridged life tables for Canada (11) and the affected jurisdictions(7-9,11) and complete Canadian life tables(7-9,11) using a method suggested by Dickman et al.(12) Where this was not possible (i.e., ages 100-109 years), complete Canadian life table values were used.Cancer definitions Can cers are generally defined according to the groupings of ICD-O-3(2) for incidence and ICD-10(4) for mortality (Table A10). Som e definitions have changed slightly over time; changes occurring since the 2004 edition of this publication are outlined in Tables A11-1 and A11-2. For c hildren aged 0-14 years, cancers were classified and reported according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer, Third Edition (ICCC-3). (13) This system is most appropriate for reporting childhood cancers because it acknowledges the major differences between cancers that develop during childhood and those that occur later in life. The category \"intracranial and intraspinal\" excludes non-malignant tumours. For c ancer incidence of adolescents and young adults aged 15-29, cancers were classified and reported according to the SEER adapted classification scheme for tumours of adolescents and young adults (AYA). (14) Bladder c ancer includes bladder in situ carcinomas, which are considered invasive for the purpose of incidence reporting and are included for provinces and territories except Ontario.Methods Incidence and mortality rates Records from each province or territory were extracted from the relevant incidence or mortality files and then classified by year of diagnosis or death and by sex, five-year age group (0-4, 5-9,..., 80-84 and 85+ years) and cancer type. Rat es for each category were calculated by dividing the number of cases or deaths in each category (i.e., province or territory, year, sex, age group, cancer type) by the corresponding population figure. These formed the basis for calculations of age-standardized rates and for estimates beyond the most recent year of actual data. For t he section Incidence and mortality by age and sex, age-specific rates were computed for broader age groups (0-19, 20-29,..., 70-79 and 80+ years) in the same way. Age-s tandardized incidence rates (ASIR) and mortality rates (ASMR) were calculated using the direct method, which involves weighting the age-specific rates for each five-year age group according to the age distribution of the 1991 Canadian population:APPENDIX II: Data sources and methods111 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Figure C (Introduction ) shows the number of deaths avoided since the mortality rate for all cancers combined peaked in 1988. The ye ar 1988 was chosen as the baseline year when the overall cancer mortality rate was at its highest for Canadian men and women. The ag e-specific cancer mortality rates from 1988 for males and females in each five-year age group were applied to the age-specific populations for each of the subsequent years up to 2009 to obtain the expected number of deaths for each of those years if the 1988 death rates prevailed. To ob tain the excess deaths that would have occurred the expected deaths for each year were summed and then the observed number of deaths for each year was subtracted from this total. Simil ar charts are included for lung cancer and breast cancer in women. Figure D (Introduction ) shows the relative contributions to the changes in the total number of new cases and deaths that can be attributed to changes in cancer risk and cancer control practices, population size and aging of the population. The low est solid line represents the total number of new cancer cases (or deaths) that would have occurred each year if the population size and age structure had remained the same as they were in 1985. This line reflects the impact of changes in cancer risk and cancer control practices. The middle lin e represents the number of new cases (or deaths) that would have occurred if the age structure of the population had remained the same as it was in 1985. This line reflects the impact of changes in cancer risk and cancer control practices, together with population growth. The to p line represents the number of new cases (or deaths) that actually occurred and thus reflects the combined impact of changes in risk and cancer control practices population growth and aging of the population. The series shown in Figure D were calculated as follows: Upp ermost series: the annual number of Canadian cancer cases or deaths, for males or females Next-to-u ppermost series: annual total population multiplied by the annual age-standardized rate, using the 1985 population distribution for males or females as the standard weights Next-to-b aseline series: the 1985 total population multiplied by the annual age-standardized rate, using the 1985 population distribution for males or females as the standard weights Bas eline (dotted line): the observed number of Canadian cancer cases or deaths during 1985, for males or females. Estimation of incidence (new cases) and mortality (deaths) for 2014 Two methods were used to estimate incidence and mortality data: the Nordpred Power5 regression modelling The Nordpred Power5 regression model was the primary method for estimating the number of new cases and deaths in 2014 for each cancer type by sex (except new cases of prostate cancer and non-melanoma skin cancer; see Prostate cancer incidence and Non-melanoma skin cancer incidence below) reported in Tables 1.2 and 3.2. Nordpred is based on an age-period-cohort Poisson regression model but has enhancements that overcome difficulties in the standard Poisson model and improve projection accuracy. (15) Nordpred was developed into a software package(16) and is now one of the most frequently used methods for cancer projections worldwide.(17-21) The Nordpred Power5 regression model was used when the average annual number of cases for a type of cancer for the most recent five years was greater than 50. The assumption underlying the Nordpred Power5 regression model is that the annual number of new cases and deaths are independent Poisson random variables with mean values equal to the product of the population size for a particular year and the (true) annual rate.APPENDIX II: Data sources and methods 1991 Canadian standard population Age group Population (per T he Canadian population distribution is based on the final postcensal estimates of the July 1, 1991, Canadian population, adjusted for census undercoverage. The age distribution of the population has been weighted and normalized. Data source: Census and Demographics Branch, Statistics Canada112 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014 A sepa rate Nordpred Power5 regression model was fit for each province, sex and type of cancer for the period of 1986 to 2010 for incidence and 1985 to 2009 for mortality. The No rdpred Power5 regression model is R ap = (A a + Dp + P p + C c)5 where a, p and c represent age, period and cohort respectively in five-year groups. Input data were aggregated into five-year calendar periods and 18 five-year age groups (described above). Cohorts were created synthetically by subtracting age from period. R ap is the incidence/mortality rate in age group a in calendar period p, A a is the age component for age group a, and D is the common linear drift parameter of period and cohort. (22) Pp is the nonlinear period component of period p, and C c is the nonlinear cohort component of cohort c. Nor dpred uses a goodness of fit test to choose the number of five-year periods to be included in the dataset used for calculating future values (projection base). The so ftware determines whether the average trend across all observed values, or the slope for the last 10 years of observed values, is used for projection, based on a significance test for departure from linear trend. This approach serves as an approximate way of looking for significant changes in the observed trend. The software also allows the user to make this selection. For e ach age group, a minimum of five cases in each five-year period was required; for age groups below this limit, the average number of cases in the last two periods is used to calculate future rates. To al low for a damping of the impact of current trends in the future time periods, a \"cut-trend\" option is used, which is a vector of proportions indicating how much to cut the trend estimate for each five-year projection period. A gradual reduction in the drift parameter of 25% and 50% in the second and third five-year period respectively was used as the default in this publication. Age wa s included in all models as a factor. Age- specific incidence rate trends were then extrapolated to 2014. The predicted numbers of cancer cases in 2014 were calculated by multiplying these extrapolated incidence rates by the sex-, age- and province-specific population projections for the same year. The No rdpred \"recent\" and \"cut-trend\" options were modified from the default values for selected types of cancer, including thyroid cancer incidence and prostate cancer mortality, since recent trends are not expected to continue with as large an annual percent change. The values were chosen so that estimates were consistent with the most recent data available to the provincial cancer registries. Five-year averaging New cases and deaths in 2014 for each type of cancer were also estimated based on the average of the five most recent years of data. This method may be more realistic for cancers for which there are recent changes in trend (the Nordpred Power5 regression model results in poor estimates for these cancers because it is based on a medium- or longer-term trend) or when frequencies are low and result in unstable estimates using the Nordpred model. The average of rates for the most recent five years was calculated for each sex, five-year age group, cancer type and province. The predicted numbers were then obtained by multiplying these rates by the corresponding projected population sizes.Selection of \"best\" estimates Estimates from the two methods were compared for each sex, cancer type and geographic region for all ages combined. The \"best\" estimate for each category was selected in consultation with individual provincial or territorial cancer registries, according to the following guidelines: The No rdpred model was preferred except when frequencies were low. Five-y ear average estimates were used when the average annual number of cases during the most recent five years was less than or equal to 50. Five-y ear average estimates were used for the territories and are reported only for \"all cancers\" because of small sample sizes. The abs olute value of the difference between the age-standardized rates estimated by the two methods was calculated and expressed relative to the five-year average estimate. For example, if the Nordpred Power5 regression model estimated a rate of 4.0 and the five-year average estimated a rate of 4.5, the relative difference would be |4.0 - 4.5| \u00f7 4.5, or 11.1%. Pro vinces closely examined estimates for cancers where the absolute value of the relative difference exceeded 15%. Such situations may be indicative of important deviations from the long-term trend. Pro vinces provided feedback based on the availability of in-house projections, knowledge of local trends or access to more current data, which permitted an assessment of the estimates produced by the two different estimation methods. Est imates for Canada as a whole were computed as sums of the estimates for the individual provinces and territories.APPENDIX II: Data sources and methods113 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Tables A12 and A13 indicate the cancer types that were reported according to the five-year average method for 2014. In these situations, the age-standardized rates for 2014 reported in this publication were calculated using the most recent five years of actual data. All cancers combined Provincial estimates of incidence counts for \"all cancers\" for males were computed as the sum of the \"best\" estimates for prostate cancer and all cancers excluding prostate, as estimated by the Nordpred modelling. Prostate cancer incidence The results of the Nordpred Power5 regression model are not satisfactory for prostate cancer. An annual age-specific trend Power5 projection model was fitted to a minimum of seven and a maximum of nine years of data, as selected by a goodness of fit test. The model is R ap = (A a + D ap)5, where a is age, p is period, A a is the age effect of age group a, and D a is the slope parameter at the ath age group, which takes the differentiation in trend from different 10-year age groups into consideration. New cases of prostate cancer in 2014 were also estimated based on the most recent year of data available. This method may be more realistic when there are recent changes in trend (the age-specific trend model results in poor estimates for prostate cancers because it is based on a medium-term trend). The predicted numbers were then obtained by multiplying these rates by the corresponding projected population sizes.Non-melanoma skin cancer incidence Only a few provinces routinely collect data on the incidence of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (generally referred to as non-melanoma skin cancer, or NMSC). The numbers of NMSC in all of Canada, by sex, were estimated using these data. Coun ts of NMSC for 2002 to 2011 by year, sex and age group were provided by the Alberta Cancer Registry, the Manitoba Cancer Registry, the New Brunswick Cancer Registry and the Newfoundland and Labrador Cancer Registry. Linear regressions using a logarithmic transformation of the annual rates for each province and age group (0-39, 40-59, 60-79 and 80+ years) were conducted and projected to 2014. For Newfoundland and Labrador, data starting from 2006 were used for the projection because of the detection of a change in trend by joinpoint analysis. The predicted numbers of NMSC cases for all of Canada were calculated by multiplying the projected incidence rates for each of the four provinces by the sex- and age-specific Canadian population projections for 2014. Repo rted new cases of NMSC for all of Canada are the average of 2014 estimates from Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador registries.Rounding for reporting Est imates of incidence and mortality presented in this publication have been rounded as follows: Numb ers between 0 and 99 were rounded to the nearest 5. Numb ers between 100 and 999 were rounded to the nearest 10. Numb ers between 1,000 and 1,999 were rounded to the nearest 50. Numb ers greater than or equal to 2,000 were rounded to the nearest 100. Percen tages, age-standardized rates and age-specific rates were rounded to the nearest 10th, except in Tables 2.5, 4.5, A4 and A6, where space restrictions forced rounding to the nearest whole number. Age-s pecific and sex-specific numbers or rates were combined before rounding, so it is possible that the totals in the tables do not add up. However, any such discrepancies are within the precision of the rounding units described above. Est imates of incidence counts presented in Tables 7.7, A1, A3, A7, A8 and Figures 1.3, 7.3 and prevalence counts in Tables 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 7.5, 7.6 and Figures 6.2 and 7.6 have been randomly rounded either up or down to a multiple of 5.APPENDIX II: Data sources and methods114 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Precision of 2014 estimates Estimates of precision (standard errors, coefficients of variation and confidence limits) for 2014 counts and rates are available on request from the Chronic Disease Surveillance and Monitoring Division (Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention, Public Health Agency of Canada). The precision of an estimate depends primarily on the number of observed cases and the population size for each combination of cancer type, age, sex and province or territory. Annual percent change (APC) in cancer incidence and mortality rates The estimated APC was calculated for each cancer type by fitting a piecewise linear regression model, assuming a constant rate of change in the logarithm of the annual ASIR or ASMR in each segment. The models incorporated estimated standard errors of the ASIR or ASMR. The tests of significance used a Monte Carlo Permutation method. The estimated slope from this model was then transformed back to represent an annual percentage increase or decrease in the rate. Join point analysis was applied to annual age- standardized rates over the period of 1986 to 2010 (for incidence) and 1986 to 2009 (for mortality) to determine years in which the APC changed significantly. Such years are referred to as changepoints. A minimum of fi ve years of data before and after a changepoint was required for a new trend to be identified. Thus, the most recent possible changepoint is 2006 for incidence and 2005 for mortality. If no c hangepoint was detected within the periods of 2001 to 2010 (for incidence) or 2000 to 2009 (for mortality), then the APC was estimated by fitting a model within these time periods, in the same way as described above. If a ch angepoint was detected within these decades, then the APC was estimated from the trend in the last segment. Both the changepoint year and the APC for the years beyond the changepoint are indicated in Tables 1.5 and 3.5. Probability of developing or dying from cancer Probabilities of developing or dying from cancer were calculated according to the age- and sex-specific cancer incidence and mortality rates for Canada in 2009 and life tables based on all-cause mortality rates from 2007 to 2009. The methodology used was that of Zdeb (23) and Seidman et al.(24) The met hod used for the probability of developing cancer assumes that current age-specific incidence rates will prevail throughout the future lifetime of a person as he or she advances in age. Since this assumption may not be true, the probabilities should be regarded only as approximations. The pr obability of dying from cancer represents the proportion of people who die of cancer in a cohort subjected to the mortality conditions prevailing in the population at large in 2009. It was estimated by determining the proportion of deaths attributed to specific types of cancer for each sex and age group, multiplying this proportion by the corresponding number of deaths in the life table and summing the life table deaths over all age groups for each sex to obtain the probability of dying from each cause.Potential years of life lost (PYLL) The indicator was calculated by obtaining deaths for ages <1, 1-4, 5-9, . . . 90+ for Canada in 2009 and life expectancy at the midpoints of the age groups. The PYLL is the total number of years of life lost obtained by multiplying, for each age group, the number of deaths by the life expectancy of survivors. (25) Survival Ana lyses were based on all primary cancers. The effect of including multiple cancers in survival analyses has been studied both internationally (26,27) and in Canada.(28) Ana lyses were based on those individuals aged 15-99 years at diagnosis excluding adolescent (15-19 years) bone cancers, which are dissimilar to those diagnosed in older adults. An exception was the analysis of childhood cancers, which was based on children under the age of 15 years at diagnosis. Dea ths of people diagnosed with cancer are identified through record linkage of the CCR to the CVS: D and from information reported by provincial or territorial cancer registries. For deaths reported by a registry but not confirmed by record linkage, it was assumed that the individual died on the date submitted by the reporting province or territory. At the time of the analysis, registration of new cases and follow-up for vital status were complete through December 31, 2008. Pers ons whose diagnosis was established through death certificate only or autopsy only were excluded.APPENDIX II: Data sources and methods115 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014 Rel ative survival ratios (RSRs) were estimated by comparing the actual survival experience of persons diagnosed with cancer to that expected in the general population of people in Canada of the same age, sex, province of residence and time period. They were computed as ratios and expressed as percentages. Ana lyses were based on a publicly available algorithm,(29) with some minor adaptations. Expected survival proportions were derived using the Ederer II approach, (30) from sex-specific provincial life tables produced by Statistics Canada. Only o bserved survival proportions are reported for the analysis of childhood cancers as the estimates of observed and relative survival for the 0-14 year age range are essentially the same. Surv ival analyses were conducted using both period and cohort analysis methods.(31) The period approach to survival analysis provides up-to-date predictions of cancer survival. (32) With this method, follow-up data do not relate to a fixed cohort of people with cancer. Rather, estimates of period survival are based on the assumption that persons diagnosed in the period of interest will experience the most recently observed conditional probabilities of survival. When survival is generally improving, a period estimate tends to be a conservative prediction of the survival that is eventually observed. Con ditional five-year relative survival is calculated as per five-year RSRs but using only the data of people who have already survived specified amounts of time since diagnosis. (33,34) As an in dication of the level of statistical uncertainty in the survival estimates, confidence intervals formed from standard errors estimated using Greenwood's method (35) are provided. To avoid implausible lower limits less than zero or upper limits greater than one for observed survival estimates, asymmetric confidence intervals based on the log (-log) transformation were constructed. RSR confidence limits were derived by dividing the observed survival limits by the corresponding expected survival proportion. Age-s tandardized estimates were calculated using the direct method by weighting age-specific estimates for a given cancer to the age distribution of persons diagnosed with that cancer from 2001 to 2005. Confidence intervals for age-standardized RSRs were formed by multiplying the corresponding age-standardized observed upper and lower limits by the ratio of the age-standardized relative survival point estimate to the age-standardized observed survival point estimate.Prevalence The primary type of prevalence reported in this publication is tumour-based. Two-, five- and 10-year limited duration prevalence estimates are based on the number of cancers diagnosed in the previous two, five and 10 years among people who are alive. Estimating prevalence requires current, accurate information about both the incidence and vital status of cases. Because of issues in correctly ascertaining the vital status of persons diagnosed while residing in Quebec, the following approach was used: Can cer site-, sex- and age-specific limited duration, tumour-based, prevalence estimates for all of Canada, excluding Quebec, were determined directly using the counting method. (36,37) Specifically, all primary invasive cancers (including in situ bladder cancers) diagnosed among persons residing outside of Quebec in the relevant time period and alive on January 1, 2009, were counted, regardless of whether they were first or subsequent primaries. Sex- an d age-specific population estimates for January 1, 2009, were derived by averaging the 2008 and 2009 mid-year population estimates for all of Canada, excluding Quebec. Can cer site-, sex- and age-specific limited duration prevalence proportions for all of Canada, excluding Quebec, were then estimated by dividing counts by the appropriate population estimates. Can cer site-, sex- and age-specific counts for all of Canada, including Quebec, were then obtained by applying the prevalence proportions to Canadian sex- and age-specific population estimates, which included Quebec, and then summing across the strata.APPENDIX II: Data sources and methods116 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014 Pers on-based limited duration prevalence counts are estimated as the number of individuals represented in the tumour-based limited duration prevalence counts. For example, a person diagnosed with two primary cases of cancer A and one of cancer B in the 10 years preceding the index date would be counted once under cancer A, once under cancer B and once under all cancers combined for 10-year person-based prevalence. In terms of 10-year tumour-based prevalence, the same person would contribute twice to cancer A, once to cancer B and three times to all cancers combined. Age-s pecific prevalence estimates were obtained using the age attained as of January 1, 2009. The indirect approach for estimating cancer prevalence in Quebec is different from that employed in previous versions of this publication. The current approach's primary assumption is that sex- and age-specific limited duration cancer prevalence proportions, calculated using cancer cases and population estimates from all of Canada excluding Quebec, are an accurate estimate of cancer prevalence proportions within Quebec.Data and methods issues Incidence Although the Canadian Council of Cancer Registries and its Standing Committee on Data Quality make every effort to achieve uniformity in defining and classifying new cancer cases, reporting procedures and completeness still vary across the country. The standardization of case-finding procedures, including linkage to provincial or territorial mortality files, has improved the registration of cancer cases and comparability of data across the country. Some specific issues remain: Benign t umours and carcinomas in situ are not routinely captured or reported except for in situ carcinomas of the bladder. All cancer registries except Ontario report in situ bladder cancers to the CCR. There m ay be under-reporting of cancer cases in Newfoundland and Labrador due to incomplete linkage of cancer data with death data. This under-reporting could result in death counts or rates exceeding those for incidence in a specific year; this especially affects highly fatal cancers. The number of \"death certificate only\" (DCO) cases for 2008 to 2010 in Newfoundland and Labrador was estimated from 2007 data. In Que bec, cases diagnosed through DCO are incompletely captured prior to 2000. In addition, because of the registry's dependence on hospital data for the period included in the present report, the numbers of cases of some cancers are underestimated, particularly for those where pathology reports represent the main source of diagnostic information. Prostate cancer, melanoma and bladder cancer are affected in particular. (38) The 2014 estimates for these sites may be an underestimate because an increase in cases in the registry is expected with the inclusion of pathology reports starting with 2011 data. The num ber of DCO cases for 2010 in Quebec was estimated from the average of 2005 to 2009 data. The num ber of DCO cases for 2008, 2009 and 2010 in Ontario was estimated from the average of 2003 to 2007 data. The num ber of DCO cases is less than 2% of total cases. Non-m elanoma skin cancers are excluded since most provincial and territorial cancer registries do not collect information on these cases. These cancers are difficult to register completely because they may be diagnosed and treated in a variety of settings and are very numerous. Estimates based on four registries that include these cancers (see Non-melanoma skin cancer incidence above) are therefore likely to be underestimates.APPENDIX II: Data sources and methods117 Canadian Cancer Society n Canadian Cancer Statistics 2014Mortality Although procedures for registering and allocating cause of death have been standardized both nationally and internationally, some lack of specificity and uniformity is inevitable. The description of cancer type provided on the death certificate is usually less accurate than that obtained by the cancer registries from hospital and pathology records. Although there have been numerous small changes in definitions over the years (see Tables A11-1 and A11-2), there is one major earlier change of note: In th e versions of this publication published before 2003, mortality due to colorectal cancer was based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), (39) codes 153-154, to be consistent with other publications. However, this underestimates colorectal cancer mortality by about 10% because most deaths registered as ICD-9 code 159.0 (intestine not otherwise specified) are cases of colorectal cancer. Sta rting in the 2003 edition, these deaths were included in the definition of colorectal cancer. As a consequence, mortality figures for colorectal cancer appearing in this publication cannot be directly compared with those appearing in publications prior to 2003.Survival Cases diagnosed in the province of Quebec were excluded from survival analyses, in part because the method of ascertaining the date of diagnosis of cancer cases in this province clearly differed from that of the other provincial cancer registries (40) and because of issues in correctly ascertaining the vital status of cases. Prevalence Because of issues in correctly ascertaining the vital status of persons diagnosed while residing in Quebec, prevalence data for this province were determined indirectly (see the Methods section above). Prevalence estimates were derived using the corresponding observed prevalence proportion calculated for the rest of Canada, stratified on age group, sex and cancer type.References 1.
