AT ECSU, BECAUSE WILLIMANTIC IS A SMALL CO MMUNITY, MANY OF THEIR REFERRING RELATIONSHIPS OCCUR BY DEFAULT. WINDHAM COMMUNITY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IS LOCATED A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE HEALTH SERVICE AND FROM EASTERN'S CAMPUS. A NUMBER OF MEDI CAL PROVIDERS HAVE OFFICES IN THE DIRECT VICINITY OF THE HOSPITAL.

Non-Participating Providers providing covered services are compensated on a fee for service basis.Aetna Pharmacy Management negotiates discounts from independent Pharmacies, chain Pharmacies, and mail order vendors who accept our reimbursement rates for dispensing andingredient costs in return for volume business. Our negotiated discounts are passed in full to ourPlan sponsors. The reimbursement formula is based on Average Wholesale Price (AWP) less a negotiated discount, plus a dispensing fee. The dispensing fee is a contractual fee negotiated between AetnaPharmacy Management and the Network Pharmacy. The negotiated rate self-renews each year,unless it is changed contractually. Where the Covered Person is responsible for a Coinsurance payment based on a percentage of the bill, the member 's obligation is to be determined on the basis of the charges established by contract, if any, rather than on the basis of the Provider 's billed charges.36Pre-Authorization Requirements and Grievance Procedures All inpatient admissions must be Pre-Certified by contacting Chickering Claims Administrators, Inc. Aetna Life Insurance Company evaluates and determines the appropriateness of medical careresources utilized by their Covered Persons. To accomplish these goals, Aetna Life InsuranceCompany has developed a comprehensive Patient Management Program. The populationdemographics of the membership and the program 's results are reviewed to determine the need for changes. Regional medical directors in concert with local market medical directors review thisinformation to initiate new program development or to enhance current programs. The PatientManagement Program is reviewed annually. Only Medical Directors make decisions denying coverage for services for reasons of Medical Necessity. All such Patient Management determinations are communicated both by telephone andin writing. Decisions on appeals are made in a timely manner, as required, by the urgency of thesituation. Pre-Authorization decisions are made within two business days; emergent decisions aremade immediately; concurrent decisions are made within one business day; and retrospectivedecisions are made within 30 days of the receipt of appropriate information. If subspecialty reviewis required, the Focused Review process takes approximately 10 business days.

Coverage denial letters delineate any unmet criteria standards and guidelines, and inform the provider and Covered Person of the appeal process. The actual components of the Aetna Patient Management Plan include the following and apply for all products: Inpatient Service Authorization Registration of Inpatient Services Inpatient Pre-Certification Concurrent Review Discharge Planning Care Management Retrospective Review Medical Loss Ratio The anticipated medical loss ratio, or percentage of total premium revenue that will be spent on medical care for student health coverage for the calendar year ending on December 31, 2006 , is 77.5%.

The dispensing fee is a contractual fee negotiated between AetnaPharmacy Management and the Network Pharmacy. The negotiated rate self-renews each year,unless it is changed contractually.

Aetna Life Insurance Company evaluates and determines the appropriateness of medical careresources utilized by their Covered Persons. To accomplish these goals, Aetna Life InsuranceCompany has developed a comprehensive Patient Management Program. The populationdemographics of the membership and the program's results are reviewed to determine the need forchanges. Regional medical directors in concert with local market medical directors review thisinformation to initiate new program development or to enhance current programs. The PatientManagement Program is reviewed annually. Only Medical Directors make decisions denying coverage for services for reasons of Medical Necessity. All such Patient Management determinations are communicated both by telephone andin writing. Decisions on appeals are made in a timely manner, as required, by the urgency of thesituation. Pre-Authorization decisions are made within two business days; emergent decisions aremade immediately; concurrent decisions are made within one business day; and retrospectivedecisions are made within 30 days of the receipt of appropriate information.
