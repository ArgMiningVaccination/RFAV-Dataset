We don't have any 'inside information' but suspect that there will still be density requirements indoors for some time. Are the density quotients in SISfm maps still current or will they be updated to reflect the new rules after Nov 5Density Would the maximum occupancy per office will be recalculated and display on the system? Density In line with the previous question, what is full and will these capacity limits be reflected in SisFM?Density Would the maximum occupancy per office will be recalculated and display on SISfm? Density Will the density restrictions be higher in buildings with no or local ventilation? Density It is not expected that the density limits will need to be more stringent in buildings with local or no ventilation, but we will continue to review these spaces on a case-by-case basis. Who will advise the wider University community on how to manage COVIDSafe events moving forward?Events Will all public events need to be registered with the DHHS moving forwards, regardless of how many people are attending?Events What 'Monash' approvals will be required for groups to deliver events on campus post 5 November?Events Will areas need to register their events with DHS under their tier program for events on campus post 5 November?Events We have events in late November inviting under 18 year olds on campus. Will we require them to be vaccinated to visit? Will we have a differing approach for under 16 y.o.s?Events If it isn't covered in this session I would like to hear how we should be running activities and events on campus.Events What will the position be on vaccinations for public events held on campus? Events Will there be tools provided to the hundreds of staff who run events to ensure the event is COVID-safe, including but not limited to required use of Service Vic check in app.---Events Are there any procedures for staff and students attending in-person events off-campus, e.g. conferences.Events How practical is it to plan an event with 50 staff on campus at the end of Nov? Events What will happen if buildings are considered Tier 1? Will they be closed and everyone asked to 14 day quarantine even after vaccination reuirements are in place.Exposure sites The Victorian Government has recently announced some changes to how exposure sites are managed (including the removal of Tier 2 and 3 exposure sites from their webpage) and has announced that there will be some changes for the length of quarantine required for fully vaccinated persons. We expect that these requirements will continue to change as the vaccination levels increase. Is there a limit on the amount of time you can wear a mask on campus?? Masks At the current time, a mask is required indoors and outdoors at all times when outside your home. The current Victorian Government roadmap indicates that masks will not be required when outdoors from November 5, but the Chief Health Officer Directions will need to be updated to formally permit this. Further information will be provided when it is available. With the additional requirement that authorised workers need to be vaccinated, will new permits be issued or can people continue using their existing permits?Permits Will there be new authorised worker permits or can everyone continue to use their existing permit?Permits Will supervisors be informed if a student or staff member fails to be given a new essential worker permit due to non-vaccination?Permits The university will manage the mandatory vaccination requirements for staff and students and put in place either building access controls or COVID marshals to ensure appropartely vaccinated staff and students are entering our buildings. are there any plans in place to manage return to work for the vaccine-hesitant, people who have medical reasons for not being vaccinated or simply those staff and students who may not yet be comfortable returning to campus?Return to work We are following the Victorian Government requirements regarding what vaccination levels are required for different personnel types (eg Authorised Workers, construction workers, aged care workers, healthcare workers) to attend their workplace. At the current time there is no information available regarding return to work for unvaccinated persons. Given the dynamic nature of the current state of vaccinations, reactivation etc, is it possible to consider regular senior updates as we did last year?Senior mgr. updates Request for regular senior leader updates like there were last year. Senior mgr. updates All platforms will need to ensure that all staff, students and visitors (including contractors) attending campus are double vaccinated after the state reaches the 80% double vaccinated threshold. We understand this will be managed with the Services Victoria app and supported by new signage. Will staff be expected to confirm vaccination status or will we rely on the honesty of individuals?Vaccination / access / essential workers How do we manage at a local level proof of vaccination for essential workers Vaccination / access / essential workers What if you don't want to attach your personal data from MyGov or download Medicare app to your work mobile device? Will we need to use personal devices to prove vaccination to attend work and buildings?Vaccination / access Will the current proof or vaccination pdf be replaced with something with a QR code to check into places?Vaccination / access How to verify staff and students fully vaccinated, is it by barcode scanning at entry point and the expectation is to have your COVID-19 vaccination certificate available in your Service Victoria app?Vaccination / access Will Monash staff members have to sight vaccination information for students and also visitors they bring to campus? or are we relying on the Service Victoria app?Vaccination / access Not sure if this is the appropriate forum for this question, but with regard to the requirement for all staff, students and visitors requiring double vaccination before entering a Monash site - how are we going to enforce this rule? For example, if meeting with external stakeholders, will it be up to the individual Monash staff member / host to sight the guest's vaccination status or exemption letter before the meeting?Vaccination / access In general, how are we enforcing the vaccination rules for staff, students and visitors? How is it being checked?Vaccination / access Would the policing of contractor vaccinations be managed by Monash or do we have to check their status everytime they come in? How about delivery drivers and those who drop off parcels etc?Vaccination / access How will the University be checking the vaccination status of visitors and contractors? Vaccination / access When will Monash request a copy of the Vaccination Certificates and who will check them and where will they be stored/saved.Vaccination / access Is student and staff vaccination status being looked after completely by the University or is there some onus on individual supervisors to know if their staff and students are vaccinated? Will supervisors be informed if a student or staff member fails to be given a new essential worker permit due to non-vaccination?Vaccination / access Will people have their building access revoked if unvaccinated? Vaccination / access This is currently being reviewed. There is the potential that your security access will be revoked if your vaccination status is not in accordance with the Government requirements. How are the vaccination requirements being broadcast to students (nothing to engineering students as yet)?Vaccination / access As noted, Authorised Worker Permit holders are the only persons permitted to access the campus at the current time and they have already asked for their vaccination records. Additional information regarding the requirements for persons from November 5 will be circulated shortly. It is a Victorian Government requirement that all persons attending campus or working on site be double vaccinated in order to attend campus from November 5. Should we keep a local record of sighting visitors' vacc status? Vaccination / access We will advise if this is necessary when the updated Chief Health Officer Directions are released.Currently this is being looked after at a University level, by ensuring Authorised Workers are meeting the Government vaccination requirements and with the use of security personnel and marshals. HR is also collecting vaccination records for staff; Student Services are managing this process for students. If you are inviting someone to campus, viewing their Authorised Worker status and vaccination record is a quick way of proving that they are eligible to be on campus. Contractors engaged by BPD are completing a vaccination declaration through SINE and have been informed that the vaccination records for their employees may be checked on campus or in an audit. To assist Faculties and Departments who engage contractors, an electronic copy of the above declaration has been circulated for use. In order for anyone to work, including Delivery Drivers, they need to be complying with the Victorian Government vaccination requirements. In order to enter a building and deliver a parcel the individual will need to comply with the vaccination requirements and scan in using the Service Victoria QR code.OHS COVID Informatin Session - 14 October 2021 FAQs The information in SISfm is accurate at the current time. We don't know what the Government will announce in future, but suspect that the density limits will stay at 1 person per 4 square metres for the immediate future. As the vaccination levels increase, the Government may alter the density requirements. We are waiting and watching for the latest Government requirements. We anticipate that masks will be required inside and that there will be vaccination requirements, density limits and caps on numbers. Unfortunately we are unable to confirm what these requirements will be until the Government announces further information. Yes, this information will be summarised and provided on the Monash University COVID update page as soon as it is available. The existing Authorised Worker Permits which were issued are still valid, but in addition your vaccination information needs to be uploaded to the portal. (Authorised Workers will have received an email about this during the week commencing 11/10/21). Yes. Monash University Authorised/Permitted Workers have been asked to upload a copy of their vaccination certificate to a special Monash portal, during the week commencing 11/10/21. It is anticipated that this request will be extended to all Monash staff and students in the near future. People who do upload valid evidence will have their Authorised Worker permit revoked until this evidence is provided. The Victorian Government has recently introduced the ability for people to attach their vaccination certificate to the \"Service Victoria\" app as an easy way to prove your vaccination status upon arrival at venues including schools, work, shops and restaurants. If you don't want to link your record to this app, or don't have a smartphone you may print out a hard copy of your vaccination record and show this instead. OHS COVID Information Session - 14 Oct 2021 Author: Health, Safety Wellbeing 1Question Category ANSWER How are off campus sites expected to monitor when they don't rely on MPass to access their areas?Vaccination / access Yes access to buildings and spaces will need to be in line with the governement vaccination requirements. Local procdures will need to be developed for rural and remote sites with out building access control systems. Please engage with OHS in establsihing these processes Can the COVID Vaccine not \"take\"? I've gone through 3 complete Hep B immunisation processes, but still don't have Hep B protection. Can this be tested in relation to COVID?Vaccination Hepatitis B is one vaccine where people need to have a particular level of antibody respoonse. About 4% of people never achieve this level of antibodies and so other control measures are introduced to protect them. There has been some evidence that antibody levels from some covid vaccines decreases over time, but checking everyone's antibody levels is probably not the best option at the current time. There is further research underway globally. For those of us that are first-aiders does COVID change expectation of care? Specifically around resuscitation.Vaccination The current Australian Resuscitation Council advice regarding CPR is that - don't go really close to the patient to check for signs of life - if you watch and see they are not breathing or they are not breathing normally, start chest compressions. Compression-only CPR (no breaths) is currently recommended. Persons completing compressions need to wear a mask. Wash hands thoroughly once provided. Completing CPR doubles the chances of someone surviving to be discharged from hospital. You can see a short video on the ARC webpage explaining these changes here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4456QsFjNs&t=260s. Refer to the OH&S guideline, COVID-19 and Providing First Aid, for further details. We will include this for discussion at the next First Aider / Defib update in November 2021. If you have a medical exemption are you allowed on campus? Statements seem to say you must be vaxxed to be on campus.Vaccination If you have a valid medical exemption, you are permitted to come to campus. Evidence of this exemption needs to be provided. Of course, all other COVID safe strategies need to be followed (including masks and physical distancing) and at the current time an Authorised Worker Permit is also required. Younger people under 18 attending campus in late November, vacc requirement? Vaccination We are following the Government requirements. At this stage the requirements for mandatory vaccination tend to be for persons over 18 years only, but of course this situation could change. Further information should be avaialble closer to your event date. Of course, even if vaccination is not mandatory, the other COVID safe strategies still apply. What is the advice on recognition of vaccines received overseas? Vaccination / International What is the advice re vaccinations of staff/students who recieved vaccination overseas Vaccination / International For International students already on site with non-approved vaccines, can they remain on campus?Vaccination / International For those staff who are offsite (211 Wellington for example) what processes are there relating to ventilation at this building? Will this be communicated to enable safe return to workVentilation - The ventilation system in building 235B is not up to standard. - That would also include the portables behind MSDI - Bld 27 level 2 should be on this list - Paul we have staff offices also in 79P - Building 230 (264 FTG Road) ventilation is extremely poor - Ventilation in the Northern Pavillion? - Building 262 - MCHRI - Kanooka Grove? - Offsite buildings where staff are located ie. Monash Medical Centre - Building 261 and 262Ventilation Will the University look at HVAC in off-campus leased spaces? Ventilation What steps are being put in place for Monash sites that are rented from others. Eg: Omnico business park on FTG Road??Ventilation Just wondering if there are plans to do similar things at our other campus locations eg Gippsland :-)Ventilation For offsite buildings such as 211 Wellington Road, how do we determine what type of ventilation we have, and what, if any, control Monash has on these systemsVentilation Is there an audit of Rural Health Offices/Sites? Ventilation Will the University look at HVAC in off-campus leased spaces? Ventilation For offsite buildings such as 211 Wellington Road, how do we determine what type of ventilation we have, and what, if any, control Monash has on these systemsVentilation Will the rented building spaces be bought upto spec? Ventilation ERDA have staff at 710 Blackburn Rd. Can you please advise post meeting re G.02 710 Blackburn Rd?Ventilation If spaces cannot be occupied as have inadequate local ventilation to whom are we contacting for alternate sites?Ventilation Spot checking and ensuring we comply are all discussing processes on campuses (security checking and spot checks) but what about for Monash leased spaces.Ventilation What changes are going to be made to spaces with no existing ventilation? I.e. Residential Village buildingsVentilation Monash Residential Services have introduced requirements for student rooms, including occupancy limits and mask wearing. Can we find out the ventilation system types of different buildings? Ventilation Buildings with multiple systems and/or no systems - will BPD provide a status to departments? Ventilation Should we have signage to alert to ventilation system for each building - eg colour code to alert OHS staff and workers on risk status.Ventilation How many air changes per hour will be implemented? Research has shown that a minimum of 6 p/h is recommended.Ventilation The air change rates is not the key factor to consider. It is the percentage of outside air provided that is critical to dilute indoor contaminates and 10 litres per sec per person is the Aust Std setting we are meeting or exceeding. Are type 3 buildings able to be purged also? Ventilation No, unfortunately the ventilation plant and equipment for fixed outside air systems is unable to deliver fresh air purges. The equipment was not designed to do this. These systems were designed to provide 10 litres/sec/person outside air and we are finding that they are in reality delivering over this amount. With decreased occupancy levels the systems are delivering well over the design air flows. What is the rating of our filters? Ventilation It depends upon the intial plant and equipment design as to the type of filter specified for the ventilation equipment. Often it is not possible to 'upgrade' the filters as this restricts airflow in to the ventilation system. The filters in place are being regularly maintained. Can we consider air purifier units for shared offices in type 4 buildings? Ventilation We may consider some units for particular locations, but our priority is to introduce outside air. Does having open windows in an area undermine the effectiveness of the air circulation system? We have meeting rooms where the air system is disabled if the windows are opened.Ventilation There certainly is a balance between the amount of outside air introduced and the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. Where there are interlocks installed this will be considered as part of the review of the ventilation system. Will the cleaning regimes in offices be extended to include ceiling/wall air intake vents Ventilation No. We are not seeing any evidence that this is of concern from COVID perspective. There is focus on ensuring the filtration system is cleaned and maintained. Will we be given the tools to monitor CO2 levels locally in offices or venues? Or will we have to purchase these ourselves?Ventilation The CO2 sensors which are built in to our buildings feed information back in to building management system. BPD has some CO2 monitoring equipment that can be used to complete spot checks of spaces and is purchasing additional equipment. Is that tested at a building level or office level? Our building is an older one and the airflow varies dramatically from room to roomVentilation The checks which are being completed are of the installed ventilation systems. To make everything more complicated, sometimes parts of buildings have been refurbished and have different systems to other parts of the same building.In addition to looking at the main four campus locations we are also checking off campus locations, including making enquiries regarding non-Monash owned buildings. Typically, if you are in a large office building these systems will be of the first three types we looked at. Thanks for the information regarding the individual buildings of concern; we will ensure they are checked too. Where spaces are deemed to be not appropriate for their current use, BPD will work with the area/faculty/department to either find appropriate space or improve the current space. BPD is working to provide summaries to faculties and departments noting any spaces of concern and adding information to SISfm. There probably won't be signage displayed, but this can be a discussion between BPD and the departments. The information will be provided in SISfm. Ventilation systems are one of nine covid safe strategies; please remember that all of the other control measures also need to be implemented (just because a ventilation system is \"type 1\" doesn't mean that all of the other covid safe measures Vaccine registration is overseen by the TGA (Theraputic Goods Association) in Australia. There are four vaccines currently approved for use in Australia (and hence recognised for persons overseas) - Pfizer (Comirnaty-BNT162b2), further information available here https://www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccine-provisional-registrations The TGA also recognises some vaccines which have been provided overseas - there are currently two on the list - Coronavac (Sinovac) and Covishield (Astra Zeneca). Anticipate that more will be added in future. There is further information available here OHS COVID Information Session - 14 Oct 2021 Author: Health, Safety Wellbeing 2 "}
