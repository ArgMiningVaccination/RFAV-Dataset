So why don't people get vaccinated? [variety of reasons](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3133255/coronavirus-vaccine-bubble-incentives-arent?module=inline&pgtype=article). Concerns over vaccine safety and side effects are the fault of governments around the world pausing vaccinations for infinitesimal side-effect risks on the principle of an \"abundance of caution\", rather than taking a \"balance of risk\" approach, while the media carried scare reports of deaths after vaccination, which exaggerated their occurrence. It didn't help that French President Emmanuel Macron early on threw shade at the AstraZeneca vaccine, irresponsibly and incorrectly. All this led to understandable hesitancy. [Covid-19 vaccines](https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/coronavirus-vaccine?module=inline_auto&pgtype=article)are overwhelmingly positive, as the experience of highly vaccinated countries is showing. Everyone ought to be lining up to get their jabs. Our family is fully vaccinated, and we confirm the experience of writers to these pages that the process is simple, friendly and efficient. There is really no excuse for not getting the jabs, but many remain \"hesitant\". One way to improve uptake is to make life more convenient for those of us who are vaccinated (and to stare down those who cry \"discrimination\" at any attempt to encourage uptake). For example, the government could do away with the mask mandate entirely. Those of us who are vaccinated don't have to worry - the risk is not zero, but is extremely small. Those who are unvaccinated have a simple choice: get vaccinated! It's free, easy and effective. Or take the risk. Wear a mask if you wish. But do not expect those of us who are vaccinated to keep wearing masks because you refuse a simple and effective vaccination. Why should we who have done the right thing have to keep considering those who refuse to do the same? This move could boost our vaccination rate. The world has vaccinated 1.4 billion people. It's high time hesitant Hongkongers get the jabs. Peter Forsythe, Discovery Bay Domestic helpers not to blame for failed Covid-19 policy [compulsory testing order](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3133703/coronavirus-domestic-workers-queue-outside?module=inline&pgtype=article)(\"Domestic workers queue up outside testing centres across Hong Kong, braving scorching heat\", May 17). Where in the world has the transmission of the coronavirus been dependent on someone's nationality or ethnicity? Yet again this group is being made [a scapegoat](https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3132149/dont-treat-helpers-scapegoats-hong-kongs-struggling-vaccine-drive?module=inline&pgtype=article)for the failings of the government's virus-response policies. One can only imagine the indignation government officials and their supporters would feel if they were similarly lumped together as one homogenous group labelled \"risky\" just because of who they were and what demographic subset or class they belonged to and socialised with. [Don't treat helpers as scapegoats for Hong Kong's struggling vaccine drive](https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3132149/dont-treat-helpers-scapegoats-hong-kongs-struggling-vaccine-drive?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) [refugees](https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3133490/hong-kong-immigration-bill-baseless-rhetoric-refugees-only-hurts?module=inline&pgtype=article)or foreign domestic helpers - for their own shortcomings. By doing so, they show their ignorance and bigotry. One day, the government and these legislators will start to realise that this city is kept afloat by foreign domestic helpers - perhaps when they do, they'll begin to treat them with respect, not contempt. In most of the world, people are clamouring to get vaccinated, whereas in Hong Kong we have an abundance of vaccines yet only a minority want them. That is a huge \"achievement\" that the government is wholly responsible for, yet nobody ever resigns or admits they've made a mistake - why is that? The health secretary's policies show ignorance of the way people live, work and socialise. She should step down now before she does any more damage. Lee "}
