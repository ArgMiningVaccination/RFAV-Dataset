Progressive renal function loss is a common pheno- menon in renal failure, irrespective of the underlying cause of the kidney disease. Most chronic nephropathies lack a specific treatment and progress relentlessly to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) which prevalence thereof is increasing worldwide (Locatelli et al. 2001; Moeller et al. 2002). CRF patients are almost invariably hypertensive (Ridao et al. 2001), have acquired combined hyperlipidemia a (Beto and Bansal 1998), profound oxidative stress (OxS) (Annuk et al. 2001), and decreased physical activity and increased psychosocial problems. If patients choose to smoke, the additive risk is profound (Orth and Ritz 2002). Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for both cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and CRF (Ritz et al. 1999). Moreover, CRF patients are becoming older and are often menopausal (Wenger 1998; Jang et al. 2001; Shlipak et al. 2001). Finally, renal patients have a dramatic tendency for vascular and cardiac calcification, pro- bably al. 2003). Also, the risk of atherosclerotic CV D in patients with CRF, especially in patients on renal replacement therapy, h as shown to be 10-20 times greater than in the general population (Foley et al. 1998; Levey et al. 1998; Luft 2000; Eknoyan et al. 2001; Sarnak et al. 2002). Experimental studies have shown that lipid abnorm alities can influence the progression of renal disease and lipid pe roxidation (LPO) has been increased in animal and human glomerular diseases (Nath et al. 1990; Schrier et al. 1994; Annuk et al. 2001). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased production in nephron leads to renal tissue elevated LPO. Profound LPO in vessels and later development of atherosclerotic lesions play a central role in the progression of the pathology (Ross 1999). Uraemia is associ ated with the generation of profound OxS, which has impact on highly rapid development of atherosclerosis and is related with consequences in targ et organs (Galle 2001; Himmelfarb et al. 2002). Reduction of both the traditional atherosclerosis risk factors as well as specific factors related to chronic renal fa ilure should be one of the main targets of early management of patients with chronic renal disease (Sarnak and Levey 2000; Taal and Brenner 2001; Ritz et al. 2002). The National Kidney Foun- dation Task Force recommendations stress the importance of preventive measures for renal patients, early in the course of kidney failure, when these can be most effective, cost efficient, and of greatest benefit to patients and to society (Ismail et al. 1998; Meyer and Levey 1998). The notion of renoprotection is developing into a combined approach to renal diseases; the main goals are control of blood pressure and reduction of proteinuria (Grimm et al. 1997; Ruggenenti et al. 2001; Praga and Morales 2002). 10Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocking agents have been proved to be vaso- and renoprotective and, therefore, suggested not only for anti-hyper-tensive but also for vaso- and cardio-protective purposes in chronic glomerular diseases with and without systemic (Ruilope 1997; Cruickshank Fournier et al. 2002; a potent stimu- lator of OxS and renin-angiotensin sy stem blocking agents may reduce the profound OxS in the body (Donmez et al. 2002; Agarwal 2003). How different RAS blocking agents implicate OxS levels in blood, urine and kidney tissue needs still further investigation. As patients with chronic renal disease are considered in the highest risk group of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, all beneficial cardio-vascular rehabilitation strategies should be included in their management, in addition to pharmacological renoprotective therapies (Ots et al. 2000) in order to retard the development of risk fact ors for CVD and stabilise renal functioning for a longer period of time (Oberley et al. 2000). Preventive measures should be undertaken as early as possible. The care of CRF patients cannot start in the period of ESRD or after the initiation of dialysis, but should be set in motion when progressive renal disease is diagnosed and renal failure first begins. Therapy that diminishes the activity of the renin-angiotensin system and the sympathetic nervous system could possibly stabilise kidney functioning (Ritz et al. 1998; Amann et al. 2001; Orth et al. 2001; Augustyniak et al. 2002). Aerobic exercise, of moderate intensity, is associated with beneficial hemodynamic response and reduction of sympathetic activity (Brown et al. 2002; Gajek and Zysko 2002; Svarstad et al. 2002). Some experimental studies have shown that exercise in a wate r environment could improve renal functioning and even slow the progression rate (Heifets et al. 1987; Osato et al. 1990). Land-based exercise studies have not yet shown a benefit on renal function neither in clinical (Eidemak et al. 1997) nor in experimental studies (Averbukh et al. 1992; Bergamaschi et al. 1997). Exercise therapy for renal patients is usually taken with precauti on because of exaggerated renal vaso- constriction during exercise (Clorius et al. 2002). There is still much effort needed to study the mechanisms involved in the progression of kidney diseases to find out the best possible progression preven-tion strategies of combinations of drug interventions and lifestyle changes. The present work consists of studies that evaluate the modulation of OxS parameters in experimental and clini cal progressive renal failure with pharma- cological and non-pharmacological ways of treatment. The experimental part of this thesis investigates the OxS indices in small animals to estimate the changes in OxS grade in blood, urine and kidney tissue using RAS-blocking therapy with losartan and RAS independent beta -blocking therapy with atenolol. The clinical part of the study evaluates the impact of rehabilitation conditioning program on OxS in CRF patients and elucidates the benefits of the conditioning on renal and cardio-respiratory parameters. 112. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE 2.1. General characteristics of progressive renal disease Virtually, renal diseases progress to terminal renal failure (RF) relatively independently of the initial disease. The most common causes of progressive CRF are diabetic nephropathy, chronic glomerular diseases and hypertensive nephrosclerosis (Remuzzi et al. 1997). A primary disease eventually leads to secondary glomerular injury and nephron loss that is clinically characterised by proteinuria, hypertension, a gradual elevation in the plasma creatinine concent-ration and a progressive decline in glom erular filtration rate (GFR) (Jacobson 1991). Various risk factors and mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of RF where participation of the RAS (Wolf et al. 2003), sympathetic overactivity (Johansson et al. 1999; Amann, Koch et al. 2001) and developing of proteinuria play central roles (Schmitz and Vaeth hypertension Hypertrophy of remained nephrons Inappropriate activity of RAS (actions of Ang II) Systemic hypertension Chronic inflammation RENAL FIBROSIS Interstitial fibrosis Proteinuria Figure 1. Pathogenesis renin-angiotensin system; AngII \u2014 angiotensin II 12In the great majority of cases, progression to ESRD occurs slowly over a period of several to many years. Proteinuria is the earliest clinical marker of hemodynamically mediated glomerular injury (Peterson et al. 1995). The findings that greater proteinuria and significant hypertension are independent predictors of accelerated progression of renal dysfunction are confirmed previously (Hunsicker et al. 1997; Ruggenenti et al. 1998). Although the underlying renal disease often cannot be treated, the progression of chronic renal disease greatly depends on systemic and intra-glomerular hypertension, dyslipidemia, OxS and development of glomerular damage and therapeutic interventi ons suppressing these factors may be successful in slowing the progression rate of CRF, regardless of the initiating cause. 2.2. Risk factors of premature atherosclerotic complications in chronic renal disease In addition to classical risk factors of premature atherosclerotic complications for all population (aging, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, physical inactivity) patients with CRF have specific risk factors: inappropriate activity of Ang II, uremic toxicity (including hyperuricemia and hyperphosphatemia), prolonged high-grade OxS, malnutrition, anemia and immunosupressive treatment (Stenvinkel et al. 1999). Psychosocial factors, such as environmental stress and lowere d responsiveness to stress should not go unmentioned (Suh et al. 2002). The progression of atherosclerosis is prescribed previously (Ross 1999; Lusis 2000). The approach to the risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, profound OxS, smoking and physical inactivity should be guided by the principle that chro nic renal disease patients belong in the highest risk group for subsequent atherosclerotic complications (Baigent et al. 2000; Zoccali et al. 2002). 2.2.1. The renin-angiotensin system and pathogenic roles of angiotensin II Angiotensin II (Ang II), the principal peptide of the RAS, is an important factor in mediating glomerular haemodynamics and contributes to the rise of intraglomerular and systemic blood pressure. Although there are numerous mechanisms involved in the process of renal disease progression, however, the RAS plays a crucial role there (Aros and Remuzzi 2002; Wolf, Butzmann et al. 2003). 13Activation of RAS increases the levels of Ang II in the plasma, leading to generalised vasoconstriction and to sa lt and water retention in the kidneys. Simplified RAS is an enzymatic cascade (Fig 2) in which renin acts on angio- tensin to form Ang I and the latter is converted to Ang II by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Ang II interacts with at least two membrane receptors, type 1 (AT 1) and type 2 (AT 2). AT2 receptor AT1 receptor chymase, tonin, cathepsin vasoconstriction, oxidative stress ACEReninAngiotensinogen Angiotensin Angiotensin Figure 2. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The AT 1 receptor is responsible for the majority of the effects of Ang II: vasoconstriction, sodium re-absorption, modulation of OxS, cell proliferation and inflammatory response (Luft 2002; Sun et al. 2002). The AT 2 receptor has a similar structure, but its transduction and function is less known. Probably a certain amount of Ang II can be produced via non-ACE pathways (by chymase, tonin, cathepsin). Therefore, the modulation of level of Ang II is physiologi-cally important and AT 1 receptors are responsible for angiotensin's functional effects (Luft 2002). Ang II is both an endocrine hormone in blood and a paracrine hormone formed in tissue. The paracrine way of RAS is noticed in almost every tissue, especially in brain, cardiac and renal tissue. Most renal AT 1 receptors are exposed to locally produced Ang II rather than to Ang II from circulation. However, both local production and AT 1 receptor-mediated uptake from the circulation contribute to the high levels of Ang II in the kidney (Kim and Iwao 2000; van Kats et al. 2001; van Kats et al. 2001). Ang II may promote renal disease progression by inducing glomerular hypertension, hyperfiltration, glomerul ar hypertrophy (Brenner 1983) and lea- ding to increased systemic blood pressure (Aros and Remuzzi 2002). On the 14other hand, Ang II behaves like a proinf lammatory cytokine, participating in various steps of the inflammatory response: induces expression of monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1, a potent chemokine (Wolf 1998; Kato et al. 1999), osteopontin expression (Yu et al. 2000), proliferation of mesangial and glomerular endothelial cells (Yu 2003) and over-production of transforming growth factor-beta (Shin et al. 2000) contributing to pathological inflammation and fibrosis through the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins (Sun et al. 2000; Mezzano et al. 2001). Ang II increases bitor-1 (Paueksakon et al. 2002) progressive sclerosis (Ma and Fogo 2001). Haugen et al. (2000) and Pueyo et al. (2000) have shown that Ang II is contributing to patholog ically increased OxS level, activating inflammatory mechanisms (Haugen et al. 2000; Pueyo et al. 2000). So, Ang II exerts both hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic effects on the kidney, which are involved in the loss of renal function. 2.2.2. Hypertension Kidney disease may be either a cause or consequence of hypertension and atherosclerotic CVD (Prichard 2003). Hypertension is a significant risk factor for the development of glomerulosclerosis in various etiologies (Klag et al. 1996; Ridao, Luno et al. 2001). According to the data of three large registries covering the United States, Europe, and Australia / New Zealand it appears that hypertension and diseases of the large ar teries constitute the second major cause of RF (Maisonneuve et al. 2000). In Estonia, the prevalence of ESRD caused by hypertension is low, 7% (Lilienthal et al. 2003). Essential hypertension (EH) is a multi-factorial disorder that involve abnormalities in the functions of the heart, the blood vessels, the kidneys and is characterised by significant and persistent elevations in arterial BP (Bakris and Mensah 2002). Primary or EH is diagnosed by exclusion, as the cause of hypertension is not readily definable. Approximately 5-10% of patients have secondary forms of hypertension. Rena l parenchymal disease is the most common pathology associated with h ypertension. Renovascular hypertension due to renal artery stenosis is the most common potentially curable form of hypertension with the help of angioplasty, stenting or surgery. Pathology in endocrine organs causes endocrine hypert ension. The use of medications, oral contraceptives, an excess of alcohol a nd drug abuse cause reversible rises in blood pressure (BP). 15Essential hypertension In the development and maintenance of EH the genes, environment and the gene-environment interactions play key roles. High salt intake influences the formation of EH in approximately 1/3 of hypertensive patients, in so called \"salt-sensitive\" persons. Recently has been shown that high salt diet may via OxS-associated mechanism (including glutathione system) induce endothelial dysfunction in salt-induced experimental hypertension (Bayorh et al. 2004). Apart from a genetic component more women than men and more urbanites than country dwellers are affected by pr imary hypertension. In addition, chronic psychological stress, job-related or pe rsonality-based, can induce hypertension (Kaplan 1998). Increases in the heart rate and stroke vo lume lead to increases in the cardiac output and contribute to increases in arterial BP. Volume status and the level of the total peripheral vascular resistance in combination determine the level of BP. The systemic vascular resistance is influenced by multiple vasoactive mechanisms under the control of local, regional and systemic neural, humoral and renal factors. The tissue arteriol es vasoconstrict to decrease the excessive blood flow. The resulting vasoconstriction raises the peripheral vascular resi- stance, which is cardinal in most consis tent findings in hypertension \u2014 whether essential or secondary in origin. If the peripheral vascular resistance is not appropriately lowered in the face of hypervolemia, hypertension results . The chronic elevations in BP result from comb inations of inappr opriate levels of cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. The kidney is prominent in long-term regulation of BP (Rettig 1993; Mailloux and Haley 1998; Ridao, Luno et al. 2001). The individual changes in cardiac, vascular, or renal function seldom occur separately, and, if so, they may lead to mild or moderate increases in ar terial pressure. Combined alterations in cardiac, vascular, and renal functions are more common and are often associated with pathologic increases in arterial pressure and established hyper- tension (Bakris et al. 2000). The pathophysiological alterations of EH include among others dysregu- lation of arterial compliance and endothelial dysfunction (Taddei et al. 2001), metabolic syndrome and insulin resi stance, elevated OxS (Suematsu et al. 2002), abnormal sympathetic nervous system activation (DiBona 2002), accelerated atherosclerosis, left ventricu lar hypertrophy, and a propensity for increased vascular thrombogenesis et al. 1997; Odama and Bakris 2000). 16Renal parenchymal hypertension Hypertension complicates the clinical cour se of patients with CRF and, if inade- quately controlled, may hasten the dete rioration of renal function (Mailloux 2001). The development of hypertension among chronic renal disease patients involves various subsequent pathogenic factors, like above-mentioned inappro- priate activity of the RAS, increased sympathetic vasodilatation (Rettig a nd The fall in GFR during renal disease increases the prevalence of salt- sensitive hypertension. The latter has r et al. 2004). Renal disease leads to hypertension, which in turn can contribute to the progressive scarring of the kidney thus playing a pathogenic role in progression of renal disease accelerating loss of function of the diseased kidney (Odama and Bakris 2000). Impaired renal sodium excretion, leading to extra-cellular fluid volume expansion, is the most clinic ally important mechanism leading to hypertension in those patients with kidney disease (Hostetter et al. 2001). After the loss of a critical number of nephrons, the remaining nephrons undergo compensatory functional and structural adaptations. During this process, the surviving nephrons lose the capacity to autoregulate glomerular flows and pressures and become vulnerable to the effects of systemic hyper-tension, which is readily accompanied by glomerular hypertension, hyper-filtration and hypertrophy (Hostetter et al. 1982), so contributing to the progression of RF (Fig. 1). Renovascular hypertension Renovascular hypertension is usually caused by atherosclerotic narrowing of the origin of the renal artery and is co mmon among patients with peripheral vas- cular disease, carotid stenosis or hear t failure. Renovascular hypertension must be distinguished from renal artery ste nosis. In true renovascular hypertension, the kidney takes charge of BP and will do what it takes to push blood pressure high enough to force blood through the blocked artery. This can be diagnosed with functional tests that measure glomer ular filtration rate before and after blockade of the RAS system with ACE inhibitors or antagonists of the AT 1- subtype of the angiotensin receptor (AT 1RA). Involvment of oxidative stress has been demonstrated in experimental renovascular hypertension (Lerman et al. 2001; Higashi et al. 2002). 172.2.3. Diabetes The incidence of diabetes mellitus, partic ularly type 2, is increasing in the general population. Similarly, the incidence of patients with diabetes mellitus who develop ESRD has increased concomitantly in the dialysis facility to 44% of patients starting dialysis therapy with diabetes mellitus as their primary diagnosis (Ritz and Tarng 2001). According to the data of three large registries covering the United States, Europe, and Australia / New Zealand it appears that diabetic nephropathy is the main cause of end-stage renal disease in many countries (Maisonneuve, Agodoa et al. 2000). In Estonia, the prevalence of diab etic nephropathy shows increasing ten- dency, remaining in third place after chronic glomerulonephritis and nephritis (Locatelli, D'Am ico et al. 2001; Lilienthal, 2003). Elevated blood glucose causes glomerular hyperfiltration, hypertrophy, and hypertension. Hyperglycaemia induces onset of microalbuminuria both in type 1 and type 2-diabetes (Bakris and Sowe rs 2002). In the general population and among patients with chronic renal disease, CVD is more prevalent among individuals with diabetes than those without diabetes (Lea and Nicholas 2002). Diabetes and hypertension are the key ri sk factors for atherosclerotic compli- cations in chronic renal patients whereas both have OxS-based component in their progression pathophysiology (Touyz al. 2002; Wen et al. 2002). 2.2.4. Pronounced oxidative stress Under normal physiological conditions, the rate and magnitude of reactive species formation is balanced by the ra te of their control/elimination. Gene- ration of oxidative compounds is physiologi cally relevant as an important step in inflammation and tissue repair proce sses, it represents part of the defence mechanisms against invading micro-orga nisms and malignant cells, as well as of tissue healing and remodelling. An imbalance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants results in oxidative st ress (OxS), which has the pathogenic outcome when the production of pote ntially harmful products overwhelms antioxidant capacity/defence (Halliwel l and Gutteridge 1999). The subsequent disturbance of the pro- and anti-oxida nt balance in favour of the former contributes to tissue injury. OxS is monitored indirectly by assay ing products of oxidative damage (such as lipid peroxidation products, adva nced glycation and oxidation lipid and protein products, nucleic acid oxidation de rivates) or antibodies directed against oxidized epitopes (such as anti-oxidized low-density lipoprotein antibodies). On the other hand, to investigate the potential of an organism, tissue, cells or body fluids to withstand OxS-caused further events both enzymatic vitamin C, vi tamin E) can be evaluated (Abuja and Albertini 2001). It has been shown that the overproduc tion of free radicals and other reactive species plays an important role in the pa thophysiology of various experimental and clinical renal diseases (Nath, Cr oatt et al. 1990; Diamond 1994; Galle 2002; Suematsu, et al. 2002; Vaziri et al. 2003). The gene- ral population studies show that prolonged profound OxS is associated with risk factors for premature atherosclerotic complications, most of them linked to abnormalities in lipid metabolism (Trevisan et al. 2001). Several studies indicate that CRF patients are in a state of pronounced OxS (Kitiyakara et al. 2000; Annuk, Zilmer et al. 2001; Boaz et al. 2001; Usberti et al. 2002). One reason for such OxS in pa tients with renal failure is the underlying kidney disease itself. Activation of local tissue RAS, renal anaemia and immunological disorders in the kidney result in an elevated formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) active in the pathogenesis of kidney disease progression. Increased nephron ROS generation leads to renal tissue lipid peroxidation (LPO). An over-activated RA S leads to persistent profound OxS. An interaction between blood pressure, OxS and oxidised lipids (Drueke et al. 2001) is proposed as an important key fact or that could lead to rapid develop- ment of renal and cardiovascular disease (Haugen and Nath 1999; Bolton et al. 2001; Annuk et al. 2003) (Fig.3). DISEASED KIDNEY Inappropriate activity of RAS Aggravation of renal tissue OxS Lipid peroxidation, dysfunction Atherosclerotic cardiovascular complications Renal failure Lipid peroxidation Figure 3. Role of oxidative stress (OxS) in pathogenesis of renal failure 19Increased formation of free radicals leads to an accelerated LPO. Both experimental and clinical studies show that the level of LPO is elevated in CRF (Hasselwander and Young 1998; Mathur al. 2002; MDA and 4-hydroxyno- nenals) are formed. Isoprostanes are also produced upon peroxidation of lipoproteins (Morrow 2000). Glutathione (GSH) plays an important role in the cellular defence against oxidant stress (Ceballos-Picot et al. 1996; Lang et al. to and hydrogen peroxide to their corresponding alchols. Acting as an antioxidant, GSH is oxidised to its disulfide (GSSG). The latter must be rapidly converted back to GSH by glutathione reductase. Hence, the ratio (GSSG/GSH), known as the glutathione redox ratio, may be used to express OxS level in red blood cells and other cells or in blood. In chronic diseases e.g. chronic renal disease, the level of GSH is markedly lowered and the glutathione redox ratio is increased (Lang et al. 2000). Endothelial dysfunction in patients with CRF is a critical component in the systemic vasoconstriction and reduced peripheral perfusion that characterises these patients. Endothelial regulation of v ascular tone is mediated substantially by nitric oxide. Increased OxS in CRF is likely caused by decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide due to reduced expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and increased generation of ROS (Forgione et al. 2002; Vaziri et al. 2002). The decreased vascular relaxation and excessive vasoconstriction lead to significant increases in the peripheral vascular resistance and arterial BP over time, particularly with ageing. The impo rtant role of the endothelium and has been emphasised by Stenvinkel. Endo- thelial dysfunction is thus an important ta rget for future therapy in patients with CRF (Stenvinkel 2003). Because of all above-mentioned reasons, it is plausible that pronounced OxS contributes to the high prevalence of CVD in CRF patients and plays a role in progression of glomerulosclerosis and renal fibrosis. In summary, the common denominators, whereby different risk factors cause atherosclerosis and its consequences in target organs, are elevated OxS, chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. 2.2.5. Sympathetic overactivity In CRF, sympathetic tone is constantly increased and RAS over-activated. Data from experimental and clinical studies show that sympathetic over-activity is triggered by kidneys and resetting itself by stimulation of hypothalamic centres (Rump et al. Campese et et al. 2000; Tinucci et al. 2001; Ye et al. 2002). The damaged kidneys send efferent nerve impulses to the 20central nervous system to increase efferent sympathetic discharge (DiBona 2000). Systemically this sympathetic over-activity contributes to hypertension (Campese and Krol 2002) and cardiovascular complications (DiBona 2001; Rabbia et al. 2001). Locally in the kidney, neur otransmitter release is enhanced, which induces proliferation thereby promoting loss of renal function. Amann et al showed in an experimental study th at sympatholytic agent ameliorated greatly hypertensive nephrosclerosis, ev en in doses, that did not lower BP (Amann et al. 2000). In a clinical trial, sympathetic over-activity was norma- lised during antihypertensive monotherapy with the ACE enalapril, but exacerbated by anti-hypertensive therapy with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, amlodipine (Tuncel et al. 2002). These results imply a potentially important role for the sympathetic nervous system in explaining recent trial data suggesting an added renoprotective effect of antihypertensive agents that block the RAS. Future clin ical trials are needed to determine whether normalisation of sympathetic ac tivity should constitute an important therapeutic goal to improve renal and ca rdiovascular outcomes in patients with CRF. 2.2.6. Dyslipidemia Humoral factors, hyperlipidemia, lipid deposition in vessels and later develop- ment of atherosclerotic lesions play a central role in the progression of prema-ture atherosclerosis in chronic renal disease (Horsch et al. 1981) (Rutkowski et al. 2003). In addition to contributing to CVD, pronounced dyslipidemia may be a risk factor for the progression of renal disease. Dyslipidemia and pro- nounced OxS contribute to premature atherogenesis (Ross 1999). Dyslipidemia of renal disease consists of both qua ntitative and qualitative abnormalities in serum lipoproteins (Crook et al. 2003). Uremic dyslipidemia is mainly characte- rised by (VLDL) (HDL). Plasma total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is rarely elevated in CRF patients (Shoji et al. 2001). The alterations in lipid metabolism and action lead to macrophage activation and infiltration in the kidney with resultant tubulo- interstitial and endothelial cell injury. Hyper lipidemia is also an important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular events in CRF patients, and it requires intervention to avoid or minimise the sequeal of these complications (Kasiske 2003). The reductase inhibitors (statins) are cholester ol-lowering agents that could be well suited to the needs of RF patients (Van Den Akker et al. 2003). Studies have shown the effectiveness of statins in lo wering LDL cholesterol level, slowing down progression of atherosclerosis (Fried et al. 2001), and in decreasing the number of cardiovascular incidents (Tonelli et al. 2003). Many circumstances expose the anti-proliferative, anti-in and even antioxidative 21influence of (McKenney 2003). However, in a recent multi-centre trial among renal transplant recipients, therapy with fluvastatin showed no significant impact on risk reduction of cardiac events (Holdaas et al. 2003). Since the discovery of statins, experiments and clinical studies have been carried out showing other mechanisms of action by these drugs (Elisaf and Mikhailidis 2002; Yamashita et al. 2002; Bianchi et al. 2003; Palmer and Alpern 2003) including their nephroprotective role (Tonelli et al. 2003; Wilson et al. 2003). Future trials will show if there is an effect on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in CRF patients (Fellstrom et al. 2003). The effects of dyslipidemia on the kidn ey are mainly observed in those with other risk factors for renal disease progression such as hypertension, diabetes, and proteinuria (Keane 2001; Yu 2003). Nevertheless, high-grade OxS, LPO and elevated LDL oxidation levels are play ing here a substantial role (Van Tits et al. 2003). 2.2.7. Specific risk factors for uremic patients The uremic syndrome causes the progr essive retention of a large number of compounds, which under normal conditions ar e excreted by the healthy kidneys (Vanholder et al. 2003). They can be conditiona lly called uremic toxins and they contribute to the progression of at herosclerosis in chronic renal disease. About 90 compounds/factors are describe d associated with non-physiological influence. High levels of homocysteine (Block et al. 1998; Suliman et al. 2003), electrolyte imbalance, hyperuricemia and hyperphosphatemia (Locatelli et al. 2002) are the most frequently studied. These compounds induce excessive free radical production by renal tubular cells and activate the inflammatory syndrome associated with the development of CRF (Annuk, Zilmer et al. 2003). 2.3. Progression prevention strategies for chronic renal failure There is a great need to identify comple x strategies that arrest the progression mechanisms that contribute to the atherosclerosis development in CRF regardless of the specific renal disease. The most successful advances today are the randomised controlled studies demonstr ating the reno- and et al. 2001; Brenner et al. 2001; Lewis et al. 2001; Wright et al. 2002). Strategies for risk factor identifi cation and reduction should additionally target both the traditional risk factors, including physical inactivity, and specific risk factors related to chronic renal di sease. A multiple-risk-factor intervention 22is suggested (Levey et al. 2003), so that the individual patient could have the proven therapies and best counselling suitable for his personal needs and stage of disease. 2.3.1. Renin-angiotensin system blockade Studies on experimental (Ots et al. 1998) and human diabetic (Brenner, Cooper et al. 2001; Lewis 2003) and non-diabetic renal diseases (Maschio et al. 1996) revealed that the progression of the renal disease can be slowed by the RAS blockade, which modulates hemodynam ic and non-hemodynamic factors contributing to the progression of glomerulo sclerosis and renal fibrosis (Ferrario 2002; Strawn and Ferrario 2002). Therapeutic management of diseases with increased activity of the RAS has been greatly facilitated by the availability of classes of drugs that inhibit ACE or block angiotensin II receptors. In c linical practice, this has had far-reaching implications for the treatment of EH and congestive heart failure (Johnston et al. 1979; Turini et al. 1979; Palmer et al. 2003). Furthermore, RAS-blocking agents have been proved to be vaso - and renoprotective and, therefore, prescribed not only for anti-hypertensive but also for vaso- and renoprotective purposes in diabetic nephropathy and in other chronic glomerular diseases with and without systemic hypertension (Andersen et al. 2002). Early intervention in patients with hypertension and diabetes is necessary to prevent the development of kidney damage (Ruilope 2002). 2.3.2. Blood pressure control and the reduction of proteinuria Systemic hypertension is a strong well- known independent risk factor for impaired renal function (He and Whelt on 1999). Lower levels of achieved BP are associated with a slower decline in renal function, both in patients with and without proteinuria (Marcantoni et al. 2000; Fournier, Presne et al. 2002). The MDRD Study confirmed that a lower blood pressure goal can be regarded as renoprotective: for patients with proteinur ia of more than 1.0 g/24 hours, a target blood pressure of less than 92 mm Hg (125/75 mm Hg). For patients with proteinuria of 0.25 to 1.0 g/24 hours, a target mean arterial pressure of less than 98 mm Hg (about 130/80 mm Hg) is advisable (Peterson et al. 1995). The extent to which lowering blood pressu re reduces proteinuria is a possible measure for the effectiveness of therapy in slowing the progression of renal disease. Patients with the highest blood pressure and proteinuria are those with the fastest progression of CRF (Grimm et al. 1997; Keane 2000). In chronic nephropathies, proteinuria is the best independent predictor of disease progres- sion (Ruggenenti et al . 1998; Hebert et al. 2001). The level of proteinuria 23proved to be the most important risk for progressive kidney injury in diabetic patients (Adler et al. 2003; Keane and Lyle 2003). Anti-hypertensive drugs that most effectively limit protein traffic at comparable levels of blood pressure are those that most efficiently slow disease progression and delay or prevent renal failure in proteinuric chronic nephropathies (Usta et al. 2003). Microalbuminuria is one of the earliest indicators of kidney injury (Keane and Eknoyan 1999) and could easily be monitored. 2.3.3. Nutritional counselling Patients with CRF need to undergo nut ritional assessment and their nutritional status should be followed at frequent intervals. A care plan for nutritional management should be developed early in the course of CRF and modified frequently, based on the patient's medical and social conditions (Beto et al. 2004). Lower levels of dietary protein intake slow the increase in proteinuria and renal disease progression both in clinical (Locatelli et al. 1991; Maiorca et al. 2000; Waugh and Robertson 2000) and experimental studies (Jacob et al. 2002; Abbate and Remuzzi 2003). A beneficial eff ect of low protein diet on the rate of progression of CRF is observed in non-diabetic renal diseases, but their beneficial effect seems to be greater in diabetic renal disease (Aparicio et al. 2001). It has already been emphasized in 1925 by Steiner and Wegman that proteinuria per se contributes to the renal tissue injury, and the progression of kidney disease could be influenced by dietary measures that support protein digestion. As reviewed by Schieppa ti and Remuzzi in 2003, the presence of large quantities of protein within the tu bules has an inflammatory effect on the tubular cells and interstitium. Macrom olecular trafficking through the glomerulus has an intrinsic toxicity, wh ich is indipendent from the mediation of Ang II as showed in an experimental study with protein overload diet (Benigni et al. 2002). Podocytes accumulate protei n overload and become damaged, which leads to their dysfunction (Abbate et al . 2002). Based on the meta- analyses and secondary analyses of the randomised trials, it can be concluded that protein restriction slows progression of renal disease (Pedrini et al. 1996; Zarazaga et al. 2001). Patients dietary protein intake could be 0.6 g/kg ideal body weight/day (Locatelli et al. 2002). The low protein diet can already be recommended in the early stages of progressive renal disease. Patients on protein-restricted diets should be carefully monitored to prevent malnutrition. The dietary salt restriction is based on advice given for prevention and treat- ment of high blood pressure (Ruilope 2004). The goal of 80 to 120 mmol/day (for example, only 2 g sodium/day diet) is considered to be a renoprotective measure. Dietary salt intake could be monitored by a periodic measurement of 24-hour urine creatinine and sodium. 24High urine volume and low urine osmolality are independent risk factors for faster GFR decline in patients with chr onic renal insufficiency according to the analysis of the MDRD Study database (Hebert et al. 2003). The high urine volumes were associated with maintained or increased BP and greater diuretic use. Thus, high fluid intake does not appear to slow renal disease progression. Suggestions are, until better evidence b ecomes available, that patients with chronic renal insufficiency should generally avoid increased fluid intake. 2.3.4. Control of blood glucose, blood lipids and correction of anemia The glycemic control in diabetic pati ents is essential to prevent onset and development of renal involve ment (Ritz and Tarng 2001). The renal risk increases progressively with higher HbA1c values. Hyperlipidemia contributes to the pr ogression of renal disease (Sahadevan and Kasiske 2002). The MDRD Study already showed that low HDL choleste-rol was an independent risk factor for progression of renal disease and high cholesterol and high Tg levels promote progression of diabetic glomeruloscle- rosis (Peterson, Adler et al. 1995). 9-year follow-up in Finland (Wirta et al. 1997) has shown, that serum Tg predicted total mortality in diabetic patients. Hyperlipidemia contributes to increas ed risk of cardiovascular compli- cations. A small but potentially importan t reduction in cardiovascular risk is achieved with reduction or modification of dietary fat intake, seen particularly in trials of longer duration (Hooper et al. 2001). Thus, it is advisable to encourage blood lipid control (Greco a nd Breyer 1997) and if necessary drug pharmacological treatment in patients with progressive renal disease to correct hyperlipidemia. Obesity is noticed as a significant ri sk factor for the development of proteinuria (Tozawa et al. 2002). Lowering excess weight is advisable for patients with CRF and motivation to ch ange the dietary habits should result from education. Kidney tissue hypoxia may be another common mechanism for the prog- ression of chronic kidneys. Progressive anemia, due largely to erythropoetin defiency, is a common complication of CRF (Deicher and Horl 2003). Anemia can be corrected by the administration of erythropoetin and iron preparations. Control and correction of anemia is alre ady essential in pre-dialysis patients, for improving quality of life (Ross et al. 2003). On the other hand erythropoetin or iron therapy may transiently enchance the OxS (Locatelli et al. 2003). In correction of anemia with erythropoetin or iron therapy, OxS status should be monitored. 252.3.5. Cessation of smoking Smoking is the number one preventable risk factor of diverse atherosclerotic complications in the world. Several potential mechanisms of smoking-induced renal damage have been discussed, e.g. in crease in BP, alteration of intra-renal hemodynamics, as well as activation of the sympathetic nerve, the renin-angiotensin and the endothelin systems (Odoni et al. 2002). The exact mechanisms of smoking-induced renal damage still remain to be determined; the role of profound OxS should be stressed (Lim et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2002). Discontinuation of smoking h as been shown to improve both renal and cardiovascular prognosis in the re nal patient and is probably the single most effective measure to retard progression of RF (Schiffl et al. 2002). Smoking has vasoconstrictor, thrombotic, and direct toxic effects on the vascular endothelium (Kanauchi 2002). Cigarette smoking known to be an in dependent risk factor for progression of inflammatory renal disease (IgA nephr itis), non-inflammatory renal disease and diabetic nephropathy (Orth et al. 1998; Orth 2002; Chuahirun et al. 2003). Smoking is one of the most important remediable renal risk factors. For all the above reasons, cessation of smoking shoul d be advised for renal patients \u2014 a recommendation, which should be given more frequently. 2.3.6. Oxidative stress status and adjuvant antioxidant therapy The development of atherosclerosis in CRF patients seems to be dependant on the grade of oxidative status of lipopro teins and their resistance to oxidation (Mimic-Oka et al. 1999; O'Byrne et al. 2001). Today, there is no doubt that the control and correction of the oxidant/an ti-oxidant imbalance in patients with chronic renal disease is an important approach for the reduction of the risk for those patients to develop cardiovascular disorders and renal failure (Massy and Nguyen-Khoa 2002; Locatelli, Canaud et al. 2003). Ang II is a potent stimulator of oxidative stress and RAS-blocade can already have an anti-oxidant effect (Calo et al. 2002). Plasma homocysteine as well as blood glutathione are associated with CRF and hypertension (Annuk, Fellstrom et al. 2001; Muda et al. 2003). It is accepted that plasma total homocysteine el evated levels may be reduced by supplementation with folic acid or comb inations of folic acid, vitamin B 12, and vitamin B 6. Folic acid is necessary for homocysteine metabolism, and therapy with folic acid reduces highly elevated plasma total homocysteine concentra- tions in CRF patients, although seldom to the normal (Dierkes et al. 1999; Sunder-Plassmann et al. 2000; Kaplan et al. 2001; Elian and Hoffer 2002). Supplementation with vitamin B 12 resulted in total homocysteine reduction among CRF patients, although other investigators find no effect (Hyndman et 26al. 2003). Supposedly, the efficacy of vitamin B 12 and folate supplementation on plasma total homocysteine levels ma y depend on individual genotype (Nakamura et al. 2002). Adequately designed antioxidant administration as an adjuvant therapy may have clinical impact for reducing cardi ovascular complications in chronic renal failure (Tremblay et al. 2000). It has been showed that high-dose vitamin E supplementation for longer period of time could be beneficial for ESRD patients (Boaz et al. 2000). 2.3.7. Exercise therapy as an important part of complex rehabilitation Among non-pharmacological approaches, aerobic exercise could be advised for CRF patients more often to increase thei r general conditioning and stabilise the renal function for longer period of time (Painter et al. 1999; Kouidi 2002). Permanent physical inactivity is one of th e major risk factors of atherosclerosis. CRF patients have usually lim ited exercise tolerance (DePaul et al. 2002) and diabetic and elderly patients have a signifi cantly lower result than the rest of the patients (Wiberg 2003). Exercise therapy is an important part of complex rehabilitation for CVD patients (Shephard and Balady 1999). As patients with chronic renal disease are considered in the highest risk group of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, al l beneficial cardiovascular rehabilitation strategies should be included in their management, in addition to the renoprotective pharmacological therapies to retard the development of risk factors for CVD and possibly slow the progression of RF. Preventive measures should be undertaken, encouraging patients to increase their physical activity and optimise their functional capacity as early as possible. Exercise training has been shown to have a positive influence on physical capacity (Clyne et al. 1991; Death 1999), hypertension (Petrella 1998), left ventricular function (Deligiannis et al. 1999), lipid and glucose metabolism (Tran and Weltman 1985; Laaksonen et al. 2000), OxS and inflammation status (Arak-Lukmann 2002; Pihl et al. 2003), anemia (Painter et al. 2002) and quality of life (Painter et al. 2000) in CRF patients and in patients on renal replacement therapy (Boyce et al. 1997; Fitts et al. 1999). Moderate exercise has proved to possess antioxidative influence especially with a combination of dietary measures (Roberts et al. 2002). Important questions in the progression preven- tion strategies of chronic renal disease pa tients are mode, intensity, frequency, duration, and regularity of exercise (Painter 1994; Konstantinidou et al. 2002; Sietsema et al. 2002). 272.3.7.1. Mode of exercise There are various suggestions for exercise therapy; the more traditional of them being walking, stock-walking, jogging, cycling or low and moderate impact aerobics programmes. Exercise should be dynamic, enjoyable, easily accessible and without adverse effect for optimal impact. Generally, exercise training is being recommended to patients as a comp lementary therapeutic modality held in a rehabilitation centre under the supervis ion of a physiotherapist or as a good, counselled, home exercise programme. The exercise prescription must include measures to minimise both cardiovascular and musculoskeletal risk. An individualised programme is needed to encourage patients to increase their physical activity. The chronic renal failure, and pre-di alysis, population is old and the worsening of physical fitness is mo re pronounced among older individuals (Johansen et al. 2000). Skeletal muscle weakness and fatigue causes poor functional ability, especially when the renal dysfunction becomes aggravated. Regular exercise, already in the pre-dialysis stage, individually programmed by a specially trained physiotherapist, will further ameliorate the condition of renal patients. The chosen mode of exercise should be enjoyable for the individual patient and simple to carry out in orde r to maximise compliance. Exercising should bring by a joyful experience. Among a wide variety of aerobic training possibilities, aquatic exercise is a novel approach in CRF patients' re habilitation programmes. Water-based exercise could allow older, obese and not as well motivated patients to more easily gain all the advantages of land-based exercise. Non-swimming aquatic exercises have shown a beneficial effect, particularly useful in patients with orthopaedic problems (Ruoti et al. 1994). Water immersion causes increase in renal blood flow and contributes to the lowering in renal sympathetic nerve activity, renal vascular pressure and decr ease in plasma renin activity (Epstein 1992; Becker and Cole 1998). Some expe rimental studies have shown that exercise in a water environment could im prove renal functioning and even slow the progression rate (Heifets, Davis et al. 1987; Osato, Onoyama et al. 1990). Land-based exercise studies have not yet shown a benefit for renal function either in clinical (Eidemak, Haaber et al. 1997) or in experimental studies (Averbukh, Marcus et al. 1992; Bergamaschi, Boim et al. 1997). It has been investigated and summarised by Epstein (Epstein 1992) that aquatic immersion influen ces renal function positively: plasma renin activity is reduced contributing to renal vascular pr essure and sodium excretion. In CRF patients and individuals, symp athetic consistently raised (Orth, Amann et al. 2001; DiBona 2002). Therefore, the aquatic environment is an ideal one for mitigation of sympathetic over-activity (Grossman et al. 1992; Ikeda et al. 1994). It is known that aquatic exercise lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients (Tanaka et al. 1997). 28Blood flow during exercise is preferentially directed to working muscle, and away from other central organs like the kidney (Clorius et al. 1996). Distribution of blood flow is influenced by sympathetic arterial vasoconstriction and is pronounced in hypertensive i ndividuals (Clorius, Haufe et al. 2002). Aquatic immersion creates physiologica lly non-invasive effects on renal regulatory systems, as has been published by Epstein: renal blood flow increases upon immersion. Water immersion per se abates the renal vasoconstriction during exercise. Orthosta tic and renal vasoconstrictive risks of land-based exercise can be avoided when ex ercising in an aquatic environment. 2.3.7.2. Intensity of exercise The intensity of exercise may usually range from 40 to 85 percent of functional aerobic capacity (VO 2max), but it should be low or moderate intensity (from 40 to 60 percent of VO 2max) for CRF patients. The intensity of aquatic exercise could be low in comparison with land-b ased exercise while, water immersion, with its influence, gives more effect for the effort (Becker and Cole 1998) and there is a shorter period needed for rec overy from aquatic exercise (Weber-Witt 1994). It is essential that the risks of exercise must be assessed along with potential benefits. The most serious inherent risk of exercise, in the pre-dialysis population, could be cardiovascular complic ations. These could be avoided with a provision of a prolonged warm-up a nd exercise adaptation period and time allowance for adequate cool-down. If the exercise starts at low intensity, the associated risk for kidney patients should be minimal. For most of the CRF patients, the risk benefit ratio will fall in favour of exercise, compared to the majority of patients exposed to greater risk by not exercising. 2.3.7.3. Duration and content of exercise Exercise conditioning consists of three phases: 1. Warm-up for 5 to 10 minutes. Warm- up exercises consist of stretching, flexibility movements and aerobic activit y that gradually increase the heart rate. The gradual increment in blood flow minimises the risk of exercise-related cardiovascular complications. 2. Conditioning phase lasts for 10 to 20 minutes involving aerobic activity. 3. Cool-down period for 5 to 10 minutes. The cool-down time includes low- intensity exercise and permits a gradua l recovery from the previous phase. Omitting the cool-down period results in a transient decrease in venous return, in the time-period when oxygen cons umption is still high. It is better to make the warm-up and cool-down periods longer in renal disease patients and to increase the duration rather than intensity (Clorius, Mandelbaum et 29al. 1996). Exercise should be monitored and supervised to prevent cardiac complications. 2.3.7.4. Frequency and regularity Long-term observational studies, in preventive cardiology, show that those individuals who exercise regularly have significantly less cardiovascular complications (Clarkson et al. 1999; Higashi et al. 1999; Smith et al. 1999; Marlowe 2001). Increased physical activity should be fo stered in such ways that it becomes a routine part of the medical therapy ear ly in the treatment period and in the mindset of the patient who then strives for self-improvement. Exercise should be regular, but even 2-3 times per week produces a beneficial effect (Suh et al. 2002), including a certain decrease of LPO and high sensitive CRP level. Prolonged low-intensity exercise has a substantially greater effect on renal hemodynamics in hypertensive renal failure patients than in healthy controls (Svarstad, Myking et al. 2002). The importance of regular physical activity in lifestyle changes in patients with CRF should not be overlooked. 2.3.8. Education and management of the psychosocial problems Various studies of the benefits of pa tient education progr ammes have shown that educated patients have a reduced in cidence of emergency dialysis compared with control patients (Binik et al. 1993; Golper 2001). Education of patients early in the course of CRF offers many potential benefits for patients and healthcare professionals, including improved treatment outcomes, reduced anxiety, greater prospect for contin ued employment, improved timing for the start of dialysis, and a greater opportunity for intervention to delay disease progression (Bakewell et al. 2002). A 2-year trial with hypertensive patients in Finland showed beautifully that systematic lifestyle counselling can lower blood pressure levels (Kastarinen et al. 2002). Individual or group psychotherapy and sometimes pharmacotherapy can be beneficial (Barrett 2003). Social, fina ncial, and other counselling methods should be provided as necessary, together with patient education, regarding treatment, including modalities and other aspects of care. The social impact of these efforts primarily will be on the patient's quality of life, and secondarily, on family members and friends. Quality of life depends on many factors, including modality of treatment and adequacy of dialysis. In patients who are employed, efforts should be made to maintain their employment status and 30social co-worker counselling should be provided for unemployed patients (Oberley, Sadler et al. 2000). Each patient's condition should be ta ken into account individually when suggesting complex therapies. Careful ma nagement of the patient, in the pre- dialysis period, in the most appropriate setting for the individual patient's needs, would best achieve this. Vocational c ounselling as an important part of non- pharmacological treatment could not remain under-valued. 2.3.9. Summary End-stage renal disease (ESRD) poses a large and growing morbidity, mortality, and financial burden (Blagg 1994). Almost all patients reach ESRD as a result of chronic progressive many years lasting conditions, particularly diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive-vascular renal disease, and glomerular disorders. Therefore, both medicament and non-medicament strategies preventing progression of RF should be united \u2014 nutritional counselling, cessation of smoking, good blood pressure control etc. Avoidance of further renal insults such as the use of nephrotoxic drugs and radiographic contrast can slow the decline of renal function. Rehabilitation of patients with CRF should encompass all aspects of the patient's well being and include vocational, physical, and medical therapies. Family physicians play an impor tant role in early recognising patients with potential for renal failure to improve the outcomes. Patients at risk merit regular renal assessment with serum creatinine tests and urine analysis for existing proteinuria. Population screening is even advisable (Briganti et al. 2003). Protective therapy may have the greatest impact if initiated early in the course of renal failure development, befo re the plasma creatinine concentration exceeds 132 to 176 \u00b5mol/l. To achieve a maximal efficacy, reno-protective and cardio-protective treatment has to be initiated as early as possible in the course of renal failure (Muirhead 2001). Because of its complexity, the integrated com- bined nephroprotective and cardioprotective therapy requires early and sustained guidance by a nephrologist throughout the whole CRF period (Avorn et al. 2002). Timely involvement of specia lised rehabilitation team (dietary specialist, physiotherapist, social co-wor ker) could be beneficial, especially in pre-dialysis state. Systematic vocat ional counselling and encouraging of participation in an exercise-conditi oning programme could bring important benefit from the public health point of vi ew, that needs further investigations. Although, classes of drugs that inhibit ACE or block angiotensin II recep- tors are widely used antihypertensive medicines in therapeutic management of hypertension and chronic renal diseases, recent meta-analysis in hypertensive subjects have shown that the comparison of various antihypertensive therapies still needs more investigations (Angeli et al. 2004) under the basis of indicative biochemical parameters. Less is known, how RAS-blocking therapy influences 31OxS status in kidney and could it be supe rior to RAS indepe ndent beta-blocking therapy in protecting the kidney tissue from lipid peroxidation. On the other hand, different non-pharmacological manipulations for more systemic therapy could be included to the complex of renoprotective therapy, such as water-based exercise for CRF pa tients. Although, the safety and the possible benefits of aquatic exercise to the renal function of the CRF patients are not yet been investigated. 323. AIMS OF THE STUDY The study is aimed at elucidating the role of medicamentous and non-medicamentous treatment in the progression preventive strategies in chronic renal failure and hypertension. Accordingly, the specific objectives of the study were: 1. To study the impact of anti-hypertensive treatment with an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (losartan) and a beta-blocker (atenolol) on blood pressure, renal function, oxidative st ress status and morphological changes in the kidney tissue in an experiment al model of chronic renal failure and hypertension (remnant kidney). 2. To determine the impact of implem entation of the regular long-term (12 weeks) water-based aerobic conditioning on the renal and cardio-respiratory functional indices and on the oxidative stre ss status in those patients with mild and moderate chronic renal failure. 334. PART I: The impact of anti-hypertensive treatment with agent (atenolol) on blood pressure, oxidative stress status and renal parameters in experimental chronic renal failure (Paper I) 4.1. Materials and methods 4.1.1. Experimental design Male Wistar rats were subjected to a subtotal (5/6) nephrectomy (NPX) as previously described (Ots, Mackenzie et al. 1998) at week (wk) 0, at approxi-mately 8 wks of age, rats weighing 262-280 g were anesthetized with intra-peritoneal methohexital sodium, 5 mg per 100 g body weight. Renal ablation was then accomplished by right nephrectomy and selective ligation of extra- renal branches of the left renal artery in such a way that approximately 2/3 of the left kidney was infarcted. Fifty-five rats were randomized afte r the surgery and divided into six groups matched for age and body weight at wk 0 and studied during 2 was measured every week fo r the duration of the study. Systolic blood pressure (SBP, mmHg) was measured weekly by the tail-cuff manometer (Harvard Apparatus, USA) in awake pr e-warmed rats. The urine was collected for 24 hours (h) using metabolic cages at wk 2 and 4, for determination of urine creatinine (U-Crea, \u00b5mol/l), and proteinuria (Uprot, g/24h) that were measured with Hitachi 912 Analyser. Blood was collected from the aorta for serum creatinine (S-Crea, \u00b5mol/l) and was measured using 912 1RA (ate- nolol, 750 mg/l) was added to the drinking water and started immediately after the operation. Drug solutions were freshly prepared immediately prior to use. After the study period rats were anesthetised using methohexital sodium (50 mg per 100g body weight) and the blood collected from the aorta for bio- chemical and OxS tests. The remnant kidneys were removed and a piece from the cortex for the OxS tests was taken and remaining tissue fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde. Paraffin sections of coronal slices, through the pelvis of the remnant kidney, were cut at a 4 mm thickness and stained using the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and Masson's trichrome methods. 344.1.2. Oxidative stress indices lipid peroxidation, malon- dialdehyde and (LPO) and in serum; markers of antioxidant status: concentrations of total glutathione (TGSH) including reduced (GSH) and oxidized forms (GSSG) in kidney cortex tissue and in serum; markers of the co mmon OxS based load of the body: 8-isoprostanes in fresh urine. The procedures met the criteria and principles described previously (Halliwell and Gutteridge 1999). Products of lipid peroxidation (LPO): malondialdehyde a nd lipid peroxidation using kit LPO-586 TM (Bioxytech\u00ae). Concentrations of total glutathione (TGSH) including reduced (GSH) and oxidi sed forms (GSSG, all in \u00b5M) were assessed by an enzymatic method as describ ed previously (Griffith 1980). The blood was de-proteinated by 10% solu tion of metaphosphoric acid (MPA) in water, adding an equal volume of MPA to the blood (Cayman Clinical Com-pany, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Fresh urine was collected at week 2 and 4. Samples were stored at -20\u00b0C until analyzed. Isoprostanes in fresh urine were measured by the ELISA technique using the manufacturer kit (Bio xytech\u00ae). The urine isoprostane data were expressed in ng per mg creatinine. 4.1.3. Morphologic studies Sections from each kidney were studied morphologically for evidence of focal- segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), defined as glomeruli showing evidence of segmental or global collapse of capilla ries with or without associated hyaline deposition and adhesions of the capillary tuft to Bowman's capsule. The extent of FSGS was expressed as a percentage of the total number of glomeruli counted (>50/section). The presence of interstitial fibrosis (IF) was measured in trichrome stained sections from each kidney and was graded according to the following scale: 0 - no evidence of interstitial fibrosis; 1 - <25% involvement; 2 - 25-50%; 3 - >50%. 4.1.4.

Discussion In the experimental part of the study, we evaluated the anti-OxS action of two anti-hypertensive agents, an AT 1RA (losartan) and a beta-blocker (atenolol) in the early stadium of chronic progressive renal failure. Both treatments lowered blood pressure and proteinuria to a similar extent during the study period. However, the glomerulosclerosis index was smallest in losartan-treated animals. Renal diseases progress to end-stage via focal and segmental glomerular scle-rosis, independent of the initial cause. Af ter renal mass reduction, the remaining nephrons undergo functional as well as stru ctural hypertrophy, glomerular and systemic hypertension develops (Hostetter, Olson et al. 2001). The segmental sclerotic lesions that develop in remn ant glomeruli of rats after subtotal nephrectomy (5/6NPX) resemble those seen in a variety of human chronic renal diseases. This remnant kidney model is used in our study to evaluate the dynamics of local and generalised Ox S parameters in the early period of experimental CRF. Angiotensin II (Ang-II) plays the central role in the development of the pathogenic disturbances (Weiss et al. 2001). Experimental and clinical studies 40indicate that RAS blockers slow the rate of the progression of renal injury resulting from kidney diseases of diverse aetiologies. Ang-II is undoubtedly relate d to OxS induction (Gonzales et al. 2002) and RAS blockade manipulation modulates the OxS status. Effects of RAS blockers on the OxS parameters in different mediums (blood, tissue homogenate, urine) have been previously studied in various experimental CRF models (Ha and Kim 1992) (Shou et al. 1997; Verbeelen et et al. 2004) and in human studies (Donmez, Derici et al. 2002; Agarwal 2003). Several studies have shown beneficial effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on the rate of the pr ogression of renal failure (Brooks et al. 1993; Rodriguez-Perez et al. 1997; Van den Branden et al. 1997). However, the RENAAL study proved the priority of the angiotensin receptor type 1 antagonist (AT 1RA), losartan, in renoprotective medication (Brenner, Cooper et al. 2001). The LIFE study pointed that losar tan is superior in reducing cardio- vascular events and mortality (Kjeldsen et al. 2002). There are different data whether RAS blockade can alter the grad e of OxS in chronic progressive kidney diseases. Recent studies have shown the presence of systemic OxS in hypertensive individuals (Nemeth et al. 2001; Turi et al. 2003). In addition, the alteration of systemic and cellular oxida tive stress is still open. Due to these reasons we investigated changes of bo th tissue and blood oxidative stress using two anti-hypertensive agents, an AT 1RA (losartan) and a beta-blocker (ate- nolol). We assessed their suppressing effects on the systemic and cellular OxS indices in after 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6NPX) in the early stages (at weeks 2 and 4) of experimental CRF comparing to untreated controls. Despite the similar effect on blood pr essure and renal parameters the LPO and reduced glutathione levels in the re nal tissue of the losartan-treatment group were significantly better than in the atenolol-treatment group (Fig.6). This suggests that the local anti-oxidant action blocks the very high activity of tissue RAS in the insured kidney. We found that the RAS blockade with losartan already significantly diminishes LPO in re nal tissue level in the early stages of experimental CRF, at week 2, having d eclining tendency further at week 4, when the difference between the atenol ol-treated and losartan-treated groups was found to be highly significant. These results confirm the previous ones which have demonstrated that, in blunti ng Ang-II action, there is a decrease in OxS and Wilcox 2001). 41SBP 0.20 0.25 0.30 pmol/mg protein glutathione (GSH) after 4 weeks of study period. LOS \u2014 losartan-treated, AT \u2014 atenolol -treated, NPX \u2014 untreated groups Reduced glutathione values showed that its synthesis was higher during losartan-treatment, but depressed in atenolol-treated rats. That points to better protection by losartan against pathologi cal oxidation compared to atenolol. Evidently, the use of the RAS blocking ag ent in our study ameliorates the anti- oxidant status in renal tissue of 5/6NPX rats, probably providing local anti- oxidative impact and this was not achieve d with the atenolol-treatment. In the condition of elevated oxygen radicals' pr oduction, losartan was able to blunt the deleterious effect of metabolic changes in the kidney. Progression of oxidative stress caused by (5/6NPX) in remnant kidney tissue was significantly suppressed only by the losartan treatment. Despite a similar blood pressure lowering effect, both the LPO level (indices of lipid peroxidation) and reduced glutathione (a principal cellular antioxidant) in the renal tissue of the losartan-treated group were significantly better than in the atenolol-treated group (Fig.6). It seems that the effect of losartan is GSH-mediated but not the redox-ratio-mediated, as this ratio, in the renal tissue, showed no significant difference between both treatment groups in this study period (I). GSH 05101520\u00b5mol rats after 5/6 NPX. In our study, LPO was elevated in all groups without blunting the action of anti-hypertensive drugs. It is of par ticular interest that losartan treatment lowered renal tissue but not systemic LPO at week 2 and 4. Moreover, in both treatment groups the LPO value in plas ma was significantly higher than in untreated controls at week 2, and remain ed higher, although not significantly, at week 4 where the atenolol-group showed an even lower level than the losartan- group. The discrepancies between tissue and plasma LPO values in the early period of CRF are difficult to discuss. It is evident that the RAS blockade in the kidney influences local tissue LPO to a mu ch greater extent than in blood, at least in the very early stage of experimental CRF. It is possible that the short-term follow up did not permit the observa tion of modifications showing a clear- cut positive action by losartan. Serum glutathione levels were markedly elevated after 5/6 NPX. The highest value of serum glutathione was found in untreated animals. On the other hand, reduced glutathione levels in the blood at week 4 were significantly higher in losartan-treated animals, compared with the atenolol-treatment, which could be interpreted as better anti-OxS acti on of losartan at the systemic level. Losartan-treatment prevented the decrease of GSH levels to the contrary situation of atenolol-treatment. Thus, losartan-treatment suppresses the development of pathological renal cellular OxS but not the blood one in the early period of chronic renal failure. Its cellular effect seems to be GSH-mediated. Atenolol-treatment also interferes with the glutathione system as it decreases both GSSG and GSH in the renal tissue in our study (I). In summary, losartan enables the cont rolling of the progression of OxS in the kidney tissue level during the early stages of experimental chronic renal failure. This finding may partly explain the renoprotective effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Urinary isoprostanes are markers of the common oxidative stress-based load of the body. Thus, the assay of urinary isoprostanes gives useful infor- mation about changes in systemic OxS. Both treatments (losartan, atenolol) induced some elevation of isoprostanes at week 2, which can be observed in parallel with the systemic LPO status that corresponds with the data of Tesar et al. in the adriamycin-induced nephritic syndrome model (Tesar, Zima et al. 2002). Urinary isoprostanes decreased in lo sartan-treated rats from 2 weeks to 4 weeks, in atenolol-treated rats a furthe r increase occurred. It could be related to effects of anti-hypertensive agents on lipid peroxidation process in serum and thus probably in the filtered load. Both treatments (losartan, atenolol) induced elevation of urine isoprostanes at week 2; it is noteworthy that, considering the 4-week condition, the urinary isoprostanes le vel is lower in losartan-treated rats compared with untreated animals. At the same time the level of urinary isoprostanes is characterised by a further increase in atenolol-treated rats. 43There were no major changes concerning the physiological and morpho- logical parameters between the animals treated with AT 1RA or beta-blocker in 4-week study period, although the tendency of less glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis was noticed in the group treated with losartan. Losartan's renoprotective characteristics may be re lated to the anti-OxS action and lipid peroxidation decline, presumably due to RAS diminished activity in kidney. Our study showed that the measurement of LPO in kidney tissue gives valuable information in biochemical level; despite the similar effect of AT 1RA or beta- blocker on BP and proteinuria in 4-week period, the kidney tissue LPO was significantly lower only after AT 1RA-treatment. 445. PART II: The impact of aquatic exercise on blood pressure, oxidative stress level, cardio-respiratory , renal and lipid parameters in those patients with chronic renal failure (Papers II; III; IV) 5.1. Patients Twenty-six patients with mild to modera te progressive CRF participated in the study: seventeen in the exercise group, nine patients remained sedentary and formed the control group. Clinical charact eristics of the patients at baseline are given in Table 6. Table 6. Clinical characteristics of study patients at baseline (mean values\u00b1SD) Exercise group (n=17) Control group (n=9) Age (years) between para meters of study groups were found. Diagnoses of participating patients were the following: diabetes mellitus type I \u2014 3, type II \u2014 3, essential hyperten sion \u2014 4, chronic glomerulonephritis \u2014 15 patients, chronic pyelonephritis \u2014 1. All patients had mild or moderate proteinuria and nobody was anaemic. 15 patients had mild cardiovascular problems (NYHA I-II). Medication was not changed during the rehabilitation programme. There was no dietary change; the patients followed their usual diet habits. Informed consent was obtained fro m all patients and the Ethics Review Committee on Human Research at the Univer sity of Tartu approved the study protocol. All data were collected at baseline and after the 12-week follow-up. 455.2.Methods 5.2.1. Stress test protocol Cardio-pulmonary exercise performed using the bicycle ergometer \"Siemens 380\" . The protocol began with resting data for 1 minute. The workload started at 40 watts (W) with increments of 10 W per minute until volitional fatigue, dyspnoea or other indi cations for stopping the test occurred. Recovery included 2 minutes of no-load cycling followed by a seated rest for 15 minutes. Functional indices of the cardio-respiratory system were measured continuously using an automated expire d gas analyser (Oxycon Record, Erich Jaeger, 1993). Following cardio-respiratory parameters were taken at baseline and after 12-week follow-up: peak oxygen uptake (peak VO 2, ml/kg/min), peak oxygen pulse (VO 2, ml/kg/min), peak ventilation (l/min) and peak load (W). Resting blood pressure was measured in a sitting position before testing and after a 15 minutes recovery period. 5.2.2. Exercise conditioning The study group exercised vertically in the pool with total immersion to the shoulder ( at water temperature +24 o) twice a week for 12 weeks with sessions lasting 30 minutes, involving rhythmic m ovements for joints and body (aerobic exercise). These activities were supervi sed by a trained physiotherapist and based on a comprehensive plan by a physical specialist. The exercise program consisted of a 10-minute warm-up period with gentle stretching, a 10-minute cardiovascular segment of exercises with gradually increasing intensity and a 10-minute cooling down period with a final stretching time. The group all exercised at low-intensity (40-50% of their individual peak oxygen uptake heart rate). Heart rate (HR, b/min) was monitored with a sport-tester (Polar Electro) during exercising (max HR was taken after the most intense moment after gradually increasing the intensity exercise part). Blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP, mmHg), was measured before (resting 15 minutes in sitting position) and afte r 15 min resting on completion of the training. 5.2.3. Markers of oxidative stress Products /ml) malonaldehyde and 4-hydroxyalke- LPO (Bioxytech\u00ae LPO-586 TM). measured as described by Starkopf et al 1997 (Starkopf et al. 1997). Markers of antioxidant 46status: concentrations of total glutat hione (TGSH) and oxidised forms (GSSG, all in \u00b5M) were assessed by an enzymatic method (Griffith 1980). Isoprostanes in fresh urine (ISO, ng/mg creat) were measured by the ELISA technique (Bioxytech\u00ae). 5.2.4. Plasma lipids and renal parameters Blood samples were obtained via venopunctu re fasting. Serum total cholesterol health status Patient-side subjective outcome of genera l health status was assessed in an interview, using one question: \"How do you evaluate your general health status now?\" It was characterised using nu merical values from 1 to 10 and was interpreted as following: points 10-8 = good; points 7-4 = average; points 3-1 = poor. 5.2.6. Statistics Group data are presented as means\u00b1SD. Differences between the initial and final values within the group were evaluate d using the two-sample paired t-test for means. The p < 0,05 was accepted as statistically significant. 5.3. Results 5.3.1. Blood pressure and cardio-respiratory parameters In the exercise group, a significant decrease in both SBP and DBP was noticed. Indices of cardio-respiratory reserve and physical capacity in the exercise group showed improvement in all paramete rs (Table 7). Peak oxygen pulse (ml/b/min\u00b1SD), peak ventilation (l/min \u00b1SD) and peak load (W\u00b1SD) were significantly improved when comparing da ta before and after the rehabilitation 47programme. Mean peakVO 2 (ml/kg/min\u00b1SD) was also better, although not significantly. There were no signifi cant changes in the control group. Table 7.

The serum LPO level decreased and the reduced glutathione value increased significantly in the exercise group. Individual values of the glutathione redox ratio (GSSG/GSH) normalised in 16 out of 17 exercising patients, the group mean change was significant. There was no significant change in excretion of isoprostanes in urine. There were no significant changes in OxS status in the control group. Table 8.

Discussion The present study shows consistent with the data from other authors, that cardio-respiratory functional capacity of renal patients can be significantly improved in regular physical activity performance (Goldberg et al. 1983; Boyce, Robergs et al. 1997; Painter et al. 2002). Cardio-respiratory reserve and physical capacity indices were improved in our study exercise group; remained unchanged, even worsened, in sedentary control group. Peak VO 2, peak workload and peak ventilation are consider ed the variables that reflect exercise tolerance and usually improve after training (Fig. 7).

Peak VO 2, peak workload and peak ventilation before and after the regular 12- week aerobic water-based exercise. Although there are no clear guidelines for exercise training for patients with renal disease, it has been emphasized that most of these patients can benefit from increased physical activity. 50We chose the water-based exercise from the various suggestions for aerobic exercise therapy because the low-intensity exercise has been showed to be optimal for renal patients for an adequate response and the intensity of aquatic exercise could truly be low in comparis on with land-based exercise while water medium gives more effect to the effort. Older, obese and less motivated patients gain in water all the advantages of la nd-based exercise more easily (Ruoti, Troup et al. 1994). The most important aspect for optimal impact is that the exercise should be enjoyable and relaxing for the individual patient. In our study we obtained improvement in renal functional parameters: proteinuria diminished significantly (Fig. 8) and serum cystatin C decrease was reinforced by small GFR improvement (II, III, IV). This effect bears a resemblance to experimental results made previously in small animals. Interestingly, studies with uremic anim als (Heifets, Davis et al. 1987; Osato, Onoyama et al. 1990) have shown that sw imming exercise significantly reduced Blood pressure 130135140145150155mmHg Proteinuria 0,00,51,0 Before Afterg/24h 80 85 90 95 Before After Figure 8. Blood pressure and proteinuria before and after the regular 12-week aerobic water-based exercise. 51proteinuria and the degree of glomerulosclerosis in rats compared with sedentary animals but land-based exercise did not improve renal function in small animals (Averbukh, Marcus et al. 1992; Bergamaschi, Boim et al. 1997). Recently it has been shown a beneficial effect of swim training on oxidative stress parameters in rats (Ravi Kiran et al. 2004). In the human study performed by Eidemak et al . (Eidemak, Haaber et al. 1997), no effect, of land-based exercise (bicycle-ergometric training) on the renal function in patients with moderate renal failure, was found. Decrease of proteinuria in our exercising patients can be observed parallel with the significant lowering of blood pressure (Fig.8). However, also involved are probably the alterations in renal sympathetic activity and levels of plasma angiotensin II in response to the water immersion effect (Epstein 1992). The aqua tic environment is an ideal one for mitigation of sympathetic over-activity (Becker and Cole 1998). The decline in sympathetic activity induces a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. An important mechanism is a fall in circula ting norepinephrine levels that parallels the reduction in blood pressure (Grossman, Goldstein et al. 1992). One possible contributing factor is increased urinary sodium excretion (Epstein 1992). Furthermore, the renal vasoconstricti on can be avoided when exercising in water because in contrary to land-based exercising the renal blood flow increases upon water immersion. Thus, aquatic aerobic exercise seems to be safe concerning the renal function of CRF patients.(III, IV). It is known that CRF patients have pronounced oxidative stress status (Himmelfarb, Stenvinkel et al. 2002) a nd in experimental model of CRF the LPO level was high, both in kidney tissue and blood (I). Mild to moderate exercise has been shown to have protective properties against profound oxidative stress (Arak- Lukmann 2002; Roberts, Ravi Kiran, Subramanyam et al. 2004). The favourable effect of our exercise conditi oning was significant lowering of serum lipid peroxidation in the exercising group (Fig.9). Reduced glutathione higher level in our exercising patients was significantly noticeable after the conditioning program, which shows that anti-oxidative defence was improved after regular exercising. The glutathione redox-ratio normalised and was significantly lower when compared the fo llow up values to baseline, confirming the anti-oxidative effect of regular exercise (Fig.9). 52LPO 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 Before After ng/ml Redox ratio 0.000.050.100.15 Before After Figure 9. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) and glutathione redox ratio (GSSG/GSH) before and after the regular 12-week aerobic water-based exercise. All our renal patients received anti-hype rtensive medication: ACE-inhibitor alone or in anti-hypertensive combination therapy and their medication was not changed during the rehabilitation programme , so the medication could not have influenced the changes in OxS during the study period. The anti-hypertensive effect of regular aerobic exercise has been intensively studied, but the factors responsible for the potential lowering of blood pressure are incompletely understood and how exercise diminishes sympathetic tone needs further investigations. Although, th e decline in sympathetic activity could induce reduction in systemic vascular resistance, lower arterial blood pressure and ameliorate the systemic OxS status in CRF patients in our study. The beneficial influences of physical exercise on lipid profile are well known (Ensign et al. 2002). Lipid changes in our study also showed an ameliorating tendency (II, IV). The total cholesterol level of the exercise group was improved. In complex rehabilitation practice, dietary advice is an important part, which could reinforce the better outcome of lipid profile but, in our study, participants retained their usual dietar y habits. However, to positively improve the plasma lipid profile, dietary means, excess weight reduction and individual motivation to carry on the lifestyle changes should be united (Krook et al. 2003). The results of several studies report of improved psychological well-being and quality of life after exercise (Painter et al. 1997; Painter, Carlson et al. 2000). We used a very simple numbered scale for testing the subjective patient- side outcome, which could not be compared with large life quality questionnaires, but there was significant improvement shown in patients' evaluation of their general health status after our aquatic exercise program (IV). 53Reduction of proteinuria is the most important goal in progression prevention strategies of chronic nephropathies (Schieppati et al. 2003). Thus, the therapies, like aquatic exercise, which can reduce proteinuria and additionally improve subjective well-bei ng and physical functioning should not be overlooked already in the early stages of renal failure to postpone further decline of renal function and prevent a vicious cycle of inactivity, depression and malnutrition with all their pa tho-physiological consequences. 546. CONCLUSIONS 1. Antihypertensive treatment with renin-angiotensin system blocking agent (losartan) and with a beta-blocking agent (atenolol) lowered blood pressure and diminished proteinuria almost to the same extent in rats with experimental chronic renal failure (remnant kidney). 2. Despite a similar blood pressure lowering efficacy, the progression of aggravated oxidative stress in the kidn ey tissue, caused by sub-total nefrec- tomy in rats, was significantly supr essed only by the renin-angiotensin system blocking treatment, not by a beta-blocker treatment and the morpho- logical changes in the kidney after 4 weeks of treatment showed less interstitial fibrosis in losartan-treated groups compared with atenolol-treated and untreated animals. 3. The supervised and monitored regular aquatic exercise applied individually for patients with chronic renal disease is a safe and supportive method in complex of renoprotective strategies. It caused significant improvement of renal functional parameters , had beneficial effects on physical capacity and ameliorated significantly the oxidative stress status of chronic renal failure patients. 4. Combination of adequate pharmacol ogical suppression of renin-angiotensin system together with non-pharmacol ogical treatment: regular aquatic exercise, dietary measures, smoking cessation, encouragement and edu- cation could preserve renal function, prevent physical worsening and postpone cardiovascular and renal compli cations in patients with chronic renal disease. 55REFERENCES Abbate, M. and G.
