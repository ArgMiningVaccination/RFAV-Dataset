Introduction This report summarizes the findings from a cognitive interviewing study of the questions appearing on the Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM ) supplement intended for the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) . The report presents an overview of the themes that emerged from the qualitative interview data for the modality -specific questions (i.e., the unique questions that were only asked of a specific CAM practice, such as \"special diets\" or \"traditional healers\" ), as well as a question -by-question evaluation of the recurring questions asked of each CAM modality (e.g., such a s questions about health coverage and motivations for using CAM) . Our testing focused on those questions designated as \"new\" for the 2012 NHIS. While an evaluation is included for all new questions, particular attention is devoted to questions that may lea d to potential response error. The question- by-question evaluation include s descriptions of how respondents interpreted question intent, explanations of why and how questions presented problems for respondents and, where appropriate, recommendations for question improvement. Section II of this report briefly describes the methodology of cognitive interviewing, outlines the interviewing procedures, and discusses the sampling process for this study . The third section provides an overview of the findings from the modality -specific question analysis; due to resource constraints and the length of the instrument, researchers were limited in their ability to thoroughly test the modality -specific questions for each CAM practice. None theless, of the modalities for which we were able to collect enough data, some suggestive patterns emerged and these findings are presented in more detail below. Section IV offers a more in depth question- by-question evaluation of the recurring questions t hat were asked of each CAM modality ( PRT.3 - PRT.38 ), as well as an overview of the findings from the practitioner -based questions ( PRT.1 - PRT.2 ). In an effort to pro vide the most robust analysis possible with the most amount of data , this question- by-question analysis was conducted across modalities, irrespe ctive of specific CAM practices (e.g., question PRT.3 was analyzed irrespective of whether the respondent was referring to traditional healers, movement therapies, herbal supplements, et c...). Findings from this analytic approach are described in more detail below. 2 II. Method As a qualitative method, cognitive interviewing provides detailed insight into patterns of error as well as patterns of interpretation and calculation that respondents use to answer questions. With this technique, interviewers administer survey questions, obtain a response, and then probe respondents for other informa tion relevant to the question. Probing can be conducted either concurrently (i.e., immediately afte r the survey question is administered) or retrospectively (i.e., after the entire survey has been administered). For this project, researchers probed concurrently . Cognitive interviewing results in rich and detailed information on the question- response process, allowing analysts to determine the effectiveness of survey language and respondents' ability to recall requested information. The information obtained from this intensive interviewing method allows interviewers to determine how questions perform, including phenomena that are captured by the survey question. With this understanding, it is possible to identify which questions are problematic, as well as why and how questions are problematic. Such insight can lead to possible strategies for improving question design. Sample Interviewing for this project was conducted at the Questionnaire Design Research Laboratory (QDRL) at the National Center for Health Statistics. We recruited a purposive sample, seeking respondents who themselves have ever used or have children who have used vitamins, minerals, or natural herb supplements, or any of the following health practices: acupuncture, ayurveda, biofeedback, chelation therapy, chiropractic, energy healing, folk medicine, homeopa thy, hypnosis, imagery, movement therapies, naturopathy, qi gong, spiritual healing, self -help groups, tai chi, traditional Latino medicine, and yoga. Recruitment for the study was done using a newspaper advertisement. In total, we conducted twenty -four in terviews, all in English. Five interviews focused on the CAM experiences of the respondent's child, and nineteen focused on the respondent's personal experiences with CAM. The sample consisted of adults aged 24- 79 and recruitment was conducted with the intent to seek out demographic diversity among respondents in terms of age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and income level , with particular interest in recruiting Latinos (see Table 1 ). Each participant was given a $ 40 remuneration for their participation. Interviewing Procedures Given the length of the questionnaire and the unfeasibility of administering the instrument in its entirety, we selectively administered the questionnaire based upon information ascertained during the recruitment screener process . Our aim was to test as many questions across as many different CAM modalities as possible , and we assessed this data collection strategy on an ongoing basis. For example, as soon as we realized we had al ready gathered a relatively substantial amount of data on CAM users of yoga/ tai chi/qi gong, we shifted our focus in subsequent interviews to test questions appearing in other CAM modalities . When administering questions at the beginning of each modality , we pro bed respondents generally about their practices with the modality being asked 3 about. This was done to elicit respondents' narratives regarding their experiences with the CAM practice. Interviewers also administered concurrent probes for each question, whic h asked respondents to recall how they came to their answer. Probe questions included such things as: Why did you answer the way you did? Can you tell me more about that? What do you think this question is asking? Probing was completed question by question. All interviews were conducted face -to-face and the average interview length was no longer than one hour. Interviews were audio taped; the audio tapes and interview summaries were used to conduct the analysis.

Overview: Modality- Specific Analysis Due to the length of the questionnaire , coupled with constraints on time, resources and interview participants, we were unable to conduct individualized analys is for each modality. However, researchers were able to observe general , albeit limited, patterns of interpretation for some of the specific modalities; these modalities are: traditional healers, movement therapies, herbs and other non- -mineral dietar y supplements, homeopathic treatment, and yoga/tai chi/qi gong . We present these observations below. It is important to keep in mind that, w hile these observations constitute possible suggestive patterns of interpretation, the limited number of respondents that spoke about any given modality must be taken into consideration. Traditional Healers Three respondents reported having any experience with traditional healers. Two different respondents, both from Peru, noted that many of the healers listed on the questionnaire overlap with one another. That is, many of the different healers work together and/ or perform the same treatments. For example, one respondent said that the Curandero is more related to magical powers and the Heir bero works more with herbs. Last April , this respondent was treated by a practitioner that did both. He said that it is not unusual for one practitioner to do five different things - in fact, he said, it is closer to the norm. This respondent made a compar ison to a gen eral practitioner in Western medicine who might conduct X -rays, administer pain medication , and do a family health history analysis. The other respondent from Peru also suggested that many of these practitioners are the same (both respondents from Peru said Hueseros are distinct, working with \"the bones ,\" similar to a chiropractic practitioner) ; however , unlike the other respondent from Peru, he thought the different names represented different regional titles for the various healers (i.e., a practitioner might be called one name in Central America and another in South America ). Of the se two Peruvian respondents, only one had any personal experience with traditional healer s, although both were familiar with the different healer names and functions. This observation could have implications for the data collected in this modality . For example, the Peruvian man who was treated last April by a practitioner that performed the functions of a Curandero and Heirbero reported seeing a Heirbero \"the most during the past 12 months\" ( TRD.2a). Even though this practitioner \"did both,\" this respondent selected \"Heirbero \" because, at the time of his visit, he was \"looking more for the Heirbero side.\" Thus, although the respondent ostensibly saw a Curandero and Heirbero the same amount in the last 12 months (since they were the same person), the respondent chose Heirbero because his visit was prompted more by the functions of a Heirbero rather than a Curandero. Essentially, the question assumes that practitioners perform unique functions; however, this does not appear to be the case. In order for this question to make sense in the context of this man's experience with traditional healers , this respondent answer ed the question based on the function of the practitioner, rather than the practitioner title. 5 Movement Therapies Three people responded \"yes\" to having seen a practitioner for movement ther apy; two saw practitioners for P ilates and one for Alexander Technique. While no general patterns of interpretation could be made, one student of P ilates hesitated when answering this question ( MOV.1 ) and said, \"P ilates, I take a class.\" Pressed for an answer, he said , \"She is an instructor, teacher of P ilates and I take the class , so yes.\" Asked why he hesit ated, the respondent said, \"I 'take' P ilates rather than I 'see a teacher or practitioner ' for Pilates \" (as when people say \"I s ee a doctor for... \"). He th inks of P ilates more in terms of physical fitness as opposed to wellness or healthcare . This respondent's narrative suggests that the survey question's language of \"seeing a practitioner or teacher for Pilates\" does not map neatly onto this respondent's relationship with P ilates, which he understands as something he does \u2014in the form of an exercise class \u2014for physical fitness, rather than a healthcare measure that involves a practitioner. Herbs and O ther N on-vitamin/non- mineral Dietary Supplements In general, respondents were not always clear as to what exactly constitu ted an herbal and other non- vitamin/non -mineral dietary su pplement; this wa s the case even though the description of herbs and non- vitamins/non -minerals was read for each respondent, and sometimes even repeated. For example, after administering HRB.1 , one respondent said, \"Now, you're talking about something for weight control?\" The respondent takes green tea extract and Conjugated Linolenic Acid for weight loss . Importantly, this respondent thinks about his use of these supplements in the context of weight loss, rather than in the context of herbs and non- vitamins/non -minerals. Another respondent asked if this would include Ginkgo Biloba. Other respondents spoke about the various vitamin supplements they were tak ing. Such narratives suggest that CAM users are not equally savvy or informed about the supplements they take, with some respondents unsure as to whether the supplements they take fall into the herbal and non- vitamin/non -mineral category , and others conceiving of their vitamin supplements in the context of this question. As a result, t wo overarching observations were made that could potentially impact the information being captured in the survey questions about herbs and other non-vitamin/non -minera l dietary supplements . First, r espondents might not know if the supplements they take constitute a n herb and other non- vitamin /non- mineral dietary supplement and thus do not report it even if the supplement does fall into this category. For example, after going on for several minutes about the green tea extract and the Conjugated Linolenic Acid (CLA) he takes for weight loss, and the fish oil he takes for overall health, the respondent mentioned earlier says as an afterthought , \"there's one other thing that might be considered in this category.\" He takes red yeast tablets. This is notable because the respondent didn't think about this for quite awhile into his narrative and, even after he mentioned it, he was unsure if red yeast tablets would be considered an herb or non- vitamin /non- mineral dietary supplement. This respondent's narrative suggests that some people might be unaware of the fact that their supplements fall in to this modality category . 6 Second, respondents might assum e that the supplements they take constitute an \"herb and other non- vitamin/non -mineral dietary supplement ,\" even if the supplement does not fall into this category. For example, one woma n reported taking wood root tonic and geritol, which she describes as a complete vitamin. This respondent was thinking about her intake of geritol even though the question asks spec ifically about non- vitamin supplements . Similarly, another man spoke extensively about his previous experi ence with what he refers generally to as \"herbs .\" He was thinking about various herbal remedies, which are sometimes consumed in the form of an infused tea , even though the question specifically asks respondents not to consider herbal teas in their responses. In addition to herbs, he was also thinking about folk remedies which use materials as diverse as burnt rice and bread, tomatoes, potatoes and flour to treat such things as inflammation, indigestion, diarrhea and sunburns. Thus, w hile some respondent s might not be aware that the supplements they take are considered \" herbal and non- vitamin/non -mineral, \" other respondents might lump many non-herbal and vitamin/mineral supplements into this category, as well as other folk remedy practices. The form er scenario results in an under -reporta ge of herbal and non- vitamin/non -mineral supplement intake while the latter results in an over -reportage. In addition to being unclear as to which supplements to consider in the context of the questions about herbs and non- vitamin/non -mineral dietary sup plements, respondents sometimes struggled when reporting on the amount and frequency with which they take these supplements. For exa mple, the respondent who ingests red yeast tablets takes these in combination with niacin (although it is not a combination pill). For the question, HRB.6: Which 2 of these herbs and other non- vitamin supplements did you take the most [in the past 30 days/past 12 months]? , the respondent said red yeast and niacin. He takes these supplements daily . However, he also takes CLA daily . Yet, because he divides his dosage of red yeast and niacin into four smaller doses throughout the day, and only takes CLA twice during the day, he decide d that he takes red yeast and niacin \"the most.\" This respondent's decision to divide up his dai ly intake of r ed yeast is his own innovation\u2014a n effort to avoid a common side effect of the supplement. The supplement could easily be taken twice a day in a higher dosage. This suggests , at least from a survey design perspective, a potentially arbitrary r eporting of which supplement he takes \"the most.\" Respondents displayed particularly divergent patterns of interpretation for the next question, HRB.7: About how many days per week, month, or year do you buy herbs and other non- vitamin supplements? Typica lly, respondents did not use the response format provided in the instrument. Most frequently, respondents thought about how many times (rather than days ) per week/month/year they purchased supplements, such as \"two times per month.\" In addition to thinking about their answers in terms of times rather than days, respondents also did not always purchase their supplements in one week/month/year interval s; such was the case for a respondent who reported purchasing supplements \"once every two months.\" These respondents' experiences did not fit neatly into the re sponse option format provided by the survey instrument. Moreover, the question seemed to assume a certain element of consistency in respondents' supplement purchasing patterns. This was made evident by the respondents who cycle on and off supplements, or try a 7 supplement once and then never take it again. For these respondents, this question posed some challenges. For example, one respondent whose son took Gingko Biloba for only two months last year replied , \"2 months per year.\" However, this was the duration for which his son took Gingko Biloba, not the frequency with which he purchased Gingko Biloba. This respondent only ever bought one bottle of Gingko Biloba for his son. Another respondent said this question was hard for him to answer because he thinks about his herb use in terms of how often he takes a supplement , not how often he buys the supplement . He said his purchasing patterns really \"depend;\" as soon as his body gets used to one supplement, he changes up his regimen. Similar to other respondents, this person's purchasing patterns are varied and not always consistent. Finally, two other instances stand out in the context of this question. F irst, one respondent reported her answer in terms of the product unit that she purchases rather than in terms of days per week/month/year; that is, she reported buying \"one bottle per year.\" Given her experience with Echinacea in the past 12 months, this w as the response format that best fit her case. Second, another respondent reported \"zero\" for this question since he doesn't buy herbs but rather receives them as gifts when he goes back to visit Peru. His narrative may point to an assumption embedded in t he question, which assumes that people acquire herbs only through purchasing them . Notably, in the context of this question, r espondents also thought about their vitamin purchases, and possibly their loose herbal tea purchases. This may be because respondents often purchase d their herbs and non- vitamin /non- mineral supplements along with their vitamin /mineral supplements. The fact that respondents often bundled their herbal and non- vitamin/non -mineral purchases together with their vitamin/mineral purchases had implications for the following question, HRB.8: On average, how much do you spend each time you buy herbs and other non- vitamin supplements? For example, one respondent reported spending $75 each time he purchased herbs and other non- vitamin supplements. During his narrative it became clear that he was including his vitamin purchases in this total; if he were to only consider the costs of his non- vitamin and herbal supplements, the total would be closer to $30. Finally, re spondents t hought of different things when they hear d the concept \"practitioners for herbs and other non- vitamin supplements.\" One respondent thought this meant \"some person who gives you the stuff.\" Another person thought about the nutritionist at his doc tor's office. A third respondent was thinking about the street vendors in Peru who sell the herbs. A fourth respondent was thinking about her acupuncturist. These narratives suggest that respondents either might think of very different practitioners when answering this question and/or might not always know who a practitioner for herbs and other non- vitamin supplements even is. Homeopathic Treatment Similar to some respondents' uncertainty around what constituted an \"herbal or non-vitamin/non -mineral dietary supplement,\" some respondents were unsure as to what constituted a \"homeopathic treatment.\" The respondent who practiced folk remedies from his childhood in Peru asked, \"A re they talking specifically about pills that are made in th e 8 house or a smal l little shop? If so, then 'no' because I'm not very much of a pill -taker. I kind of avoid medicine quite a bit.\" He add s, \"I do tend to follow remedies that they consider more natural.\" This respondent contrasted \"natural remedies\" to all pills, including homeopathic pills. Asked about what the term homeopathy mean s to him , he said he thinks of any homemade medicine. Yet, since the term \"pills\" appeared in the instrument 's description of homeopathic treatment, he thought he might have the wrong definition. He speculated that it might apply to shops (he referenced Giant) that sell such things as vitamins, zinc pills, iron, and fish oil . Another respondent who reported practicing homeopathic treatments was thinking about the inhaler she uses for sinus congest ion. This is despite the fact that t he instrument explicitly describes homeopathic treatment as small pills or drops that are often placed under the tongue. These narrative point to the varied and uncertain ways in which respondents understood \"homeopathic treatments,\" despite having the description read to them. Similar to some of the challenges found in the question about frequency of herbal supplement purchases, respondents had some challenges reporting how often they bought homeopathic medicine. One respondent reported buying it once a quarter, translating this into \"once every three months.\" Yet, t his answer does not map onto t he response format provi ded by the survey instrument (which asks for answers in terms of days per week/month/year) . Two other respondents couldn't answer the question at all. One of these respondents said that her purchases are sporadic ; she might use the treatments seasonally or as a condition comes up. Her purchases also vary based on her finances ; that is, if she has the money to \" indulge \" in homeopathic treatments, she will. Similarly, the second respondent who couldn't answer this question said that she buys chondroitin/glucosamine \"ahead, when it's on sale.\" As such, she doesn't buy it on a regular schedule. Asked if c hondroitin/glucosamine was con sidered a homeopathic treatment she said, \"I don't know.\" While we were only able to obtain limited information from respondents who reported seeing a practitioner for homeopathy, the one narrative we documented might suggest that respondents have varying interpretations of homeopathic practitioners as well. When asked this question, the respondent said she has a \"naturopath\" who she visits frequently and who prescribes her therapies based on what she needs. The respondent does not get the homeopathic treatment from her \"naturopath;\" rather, she gets it at a homeopathic pharmacy and a natural healt h food store . It is not clear whether the practitioner in question is indeed a homeopathic practitioner, since the respondent repeatedly referred to her as a naturopath. Yoga/T ai Chi/Qi Gong Of the three exercises mentioned in this modality, most respondents reported experience with yoga; one person also reported experience with tai chi. A couple of respondents expressed some confusion when asked: YOG.2 During the past 12 months, did you practice [exercised mentioned in YOG.1] for yourself? These respondents were unsure as to wh at exactly was meant by the phrase \"for yourself.\" For example, upon hearing the question one respondent asked, \"For myself? Does that mean as opposed to going to a 9 class? \" This respondent thought \"for yourself\" meant doing yoga on your own. However, another respondent had a different interpretation. This respondent said, \"Y ou mean on my own or for my own purpose?\" All his experiences doing yoga have been as part of a class . Ultimately this respondent replied \"yes\" because, as he said, \"I did do yoga in the past 12 months and I did it because I wanted to.\" Unlike the previous respondent who interpreted the phrase \"for yourself\" to mean doing yoga on your own, apart from a class, this second respondent interpreted the phrase to mean doing yoga because you want t o, even if it's in a class . The next set of observations pertain to the questions that ask whether the respondent did breathing exercises, postures or movements, or meditation as part of yoga. All eight respondents who answered questions in this modality reported doing breathing exercises as a part of yoga and, for the most part, thought that breathing exercises were always necessarily a part of yoga. When asked to describe what's involved in these breathing exercises, one respondent said, \"I t's to concentrate your energy, to focus.\" Another respondent described it as a moment when you close your eyes, relax and not think about anything ; she also described it as \"concentrating on [her] breathing.\" Similarly, a third respondent described it as the period of time at the beginning of class when the instructor tells them to sit quietly and focus on their breadth and center their mind. They are told to focus on breathing before doing any type of movements . A fourth respondent articulated a similar e xplanation, saying the breathing was \"slow,\" \"part of relaxation,\" and a time to \"focus on your breathing,\" but he also mentioned the audible \"AUM's\" that the group chants at the end of class as part of the breathing exercises he does in yoga. These different narratives suggest that people often tend to think of quiet, relaxing, slow and concentrated or focused breaths in the context of this question, rather than loud, vigorous breaths, or breaths that involve specific counting exercises. Respondents also all reported doing postures or movements as a part of their yoga practice and, as was the case with breathing exercises, respondents did not know of a yoga practice in which postures or movements were not involved. Respondents did, however, report varying patterns of interpretation in their responses to the question about meditation. Some respondents reported meditating in their yoga practice, while others did not. The respondents who reported meditating as part of their practice, however, described medi tation in various ways. For example, one respondent spoke about a 15- minute period of time reserved at the end of class to meditate. A different respondent described meditation as part of his religion and said it's like a \"warm -up\" and helps you concentrate. A third respondent was thinking of the time when she goes to the gym for yoga, closes her eyes and thinks about nothing ; consequently she doesn' t feel her back pain. Unlike other interpretations, t his particular respondent appears to think about meditation specifically as a time during which she forgets about her back pain. However, other respondents reported not meditating as part of their yoga practice; nonetheless, these respondents' narratives still point to varying inte rpretations of the term \"meditate.\" For example, one of these respondents reported not being \"at that level.\" He said meditation is when people really concentrate, stay in a position for a while and are \"searching for a balance.\" He believes that he is not at the level where he can do that. A different resp ondent who reported not meditating during yoga described the term as 10 sitting still for at least 30 minutes, in prayer , to whomever you worship. Taken in total, these narratives suggest v ery different interpretations of the construct \"meditation ,\" which in turn impacted whether respondents believe d to have medita ted as a part of their yoga practice. IV. Question -by-Question Review This section of the report presents findings from the question- by-question analysis conducted on all the recurring \"new\" questions of the CAM supplement ( PRT.3 - PRT.38 ), as well as the first set of practitioner -based questions ( PRT.1 - PRT.2 ). This evaluation includes descriptions of how respondents interpreted question intent, assessments of construct validity, evaluations of question performance and, where appropriate, recommendations for question improvement. Researchers also point out areas that may lead to potential re sponse error when applicable. Acupuncture: ACU.1 Whic h type of practitioner did you see? [Interviewer: read choices below] Mark all that apply. If more than one marked in ACU.1 ask ACU.2 1) MD/DO (goto PRT.3) 2) Chiropractor (goto acupuncturist, MD/DO or chiropractor (goto PRT.3) 4) Other (goto PRT.3) Though we had very little data on this question, it is worth noting that one respondent was quite adamant that her acupuncturist w as an M.A.C, meaning she had a Master of Acupuncture degree . The respondent strongly felt that the categories did not adequately represent what her acupuncturist was. ACU.2 During the past 12 months, which practitioner did you see the most for acupuncture? We had no data for this question. 11 Chiropractic or Osteopathic Manipulation CHI.1 Which did you see, a practitioner for chiropractic manipulation or osteopathic manipulation or both? 1) Practitioner for chiropractic (goto PRT.3) 2) Practitioner for osteopathic (goto PRT.3) 3) Practitioner for both chiropractic and osteopathic (goto CHI.2) We had very little data on this question, but a few issues worth mentioning did arise. When the interviewer first read this question, one respondent quickly answered, \"it was a practitioner,\" which made it clear that the question was perhaps confusing. Another respondent appeare d unable to answer, and said, \"W ell, he [his son] went to the chiropractor for a broken bone.\" We suspect that the terms may not have been familiar to him and therefore he did not know how to answer. CHI.2 During the past 12 months, which practitioner did you see the most? 1) Practitioner for Chiropractic (use as fill for rest of section) 2) Practitioner for Osteopathic (use as fill for rest of section) We had no data for this question. Massage: MAS.7 What type of practitioner did you see? Mark all that apply. If more than one chosen, goto MAS.8. (1) Licensed massage therapist (2) Physical therapist (3) MD/DO (PRT.3) (4) Nurse (PRT.3) (5) Licensed acupuncturist (PRT.3) (6) Chiropractor (PRT.3) (7) Naturopath (PRT.3) (8) Other (PRT.3) One respondent had seen the person in a massage office at a mall and \"assumed\" the person was a licensed massage therapist. The word \"licensed\" may be throwing some respondents off as they may not know for sure if the person is licensed. Another respondent commented that she was unaware that a m assage therapist needed to be \"licensed.\" She was therefore unsure whether or not the person was licensed. Also, one respondent selected \"other\" because the person he saw was a \"student practitioner\" and he did not think any of the available categories cap tured this. 12 Biofeedback: Bio.1 Did you do breathing exercises as part of [modality]? 1) Yes 2) No We had no data on this question. Repeated Questions: PRT.3 Do you currently see a practitioner for [modality] more, less, or about the same as you did one year ago? 1) More 2) Less 3) About the same Most respondents appeared not to have trouble answering this question, though one recurring issue did emerge. Specifically, for those who no longer practice the modality the options did not always appear so straightforward. Several of these respondents explained that at the time of the interview they were no longer seeing the practitioner and thought that the question might not be applicable. For instance, one respondent who was answering for his son who had seen a practitioner in the past 12 months but was not seeing a practitioner at the moment, hesitated before answering \"more.\" He answered this way, however, because a year ago he was not seeing a practitioner at all, but he had seen a practitioner over the course of the previous 12 months. It may be that the \"one year ago\" reference is vague or unclear, or perhaps too broad. However, it is not clear what a solution to this might be. For respondents who see a practitioner only sporadically or on an \"as needed\" basis, this question may also be difficult to answer. For instance, one respondent who had used homeopathic treatment in the past 12 months said she only uses it when she has a flare up and therefore found it difficult to compare her current use to her use 1 year ago. Additionally, another respondent explained how he only practices yoga when he's vacationing in Argentina. Because he does not practice yoga with any regularity, it was somewhat difficult for him to think about how to best answer the question. He did not consider his current, 'right at this moment\" use because he is not currently practicing yoga, but it appeared that over the course of the past year he had practiced it more than the previous year. However, he answered \"about the same\" be cause it best matched how often he saw a practitioner one year ago. 13 PRT.4 Compared to the past 12 months, do you plan to see a practitioner for [modality] more, less, or about the same during the next 12 months? 1) More 2) Less 3) About the same In gene ral, most respondents answered \"about the same.\" However, some did confidently predict either an increase or decrease in the visits to a practitioner. They tended to describe how their circumstances were going to change and they would either have more money or time to see a practitioner more often or had plans (such as enlisting in the army) that would decrease the amount of disposable time they had available to them. Additionally, one respondent attributed her plan to increase her use of homeopathic medicine to being a \"loyal listener of Dr. Oz,\" a celebrity -doctor with an afternoon talk show. She described herself as always \"looking into new things to try.\" For those who answered \"about the same,\" a number of them found the question relatively stra ightforward and easy to answer, but they did so based on the assumption that their circumstances would not change and therefore saw no need to answer \"more\" or \"less.\" However, some respondents did appear to have some difficulty projecting that far into th e future. This was particularly true for respondents who explained that they did not necessarily have some sort of 'plan\" in place. As with the previous question, PRT.3 , this was especially true for respondents who were using the modality \"as needed.\" For example, one respondent who often seeks out homeopathic remedies explained that she is not planning on spraining her ankle, but if she does, she will certainly use a homeopathic treatment to help heal the sprained ankle. She described this as a 'really har d\" question to answer. Another respondent who was answering with respect to her teenage daughter's use of yoga explained that it was very difficult for her to answer this question. She said, \"With teenagers one week it's one thing, the next week it's another.\" For some the 12 month period was too broad and they wished for the time frame to be specified more closely. One respondent was very annoyed by the question and kept asking, \"As when?\" She said her use of a practitioner changed at various times in the past 12 months and therefore she couldn't really make a comparison because it varied based on the specific time frame within the past 12 months that she compared it to. She said quite directly that the reference to 12 months was \"vague.\" This last issue is related to an issue that arose for the previous question PRT.3 . Specifically, respondents sometimes had difficulty with this question when they were no longer seeing the practitioner or no longer using the modality. For instance, one respondent explaine d that she was no longer seeing the practitioner at the time of the interview, and planned to continue to not see the person. In this instance it is not clear if she should say \"about the same\" or \"less,\" but neither seems exactly right. 14 With respect to herbs the use of the term \"more\" may be interpreted in different w ays. Rather than viewing it as \"more\" in terms of quantity, one respondent interpreted more to mean the strength of the dose might increase or go higher. PRT.5 Does your health insurance cover seeing a practitioner for [modality]? 1) Yes (goto PRT.6) 2) No (goto PRT.21) Very few respondents answered 'yes' to this question. Also, a number of respondents reported that they did not have health insurance and therefore skipped out of the question. Additionally, one respondent said she had \"health coverage\" (through a V.A. hospital) but not \"health insurance\" and therefore did not consider the question applicable to her case. A persistent theme across the interviews for those who did have health insurance, however, was tha t these respondents were not sure whether or not their insurance covered seeing a practitioner . In fact, eight respondents who gave answers of either \" yes\" or \"no\" revealed upon probing that they were actually not sure. Some respondents who answered \"no\" indicated that it had never occurred to them to inquire into whether the modality might in fact be covered by insurance. Though it did not occur with frequency, several respondents did explain that their health insurance only covered the modality if they had a justifiable \"medical reason\" for seeking treatment. One respondent said this was true for massage and another said this applied to gym memberships (and by e xtension, Pilates) as well. In both of their cases, the modalities were not covered by insurance. Finally, though this only emerged in one case, one respondent answered his question based on the homeopathic treatment his son was currently receiving at the time of the interview and not based on whether or not his insurance covers homeopathic treatment more generally. He answered \"no\" to this question because his son's treatment took place outside of the country and therefore outside of the insurance compan y's coverage area. However, had he visited a homeopath inside of the coverage area, his son's care would have been covered. It appeared that he was skipping ahead and correctly answering the following question ( PRT. 6 ) but consequently interpreted this que stion incorrectly. PRT.6 During the past 12 months, were any of the costs for your visits to a practitioner for [modality] covered by health insurance? 1) Yes (goto PRT.7a) 2) No (goto PRT.7) Though we collected very little data on this question, it is worth nothing that several respondents found this question to be repetitive. One respondent, visibly irritated by the question, asked, \"Didn't you just ask me that?\" It is possible that these respondents were not seeing a difference between this question and question PRT 5. 15 PRT.7 Which were not covered by your health insurance: the practitioner, the health problem, or something else? Mark all that apply. 1) Practitioner (goto PRT.21) 2) Health problem (goto PRT.21) 3) Other (goto PRT.21) We did not have enough data to analyze this question. PRT.7a During the past 12 months, did you have to pay a deductible before your health insurance would cover seeing a practitioner for [modality]? 1) Yes (next question) 2) No (goto PRT.8) This question was not extensively administered, but it did appear that one respondent was thinking about a co -payment and not his deductible. He answered \"yes\" and explained that his insurance company had raised his deductible from '$20\" to \"$25.\" Another respondent answered \"yes\" but clarified that she \"thought so.\" She went on to say, \"I don't really remember the terms. I'd have to look that up.\" PRT.7b How much was the deductible? $ __________________ Again, this question was not extensively administered, but of those who did answer, one appeared unsure of her answer and said \"IF there was a deductible, it was $300.\" It is not clear how or where she came up with this answer. Another respondent who had a lready revealed in the previous question that he might have been confusing his deductible with his copayment answered \"$25,\" which sounded like a rather small amount for a deductible. 16 PRT.7c Did you pay ALL of this deductible? 1) Yes (next question) 2) No (PRT.21) We did not have enough data to analyze this question. PRT.8 During the past 12 months, did your health insurance limit the number of visits that were covered for seeing a practitioner for [modality]? 1) Yes 2) No This question was not extensively administered, but nearly all who were asked the question answered \"no.\" However, most of them were also not 100% confident with their answers. For instance, one respondent explained that there might have been a limit, but she never reached i t and therefore was never informed that her health insurance would no longer pay for her visits. Therefore she assumed that there was not a limit on the number of visits. PRT.9 {fill for yes to question above: Other than limiting the number of visits,} D id your health insurance {also} limit the dollar amount covered for seeing a practitioner of [modality]? 1) Yes 2) No Again, this question was not extensively administered. However, of the respondents who were given the question and probed on their answers, most were not entirely confident with their answers. One respondent appeared annoyed by this question and did not see how it differed from the previous question. She stated, 'I just said, there's unlimited visits for one year.\" PRT. 10 Which limit affected your use of [modality] the most: the limit on the number of visits or the limit on the dollar amount? 1) number of visits (PRT.11) 2) dollar amount (PRT.16) 3) Neither affected my use of [modality] (didn't exceed limits) (PRT.21) DK (PRT.11) We did not have enough data to analyze this question. 17 [NEW] PRT.11 During the past 12 months, what is the maximum number of visits to a practitioner for [modality] that your health insurance would cover? ____________________ (number of visits) We d id not have enough data to analyze this question. [NEW] PRT.12 During the past 12 months, how many times did you see a practitioner for [modality]? ____________________ (number of visits) We did not have enough data to analyze this question. PRT. 13 How much did you pay out -of-pocket per visit to a practitioner for [modality]? $ __________________ (goto PRT.23) This question was not extensively administered and tested, but one respondent did indicate that the question was difficult for her to answer because the price varied. PRT.14 How much did you pay out -of-pocket per visit to a practitioner for [modality] for visits COVERED by health insurance? $ __________________ We did not have enough data to analyze this question. PRT.15 How much did you pay out -of-pocket per visit to a practitioner for [modality] for visits NOT COVERED by health insurance? $ __________________ GOTO PRT.23 This question was not extensively tested and administered, but it did appear that one respondent did not distinguish this question from the previous one that asked her how much she paid out of pocket. 18 PRT.16 During the past 12 months, what is the maximum dollar amount that your insurance would cover for visits to a practitioner for [modality]? ____________________ (amount in dollars) Though this question was not extensively administered, it is worth nothing that one respondent found it repetitive and said, \"You already asked that, in a way.\" PRT.17 During the past 12 months, did you spend more money for [modality] than was covered by health insurance? 1) Yes (next question) 2) No (next question) DK (goto PRT.21) This question was not extensively administered but one respondent appeared very annoyed by this question and said, \"Uh, DUH!\" because she believed she had already made her answer to this question clear. PRT.18 During the past 12 months, how many times did you see a practitioner for [modality]? ____________________ (number of visits) We did not have enough data to analyze this question. PRT.19 How much did you pay out -of-pocket per visit to a practitioner for [modality] for visits COVERED by health insurance? $ __________________ This question was not extensively tested, but the same respondent who had earlier stated that his deductible was $25 similarly answered $25 here, which provides further evidence that he was getting co -payment an d deductible confused. PRT.21 During the past 12 months, how many times did you see a practitioner for [modality]? ____________________ (number of visits) 19 For respondents who saw a practitioner on a consistent and regular basis, this question appeared fairly straightforward and only required some basic mathematical calculations on their part. For example, a respondent who had seen a practitioner for acupunct ure 2 times a month for 10 months answered \"20.\" However, some respondents failed to calculate out the number of times they went and instead provided answers like, \"I went every 2 -3 weeks\" or \"I went once a week.\" We did not ask them to be more specific because it appeared that this was what they interpreted the question to be asking. We also found that several respondents provided answers that appeared inconsistent with what they had revealed earlier in the interview. However, it was not clear why these inconsistencies were present in their answers. Though this last issue pertained to only one respondent, this may nonetheless be an issue that is pertinent when the supplement is more widely distributed. One respondent had gone on several retreats in the last 12 months where mantra meditation was routinely practiced, and she therefore found this question very difficult to answer. The retreats involved practitioner guided mantra mediation sessions throughout the week that the retreat took place. If these sessions do in fact count as visits with a practitioner (note: the respondent did count them as such), the number of visits was very difficult for her to recall. She initially answered \"two\" when she first heard th e question, but her elaboration of her answe r revealed that this was inaccurate. [NEW] PRT.22 On average, how much did you pay out -of-pocket for each visit to a practitioner for [modality]? $ __________________ Some respondents qualified their answers by not just stating how much they paid out of pocket but also stated how long the visit with the practitioner was. For some respondents, their answers varied based on how long the visit with the practitioner lasted. For example, one respondent said she paid $30 for a 20 minute session with an energy healer and another respondent answered $125 but explained that his visit lasted 90 minutes. Though the question a sks them to answer \"on average,\" several respondents nonetheless wanted to explain that their answered varied from visit to visit. T his may also be a useful caveat for data users to be aware of. In addition to the previous issue, some respondents also had a difficult time with this question because their involvement in the modality was through a gym membership. Those respondents who encountered this dilemma offered a range of responses, some answering \"nothing or 0,\" others providing the gym fee as the answer, and other respondents attempted to calculate out the cost of each trip to the gym. This seemed to particularly characterize respondents who had practiced yoga and/pr Pilates. 20 Several respondents also described circumstances wherein their visits to the practitioner were wh at they characterized as \"free.\" Sometimes these were in exchange for some sort of work or service on the ir part. One woman described how her visits to an acupuncturist were part of a \"barter arrangement\" and therefore not technically \"free,\" which left her feeling unable to answer the question. Another respondent explained how the costs associated with a man tra meditation retreat were exchanged for her help in the kitchen. Other respondents had friends or family members who provided the services for them and therefore free of charge. In these cases, more often than not the respondent explained that he or she was unable to answer the question or simply answered \"it cost nothing.\" PRT.23 During the past 12 months, did you see a practitioner for [modality] for any of these reasons? Yes/no (1) To treat or manage physical or emotional symptoms (2) To prevent a specific disease or health problem (3) To treat or manage a specific disease or health problem In general, respondents found the response items to be very similar. This was particularly true for item #1 and item #3. Respondents asked us to re -read the quest ion, to clarify, or simply commented, \"Didn't you just ask me that?\" The respondents tended not to see a difference between \"symptoms\" and \"health problem,\" and often saw the two as going hand- in-hand. Additionally, the line between prevention and treatme nt was not always totally clear to respondents. For instance, one respondent who practices Pilates to help with back pain explained that he picked to \"prevent a specific disease...\" because he hopes to prevent his back pain from getting worse. He added that he also wants to treat his back pain as well. It is not clear if he is applying an overly liberal understanding of \"to prevent' in this case or not. The fact that the response items appeared very similar to respondents may not in and of itself be a \"pr oblem,\" but a second, somewhat related issue likely is in fact a problem. Specifically, respondents incorrectly assumed that the question was asking them to pick the response that best characterized their circumstances. For example, one respondent, upon he aring the first item, stated that she wanted to hear the remaining response options before answering \"yes\" or \"no.\" For some respondents this meant that they would have answered \"yes\" to more than one item and for others, this meant that they actually woul d have answered \"no\" to all of the items but thought that at least one response option needed to be selected. Some respondents took issue with the reference to both physical and emotional symptoms in the same response item. For nearly all of the responde nts who answered \"yes\" to this question, they described having either emotional symptoms or physical symptoms, but never both simultaneously. Some respondents hesitated when answering this question because only one of the two applied and they were not sure if they should answer \"yes\" 21 or \"no.\" One respondent even commented specifically that asking about both emotional and physical symptoms at the same time made the question difficult to answer. In addition to these issues just discussed, some respondents had questions about the definitions of terms used in the item responses. One respondent was not sure if \"physical symptoms\" included pain. Another respondent similarly wondered what \"physical' referred to in this context. She ultimately answered yes because she was thinking about pain associated with her back. PRT.24 During the past 12 months, did you see a practitioner for [modality] for any of these reasons? Yes/no (1) Because medical treatments such as prescription medications or surgery were not helping you (2) Because medical treatments such as prescription medications or surgery were too expensive (3) Because [modality] combined with medical treatments such as prescription medications or surgery would help you (4) Because prescription medication does not work for the health problem you want to treat or prevent (5) Because prescription medication causes side effects (6) Because prescription or over -the-counter drugs are too expensive (7) Because [modality] treats the cause and not just the symptoms (8) Because the practitioner spends more time with you than medical doctors (9) Because the practitioner treats the whole person and not just one part (10) Because I can participate in decisions about my health with the practitioner After a pre liminary analysis of the first 5 or so interviews we noted that respondents found the reference to \"medical treatments\" in the first three items unclear. We added the clause \"such as prescription medications or surgery\" to help clarify the intent of \"medical treatments.\" Though this became clearer to respondents, another issue related to these questions remained. For respondents who were not receiving or using any medical treatments other than the modality mentioned in the question stem, these questions appeared not to be applicable. In fact, a number of respondents specifically commented that these items were not relevant to their circumstances. To them an answer of \"no\" did not really reflect their situations. The question almost appears to assume that the respondent is currently receiving or has received medical treatments for a particular issue. For insta nce, one respondent who received massages explained that there was not a prescription medication available that could give him the same experience or results, so there was really no basis for comparison. This change in the wording also appears to make item (6) appear redundant or repetitive. It also appeared that some respondents were answering the question based not on what motivated them to seek out the practitioner or use the particular m odality but rather on whether or not they thought the statement accurately described the modality. However, 22 some respondents did make it clear that they saw this distinction and were answering the question based only on what motivated them to participate i n the modality. Because [modality] combined with medical treatments such as prescription medications or surgery would help you: Here one respondent was thinking of injections into his joint areas as \"medical treatments\" that might work with his modality (massage). However, he does not currently receive these treatments but would only need them if h e gets injured. In this sense, it is not clear if he answered this question correctly or not. Because prescription medication does not work for the health pr oblem y ou want to treat or prevent: Very few respondents answered \"yes\" to this question. One respondent who did, however, explained that painkillers helped her back pain but she \"couldn't function when [she] took the pills\" and therefore considered them not to \"work.\" Because modality tre ats the cause and not just the symptoms: Some respondents found this very straightforward and were able to answer comfortable. Ti was very clear to them what the \"cause\" in their situation was and what the symptoms were. One respondent had a more transcendental understanding of this statement, and explained that her traditional healer takes her to the \"spiritual world\" where the \"cause\" lies, as she put it. This appeared to fall outside of a traditional Western medicine based understanding of cause and effe ct but nonetheless was applicable to her situation. Some, however, did not find the statement to be all that clear. As one respondent put it, \"If it treats the cause, I would think it treats the symptoms. That question doesn't sound right. I mean, if it takes care of the cause then you don't have the symptoms.\" Other respondents similarly remarked that the statement confused them. It may be that the distinction between symptoms and causes is not clear to respondents, particularly for those who see them going hand -in-hand. One last example appears to highlight the general tendency of respondents often to try to make their experiences match the response items. She thought this was referring to the \"specialized training' that the practitioner has, stating, \"T hey have extensive training and they can give you the best advice for the long term.\" It did not appear that this respondent fully understood what this question was asking of her. Because the practitioner spends more time with you than medical doctors: Several respondents agreed with this statement but then went on to point out that in their situations they were, in essence, paying for the extra time and therefore it did not mean that CAM practitioners in general spend more time with patients than medica l doctors. As one respondent put it after hearing this question, \"Well, yeah, [because] I paid for 20 minutes.\" Another respondent similarly explained that you \"pay for the time\" with the practitioner and so \" of course you get more time with them\" (he was thinking specifically about massage practitioners). One respondent found this difficult to answer because the time he spent with the practitioner was in a class setting and therefore was not \"one -on-23 one.\" He pointed out, however, that he was not sure if this should be considered \"health care\" or \"health treatment.\" Because the practitioner treats the whole person and not just one part: This question appeared to work better for some modalities more than others, meaning that respondents were better able to understand what the question was asking. Some thought this meant that the practitioner treated not just their physical symptoms, but th eir emotional and mental health as well. For example, one respondent described how her practitioner asked her about her lifestyle and her diagnosed depression. She did not think that her primary doctor would ever do this. However, for some, particularly those who were considering the question in the context of massage, the statement almost appeared contradictory. Several noted that they actually want their masseuse to focus on only one part of, for example, their backs, and not their entire bodies. Therefor e they did not see how this would be motivating factor to pursuing massage treatment. Others noted that their modality did not have a \"practitioner -patient\" kind of relationship, as was the case with both Pilates and yoga. Because I can participate in de cisions about my health with my practitioner: A number of respondents, particularly those who were answering it in relation to massage or other \"hands on\" treatment appeared to interpret this question in similar ways. Several respondents who agreed with this statement said they did so because they can tell their practitioners where to focus and which parts of their bodies need more attention. Others offered slightly different interpretations of this statement. One thought that it meant \"sitting down with m y doctor, presenting the symptoms and then working together to come up with a solution.\" She said this did not characterize her relationship with her shaman. Another respondent who agreed with this statement said it meant that she was a \"proactive person and [she] knows her condition better than anyone else.\" She went on to add, \"Western doctors especially tend to be very dogmatic and they don't have a clue.\" Her experience with her acupuncturist, however, was quite the opposite of this. Finally, one resp ondent who was asked this question in relation to his son's use of homeopathic treatment said it did not make sense, as he (meaning his son) \"can't participate in decisions about this health\" because the respondent, his father, was the one who chose to take him to see a homeopath in the first place. 24 PRT.25 During the past 12 months, did you see a practitioner for [modality] for any of these reasons? Yes/no (1) To stay healthy (2) To improve your energy (3) To Improve your immune function (4) To improve your physical ability (5) To improve your athletic or sports performance (6) To improve your sexual performance (7) To improve your concentration (8) To improve your memory (9) To improve your flexibility (10) To improve your muscle strength (11) To cleanse/detoxify your body In general, there were two main issues related to this question that cognitive interviews highlighted. As we discussed earlier when summarizing the results for PRT 24 , it appeared that respondents sometimes answered the questions based not on what motivated them but rather on how they would characterized their experience. In fact, one respondent even asked midway through being probed on these questions if the interviewer wanted to know why she used the particular modality or how it affected her. She admitted that it's \"easy to say yes to these after the fact.\" Also, it appeared that respondents were often interpreting the items in a rather broad and loose w ay and attempting to make them \"fit\" into their situation in order to answer affirmatively. For one respondent who was speaking on behalf of his son's experience, these were all very difficult to answer because he did not feel confident to ascertain whether or not these were his son's motivations for using the modality. It also appeared that another respondent who was answering on behalf of his son was basing his answers not on what actually motivated his son but rather what he told his son would be the outcome of using the modality, in this case, herbs. The respondent admitted that he did not actually think the herb would have the effects that he told his son it would. However, he wanted to encourage his son to take the herb and knew this would work. Below we summarize information on each of the response items. To stay healthy: We asked respondents to describe how they were understanding \"healthy\" in the context of this question. A number of respondents commented that this either seemed \"too broad\" or 'too obvious.\" As one respondent put it, \"You go to a doctor to stay healthy. It's too obvious.\" Another asked, \"What's healthy? That's too general.\" When asked if she was using a vegetarian diet to stay healthy, one respondent stated, \"That seems counterproductive because I wouldn't do the diet to stay unhealthy.\" Finally, one respondent commented, \"Any t ime you go to a practitioner you're [going to stay healthy].\"For others \"staying healthy\" became synonymous with the outcome they hoped to achieve by using the modality or seeing a practitioner for the modality. For example, 25 one respondent who was using ma ssage to prevent and minimize injuries to his joints defined staying \"healthy\" as just that - being free of joint pain and avoiding injuries. Another respondent who drank acai juice defined \"healthy\" as \"being hydrated and normal weight,\" which were the main reasons why she drank the juice. To improve your physical ability: Though we did not have a significant amount of data on this item, one respondent did equate this with his \"overall health,\" which would suggest that it may be redundant or repetitive . To improve your athletic or sports performance: In general respondents who answered yes to this item thought that it was referring to improving one's athletic performance in a competitive setting. One respondent specifically stated that she was thinkin g not of it improving her cycling abilities but her ability to outrace other cyclists. Again, another respondent though this was referring to competitive athletic activities and not simply \"going to the gym.\" To improve your memory: For one respondent who answered yes to this question in relation to her visits with a traditional healer, improving her memory meant \"recovering [her] memory of painful events.\" However, it is not clear if this is what the item is intending to capture. Other respondents appeare d to stretch their interpretations of this item so that it \"fit\" their situations. For example, one respondent answered yes and explained that he did so because he thought being given instructions from the chiropractor might somehow improve his son's memor y. Also, this does not appear to be a motivation for seeking out chiropractic care as the question asks. In addition to this example, another respondent who answered yes when asked about her use of acai commented that being hydrated (her main reason for dr inking acai juice) helps her to think more clearly and therefore, by extension, improves her memory. This too appeared to be an attempt to stretch the response item so it fit her experience. To improve your muscle strength: It is worth noting that one person said yes to this even though she was not entirely sure it applied. However, she wanted to go ahead and say yes 'just in case.\" To cleanse/detoxify your body: Respondents offered a variety of interpretations of this statement. Some considered it to be referring to \"a cleanse\" in the very literal sense, such as a colon cleanse. One respondent provided the example of the cayenne pepper and maple syrup diet. Others thought it referred to the period after an addict stops using drugs or alcohol and attempts to purge the body of these substances. One respondent who answered yes to this question revealed upon probing that the cleansing of her body was actually a 'side effect' of the homeopathic medicine she had taken. In this sense it appeared that she was defining this as a negative consequence and not a motivation for using the treatment in the first place. 26 Others interpreted it more generally as the releasing or purging of impurities and other toxins from the body. One respondent defined this as \"releas ing muscle tension and a lot of built up energy and anxiety.\" One respondent who answered \"no\" to this question nonetheless provided an example of what she thought this question was referencing. She described how she uses foot pads at night on the bottom of her feet. She stated that this helps detoxify her body. 2693 thought this referred to 'taking the bacteria that may have accumulated in the body out. For still others this was interpreted to be more symbolic, as in the case of a \"mental or emotional cle anse' as one respondent put it. One respondent described it as the \"release of negative energy.\" She was thinking of this in the context of seeing a spiritual healer. Additionally, one respondent defined it as a \"mental cleansing - a clearing - an emptines s\" in reference to her use of mantra meditation. Another respondent described this as \"getting rid of bad energy.\" He answered \"no\" to this question, however, because he found the wording \"off -putting.\" PRT.26 During the past 12 months, did you see a practitioner for [modality] for any of these reasons? Yes/no (1) Because it was recommended by a medical doctor (2) Because it was recommended by family, friends, or co -workers (3) Because you learned about it from a magazin e, tv program, or on the internet (4) Because you can do it on your own (5) Because it is natural (6) Because it focuses on the whole person and not just one part (7) Because you wanted to try something different (8) Because it was part of your upbringing Again, it appeared that respondents were frequently answering based not on what had motivated them to use the modality in the previous 12 months but rather whether or not they agreed that these statements accurately characterized their experience with the modality. It also appeared that sometimes respondents were thinking outside of the 12 month time frame mentioned in the question. To give a concrete example of this, one respondent who answered \"yes\" to Pilates having been \"recommended by family, friends, or co -workers\" rev ealed that this recommendation occurred 6 years ago, when he first started practicing Pilates. Below are comments on each of the response items. Because it was recommended by a medical doctor: It appeared that respondents were primarily thinking of \"West ern,\" \"mainstream\" medical doctors when they responded to this question. For example, one respondent stated that she was thinking of an encounter between her and a doctor at a local hospital and another said he was specifically thinking of a doctor he encountered during an emergency room visit. 27 Because it was recommended by family, friends, or co- workers: This appeared fairly straightforward to respondents, though one respondent who answered \"no\" revealed that the faculty at his conservatory recommended a n Alexander Technique class to him. However, he did not consider them to be fall under \"friends\" or \"co-workers.\" Because you learned about it from a magazine, tv program, or on the internet: Respondents in general could not recall a specific moment when they learned about the modality through one of these sources but several commented that they, as one respondent put it, \"had heard about [the modality]\" prior to using it and therefore \"guessed\" that they had learned about it through a magazine, tv progra m, etc. One respondent who answered \"no\" to this question commented that she learned about traditional healers through books, however. Because you can do it on your own: We found that a number of respondents did not fully understand what this statement meant. In fact, 6 different respondents asked for clarification. This may be that the statement made less sense when applied to some modalities. For example, for both massage and acupuncture, respondents remarked that they did not understand how they could \"do it on their own.\" One respondent, when asked about acupuncture, even asked if this meant \"sticking needles in myself,\" which in her mind, seemed incomprehensible. However, others thought that this might refer to the ability to find the practitioner or find the treatment (such as homeopathy or herbs) on his or her own, without a referral from a doctor or a doctor's prescription, or without needing the practitioner or treatment to be covered by insurance. It also meant that respondents could go at a time that was convenient for them rather than having to work around someone else's schedule. For 3157 this meant that he could go and pay on his own, but considered this 'obvious\" and didn't consider it a motivation for seeing a massage practitioner. For another respondent this similarly meant that she could find a massage therapist, go and pay on her own. She can go when it is convenient to her. Because it is natural: A number of respondents answered yes when asked this question, but it is not clear if they did so because they agreed that the modality was natural or if this was an actual motivation for pursuing the modality. Respondents offered a number of different definitions of \"natural.\" One respondent thought it referred to \"something that's part of the natural world\" and another described it as anything \"without additives or chemicals.\" For another respondent, this meant that the modality was \"simple\" and did not involve any \"medications or contraptions\" (he was commenting in reference to Pilates). Thou gh some respondents were able to provide descriptions of what they thought \"natural\" referred to, others were left somewhat confused by the question. For example, one respondent asked what natural meant in this context and added, \"It's not natural to see a chiropractor.\" Similarly, another respondent remarked that mantra meditation was the \"opposite\" of natural, stating, \"I t isn't natural; you have to practice. It's one of the hardest things I've ever done.\" Another thought it meant that it doesn't' rely on chemicals. 28 Because it focuses on the whole person and not just one part: One respondent remarked that this item sounded like a question that was asked earlier. And another respondent thought an example of this phenomenon would be trying to get rid of pain in one's finger rather than doing something to control his weight (which would involve the whole body) . Because you wanted to try something different: One respondent thought this made it sound like it was something out of the norm or unusual, whereas for her massage is something that she thinks \"everybody does at some point.\" However, several other respondent s thought this simply meant trying somet hing she had never tried before. For example, one respondent said they had tried \"routine doctors\" and it had not worked, therefore she decided to see a naturopath simply to \" try something different.\" Because it was part of your upbringing: One respondent thought that his suggesting to his son that he drink aloe V era juice would be an example of how his upbringing had motivated his son to use it. However, he said no when asked if it was rec ommended by family, friends, etc. Another respondent answered yes to this and said because his family in India had recommended his son try homeopathic treatments. However, it is not clear if this counts under \" upbringing\" or if this would be more appropriate under the item \"was recom mended by family, friends, etc.\" PRT.27 During the past 12 months, did seeing a practitioner for [modality]...? Yes/no (1) Give you a s ense of control over your health? (2) Help you to relax? (3) Help you to reduce your stress level? (4) Motivate you to eat healthier? (5) Motivate you to eat more organic foods [ask #6 for respondents who report drinking alcohol in core] (6) Motivate you to cut back or stop drinking alcohol? [ask #6 for respondents who report smoking in core] (7) Motivate you to cut back or stop smoking cigarettes, cigars, or pipes? (8) Motivate you to exercise more regularly? (9) Improve your overall health and make you feel better? (10) Give you more hope for the future? (11) Increase your ability to focus? (12) Make you feel better emotionally? (13) Make it easier to cope with health problems? (14) Improve your outlook on life? (15) Improve your relationships with others? (16) Improve your self -confidence? 29 There were a number of issues that emerged across all 16 items in this question. First, it appeared that some respondents who answered \"no\" were doing so not because the modality failed to motivate them to, say exercise more regularly, but because they were already exercising regularly. This is an important point since it does not suggest that the modality \"didn't work,\" or did not improve their circumstances. Rather, their circumstances were such that they did not need to be improved or did not need to be motivated. Second, respondents often explained that the relationship between their use of the modality and these improvements or increased motivations was indirect. In ot her words, when a respondent answered \"yes,\" mantra meditation had improved her self - confidence, she meant that it had benefited her in other ways that then spilled over to improve her self -confidence. Related to this second issue, it appeared that respon dents were sometimes trying to make the items \"fit\" their own situations and perhaps even exaggerating the positive benefits they had received from the modality. It is not clear that they would have described these as benefits of the modality were they not provided for them. In fact, one respondent even remarked, upon hearing the question asking whether or not Pilates had increased his self -confidence, ,that he had never thought about it in these terms, but would answer yes nevertheless. Finally, for res pondents who were answering on behalf of their children who had used the modality, these questions were extremely difficult for them to answer, at least with any accuracy. For instance, one respondent remarked repeatedly, \"I couldn't say,\" when the question was administered. It may or may not be appropriate to ask these questions for the child version of the supplement. Give you a sense of control over your health? One respondent who answered \"yes\" to this question described how the modality had given her a sense of control because she can \"choose how often she goes.\" For another respondent the modality had allowed her to take a more \"proactive,\" as she put it, approach to her health care. But others were more specific and thought that this meant their symptoms were alleviated somewhat and/or their health problems were improving, as was the case for a respondent who described having fewer back issues and increased flexibility because of Pilates. Finally, one respondent interpreted this to mean that he had a \"better sense of [his] body, specifically [his] metabolism.\" Help you to relax? Most of the respondents who answered \"yes\" to this item described feeling relaxed during the treatment, such as during massage or during a yoga class. They tended not to describe feeling relaxed beyond the actual time spent with the practitioner or while practicing the modality. However, some respondents did describe feeling relaxed in general or only after their treatment. For example, one respondent said he only felt relax ed from a massage after the session ended. Help you to reduce your stress level? To one respondent the items 'help to relax \" and \"help to reduce your stress level ' were 'intertwined.' She stated, 'if you know how to relax, you know how to reduce your stress 30 level. This may indicate that the response items are redundant and that one could be removed from the survey. Motivate you to eat healthier? One respondent described how practicing Pilates had made him more aware that he needed to eat healthier but did not actually motivate him to eat healthier (he did, however, answer \"yes\" to this item). Another respondent similarly described how using herbs has helped him to be more aw are of eating healthier but had not necessarily altered his eating habits. Motivate you to exercise more regularly? Several respondents remarked that they were already exercising on a regular basis and therefore, \"no\" the modality had not motivated them to exercise more regularly. One of these respondents who was already exer cising on a very regular basis with intense workouts every day explained that massage enabled him to exercise even more because his \"recovery time was shorter.\" However, though he answered \"yes\" to this question, it appeared that massage did not motivate him to exercise more regularly; rather, it enabled him to exercise more regularly. Motivat e you to eat more organic food: Though we did not gather a l ot of data on this question, i t did appear that many respondents considered organic foods to be 'healthier' than non- organic foods, and therefore this might be subsumed under the item asking if they have felt motivated to eat healthier. However, not all re spondents considered organic foods healthier. Improve your overall health and make you feel better: Of the respondents who were probed on this question, most of them thought this was referring to not just their physical health but their mental and emotional health as well. Others invoked a sort of holistic mind- body connection and thought that the modali ty they had used tapped into this. However, one respondent did point out that for him these were actually two separate questions and that he would answer \"improve your overall health\" and \"make you feel better\" differently. More hope for the future: This response item appeared to perplex a number of respondents. One described it as \"sounding funny.\" Another respondent laughed when he first heard the question and commented that it sounded 'like some kind of religious thing.\" And yet another described it as \"out of left field\" and did not see what it had to do with homeopathic medicine. But other respondents appeared to comprehend the question and understood it to be referring to foreseeing improvement in their emotional and/or physical health. Alternatively for some respondents it meant that they would maintain their current level of health and fitness. For example, one respondent who answered \"yes\" thought that it meant he would have the flexibility of a 21 year old when he turned 40. 31 Increase your abilit y to focus? One respondent thought this meant that it had helped her concentrate, which was the same thing she talked about in an earlier question. Feel better emotionally: For one respondent this referred to her \" overall health,\" and stated that she was thinking of her emotional health when she earlier answered \"yes\" to the item asking if the modality had \" improved her overall health and made her feel better.\" Another respondent also provided an interpretation of this item that sounded very similar to a previous one, namely, the item asking if the modality had reduced his overall stress level. Make it easier to cope with health problems? A number of respondents said they didn't have health problems and therefore this question was not really applicable. In these cases they did not necessarily want to answer \"no.\" Rather, they thought a \"not applicable\" option was better. Improve your outlook on life? To many respondents this appeared to mean the same thing as \"give you hope for the future.\" One respondent also remarked that it sounded similar to \"feel better emotionally.\" However, one respondent did think that this item sounded more \"permanent\" than the other items. Improve your relationships with others: One respondent who answered yes to this question said this was an indirect result of the people his son associated with when he visited the chiropractor's office. It was geared toward teenagers and his son made friends in the setting. Another respondent who a lso answered yes said that she had grown closer to her daughter because they practiced mantra meditation together. Improve your self confidence: For one respondent who answered yes to this, she did so because p racticing tai chi meant she then had \" more knowledge about how to do somet hing.\" She went on to add that \"somebody told me if I knew every move of tai chi I could beat anyone in a fight.\" PRT.28 During the past 12 months, did you see a practitioner for [modality] for spiritual reasons? (1) Yes (2) No All but three respondents answered \"no\" to this question. For those who answered \"yes,\" one said she did so in her relation to seeing a shaman and explained, \"I wanted to feel connected with what I consider my higher power.\" For another respondent, though she answered yes, she described her answer as \"mixed\" and explained that she sometimes combines a body cleanse with a \"spiritual and mental cleanse.\" Finally, the last 32 respondent who answered yes to this said she practices mantra meditation for spiritual reasons because \"meditation is always spiritual.\" For those who said no, they seemed to regard the question as fairly straightforward. However, some did appear to find the question odd. When asked if he did movement therapy for spiritual reasons, one respondent laughed and said that the question w as \"silly.\" Additionally, several respondents thought this question was referring to religion or religious beliefs which they did not see as tied to their seeing a practitioner for a modality. PRT.29 Of the follo wing reasons, which was the most important reason for seeing a practitioner for [modality]? (1) To treat or manage physical or emotional symptoms (2) To prevent a specific disease or health problem (3) To treat or manage a specific disease or health problem Many o f the issues relevant to this question are summarized under question PRT.23 as well. Though question PRT .23 asks respondents to answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to all of the response options, respondents tended to think that the question was asking them to pick the most appropriate, or as worded in this question, \"most important\" reason for seeing a practitioner for the modality. Based on results from preliminary interviews, we decided to move this question after PRT. 23 which did appear to make it easier for respondents to recall the items to which they had answered \"yes.\" However, respondents still found the items too similar and \"somewhat redundant,\" as one respondent put it, and therefore found it difficult to decide upon an answer. PRT.30 For what symptom or health problems did you see a practitioner for [modality] the most [to prevent/to treat or manage]? (Computer will display conditions picked earlier in core or for prevent computer will display conditions asked about in core) This question was awkward to administer. Many respondents stared at us blankly after we read the question. This may have been the result of not having their answers from the \"core\" section as the comment in parentheses indicates the interviewer ordinarily would. However, because respondents had presumably answered yes to one of the items in the previous question, it would have seeme d that they would have been able to provide an answer to the question. Most were able to, but we often had to remind them of their answers to question PRT. 29, a scenario not likely to take place in the field. 33 PRT.31 For which ONE of these health conditions did you use (modality) the most? _________________________ [CONDITION] *If respondent cannot choose one condition, probe for condition most important for using modality. We did not have enough data to analyze this question. PRT.32 Did you receive any of these medical treatments for [ condition for which modality used the most ]? Please say yes or no to each. (1) Prescription Medications (2) Over- the-counter medications (3) Surgery (4) Physical therapy (5) Mental Health Counseling Because this was not labeled as a \"new\" question, we rarely probed on it and therefore do not have enough data for analysis. PRT.33 How much do you think [modality] helped your [condition]? Would you say a great deal, some, only a little, or not at all? (1) A great deal (2) Some (3) Only a little (4) Not at all We did not probe extensively on this question and therefore had very little data for analysis. PRT.34 During the past 12 months, how important was your use of [modality] in maintaining your hea lth and well -being? Would you say very important, somewhat important, slightly important, or not at all important? (1) Very important (2) Somewhat important (3) Slightly important (4) Not at all important 34 We did not probe extensively on this question and therefore had very little data for analysis . PRT.35 (sometimes PRT.36) How often did you take/use [modality] in the past 12 months? ____ times per day/week/month/year This question was fairly straightforward for respondents who engaged in their CAM practice on a consistent basis. For example, for the respondent who consistently took a daily herbal supplement, it appeared fairly easy for her to respond, \"One time per day .\" However, for respondents who engaged more sporadically or episodically with their CAM practices, this question appeared to pose more difficulty. This seemed to be the case for the respondent who talked about her inhaler as a homeopathic treatment; since she only takes the inhaler as needed, the respondent found it difficult to answer this question. When asked if she could estimate the frequency with which she used the inhaler in the past 12 months, she said she really couldn't say. Yet, even though the question appeared fairly straightforward for the consistent CAM users, respondents' answers may still be misleading given the nature of the question. For example, for the respondent who consistently takes red yeast tablets and niacin 4 times per day, the question was fairly straightforward; he answered, \"4 times per day.\" However, this respondent has only been taking these supplements for the past 6 months. Nonetheless, given the nature of the question, this nuance gets lost in the respondent's survey resp onse. A data user might interpret this man's response to mean that the respondent has been engaging consistently in this CAM practice 4 times per day for the past 12 months; however, this was not the case. Similarly, the woman who just began taking yoga cl asses 6 weeks ago replied \"2 times per week.\" Or, speaking about his son's 2-month trial with Gingko Biloba last year, a respondent replied, \"1 time per day.\" From a data user's perspective, these answers could imply a very different relationship with the CAM practice, as they may suggest a consistent pattern of CAM use over the past 12 months. Survey designers should be aware of this and determine whether this interpretation pattern is significant and whether it needs to be addressed. Finally, respondents ' experiences did not always map onto the response option format provided by the survey instrument. For example, one respondent answered \"10 months out of 12.\" That is, out of the previous 12 months, this respondent took 2 pills of an herbal supplement eve ryday for 10 out of the last 12 months. This respondent does not think about his experience with this herbal supplement in terms of the response format provided (e.g., times per day/week/year). While respondents' inability to conform to the response option format provided by the instrument might be attributable to respondents' unique patterns of CAM use, it might also be attributable to the unique features of a particular CAM modality. For example, when talking about her use of special diets, one respondent replied, \"90% of the time.\" Overall, it was awkward to administer this 35 question in the context of special diets (e.g., How often did you use a vegetarian diet in the past 12 months?). At first, this respondent said \"3 times per day,\" and then changed her response to \"90% of the time.\" Here, it appeared that the respondent was thinking about her use of this diet over the past 12 months, during which time she practiced a vegetarian diet 90% of the time. In the context of special diets, the response option format provided by the survey instrument might be particularly ill- fitting or inappropriate given respondents' experiences engaging in this particular CAM practice. PRT.36/37 During the past 12 months, did you buy a self -help book or other materials such as a DVD, CD, or Video to learn about (modality)? (1) Yes (goto PRT.37) (2) No (goto next modality) Very few respondents answered \"yes\" to this question. There did appear to be some indication, however, that those who did answer \"yes\" answered incorrectly. For example, one respondent explained that she received a book from her chiropractor. She did not pay for it but assumed that it was somehow paid for through the chiropractor's fee. Another respondent who answered yes said she watched a DVD on the internet but pointed out that she did not pay anything for it. One respondent who answered \"no\" said that he does receive magazines, however, on the subject of herbs, which suggests he should have, perhaps, answered \"yes\" to this question. PRT.37/38 How much did you pay for these materials? $ ________________________ We had very little data for this que stion since most respondents answered \"no\" to the previous one. However, the summary of question PRT. 36/37 may be relevant to this question as well. 36 Complementary and Alternative Medicine Supplement Now I am going to ask you about some health services you may have used.
