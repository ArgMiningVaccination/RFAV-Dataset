At a time of great scientific advance and a culture of evidence-based health care, there is increasingreferral to and use of complementary therapies. An under-standing of the meaning behind this paradox may usefullyinform our orthodox practice.Aim. To investigate why people attend complementary prac- titioners.Method. Semi-structured interviews with a purposive sam- ple of 20 people drawn from a study population of 176 peo-ple currently attending a variety of complementary practi-tioners in South West England. Data were collected andanalysed using a constant comparative method.Results. Most people had a chronic health problem, had already consulted their general practitioner (GP), and hadtheir GP's approval for seeking complementary therapy.Many people were attending a complementary therapist forthe first time and most were fee-paying patients. People'sreasons for consulting were encompassed by three cate-gories. The commonest of these is 'Doctors can't helpmuch', and the other two are 'Doctors are hopeless' and 'It(orthodox medicine) may work but it's not acceptable.' Thehopes and aims for treatment included long-term or short-term symptom relief, improvement in function, better under-standing, advice on self-help or other therapies, gainingcontrol, and improving their ability to cope with their illness.Some people's main aim was to avoid or reduce orthodoxsteroid-based medication.Conclusion. These people were seeking out holistic and patient-centred health care, and were making their ownjudgements about what constituted an acceptable level ofrisk from medication use. The advances of scientific medi-cine and expert evidence-based advice were not always rel-evant to them. Keywords: alternative medicine; complementary medicine; orthodox medicine. Introduction SCIENTIFIC medicine is making big advances in drugs, tech- nology, and genetics, yet more and more patients use comp- lementary therapies. Evidence-based medicine dominates ourdiscourse, yet health professionals increasingly refer to and prac-tise complementary therapies that have little scientific evidence ofefficacy. What is the meaning behind these paradoxes, and whatcan we learn that will usefully inform our practice of orthodoxmedicine? Why do people go to complementary practitioners?There have been many surveys of the extent of complementary medicine use 1-5but few qualitative studies to help us understand their meaning. Surveys show that around 30% of the British gen-eral public have consulted a complementary therapist at sometime, 1and that the majority of patients use complementary medi- cine alongside or after orthodox treatment.2In a series of tionnaire studies6-8Furnham et alidentify the three most impor- tant reasons for seeking complementary treatment as i) a positiveevaluation of complementary treatment as treating the whole per-son, ii) the ineffectiveness of orthodox treatment, and iii) con- cern about the adverse effects of orthodox medicine. Over 10 years ago (1986) Sharma interviewed a sample of establishedusers of complementary medicine, and her results suggested thatpeople were motivated by a rational and pragmatic concern to getrelief from a specific disease on terms that were acceptable to themselves, and that treatment side-effects and the patient-prac- titioner relationship were both important. Similar concerns wereexpressed in two other qualitative studies of regular users carriedout in the United Kingdom in 1984 9and 1987.10In a more recent study of users of Chinese Medicine in the USA, patients did not reveal familiarity with Chinese Medicine per se, but experienced the care as holistic care: a model that Cassidy suggests could beused for improving orthodox medicine. 11 In 1995 a national survey of general practitioners (GPs) showed that, in an average week, 45% of GPs recommended orendorsed the use of complementary therapy; 21% referred a patient for complementary therapy, National Health Service (NHS) or private; and 10% used the therapies themselves. 12 Surveys in Norway,13New Zealand,14and the Netherlands15gave similar results. A qualitative study of a group of GPs whoemploy homeopathy in their everyday NHS work 16found that these practitioners saw their homeopathic practice as an attempt to recapture a holistic model of practice and to avoid the iatro-genic effects of orthodox medicine. The interview study presented here seeks to update this earlier research by revisiting the question of why people attend comple- mentary practitioners in the context of the rapidly changing NHS of the late 1990s. It also seeks to interview a more diverse sam-ple of patients than previous studies, and to do so while patientsare undergoing a course of complementary therapy. Method Setting and study sample The patient interviews were part of a wider study that involved 12 complementary practitioners recruiting all their new patientsover a four-month period in 1997. These practitioners included osteopaths, acupuncturists, massage therapists, a homeo- path, a reflexologist, a nutritional therapist, a physiotherapist (who iden-tified herself as a complementary practitioner), a counsellor, anda healer, and they worked in seven different settings in Somerset,including general practice surgeries, complementary medicine centres, and home practice. Most of their patients were fee-pay- ing, but one osteopath and the physiotherapist also saw NHSfunded patients. For the interviews, a sample size of 20 patients was considered capable of giving a wide range of responses and experienceswhile remaining a manageable number to transcribe and analyse.'Doctors can't help much': the search for an alternative C Paterson, MBChB, MRCGP, general practitioner, Warwick House Medical Centre, Upper Holway Road, Taunton, Somerset.

Twenty patients were interviewed by CP in their own home, and the interviews were audiotaped,with permission, and transcribed. The semi-structured interviewschedule included open questions that encouraged the person totell of their experience of illness and treatment in their own way.Using a constant comparative method, 18data collection and analysis were conducted in parallel, enabling the flow of ideasbetween the two processes. Data analysis The analysis used a process of inductive coding19to develop a coding scheme that enabled all the data to be categorized accord-ing to clear written guidelines. The transcript data for each cate-gory were then collected together in separate files; for example,all the statements relating to people's aims in seeking comp-lementary therapy were coded as category 2a and collected inone file. The data in each category was then summarized andthemes were developed. During the development stage of the cod- ing process, an experienced qualitative researcher, NB, indepen- dently coded three interviews and the results were compared.Either the differences were resolved or the coding scheme wasrevised. Results The number of new patients recruited into the main study was 176,which accounted for 57% of the new patients seen by the 12 prac-titioners in the chosen study sites over the four-month period. The presenting problem was categorized according to the International Classification for Primary Care, and 88% of cases were in themusculoskeletal category. The problem had been present for overa year in 41% of patients. The characteristics of the recruitedpatients, and of the sample interviewed, are shown in Table 1. Twenty interviews of between 30- and 60-minutes duration were carried out, with six refusals. Interviewees included patientsof 10 of the practitioners. Nearly half of the interviewees were consulting a complementary therapist for the first time, several people had tried one previous therapy for the same condition,and very few were regular users of complementary medicine. Allexcept one interviewee had consulted their GP about their prob- lem, and the exception was a man who had been referred by hisGP for a previous problem to the same osteopath. The majorityof people had told their GP, and several of those who had notsaid that their GP would approve because, for example, the prac- titioner practised in or alongside the GP surgery. Only one per- son was purposively holding back from telling her GP, the hesi-tation being partly fear of a negative response but partly the needto keep some control. Two people had received a negativeresponse from their GP. One of these was a woman with pain inher hip: 'My doctor, he said it won't cure the bone \u2014 well I know that, but be for pain isn't it. There's a lot of doctors believein it.'[Patient 42, seeing an acupuncturist.] For a substantial minority of interviewees, the GP had been the instigator of their treatment, either by a NHS referral or by sug- gesting they attend privately. The analysis uses a temporal framework to follow individuals from their illness experience through their experience of ortho-dox treatment to their hopes and aims in going for complemen-tary treatment. The structure of this analysis is shown in the left- hand column of Figure 1. Experience of illness Two people had an acute problem that they had had for less than two months, and four more described an illness of less than one year. The remaining people had chronic problems that they had suffered from for several years, and five people described it asaffecting them for most of their adult life. A wide variety of mus-culoskeletal problems were presented, but people with chest,nose and throat, and gastrointestinal problems were also includ-ed. On the basis of their illness experience, the interviewees can be split into two broad groups that have been labelled iteratively, by paraphrasing interviewees' words: 1. 'It makes life a misery'; people with severe and/or very both- ersome symptoms and a low level of general well-being. 'I just really got fed up to the back teeth after two odd years of it making my life a misery. I'm only 26 and I thought,\"this is ridiculous\".' [Patient 102, seeing a nutritionist.] 'I mean I'm a very active person and the fact that I can't walk is the end of the world as far as I'm concerned. ' [Patient 26, seeing an osteopath.] 2. 'Sometimes it gets me down'; people with symptoms of vari- able severity, but maintaining a moderate or good feeling of gen-eral well-being. 'It obviously got me down sufficiently for me to go to Dr M about it and then, when they were so long fitting me in ... getting anappointment with the physio, yes. 'Cos I think I got to the pointreally when sometimes it was waking me up at night, but I meanmy general health otherwise is really good.' [Patient 27, seeing an osteopath.] Assessment of orthodox treatment People's experiences of treatment in the orthodox system inter- acted with their experience of the illness itself. This resulted in the three groups shown in Figure 1: 1. 'Doctors can't help much.' Most of this group attended ortho- dox practitioners but found them of limited benefit. Some werefrustrated by long waiting lists, and some no longer attendedbecause they had found in the past that orthodox medicine could not help them.Table 1.

[Patient 221, seeing an osteopath.] 'And have you seen your own doctor about your back and your shoulders or not?' [CP.] 'Only, no, no, no I went erm...didn't see the point of bother- ing him. I obviously went after I'd had the kidney stonesbecause I didn't know what was wrong so he sent me for acomplete check up... ' [Patient 25, seeing an osteopath.] 2. 'Doctors are hopeless.' These three people felt rejected by orthodox medicine. They all came from 'it makes life a misery'but had much less disability than others in the group. 'He was so abrupt over the way he said he couldn't possibly do anything to bring back my sense of taste or smell, thatwas injured, that was past repair, and I said, \"Well, whatabout my voice?\" and he opened my mouth and put in thespatula and turned to the nurse that was in the room and hesaid, \"What do you think of this for a case of thrush?\" and Ireally felt like I was a dead rat being brought in, which real-ly made me feel well, I've got to do something.' [Patient 141, seeing a reflexologist.] 3. 'It may work, but it isn't acceptable.' Unlike the other groups, these people had been offered orthodox treatment that was effec-tive, or was expected to be. However, it was unacceptablebecause of fears of side-effects. 'Now, OK, but I'd prefer to do it without medication if I can, erm, 'cos I really have no idea what the effect of that over40 years is likely to be, er, erm, I mean I take his point thatthe dosage steroid in the Becotide is very very small, erm,but, you know, if I can avoid it I will.' [Patient 237, seeing reflexologist.] Hopes for complementary therapy The hopes and aims people had when they started their currenttherapy could be encompassed by three themes. 1. 'Just get me better.' The interviewees in this group wanted long-term relief of symptoms, and did not suggest any otheracceptable benefits. They were hoping for complete relief ofsymptoms, but two of them acknowledged that any degree ofrelief would be acceptable. 2. 'Some relief or a way forward.' These people had ruled out a cure. They were looking for any type of help or benefit, wereopen-minded about what that might be, and expressed a widevariety of possible benefits. This included reduction in symptoms either long- or short-term, improvement in function, better under-standing, advice on self-help or other therapy, gaining some con-trol, and improving their ability to cope with their illness. 'Anything to relieve the constant nagging pain and enable me to go on coping.' 'Mmm, 'cos you felt...?' [CP.] 'Well it was ridiculous. It is ridiculous just to go on, and go on, pulling yourself to shreds and well I don't think Dr Mwould be very impressed. You've got to take some action intime and I'm learning to do that.' [Patient 25, seeing an osteopath.] 'Relief! Just general relief. I was just hoping ... I wasn't expecting a miracle cure, but I thought that he would beable to help me just get a bit better and to help myself ... tobe able to do the exercises and to carry on.' [Patient 26, see- ing an osteopath.] 3. 'Some relief, so I can avoid steroids.' For these people, avoid- ance, or reduction in use of steroid drugs was the main aim oftreatment. In order to achieve this they were looking for somereduction in symptoms. 'It was an alternative for me to try rather than having steroids shoved up my nose.' [Patient 100, seeing nutrition- ist.] 'I hate taking drugs. One thing, I'm allergic to nearly every one of them, and erm, you know, I've got to get back to nat-ural really. I'm all for natural, erm, if there's a naturalsteroid. Is there a natural steroid that I can take?' [Patient 41, seeing an acupuncturist.] The relationship of this grouping to their illness and treatment experience is shown in Figure 1. Discussion The trustworthiness of the qualitative data collection and analysisin this study has been enhanced by several of the techniques sug-gested in the literature. 17-21The identity of the interviewer, CP, as a GP, has been attended to and reflected upon throughout theproject by both authors. For example, CP's interview techniquewas closely monitored by NB, a sociologist, to refine questionwording, and coding categories and emerging themes werereviewed together several times. In addition to the patient inter-views reported here, the study involved focus group discussionswith the practitioners involved, and outcome questionnaire com-pletion over four months, thus allowing triangulation of dataTemporal framework Themes Experience of illness It makes life a Sometimes it misery (9) gets me down (11) 36 8 3 Assessment of orthodox treatment Doctors are Doctors can't help It may work, but it's hopeless (3) much (14) not acceptable (3) 21 5 8 1 3 Hopes for complementary medicine Just get me Some relief, or a Some relief so I better (7) way forward (9) can avoid steroids (4) Figure 1. Temporal framework of main themes (the numbers refer to the number of interviewees in each group).British Journal of General Practice, August 1999 629C Paterson and N Britten Original papers from all three data sources. The results were presented to the practitioners involved and their comments sought, and a leafletsummarizing the results has been sent to all participants with an invitation to respond. Despite these efforts, the limitations of this study include the effect of the 'medical gaze', the sample size of20, the single snapshot interview, and the restriction of the study to one region of the UK. The purposive sampling, from a large population of consecu- tive patients of a variety of therapists, resulted in a study sample that is likely to include many of the diverse experiences of patients who attend complementary practitioners in the SouthWest of England in the late 1990s. They differ from people inter- viewed by Sharma 1and Murray4in their inexperience of comple- mentary medicine: nearly half were trying it for the first time.Not only had all of them consulted their GP about their problem, but most people had discussed, or felt free to discuss, their com- plementary therapy with their GP. Several patients were attend-ing complementary practitioners on the referral or suggestion of their GP, and most of these were new users of such therapy. A longer term study would be required to find out how many of thenew users in this study became regular users of complementary medicine. Most of the patients in this study had chronic conditions that were often causing severe disruption to their lives and that ortho- dox medicine could not treat successfully or could only treat with a prescription, which was not acceptable because of fear of side-effects. The importance of medication avoidance or reduction forsome patients has been found in other studies of patients of both complementary and orthodox medicine. 1,8,10,11,22,23In this study, this related to steroid-based medication in all cases, but this maybe a feature of this particular sample. The current evidence-base of orthodox medicine focuses on efficacy, and health profession- als make value judgements on what constitutes acceptable risksfrom side-effects of drugs. This study reminds us that many patients make their own judgements about risk. Everyone was looking for symptomatic relief but most people with the more chronic conditions were not expecting a 'cure', rather they were looking for 'help of any kind'. Individuals often could not specify what this would be before starting treatment,but came to appreciate such things as gaining control and coping skills and securing support and hope through the patient-practi- tioner relationship. This supports the suggestion from other stud-ies 1,8that the reasons for beginning complementary medicine may be different from the reasons for continuing it. It would also appear that these patients are either seeking out or coming toappreciate holistic and patient-centred care in a similar fashion to the patients of Chinese Medicine practitioners in the USA who were investigated by Cassidy. 11This suggests that, not only are the big advances of scientific medicine irrelevant to these patients, but that they may be diverting orthodox practitioners away from the needs of patients with chronic disease, and leav-ing a vacuum that complementary medicine is filling. Further research is needed to assess the longer term effects of the perceived benefits and to investigate in-depth how peoplecombine the benefits of complementary and orthodox care. Meanwhile, reflecting on the aims and benefits described by these patients may enable us, as orthodox practitioners, both toimprove our own practice and to facilitate appropriate comp- lementary practitioner referrals.
