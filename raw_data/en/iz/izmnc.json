The Short-Term Disability plan and the Long-Term Disability plan are designed to replace a portion of your income if you become disabled and are unable to work due to illness or injury. You may enroll for the short-term plan separately or one of the long-term plans or a combination of the short-term plan with one long-term plan. Disability insurance protects your most valuable financial asset\u2014your ability to work and earn an income. It ensures that if you are not able to work due to an injury or illness, you will still have an income source. It protects you, your family and your future from suffering financial disaster if an unexpected illness or injury occurs. - Today's 20-year-old has a 3 in 10 chance of becoming disabled before retirement age. - Nearly 1 in 7 working age people will be disabled for 5 years or more prior to age 65\u2014that number increases to nearly 1 in 5 for ages 35 to 65. - Over 36 million Americans are classified as disabled and 50% of them are in their working years. Disability insurance pays benefits if you are totally disabled. During years one and two of Long-Term Disability you must be unable to perform the duties of your current job. After 2 years you must be unable to perform any job. Important Note: Supplemental Disability Insurance is important for members of the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS) and Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) Defined Contribution Plan (DCP) tiers, PERS Tier IV and TRS Tier III. While the defined benefit tiers have disability provisions for nonoccupational disabilities, PERS Tier IV and TRS Tier III have no provisions. By replacing a portion of your income while you're disabled, you're protected against the losses that can occur when your paycheck stops. It is comprehensive\u2014covering you both on and off the job. Pre-Existing Conditions: Pre-existing condition means a sickness or injury for which, in the 3 months before a covered person becomes insured under this certificate, or before any benefit increase with respect to such covered person: - medical advice, treatment or care was sought by such covered person, or, recommended by, prescribed by or received from a physician or other practitioner of the healing arts; or - symptoms, or any medical or physical conditions existed that would cause an ordinarily prudent person to seek diagnosis, care or treatment. Illnesses that occur in the first 12 months of coverage due to the preexisting condition are excluded. Effective January 1, 2023, there are no pre-existing condition limitations in the Short-Term Disability plan. Limitations and Exclusions The disability plans don't pay benefits for a disability that results from: - War, declared or undeclared, or any act of war - Active participation in a riot - Intentionally self-inflicted injuries - Loss of professional license, occupational licenses, or certification - Commission of a crime for which you have been convicted under state or federal law - Any period of disability during which you are incarcerated No more than 24 months of benefits will be paid if a total disability is caused by one of the following: - Mental or nervous conditions other than Schizophrenia, Bipolar I Disorder or Neurocognitive Disorders. - Conditions caused by or contributed to by chemical dependency, or hallucinogenic substances. - Neuromuscular, musculoskeletal, and soft tissue disorders. - Chronic fatigue or Fibromyalgia. - Self-reported conditions.

Other income that is not deducted from the disability benefit includes: - SBS Annuity payments - Deferred Compensation - Reasonable attorney fees for awards and/or settlements - Mortgage disability insurance - Non-voluntary early retirement - Veteran's benefits - Accelerated death benefit payments - Amounts rolled over to a tax-qualified plan and not taken while benefits are being paid When you consider whether to purchase disability insurance, you must first consider the benefit you would receive. If you have other income, you should review and ask yourself, could you live on your retirement, savings, or other assets alone? Payments are Taxable Since these disability plans are part of the Voluntary Benefits program, you have the advantage of paying for coverage with earnings deducted from your salary before federal income taxes are withheld. That reduces the cost of your coverage. Due to these tax advantages, however, disability benefit payments you receive from the plans are subject to federal income tax. Filing a Claim You must apply for disability benefits under these plans within one year after the date you become totally disabled. The carrier, at its own expense, has the right to examine you if you have filed a claim. Examinations may be made as often as they are reasonably required during the period for which you claim benefits. The carrier also has the right to recover any overpayment of disability benefits either directly from you or by deduction from your future monthly benefit payments. Short-term disability (STD) protects you in the event of a brief absence from work. It can also fill in the waiting (elimination) period before long-term disability benefits begin.

The maximum monthly benefit is $8,000, and minimum monthly benefit is $100. - - Premiums Your premium is based on your age and monthly base wage. Your wage is updated as of October 1 for the benefit year that begins January 1. If you are disabled, benefits are calculated at 50% or 70% of your base wage, depending on the plan you select. The maximum monthly benefit is $8,000. Some other types of income (see below) are deducted from this amount before your benefits are paid. If other income reduces your benefit to less than $100, the plan will pay the minimum $100 monthly benefit. 2023 Long-Term Disability Rates Age Premium per $100 of Wage Plan B (50%) Plan C Effective: Jan. 1 - Dec. 31, 2023 - Coverage Begins Benefits will begin after you have completed a six-month waiting period of total disability.
