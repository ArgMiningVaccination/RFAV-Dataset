Building on a decade of ingredient and research expertise, all NTC programs provide authentic, scientific guidance and proof points for companies navigating the growing economy of conscious consumers. NTC programs are designed to guide companies from best practices through solutions on the journey to Ecosystem Sound products. Nontoxic Certified Our Ecosystem Approach serves as a catalyst for business transformation - a bridge between the conventional marketplace of today and the ecosystem-friendly marketplace of the future. The cornerstone of NTC programs is our proprietary Ecosystem Approach which enables us to help companies deliver on both their product-centered and broader sustainability goals. This approach serves as a catalyst for business transformation - a bridge between the conventional marketplace of today and the ecosystem-friendly marketplace of the future - working within the natural order while still delivering products consumers increasingly desire and demand. In the absence of external regulatory pressure, companies can transform and choose to eliminate the use of substances suspected to cause harm to humans or the planet. This type of change, from the inside out, yields defensible product development outcomes in which all inputs can be considered assets, not liabilities.
