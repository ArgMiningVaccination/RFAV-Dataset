Clean surfaces using soap and water, then use disinfectant. Cleaning with soap and water reduces number of germs, dirt and impurities on the surface. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. Practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces. More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. Surfaces and objects in public places, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. High touch surfaces include: Tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc. Disinfect Recommend use of EPA-registered household disinfectant . Follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and e\u0000ective use of the product. Many products recommend: Keeping surface wet for a period of time (see product label). Precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product. Diluted household bleach solutions may also be used if appropriate for the surface. Check the label to see if your bleach is intended for disinfection, and ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Some bleaches, such as those designed for safe use on colored clothing or for whitening may not be suitable for disinfection. Unexpired household bleach will be e\u0000ective against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Follow manufacturer's instructions for application and proper ventilation. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Leave solution on the surface for at least 1 minute. To make a bleach solution , mix: 5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water OR 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water Bleach solutions will be e\u0000ective for disinfection up to 24 hours. Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.EXHIBIT B5/5/2020 Cleaning and Disinfecting Y our Facility | CDC https://www .cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility .html 2/4Soft surfaces For soft surfaces such as carpeted \u0000oor, rugs, and drapes Clean the surface using soap and water or with cleaners appropriate for use on these surfaces. Launder items (if possible) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Use the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely. OR Disinfect with an EPA-registered household disinfectant. These disinfectants meet EPA's criteria for use against COVID-19. Electronics For electronics, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines Consider putting a wipeable cover on electronics. Follow manufacturer's instruction for cleaning and dinfecting. If no guidance, use alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol . Dry surface thoroughly. Laundry For clothing, towels, linens and other items Launder items according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely. Wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry from a person who is sick. Dirty laundry from a person who is sick can be washed with other people's items. Do not shake dirty laundry. Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. Remove gloves, and wash hands right away. Cleaning and disinfecting your building or facility if someone is sick Close o\u0000 areas used by the person who is sick. Companies do not necessarily need to close operations, if they can close o\u0000 a\u0000ected areas. Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours before you clean or disinfect. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Clean and disinfect all areas used by the person who is sick , such as o\u0000ces, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines. Once area has been appropriately disinfected , it can be opened for use . Workers without close contact with the person who is sick can return to work immediately after disinfection. If more than 7 days since the person who is sick visited or used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Continue routing cleaning and disinfection. This includes everyday practices that businesses and iti ll t itihlth i t5/5/2020 Cleaning and Disinfecting Y our Facility | CDC https://www .cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility .html 3/4communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment. Cleaning and disinfecting outdoor areas Outdoor areas, like playgrounds in schools and parks generally require normal routine cleaning , but do not require disinfection. Do not spray disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds- it is not an e\u0000cient use of supplies and is not proven to reduce risk of COVID-19 to the public. High touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (mulch, sand) is not recommended. Sidewalks and roads should not be disinfected. Spread of COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not e\u0000ective. When cleaning Regular cleaning sta\u0000 can clean and disinfect community spaces. Ensure they are trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals. Wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash . Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash. Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area. Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a person who is sick. Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water. Additional key times to wash hands include: After blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. After using the restroom. Before eating or preparing food. After contact with animals or pets. Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance (e.g., a child). Additional considerations for employers Educate workers performing cleaning, laundry, and trash pick-up to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19. Provide instructions on what to do if they develop symptoms within 14 days after their last possible exposure to the virus. Develop policies for worker protection and provide training to all cleaning sta\u0000 on site prior to providing cleaning tasks. Training should include when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, how to properly don (put on), use, and do\u0000 (take o\u0000) PPE, and how to properly dispose of PPE. Ensure workers are trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals used in the workplace in accordance with OSHA's Hazard Communication standard ( 29 CFR CFR 1910.1030 ), including proper and ( 29 CFR 1910.132 ). 5/5/2020 Cleaning and Facility CDC https://www .cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility .html 4/4Alternative disinfection methods The e\u0000cacy of alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light against COVID-19 virus is not known. EPA does not routinely review the safety or e\u0000cacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot con\u0000rm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be e\u0000ective against the spread of COVID-19. CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they are e\u0000ective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage. CDC only recommends use of the surface disinfectants identi\u0000ed on List N against the virus that causes COVID-19. For facilities that house people overnight Follow CDC's guidance for colleges and universities . Work with state and local health o\u0000cials to determine the best way to isolate people who are sick and if temporary housing is needed. For guidance on cleaning and disinfecting the bedroom/bathroom for someone who is sick, review CDC's guidance on disinfecting your home if someone is sick .

Senate Ave., N855 Indianapolis, IN 46204 C OVID -19 Response Recommendations for Pools and Aquatic Facilities Release d May 5 , 2020 In accordance with Governor Holcomb's \"Back on Track Indiana\" plan, public/ semi -public pools , spas, and similar aquatic venues may open at 50% the ir normal capacity when their respective Indiana counties move into stage 3 of the plan, which is currently planned for May 24, 2020. Major water parks are permitted to open at 50% capacity when a given county moves into stage 4 of the plan. Please realize that local orders may be more restrictive , so pool owne rs/operators are advised to check with local health departments before opening . The re is no evidence that COVID -19 can be spread through pool water itself within properly maintained aquatic venues, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The disinfectant (Chlorine or Bromine) should readily kill or inactive the virus that causes COVID -19 as long as water chemistry and water circulation are adequate . It is of course necessary that disinfectant levels and related water chemistry be maintained in accordance with 410 IAC 6 -2.1 to provide this degree of protection. H owever, t here are many opportunities for COVID -19 to spread directly between patrons in the deck area, pool enclosure, and sanitary facilities. F requently touched surfaces allow for the transfer of infected respiratory droplets; the direct spread of droplets is possible if patrons are not adequately separated by six (6) feet or more . Enabling and promoting social distancing in an environment that is normally intended for somewhat crowded social interaction will require significant changes in how the facility is utilized . Reducing the bather load to 50% is only part of the solution . Furnishings within the deck area and pool enclosure will also need to be spaced and utilized differently . Frequently touched surfaces will need to be disinfected often using an effective disinfectant . Water Chemistry It is critically important that minimum disinfectant levels (Chlorine or Bromine), a proper pH, and Cyanuric acid (Chlorine stabilizer) levels that do not exceed Indiana regulatory limits be maintained. This will allow for the rapid inactivation of viruses such as the one that causes COVID -19. With adequate water circulation, proper water chemistry, regular water chemistry testing, and the continuous feed of an EPA registered disinfectant (Chlorine or Bromine product), the pool/ spa water itself can avoid becoming a mode of transmission for the coronavirus . Specific chemical paramete rs that are the most important for preventing the spread of viruses follows: Disinfectant level that meets the minimum level in 410 IAC 6-2.1-30(b). Depending on the type of pool and its relative risk, this level will be 1, 2, or 3ppm .Exhibit MPage 2 of 5 A pH level within 7.2- 7.8 is required. pH levels above 7.8 reduce Chlorine 's effectiveness. No Cyanuric acid, CYA, utilized in any pool, spa , or other aquatic venue that is indoors . IF such compounds are used in an outdoor venue, the Cyanuric acid level must be tested weekly and maintained not to exceed 60ppm. Excess Cyanuric acid greatly reduce s the disinfe ctant's effectiveness. A more complete list of water chemistry regulations and testing requirements can be found within section 30 of the Indiana State Department of Health's \"Public and Semi -Public Swimming Pools Rule\" 410 IAC 6 -2.1 at: https://www.in.gov/isdh/files/410_iac_6_2_1.pdf . As required by the above Indiana State Department of Health regulation, any aquatic venue with a disinfectant level outside of the acceptable range, a Cyanuric acid level that is too high, a pH level above 8.0, or a chemical feeder or circulation pump that is not working should be immediately closed by the facility owner/operator until the problem is corrected . Disinfecting Frequently Touched Surfaces The virus that causes COVID- 19 can survive on surfaces outside of the pool water for days without regular disinfection. P atrons may b ecome infected by touching contaminated surfaces and the n touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. This presents one of the greatest concerns for COVID -19 transmission at pool and spa facilities. Frequently touched objects such as those listed below are of particular concern and should be disinfected the most frequently . Door knobs/ handles (in the venue as well as in any building entryway doors) Stair r ailings and pool ladders Tables, deck chairs, and benches Light switches, keyless entry readers, lock boxes Baby changing stations Drinking fountains Vending machines Telephones Any e mergency shut off contr ols (typically found on spa s) Restroom faucets, sinks, soap and paper towel dispensers, toilet flush controls , and doors Touch to activate controls on interactive fountains and spa therapy jets Pool decks and the splash decks of interactive fountains An EP A registered disinf ectant should be applied to such surfaces after removing any gross soil/dirt/grease/buildup in accordance with product label directions. It is important that gross soil/dirt be removed first for the disinfectant product to kill viruses effectively. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has provided information and instructions on how to disinfect similar surfaces at the following : https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 - ncov/prevent -getting -sick/clean ing-disinfection.html . A complete list of EPA registered disinfectants suitable for coronavirus surface disinfection can be found at the following: https://www.epa.gov/pesticide -registration/list -n- disinfectants -use-against -sars-cov-2. Page 3 of 5 Household bleach (approximately 6% active Sodium Hypochlorite) can also be diluted by mixing 1/3 cup with 1 gallon of water . Liquid pool Chlorine is more concentrated ( usually 10 - 12% Sodium Hypochlorite) and can be diluted by mixing 1/3 cup with 2 gallons of water . Bleach solution s should be mixed daily for use and discarded at the end of the workday . It is unnecessary and unsafe to use a dilution that is more concentrated. Chlorinated pool water is NOT adequate to serve as a surface disinfectant solution. Appropriate personal protective equipment, such as chemical impermeable gloves, goggles, and/or a face shield should be utilized when working with all disinfectants in strict accordance with label directions and OSHA workplace standards. Dependent on the type of disinfectant used ( see label requirements), it may be necessary to disinfect some surfa ces, such as the pool deck, when patrons are not present. Consider implementing a system to gather and disinfect all deck chairs, kickboards, floats, etc. These items could then be sign ed out to incoming patrons for individual use . If it is not feasible t o disinfect some items such a s deck chairs between patrons (either due to time/staff constraints, or because the item s physically cannot be disinfected given materials and construction), it would be advisable to take such items out of use. Patrons could potentially be permitted to bring items such as lawn chairs from home, or do without. Balls and any toys /games normally used for communal play (volleyball, water basketball, etc.) should be taken out of use . 50% Bather Load Reductions and Social Distancing The virus that causes COVID- 19 is understood to spread from person to person through small respiratory droplets that are emitted when a person coughs or sneezes. The facility owner/operator should implement all reasonable measures to promote, enable, and encourage social distancing between patrons from different households . Under no circumstances should lifeguards be required to enforce social distancing expectations , because this could distract them from their life -saving surveillanc e duties . The normally acceptable 'bather load ' as calculated from the table in 410 IAC 6- 2.1-7.5 is not adequate to promote a 6' minimum spacing between patrons on the pool deck . Governor Holcomb's \"Back on Track Indiana\" plan addresses this by requiring establishmen ts such as publi c and semi -public pools to operate at no greater than at 50% t heir usual capacity. This 50% bather load reduction should be maintained throughout stages 3 and 4 of the Governor's plan at pools, spas, and similar venues. Major water parks opening during stage 4 must also operate at 50% the usual bather loads. The established bather load determines how many people can be allowed inside of a given pool or aquatic venues enc losure (fence d area when outdoors; room when indoor s) at one time. Bather load accounts for all of the people in the water as well as on the pool deck . The normal acceptable bather load can b e calculated from the table below. Page 4 of 5 State code mandates that this normal bather load be posted on a sign with 1\" le tters. During stages 3 and 4 of Governor Holcomb's plan, this sign should be replaced or covered by a temporary sign stating the new, 50% bather load. Suggested measures that could be utilized to help limit the bather load at 50% while encouraging 6' social distancing are listed below . Facility owners /operators should implement th e combination of measures most appropriate for their unique operation . Access to the facility (gate/door) could be controlled by mana gement or an attendant. The total number of deck chairs/seats should be reduced to one half the usual number, not to exceed 50% the usual bather load. Tables, benches, and deck chairs could be removed and/or appropr iately spaced 6' or more apart . Deck chairs could be signed out to patrons with disinf ection occurring between users . A method to allow access for a limited block of time (i.e. 1.5 or 2 hours) may be implemented to allow more patrons access per day with the reduced bather load. A system to reserve blocks of time could be implemented. Face coverings Facility employees must wear face coverings when working near p atrons or in areas accessible to patrons. P atrons should be encouraged or even required to wear face coverings when they are not actively swimming or in the water . This would apply to employees and patrons in deck areas, sanitary facilities, as well as other common use areas outside of the water . The CDC has recommended the use of face coverings to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets by patrons who are infected but not showing symptoms. Facility owner s/operators could enforce this expectation via a variety of means including signage, a waiver/handout , or direct supervision by staff who are not actively serving as lifeguards . Under no circumstances should lifeguards be taxed with additional surveillance/enforcement duties related to enforcing face covering expectations . Swimming with a face covering could present a drowning hazard and should be prohibited . Page 5 of 5 Signage, handouts, and/or waivers Specific COVID -19 relevant warnings could be presented to patrons in the form of signs, handouts, verbal instructions, or possibly even as a component of a waiver. R ecommended statements that may be included in such a sign, ha ndout, or waiver include, but are not limited to, the following: DO NOT enter this facility if you have a cough, fever, or other symptoms of illness. Maintain at least six (6) feet between you and any other people who are not part of your immediate household. Wear a face covering when you are not acti vely swimming or in the pool/spa water . NEVER wear a face covering while actively swimming, or allow children to do so. NEVER dive or enter a water slide with a face covering in place. The danger of contracting COVID -19 exists if you choose to enter this aquatic facility. You are responsible for washing your hands as well as any object /s you bring in to this facility.

Suggested copy, talking points, images and artwork may be utilized by E&A clients at their discretion. Virtually all public aquatic facilities in the country have been closed for a period of time by State Executive Orders due to COVID-19. A number of states and local jurisdictions have or are in the process of issuing directives easing stay at home restrictions. While the CDC has stated that properly treated pool water is not considered a vehicle for transmission of the COVID-19 virus, the risk of transmission remains present at any place of work, and any recreation facility. Ellis & Associates wants to emphasize that no measure or combination of measures provide a guarantee against COVID-19 transmission, or the potential liability that may arise as a result. By considering the information below as well as provided by the above sources, however, facilities can provide added levels of protection, mitigate the risk, while providing valuable recreational and educational services to their membership and community. The COVID-19 related information provided in this document is based on what is currently available on the virus by the CDC, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and various state and local authorities and their respective Orders. All of these are expected to change over time as more is learned. While E&A may update its information periodically, it is impossible for any one organization to keep track of all of these sources and E&A makes no assurance that any information posted on its site is up to the minute or day. E&A is not a governmental or public agency. Any directives or guidance from the CDC regarding pool operation would take precedence over any E&A recommendations.

The aquatics industry has gr own and thrived due to the unrelenting pursuit of best practices in aquatics safety. Our knowledg e and ongoing research in regard to COVID-19 drives our commitment to providing the safest possible environment for guests and staff. The aquatics industry is working together, every day, to raise the bar in terms of technology, innovation and safety. Accor ding to the CDC, there is no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through water used in pools, hot tubs or water playgrounds. https:/ / www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/index.html In order t o be prepared for a return to living, working and playing during the time of COVID-19, professional lifeguard, health and safety training must begin now. Lifeguards, like o ther public safety workers, want to protect themselves, their family and co- workers, and the public. Because of this, OSHA adopted universal precautions for medical aid providers in regard to bloodborne pathogens that are part of standard lifeguard training.In April, the CDC r eleased a study noting that hospitalization rates for confirmed COVID-19 cases were just 0.1 per 100,000 population in persons aged 5-17 years and 2.5 per 100,000 on those aged 18-49. Most lifeguards fall into the 16-49-year age range, which suggests a risk of serious illness is limited. With prudent precautions, despite increased exposure in the line of duty, lifeguard risk can be limited. Thousands of hour s have gone into preparing and adjusting training standards all over the world, allowing any facility to follow the protocols outlined below to deliver safe and effective training using a combination of online and on-site learning.Talking PointsEllis & Associates, Inc. 800-742-8720 jellis.com Confidential 5LIFEGUARD TRAINING GUIDANCE DURING COVID-19Considerations It is advised that you obtain consent from local authorities prior to conducting in-w ater skills practice and/or practical assessment of lifeguards. Each state has or will develop their Opening Plan for business. Some sta tes will follow the Federal phased plan while other plans may have more stages. Swimming Pools & Water Parks may be specifically identified in y our state's Opening Plan while in other states the direction may not be clear. Your facility will either be presenting your Opening Plan for approval, or you may be in a jurisdiction where you are provided with an Opening Guidelines from the state/county. Either way, developing a clear plan to share with your local health officials will speed the process and confidence in the given plan. E&A suggests you work to establish communication with the authority that will oversee/direct the opening approval for your facility and the local official body that regulates lifeguard and health & safety training. https:/ / www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory In your communications with the proper authority you should inquire about your ability to start training for lifeguards and others who will need CPR/FA/AED training in an attempt to be provided with some clear direction.While it is unclear when physical distancing restric tion will ease, it is importan t to clearly communicat e to your local authority that in order to operat e you will ne ed to conduct training and some portions of t hat tr aining will no t be able to be complet ed while fully complying with physical distancing restrictions. However, such training can safely take place by following the guidelines outlined below . In some states the group ga thering restrictions will be increasing to 10 or more (depending on your state), which may provide local authorities with the confidence to allow you to train lifeguards in groups that comply with the gathering restrictions. Lifeguard Tr aining could be completed effectively with 5 persons - 1 Instructor and 4 lifeguard candidates, and a physically distanced Lifeguard on Duty - as an alternative to a larger group if local authorities were not comfortable with a larger group size and/or if your state has a lower group gathering restriction. Providing y our local authority with the information contained in this guidance document, which includes some form of health screening and/or temperature screening and best practices for minimizing person to person contact, may help give them the confidence that a one-day training with a group of 10 Lifeguards will mitigate exposure concerns.Ellis & Associates, Inc. 5979 Vineland Rd Orlando, Florida 32819 800-742-8720 jellis.com GUIDANCE DURING COVID-19Aquatics Training During COVID-19 Prepared By: Date: Introduction: The aquatics industry exists solely for the purpose of providing health and recreation to the public. As lifeguards, our team members are called upon to deliver the highest level of vigilance, care and caution while maintaining stringent standards for patient care. Of course, lifeguards do not replace parent or guardian supervi- sion but their presence, and professional training is crucial. Lifeguards provide an additional layer of accident prevention that allows our citizens and guests to enjoy exer- cise and recreation in a controlled and monitored environment. With the support of the global aquatics industry, and our professional training and certification partners, we have developed updated training protocols that will allow for maximum physical distancing and safe interaction during required on-site lifeguard training, while still achieving the necessary training objectives relating to skill competency. The aquatics industry, following guidance from the CDC and with additional consultation from the medical pro- fession, has updated protocols for improved protection of both guests and rescuers in the aquatic environment during the COVID-19 timeframe. *It will be impossible to maintain physical distancing, however; with the implementation of CDC and Model Aquatic Health Code standards, properly trained lifeguards will be able to continue to offer the elevated layer of protection our patrons need and expect. The next several pages provide an outline of Lifeguard Training Best Practices that will allow us to safely begin training lifeguards in preparation for a phased re-opening of public recreational aquatic venues.Ellis & Associates, Inc. 5979 Vineland Rd Orlando, Florida 32819 800-742-8720 jellis.com Confidential 7LIFEGUARD TRAINING BEST PRACTICES - COVID-19 CONSIDERATIONS Temperature Evaluation Process: Candidate should check temperatur e at home and confirm temperature is less than 100.4 degrees Check temperature to c onfirm temperature of each individual is below 100.4 prior to entering training COVID-19 Employee Screening Questionnaire E&A provides this template to clients to assist in the cumulative collectio n of Employee COVID-19 Employee Screening Data. If an employee has a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher they are not to report for work. If an employee answers YES to any of the symptoms below (or any 2 from question 3), do not report for work.

These items are not to be shared during training. Additional items that must be available are soap and water stations, hand sanitizer, and disinfectant wipes/solutions. Equipment Preparation All equipment should be cleaned and disinfected before, during, and after class use according to the manufacturer's instructions. Diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 60% alcohol, and specific product and/or ingredients approved by the EPA as shown on the List N: Disinfectants for use against SARS-CoVp2. This process includes: Before Class - Instructors must ensure that equipmen t has been cleaned and disinfected before use. During Class - Attendees should use a disinf ectant (e.g. alcohol, disinfecting wipes) after each use. Particular attention should be given to the face and chest of manikins and resuscitation devices (Masks, BVM, V-vac and NRB). After Class - Instructors must thoroughly clean and disinfect all contacted equipment immedia tely after class. Additional Guidance for Minimizing Exposure Risk During Lifeguarding and Safety & Health Classes The following guidelines are designed to minimize the chance of disease transmission during training. No one (instructor or participants) with a fever and other symptoms of COVID-19 should participate in any classes. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/ symptoms-testing/symptoms.html At the beginning of class, students will receive instruction on COVID-9 safety protocols that will be followed during class. Participants and instructors should wash their hands at the start of a class, during class, at each break, and at the conclusion of class. Participants will be provided with exam gloves, protective face covering, resuscitation mask, and protective eyewear at the start of class. Disinfectant wipes will be provided during class along with hand sanitizer or hand washing breaks to facilitate soap and water handwashing. Replacement items will be made available as needed. A minimum of 6 feet / 2 m of separation between participants and between participants and instructors will be maintained whenever possible. When land based or classroom training topics require interaction of students within 6 feet / 2 m of one another or with an instructor, gloves and protective face covering will be worn. There will be no person-to-person contact involving simulations for choking/airway obstruction, rescue breathing, CPR, or bleeding control (direct pressure and bandaging). CPR/Rescue Breathing/Airway Obstruction related skills will be performed only on manikins, including Heimlich maneuver. Participants will use their own resuscitation masks when practicing on a manikin. The manikin and mask/ valve should be disinfected following each use. For layperson training classes, CPR will be instructed using the Compression Only (Hands Only) guidelines, thereby eliminating the need for any rescue breathing in any manikins .Training - Personal Protective Equipment and Disinfection Protocols:Ellis & Associates, Inc. 5979 Vineland Rd Orlando, Florida 32819 800-742-8720 jellis.com Confidential 9LIFEGUARD TRAINING BEST PRACTICES - COVID-19 CONSIDERATIONSGeneral Guidance for Best Practices: New Lifeguard Training will be completed in One-Day with implementation of all Blended Learning resources. During skill practice, physical distancing will be maintained whenever possible. In situations where physical distancing is not possible (e.g. practicing water rescues), students will be paired with the same partner(s) for the duration of the skills to limit exposure. Whenever practical, exam gloves and protective face coverings will be used during skill practice. All equipment is cleaned before, during, and after skills practice. During contact by students, shared equipment will be minimized with all equipment sanitized between uses. Face coverings will not be worn during in-water practice time . The tables on the next several pages discuss individual and team skills for both Land Based (out of water) and Water Based (in water) skills, that are a necessary part of assessments required for certification of lifeguards. Every effort is made to incorporate physical distancing into the training practices, however; not all required skills can be practiced/evaluated without some physical contact.

Summary Page Who this is for: Healthcare providers and public health officials managing persons with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) under isolation who are not in healthcare settings. This includes, but is not limited to, at home, in a hotel or dormitory room, or in a group isolation facility. For Hospitalized Patients, see ( Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Patients with COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings (Interim Guidance) .Summary of Recent Changes Updates as of May 3, 2020 Changed the name of the 'non-test-based strategy' to the 'symptom-based strategy' for those with symptoms. Added a 'time-based strategy' and named the 'test-based strategy' for asymptomatic persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Extended the home isolation period from 7 to 10 days since symptoms first appeared for the symptom-based strategy in persons with COVID-19 who have symptoms and from 7 to 10 days after the date of their first positive test for the time- based strategy in asymptomatic persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This update was made based on evidence suggesting a longer duration of viral shedding and will be revised as additional evidence becomes available. This time period will capture a greater proportion of contagious patients; however, it will not capture everyone.Page 1 of 4 Disposition of Non-Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 | CDC 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home -patients.htmlExhibit TRemoved specifying use of nasopharyngeal swab collection for the test-based strategy and linked to the Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) , so that the most current specimen collection strategies are recommended. Updates as of April 4, 2020 Revised title to include isolation in all settings other than health settings, not just home. Limited information is available to characterize the spectrum of clinical illness, transmission efficiency, and the duration of viral shedding for persons with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This guidance is based on available information about COVID-19 and subject to change as additional information becomes available. For Persons with COVID-19 Under Isolation: The decision to discontinue home isolation for persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should be made in the context of local circumstances. Options include a symptom-based (i.e., time-since-illness-onset and time-since- recovery strategy) or a test-based strategy. Of note, there have been reports of prolonged detection of RNA without direct correlation to viral culture. 1). Symptom-based strategy Persons with COVID-19 who have symptoms and were directed to care for themselves at home may discontinue isolation under the following conditions: At least 3 days (72 hours) have passed since recovery defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever - reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath); and, At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared . 2). Test-based strategy Previous recommendations for a test -based strategy remain applicable; however, a test- based strategy is contingent on the availability of ample testing supplies and laboratory capacity as well as convenient access to testing. Persons who have COVID-19 who have symptoms and were directed to care for themselves at home may discontinue isolation under the following conditions: Resolution of fever without the use of fever -reducing medications and Improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), and Negative results of an FDA Emergency Use Authorized COVID-19 molecular assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected 24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) *. See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) . Of note, there have been reports of prolonged detection of RNA without direct correlation to viral culture.Page 2 of 4 Disposition of Non -Hospitalized Patients with COVID -19 | CDC 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/hcp/disposition -in-home-patients.htmlFor Persons Who have NOT had COVID-19 Symptoms but Tested Positive and are Under Isolation: Options now include both a 1) time-based strategy, and 2) test-based strategy. 1). Time-based strategy Persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have not had anysymptoms and were directed to care for themselves at home may discontinue isolation under the following conditions: At least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive COVID-19 diagnostic test assuming they have not subsequently developed symptoms since their positive test. If they develop symptoms, then the symptom-based or test-based strategy should be used. Note, because symptoms cannot be used to gauge where these individuals are in the course of their illness, it is possible that the duration of viral shedding could be longer or shorter than 10 days after their first positive test. 2). Test-based strategy Persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who have not had anysymptoms and were directed to care for themselves at home may discontinue isolation under the following conditions: Negative results of an FDA Emergency Use Authorized COVID-19 molecular assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected 24 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) *. See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) . Note, because of the absence of symptoms, it is not possible to gauge where these individuals are in the course of their illness. There have been reports of prolonged detection of RNA without direct correlation to viral culture. The symptom-based, time-based, and test-based strategies may result in different timeframes for discontinuation of isolation post-recovery. For all scenarios outlined above, the decision to discontinue isolation should be made in the context of local circumstances. Note that recommendations for discontinuing isolation in persons known to be infected with COVID-19 could, in some circumstances, appear to conflict with recommendations on when to discontinue quarantine for persons known to have been exposed to COVID -19. CDC recommends 14 days of quarantine after exposure based on the time it takes to develop illness if infected. Thus, it is possible that a person knownto be infected could leave isolation earlier than a person who is quarantined because of the possibility they are infected. This recommendation will prevent most, but cannot prevent all, instances of secondary spread. The risk of transmission after recovery is likely substantially less than that during illness; recovered persons will not be shedding large amounts of virus by this point, if they are shedding at all. Employers and local public health authorities can choose to apply more stringent criteria for certain persons where a higher threshold to prevent transmission is warranted. For certain populations, a longer timeframe after recovery may be desired to minimize the chance of prolonged shedding of replication-competent virus. Such persons include 1) healthcare personnel in close contact with vulnerable persons at high-risk for illness and death if those persons get COVID-19 and 2) persons who have conditions that might weaken their immune system which could prolong viral shedding after recovery. Such persons should consult with their healthcare provider; this might include additional PCR testing. Prolonged viral shedding has been demonstrated without direct correlation with replication competent virus.Page 3 of 4 Disposition of Non -Hospitalized Patients with COVID -19 | CDC 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/hcp/disposition -in-home-patients.htmlFootnotes *All test results should be final before isolation is ended. Testing guidance is based upon limited information and is subject to change as more information becomes available. In persons with a persistent productive cough, SARS-CoV-2-RNA might be detected for longer periods in sputum specimens than in respiratory specimens.

Based on what is currently known about the virus and about similar coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, but disease transmission via infectious aerosols is currently uncertain. Transmission of SARS- CoV-2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Transmission of coronavirus in general occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through fomites. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in community settings. It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection. Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air. This guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of rooms or areas occupied by those with suspected or with confirmed COVID-19. It is aimed at limiting the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in key environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available.Summary of Recent Changes Revisions made on 4/1/2020: Added guidance on the timing of disinfection after a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case Revisions made on 3/26/2020: Updated guidance for cleaning and disinfection of soft (porous) surfaces Updated links to EPA-registered disinfectant list Added guidance for disinfection of electronics Updated core disinfection/cleaning guidance Background PurposePage 1 of 5 Interim Recommendations for US Community Facilities with Suspected/Confirmed Coronavirus ... 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/cleaning-disinfection.htmlExhibit UThese guidelines are focused on community, non-healthcare facilities such as schools, institutions of higher education, offices, daycare centers, businesses, and community centers that do, and do not, house persons overnight. These guidelines are not meant for cleaning staff in healthcare facilities or repatriation sites, households , or for others for whom specific guidance already exists. Community facilities such as schools, daycare centers, and businesses comprise most non-healthcare settings that are visited by the general public outside of a household. Cleaning refers to the removal of dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs. But by removing the germs, it decreases their number and therefore any risk of spreading infection. Disinfecting works by using chemicals, for example EPA -registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. But killing germs remaining on a surface after cleaning further reduces any risk of spreading infection. Timing and location of cleaning and disinfection of surfaces At a school, daycare center, office, or other facility that does not house people overnight : Close off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment (like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines) used by the ill persons , focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces . At a facility that does house people overnight : Follow Interim Guidance for US Institutions of Higher Education on working with state and local health officials to isolate ill persons and provide temporary housing as needed. Close off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection. In areas where ill persons are being housed in isolation, follow Interim Guidance for Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection for U.S. Households with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 . This includes focusing on cleaning and disinfecting common areas where staff/others providing services may come into contact with ill persons but reducing cleaning and disinfection of bedrooms/bathrooms used by ill persons to as- needed. In areas where ill persons have visited or used, continue routine cleaning and disinfection as in this guidance. If it has been more than 7 days since the person with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 visited or used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Hard (Non-porous) Surfaces If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. For disinfection, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective. Definitions Cleaning and Disinfection After Persons Suspected/Confirmed to Have COVID-19 Have Been in the Facility How to Clean and DisinfectPage 2 of 5 Interim Recommendations for US Community Facilities with Suspected/Confirmed Coronavirus ... 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/community/organizations/cleaning -disinfection.htmlA list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available here . Follow the manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products for concentration, application method and contact time, etc. Additionally, diluted household bleach solutions (at least 1000ppm sodium hypochlorite) can be used if appropriate for the surface. Follow manufacturer's instructions for application, ensuring a contact time of at least 1 minute, and allowing proper ventilation during and after application. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours. Prepare a bleach solution by mixing: 5 tablespoons (1/3 cup) bleach per gallon of water or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water Soft (Porous) Surfaces For soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present and clean with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning: If the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely. Otherwise, use products that are EPA -approved for use against the virus that causes COVID -19 and that are suitable for porous surfaces Electronics For electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines, remove visible contamination if present. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics. If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids. Linens, Clothing, and Other Items That Go in the Laundry In order to minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry. Wash items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people's items. Clean and disinfect hampers or other carts for transporting laundry according to guidance above for hard or soft surfaces. The risk of exposure to cleaning staff is inherently low. Cleaning staff should wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash . Gloves and gowns should be compatible with the disinfectant products being used. Additional PPE might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash. Gloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area. Be sure to clean handsafter removing gloves. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Hand HygienePage 3 of 5 Interim Recommendations for US Community Suspected/Confirmed Coronavirus aprons or work uniforms can be worn during cleaning and disinfecting. Reusable (washable) clothing should be laundered afterwards. Clean hands after handling dirty laundry. Gloves should be removed after cleaning a room or area occupied by ill persons. Clean handsimmediately after gloves are removed. Cleaning staff should immediately report breaches in PPE such as a tear in gloves or any other potential exposures to their supervisor. Cleaning staff and others should clean handsoften, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water. Follow normal preventive actions while at work and home, including cleaning hands and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Additional key times to clean hands include: After blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. After using the restroom. Before eating or preparing food. After contact with animals or pets. Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance such as a child. Employers should work with their local and state health departments to ensure appropriate local protocols and guidelines, such as updated/additional guidance for cleaning and disinfection, are followed, including for identification of new potential cases of COVID-19. Employers should educate staff and workers performing cleaning, laundry, and trash pick-up activities to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19 and provide instructions on what to do if they develop symptoms within 14 days after their last possible exposure to the virus. At a minimum, any staff should immediately notify their supervisor and the local health department if they develop symptoms of COVID-19. The health department will provide guidance on what actions need to be taken. Employers should develop policies for worker protection and provide training to all cleaning staff on site prior to providing cleaning tasks. Training should include when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of PPE. Employers must ensure workers are trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals used in the workplace in accordance with OSHA's Hazard Communication standard ( 29 CFR 1910.1200 ). ( 29 CFR 1910.1030 ), including proper regulated waste, and PPE ( 29 CFR 1910.132 ).Additional Considerations for Employers Additional Resources OSHA COVID-19 Website CDC Home Care Guidance CDC COVID-19 Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection Guidance for Households CDC Home Care Guidance for People with Pets Find Answers to Common Cleaning and Disinfection Questions EPA's 6 Steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Use Page 4 of 5 Interim Recommendations for US Community Facilities with Suspected/Confirmed Coronavirus ... 5/11/2020 2020 Content source: National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) , Division of Viral DiseasesPage 5 of 5 Interim Recommendations for US Community Facilities with Suspected/Confirmed Coronavirus ... 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/community/organizations/cleaning -disinfection.htmlCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Recommendations for Community- Related Exposure The following updates CDC guidance for definitions and management of contacts of persons with COVID-19 contained in \"Public Health Recommendations after Travel from Areas with Potential Risk of Exposure to Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19).\"Separate guidance is available for travelers and health care workers. See also Guidance for essential workers . Public health recommendations have been updated to accommodate new scientific evidence, evolving epidemiology and the need to simplify risk stratification. New recommendations are based on: Growing evidence of transmission risk from infected persons without symptoms or before the onset of recognized symptoms; Increased community transmission in many parts of the country; A need to communicate effectively to the general public and to simplify implementation for public health authorities; Limitations in access to COVID-19 testing and increasing number of cases diagnosed clinically Continued focus on reducing transmission through social distancing of individuals in affected areas Summary of Changes: Changed risk strata descriptions - levels of risk have been reduced to simplify communications and implementation Changed period of exposure risk from \"onset of symptoms\" to \"48 hours before symptom onset\" Added the definition of a contact to include exposure to a laboratory confirmed case as well as a clinically compatible case in regions with widespread ongoing transmission Removed \"no risk\" category and replaced with unknown risk to acknowledge that all persons in the United States are at some risk of COVID-19 given the increases in community spread throughout the United States. Current guidance based on community exposure, for asymptomatic persons exposed to persons with known or suspected COVID-19 or possible COVID-19 Travelers, health care workers and critical infrastructure workers should follow guidance that include special consideration for these groups. CDC's recommendations for community-related exposures are provided below. Individuals should always follow guidance of the state and local authorities.Person Exposure to Recommended Precautions for the PublicPage 1 of 3 Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure | CDC 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/public -health-recommendations.htmlExhibit V Household member Intimate partner Individual providing care in a household without using recommended infection control precautions Individual who has had close contact (< 6 feet)** for a prolonged period of time ***Person with symptomatic COVID-19 during period from 48 hours before symptoms onset until meets criteria for discontinuing home isolation (can be a laboratory-confirmed disease or a clinically compatible illness in a state or territory with widespread community transmission )Stay home until 14 days after last exposure and maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others at all times Self-monitor for symptoms Check temperature twice a day Watch for fever*, cough, or shortness of breath Avoid contact with people at higher risk for severe illness (unless they live in the same home and had same exposure) Follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop All U.S. residents, other than those with a known risk exposurePossible unrecognized COVID-19 exposures in U.S. communitiesBe alert for symptoms Watch for fever*, cough, or shortness of breath Take temperature if symptoms develop Practice social distancing Maintain 6 feet of distance from others Stay out of crowded places Follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop *For the purpose of this guidance, fever is defined as subjective fever (feeling feverish) or a measured temperature of 100.4oF (38oC) or higher. Note that fever may be intermittent or may not be present in some people, such as those who are elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain medications (e.g., NSAIDs). ** Data are limited to define of close contact. Factors to consider when defining close contact include proximity, the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk), whether the individual has symptoms (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk) and whether the individual was wearing a facemask (which can efficiently block respiratory secretions from contaminating others and the environment). ***Data are insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure. Recommendations vary on the length of time of exposure from 10 minutes or more to 30 minutes or more. In healthcare settings, it is reasonable to define a prolonged exposure as any exposure greater than a few minutes because the contact is someone who is ill. Brief interactions are less likely to result in transmission; however, symptoms and the type of interaction (e.g., did the person cough directly into the face of the individual) remain important. Integration of these definitions and actions into communications and actions of public health authorities can be guided by CDC's \"Implementation of Mitigation Strategies for Communities with Local COVID-19 Transmission \"Page 2 of 3 Public Health Recommendations for Community -Related Exposure | CDC 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/php/public -health-recommendations.htmlPage last reviewed: March 30, 2020 Content source: National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) , Division of Viral DiseasesPage 3 of 3 Public Health Recommendations for Community -Related Exposure | CDC 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/php/public -health-recommendations.htmlCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Facility Everyday Steps, Steps When Someone is Sick, and Considerations for Employers How to clean and disinfect Clean Wear disposable gloves to clean and disinfect. Clean surfaces using soap and water, then use disinfectant. Cleaning with soap and water reduces number of germs, dirt and impurities on the surface. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces. Practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces. More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. Surfaces and objects in public places, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. High touch surfaces include: Tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc. Disinfect Recommend use of EPA-registered household disinfectant . Follow the instructions on the label to ensure safe and effective use of the product. Many products recommend: Keeping surface wet for a period of time (see product label). Precautions such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product. Diluted household bleach solutions may also be used if appropriate for the surface. Check the label to see if your bleach is intended for disinfection, and ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Some bleaches, such as those designed for safe use on colored clothing or for whitening may not be suitable for disinfection. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted. Follow manufacturer's instructions for application and proper ventilation. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Leave solution on the surface for at least 1 minute. To make a bleach solution , mix:Page 1 of 5 Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Facility | CDC 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.htmlExhibit W5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water OR 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water Bleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours. Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used. Soft surfaces For soft surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes Clean the surface using soap and water or with cleaners appropriate for use on these surfaces. Launder items (if possible) according to the manufacturer 's instructions.Use the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely. OR Disinfect with an EPA-registered household disinfectant. These disinfectants meet EPA's criteria for use against COVID-19. Vacuum as usual . Electronics For electronics, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines Consider putting a wipeable cover on electronics. Follow manufacturer's instruction for cleaning and dinfecting. If no guidance, use alcohol -based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol . Dry surface thoroughly. Laundry For clothing, towels, linens and other items Launder items according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use the warmest appropriate water setting and dry items completely. Wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry from a person who is sick. Dirty laundry from a person who is sick can be washed with other people's items. Do not shake dirty laundry. Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for surfaces. Remove gloves, and wash hands right away.Page 2 of 5 Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Facility | CDC 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/community/disinfecting -building-facility.htmlCleaning and disinfecting your building or facility if someone is sick Close off areas used by the person who is sick. Companies do not necessarily need to close operations, if they can close off affected areas. Open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours before you clean or disinfect. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Clean and disinfect all areas used by the person who is sick , such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines. Vacuum the space if needed . Use vacuum equipped with high -efficiency particular air (HEPA) filter, if available. Do not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. Wait until the room or space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day for private rooms. Consider temporarily turning off room fans and the central HVAC system that services the room or space, so that particles that escape from vacuuming will not circulate throughout the facility. Once area has been appropriately disinfected , it can be opened for use . Workers without close contact with the person who is sick can return to work immediately after disinfection. If more than 7 days since the person who is sick visited or used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary. Continue routing cleaning and disinfection. This includes everyday practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment. Cleaning and disinfecting outdoor areas Outdoor areas, like playgrounds in schools and parks generally require normal routine cleaning , but do not require disinfection. Do not spray disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds- it is not an efficient use of supplies and is not proven to reduce risk of COVID-19 to the public. High touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (mulch, sand) is not recommended. Sidewalks and roads should not be disinfected. Spread of COVID-19 from these surfaces is very low and disinfection is not effective. When cleaning Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces. Ensure they are trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals. Wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash . Additional personal protective equipment (PPE) might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash.Page 3 of 5 Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Facility | CDC 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/community/disinfecting -building-facility.htmlGloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area. Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. Always wash immediately after removing gloves and after contact with a person who is sick. Hand sanitizer: If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol- based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water. Additional key times to wash hands include: After blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing. After using the restroom. Before eating or preparing food. After contact with animals or pets. Before and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance (e.g., a child). Additional considerations for employers Educate workers performing cleaning, laundry, and trash pick -up to recognize the symptoms of COVID- 19. Provide instructions on what to do if they develop symptoms within 14 days after their last possible exposure to the virus. Develop policies for worker protection and provide training to all cleaning staff on site prior to providing cleaning tasks. Training should include when to use PPE, what PPE is necessary, how to properly don (put on), use, and doff (take off) PPE, and how to properly dispose of PPE. Ensure workers are trained on the hazards of the cleaning chemicals used in the workplace in accordance with OSHA's Hazard Communication standard ( 29 CFR 1910.1200 ). Comply ( 29 CFR 1910.1030 ), including proper waste, and PPE ( 29 CFR 1910.132 ). Alternative disinfection methods The efficacy of alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light against COVID-19 virus is not known. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19. CDC does not recommend the use of sanitizing tunnels. There is no evidence that they are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Chemicals used in sanitizing tunnels could cause skin, eye, or respiratory irritation or damage. CDC only recommends use of the surface disinfectants identified on List N against the virus that causes COVID-19.Page 4 of 5 Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Facility | CDC 5/11/2020 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/community/disinfecting -building-facility.htmlFor facilities that house people overnight Follow CDC's guidance for colleges and universities .
