Herzlinger of the Harvard Business School writes: The integration of health care activities\u2014consolidating the practices of independent physic ians, say, or integrating the disparate treatments of a partic ular disease\u2014can lower costs and improve care. But doing this isn't easy .... As with consumer-focused innovati ons, ventures that experiment with new business models often face opposition from local hospitals, physicians, and other i ndustry players for whom such innovation poses a competitive thre at. Powerful community-based providers that might be harmed by a larger or more efficient rival work to undermine the venture, often playing the public policy card by raising antitr ust concerns .... Elsewhere in the article, Professor Herzlinger note s that a \"company with a new health care idea should also be aware that regula tors, to demonstrate their value to the public, may ripple their muscles occasionally by tightly interpreting ambi guous rules or punishing a hapless innovator.\" Professor Herzlinger's cogent article anticipates and summarizes this case. St. Luke's Health System has sought to integrate the delivery of health care\u2014in part by affiliating with the Saltzer Medical Group in Ca nyon County, whose physicians share its vision of providing coordinated care for patients util izing a unified electronic health record (\"EHR\"), best medical practices, and rigorous quality control and utilization review metrics. St. Luke's will demonstrate through the testimony of its CEO, Davi d Pate, M.D., and others, that this affiliation is part of a larger plan to improve the quality a nd lower the costs of health care for patients in Ada and Canyon Counties. We will likewise show that another part of this plan is a strategic alliance with Utah-based insurer, SelectHealt h, to offer a risk-based insurance product in southern Idaho\u2014and that the affili ation with Saltzer is critical to the succe ss of that venture. 1 Harv. Bus. Rev. 2006, May 84(5); 58- 66 (attached hereto as Ex. A). Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 7 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 2 Just as Professor Herzlinge r predicted, St. Luke's effort to innovate and promote competition has provoked opposition from local hospitals\u2014 i.e. Saint Alphonsus and Treasure Valley Hospital\u2014which are threatened by a more efficient rival and which, as Professor Herzlinger foretold, have played the antitrust card. St. Luke's effort has also engendered resistance from \"other industry players\"\u2014most notably Blue Cross of Idaho, which, fearing the competition that SelectHealth will provide through its alliance with St. Luke's, has done everything it can to support the plaintiffs. In addition, apparen tly undervaluing both the consumer benefits that will result from the Saltzer transaction and the significant time that it takes for those benefits to be realized, the FTC and the Attorney General of Idaho have sought to demonstrate their value by advocating a formalistic interpretation of the antitrust laws that would ironically transform those laws from a \"consumer welfare prescription,\" see Reiter v. Sonotone Corp ., 442 U.S. 330, 343 (1979), into a competitor protection scheme. As we discuss in Part I, however, the antitrus t laws are not nearly as rigid as plaintiffs portray them. They direct this Court to balance the likely procompetitive effects of the Saltzer transaction against its purported anticompetitive e ffects. They do not authorize a conclusion that the transaction is unlawful unless the Court finds that, on balance, the overall consequences of the transaction may be to substantially less en competition in a properly defined market. In Part II, we explain how the evidence will show that the Saltzer transaction will have substantial procompetitive benefits in two different markets\u2014the market for delivery of medical care in the two-county area and the market for hea lth insurance in this State. We note how the transaction accords with the best thinking in heal th policy, is designed to create a system similar to institutions such as the Mayo Clinic which have become role models for providing quality Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 8 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 3 care at lower cost, and furthers Congressional polic y expressed in the Affordable Care Act. We also discuss how the transaction' s tight integration of physicians is critical to its success. In Part III, we address plaintiffs' claims th at the transaction will be anticompetitive. We examine how the evidence will show that plainti ffs' arguments that the town of Nampa is the relevant market is refuted both by economic an alysis and by a natural experiment conducted by Micron Technology when it excluded both St. Luke's and Saltzer from its network. We explain why evidence from other markets such as the Magic Valley is not predictive of any price increase resulting from enhanced market power resulting from the Saltzer transaction. Further, we describe why the hospital plaintiffs' concer ns about loss of referra ls and exclusion from networks are both unsupported by th e facts and predicated on an erroneous view of the law. Finally, in Part IV, we point out why, on the f acts of this case, the divestiture of Saltzer would be a highly inappropriate remedy. It would not make the market more competitive. Rather, it would deprive consumers of the benefits that the transaction wi ll bring if allowed to go forward, and it will undermine important policies of both the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and the Idaho Department of Insurance. Moreover, it is not required at this time because the transaction can readily be unwound if it turns out to result in the monopolistic practices about which plaintiffs have speculated. The title of Professor Herzlinger's article is most telling: Innovation in health care is hard indeed. But innovation is crucial if we are to have a system that lowers costs, promotes quality, and provides access for all Idahoans. For the reasons that will be brought out at trial, this court should not let the self-interested hos pital plaintiffs and th e misguided government plaintiffs succeed in stifling St. L uke's innovation through this lawsuit. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 9 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 4 ARGUMENT I. Legal Standards All the plaintiffs challenge the Saltzer transa ction under \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18, and the analogous Idaho state law, Id aho Code Ann. \u00a7 \u00b6 The hospital plaintiffs also challenge the transaction under \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, and the corresponding Idaho state law, Idaho Code Ann. \u00a7 48-104. Saint Al's/TVH Am. Compl., Dkt. 63, hospital plaintiffs have agreed, Dkt. 22-27 at 5 n.2., claims under both Clayton Act \u00a7 7 and Sherman Act \u00a7 1 are generally adjudicated according to the same standards. See, e.g., United States v. Rockford Mem'l Corp. , 898 F.2d 1278, 1283 (7th Cir. 1990). A. The Parties' Burdens To prevail, the plaintiffs must establish that the Saltzer transaction is likely, on balance, to cause substantial anticompetitive effects in a properly defined market. United States v. Penn- Olin Chem. Co. , 378 U.S. 158, 171 (1964). Although \u00a7 7 is designed to \"curb[] in their incipiency\" anticompetitive trends, Brown Shoe Co. v. United States , 370 U.S. 294, 346 (1962), the statute deals with \"probabil ities\" and not \"ephemeral possibilitie s\" of anticompetitive effects. at 323; United States v. Marine Bancorporation, Inc. , 418 U.S. 602, 622-23 (1974) (rejecting claim that was \"considerably closer to 'ephemeral possibilities' than to 'p robabilities'\"). The burden of persuasion always remains on the plaintiffs. See, e.g. , United States v. Citizens & S. Nat'l Bank , 422 U.S. 86, 120 (1975); United States v. Baker Hughes, Inc. , 908 F.2d 981, 982-83 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Thus, the plaintiffs must make a prima facie showing that the transaction will lead to undue concentration in a properly defined market, establishing a presumption that the transaction w ill substantially lessen competition. Baker Hughes , 908 F.2d at 982. St. Luke's may then rebut this presumpt ion by showing that the pl aintiffs' market-share Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 10 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 5 statistics inaccurately depict the likely competitive effects. Citizens & S. Nat'l Bank , 422 U.S. at 120; Baker Hughes , 908 F.2d at 991. The government plaintiffs have argued that, in offering evidence to rebut any prima facie showing of anticompetitive effects, a defendant bears a \"heavy burden\" to \"'verify by reasonable means the likelihood and magnitude of each asserted efficiency, how and when each would be achieved (and any costs of doing so), how each would enhance the merged firm's ability and incentive to compete, and why each would be merger-specific.'\" Dkt. 160 at 3.2 In fact, however, a defendant may rebut a prima facie showi ng with credible evidence that the plaintiff's evidence gives an inaccurate prediction of the transaction's probable effect. FTC v. Staples , 970 F. Supp. 1066, 1089 (D.D.C. 1997) (rejecting the FTC' s position that the defendant's evidence must be \"clear and convincing\"); Baker Hughes , 908 F.2d at 991-92 (refusing to \"'clearly' disprov[e] fu ture anticompetitive effects\"). \"[E]vidence on a factor s can rebut a prima facie case,\" id. at 984, including as relevant here, evidence that the transaction will lead to \"integrate d delivery\" of care and, ultimately, \"better medical care.\" FTC v. Tenet Health Care Corp. , 186 F.3d 1045, 1054 (8th Cir. 1999); see Marshfield Clinic , 65 F.3d 1406, rebutting a plaintiff's prima facie case, the defendant cannot be required to produce evidence with \"a degree of clairvoyance alien to sect ion 7, which ... deals with probabilities, not certainties.\" Baker Hughes , 908 F.2d at 987. If the defendant rebuts the presumption, the plaintiff has the burden of proving additional anticompetitive effects. Id. at 983. 2 Notably, although the government plaintiffs purport to quote the district court in United States v. H&R Block, Inc. , 833 F. Supp. 2d 36, 89 (D.D.C. 2011), for this proposition, the quote actually comes from the FTC a nd Department of Justice's Horizontal Merger Guidelines (2010) (hereinafter \"Guidelines\"), which were in turn quoted by the district court in H&R Block . As the Ninth Circuit has made clear, this Co urt is not bound by the Guidelines. Olin Corp. v. FTC , 986 F.2d 1295, 1300 (9th Cir. 1993) (\"Certainly the elines are not binding on the courts....\"). Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 11 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 6 This Court ultimately applies a \"totality-of-the-circumstances\" test and weighs all relevant factors to determine the tran saction's overall effect on competition. Id. at 984 (\"Evidence of market concentration simply pr ovides a convenient starting point for a broader inquiry into future competitiveness.\"); see also United States v. Gen. Dynamics , 415 U.S. 486, 498 (1974) (market share and concentration statis tics, while significant, are not conclusive indicators of anticompetitive effects). Significan tly, market concentration statistics alone are insufficient to win a case. Baker Hughes , 908 F.2d at 991-92 (\"The Herfinda hl-Hirschman Index cannot guarantee litigation victories. \"). The primary relevance of the HHI analysis is for federal agencies in considering whether a transacti on warrants further action on their parts\u2014not to determine the outcome of litigation. See Olin , 986 F.2d at 1300 (federal agencies' HHI in assessing transactions, \"[c]er tainly ... are not binding on the courts\"). B. Evaluating Competitive Effects 1. The significance of procompetitive effects At trial, St. Luke's will present substa ntial evidence of the extensive procompetitive effects of the Saltzer transaction. See Part II, infra . In this connection, it is noteworthy that, unlike most of the cases relied upon by plaintiffs, th e Saltzer transaction is principally a vertical one, i.e., between firms that occupy \"vertically rela ted market positions.\" Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitr ust Principles and Their Application \u00b6 900 (3d ed. 2010) (hereinafter \"Areeda\"). Specif ically, St. Luke's is a health system while Saltzer is a previously inde pendent group of 41 physicians, 34 of whom practice in Nampa, offering predominantly primary care. As shown in Part II, bringing Saltzer into the larger St. Luke's system will allow the affiliated entities to offer the benefits of integrated care. These vertical effects are highly significant. See, e.g. , Abadir & Co. v. First Miss. Corp. , 651 F.2d 422, 423-24 (5th Cir. 1981). Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 12 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 7 In particular, the procompetitive effects of the tr ansaction will establish that, in the specific economic circumstances of this case, the plaintif fs' focus on market concentration inaccurately depicts the post-merger competitive state of the market. See, e.g. , Tenet Health Care Corp. , 186 F.3d at 1054 (reversing preliminary injunction where dist rict court had failed to consider, in evaluating overall competitive eff ect of merger of two hospitals, evidence that the merger would produce \"better medical care than e ither of those hospitals could separately\" because the merged entities could \"offer integrated delivery\"). By affiliating with Saltzer, St. Luke's seek s to offer patients a product\u2014integrated, risk- based health care\u2014that is fundamentally different from the fe e-for-service (\"FFS\") medicine that Saltzer could offer as an independent group of physicians. In such circumstances, the Supreme Court has made clear that a fl exible analysis is required. See, e.g. , Broad. Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc. , 441 U.S. 1, 9, 21-22 (1979) (\"BMI\") (declining to apply per se analysis to horizontal agreement among compe titors to offer blanket licenses to copyrighted music, even where the competitors \"literally 'fixed' a 'price,'\" because \"the whole [blanket license] is truly greater than the su m of its parts; it is, to some ex tent, a different product\"). Just as the BMI Court did not apply a strict per se rule to invalidate an efficient blanket license that was viewed as a new product, this Court s hould recognize the new pr oduct that the Saltzer transaction is part of creating. Simply put, antit rust law does not support the preclusion of health care transactions that will l ead to procompetitive innovation. Cf. Miller v. Cal. Pac. Med. Ctr. , 991 F.2d 536, 545 (9th Cir. 1993) (vacating preliminary injuncti on requiring dissolution of merger under federal labor laws where \"[u]np acking the merger might ... detract from the quality of medical care CPMC provides its patients\" and m ean that \"innovative procedures\" made possible by the merger \"would have to be abandoned\"). Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 13 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 8 2. The requirements for establishi ng anticompetitive effects Both the government and hospital plaintiffs a ssert that the Saltzer transaction creates too much concentration in the market for primary care physician (\"PCP\") services in Nampa, and gives St. Luke's market power. However, th e government and hospital plaintiffs advance significantly different theories as to how the alleged increase in market concentration is supposed to lead to harm to competition. Their di ffering theories requir e different showings. a. Government plaintiffs' claims The basic theory of the government plaintiffs is that the Saltzer transaction will enable St. Luke's to exercise market power by raising pric es above competitive leve ls\u2014to the detriment of commercial payers. E.g., Gov't Compl. \u00b6 1. To maintain th is claim, the government plaintiffs must prove that the transaction is likely to lead to a significant and non-transitory increase in prices, above competitive levels, in a properly defined market for a particular product in a particular geographic area. E.g., Marine Bancorporation , 418 U.S. at 618; Baker Hughes , 908 F.2d at 982. Thus, as the Court has already reco gnized, the plaintiffs cannot rely on purported effects in different product or geographic markets to establ ish that the Saltzer transaction will purportedly cause anticompetitive effects in any relevant market. See Ex. B, Aug. 26, 2013 Hearing Tr. at 37:25-38:9; Rick-Mik Enterprises, Inc. v. Equilon Enterprises LLC , 532 F.3d 963, 972 (9th Cir. 2008) (\"failure to allege power in the relevant market is a sufficient ground to dismiss an antitrust complaint\") (emphasis added). Nor may plai ntiffs rely solely on evidence that prices are likely to increas e if the increased price is not above competitive levels. Price increases, standing alone, do not create any concern under th e antitrust laws. See, e.g. , Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. , 509 U.S. 209, 232 (1993); Rebel Oil Co. v. Atl. Richfield Co. , 51 F.3d 1421, 1434 (9th Cir. 1995). Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 14 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 9 b. Hospital plaintiffs' claims As the hospital plaintiffs have conceded, they have no standing to challenge the Saltzer transaction on the ground that that transaction will raise prices. See Dkt. 151 at 4. Instead, they advance a theory that the transaction be tween St. Luke's and Saltzer will harm them so severely that it will ultimately harm competition . See, e.g. , Saint Al's/TVH Am. Compl. \u00b6 2(c). Such a claim is impossible to prove on the facts of this case. Initially, it is a fundamental te net of antitrust law that a transaction is unlawful only if it harms competition \u2014not if it harms competitors. E.g., Pool Water Prods. v. Olin, 258 F.3d 1024, 1034 (9th Cir. 2001); see also Brunswick v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat , 429 U.S. at 477, 487 (1977). Indeed, even elimination of a competitor from the market is insufficient, without more, to constitute harm to competition. McGlinchy v. Shell Chem. , 845 F.2d 802, 812 (9th Cir. 1988). Moreover, \"courts are properly skeptical of many rivals' [antitrust] suits,\" because \"a competitor opposes efficient, aggressive, co mpetition by rivals.\" Areeda \u00b6 348a. The hospital plaintiffs' \"vertical foreclosure\" theory can be maintained only in the very rare case where harm to the plaintiffs effects significant foreclosure in the overall market. See Areeda \u00b6\u00b6 1004a, 1004f (\"the foreclosure theory has serious weaknesse s\"; the conditions necessary for harm to competition to result from a supposed foreclosure are \"stringent\"); see also id. \u00b6 1004c (\"Even complete self-dea ling, with an absolute refusal to sell or purchase from any outsider, results in no foreclosure in a compe titive market.\"). Any time that \"the number of firms, though reduced, remains sufficient for effective price competition,\" there has been no competitive harm actionable under the antitrust laws. Id. \u00b6 1010. 3. Determining the overall ef fects on consumer welfare At bottom, the goal of the anti trust laws is to enhance consumer welfare\u2014not to maintain a particular HHI. See Reiter , 442 U.S. at 343 (antitrust la ws are \"a consumer welfare Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 15 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 10 prescription\"); SCFC ILC, Inc. v. Visa USA, Inc. , 36 F.3d 958, 962 (10th Cir. 1994) (the \"objective[] of antitrust regulation\" is \"to im through increased innovation\") (citation omitted). Accordingly, Judge Easterbr ook has explained that a court should err on the side of allowing conduct because the market w ill typically self-correct any anticompetitive effects, while a judgment erroneously prohibiting procompetitive behavior will create significant and long-term societal cost s. Frank H. Easterbrook, The Limits of Antitrust , 63 Tex. L. Rev. 1, 2- 7 (1984) (noting that \"wisdom lags far behind the market\" and firms must be allowed to experiment with innovative practices). The Nint h Circuit has likewise expl ained that if market forces can potentially \"cure the perceived prob lem,\" then \"a court ought to exercise extreme caution because judicial intervention in a compe titive situation can itself upset the balance of market forces, bringing about the very ills th e antitrust laws were meant to prevent.\" United States v. Syufy Enterprises , 903 F.2d 659, 663 (9th Cir. 1990). II. The Saltzer Transaction Will Promote Competition There is no dispute\u2014in this case, in academ ic literature, or in federal policy\u2014that integration in health care benefits consumers by givi ng rise to higher-qua lity and higher-value care. words of plaintiffs' expert, Dr . Kizer, \"[t]here is general consensus among healthcare leaders, policymakers, academicians, and ot her healthcare stakeholde rs that there is an urgent need to re-engineer the delivery of healthcare to coordi nate patient care across conditions, providers, settings, and time so that it is safe, time ly, effective, efficient, and patient-focused.\" Ex. C, Kizer Rept. \u00b6 21. As the Court will hear fro m several witnesses, inte grated care is widely recognized to be the best means to achieve the \"triple aim\": improvi ng the health of the population, improving the quality and accessibility of care, and reducing the per capita cost of care. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 16 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 11 There is likewise no dispute that one of the f undamental flaws in the existing health care system is its widespread reliance on FFS payment for care\u2014 i.e., payment based on the number of office visits, procedures, and tests. As Dr. Kizer has opined, FFS payment will need to be \"largely phased out in coming years and repl aced with value-based payment methods.\" Id. \u00b6 107. Instead of being compensated for the volume of care they provide, providers will instead need to take on risk in their payment contract s, so that their comp ensation is based on the value of care they provide to their member population. In order to accomplish this dramatic but necessary transformation, Dr. Kizer has opined that \"healthcare prov iders of all types, regardless of their organizational stru cture, will have to learn to partner and collaborate to achieve clinical integration and to be better stewards of limited healthcare resources.\" Id. Indeed, the federal government itself has encouraged expanding the avai lability of shared-ris k, integrated care by establishing accountable care orga nizations (\"ACOs\"), which ar e \"groups of providers of services ... [who] work together to manage and coordinate care for Me dicare fee-for-service beneficiaries,\" and who must be \"willing to b ecome accountable for the quality, cost, and overall care of the Medicare fee-for-ser vice beneficiaries assigned to it,\" and \"to promote evidence- based medicine and patient engagement, report on quality and cost measures, and coordinate care,\" among other requirements. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395jjj(a)(1)(A), (b)(2)(A), (b)(2)(G). In this trial, St. Luke's will demonstrate th at it has embarked on a long-term mission to achieve just these goals. St. Luke's is seeking to provide integrated car e in Idaho, with risk- based contracts so that providers are compensated based on value rather than volume of care. As we will show, the Saltzer transaction is a critical step in this endeavor, and will significantly advance the achievement of St. Luke's goals, particularly in Canyon County. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 17 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 12 As noted above, the plaintiffs do not dispute that integrated, risk-based care offers tremendous benefits to consumers as compared to the fragmented, FFS care that currently predominates. Plaintiffs instead offer essentiall y two responses: (1) that St. Luke's will not, in fact, achieve benefits from inte gration, and (2) that all such be nefits can be equally achieved without the Saltzer transaction. At trial, St. Luke's will demo nstrate that neither of these responses has merit. A. St. Luke's Will Bring Integrated Care to the Population of Southern Idaho. As Dr. Pate will explain, St. Luke's is in the process of transforming the delivery of health care by offering the population of southern Idaho clinically integrat ed, risk-based care. The hallmarks of that transformation include: a system that is staffed and equipped to provide a broad range of high-quality health services; a physician culture of teamwork and focus on value for patients, including value that is derived through appropriate util ization of evidence-based care, and management and leadership structures that ensure that physicians work together to improve care and lower cost; provider incentives aligned with the need s and wants of patients for high-quality, affordable care; a substantial investment in health information technology, including both an electronic health record, which allows fo r accurate recording of patient data and seamless communication among providers, as well as automated order sets and notices to providers regarding patient car e, and data analytic tools that permit aggregation and actionable repo rting of systemwide data; all or most revenue to providers from one common source, so that all components of the system have an interest in he lping to lower the costs of the other components, and have no countervailing interest in \"hoarding\" patients or increasing utilization; and a population health focus that includes timely identification of patients whose conditions make them particul arly at risk for need of costly care, and education and care management processes to reduce their risks. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 18 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 13 Dr. Pate will explain that the fi nancially and clinically integrat ed delivery system that St. Luke's is building is a product fundamentally differe nt from the traditional, fragmented model of FFS medicine that is currently the norm in sout hern Idaho. In a successful integrated care system, providers coordinate care using eviden ce-based best practices. Through risk-based contracting and value-based compensation for pr oviders, such a system avoids the perverse effects of the incentive for providers to incur gr eater fees by providing more services. Professor Enthoven will likewise testify that it is well re cognized in health car e policy that tightly integrated delivery systems such as Geisinger H ealth System and the Mayo Clinic, the models on which St. Luke's plan is based, o ffer the greatest potential for rais ing quality while reducing cost. In order to evolve into an integrated deliv ery system, St. Luke's has expanded both its physical and technical infrastruc ture and the base of providers who are employed by or engaged through a professional services agreement (\"PSA\"). It built, inter alia , the St. Luke's Magic Valley Medical Center and the St. Luke's Namp a Emergency Department. And it acquired or affiliated with several previously independent physician practices\u2014including a number of PCPs, who play a particularly important role in pr oviding high-value integrat ed care. Notably, St. Luke's does not affiliate with any medical group unless its physicians are committed to the same transformative goal that St. Luke's seeks to achieve. These actions have helped to position St. Luke's to have the necessary scale\u2014in term s of both providers and patient population\u2014to provide truly integrated care. 1. Steps That St. Luke's Has Already Taken a. Investment in information health technology St. Luke's has invested substantial time a nd resources to adopt an EHR using the Epic platform, which is recognized as the \"gold standard\" among electroni c health records. St. Luke's overall financial investment in the system is anticipated to be near $200 million, with $50 million Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 19 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 14 already expended. The Epic EHR is a foundational investment that dramatically furthers St. Luke's progress toward integrated care. First, us e of the Epic EHR allows St. Luke's to maintain accurate, accessible electronic reco rds for all patients, which can be seamlessly shared among St. Luke's providers coordinating a particular patien t's care. Each provide r can (and must) see and populate the patient's history, thus avoiding wasteful duplication a nd harmful errors. The Epic EHR also offers tools for pr oviders\u2014including automated orde r sets and notices\u2014so that providers are automatically informed of th e standard of care for individual patients' circumstances, thus \"hardwiring\" the standardized, evidence-based best practices that St. Luke's physicians and leaders have worked to identify. Moreover, with information drawn from the EHR, St. Luke's is able to aggregate, analyze, and act on systemwide data. Using its WhiteCloud data analytics tool, St. Luke's providers are able to determine and standardize best provider practices to promote high-value care. St. Luke's has created a \"c linical integration scor ecard\" that allows it to assess objectively quality and other measures that can be tied to individual physicians a nd groups of physicians within the system. The WhiteCloud tool also a llows individual St. L uke's providers to see various statistics related to themselves and thei r patients. For example, it shows providers how their patients, as a group and individually, are fa ring on various measures (s uch as the number of a PCP's patients who have their blood pressure maintained below 140/90) , and allows providers to see how their own performance compares to that of their peers in the St. Luke's system\u2014so that providers can work with each other to impr ove care. Finally, the WhiteCloud tool analyzes and presents information on the cost of care provided by St. Luke's\u2014and by other providers for those patients for whom St. Luke's bears risk\u2014allowing St. Luke's to target high-cost patients for early intervention and to identify providers who may be over-utilizing expensive services. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 20 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 15 b. Risk-based contracting. Consistent with Dr. Kizer's opinion and th e federal policy establishing ACOs, Dr. Pate and Mr. Kee will explain why providers must move away from FFS payment, and toward contracts with payers whereby the providers take on financial risk for the patients' care. However, as Dr. Pate and Mr. Kee will explain, ce rtain predicates greatly facilitate a health system's ability to take on risk successfully. For one, the system must have high-quality data, which is necessary both to make appropriate fina ncial decisions, and to identify which forms of care produce the highest value for patients. Second, the system must have a sufficient patient or member base over which to spread the risk, so that highly expensive treatment required for a small number of patients will not overwhelm the system. And third, the system must have a sufficient number of providers wi lling both to adhere t o, and to contribute to the development of, the high-value forms of care that the syst em has identified and put in place. St. Luke's is working to implement these predicates and to increase its risk-based contracting. It is commit ted to being \"risk ready\"\u2014 i.e., ready to have 100% of its contracts be risk-based\u2014by 2015. Commercial payers have been unwilling fully to partne r with St. Luke's in making this needed transformation. Accordingly, St. Luke's has worked with SelectHealth, a non-profit insurer, to bri ng an entirely new insurance product to Idaho. St. Luke's and SelectHealth now offer an insurance product in wh ich the health care provider network\u2014anchored by St. Luke's\u2014shares in the savings that result from lowering the cost of health care. As will be explained by St . Luke's leaders and Patricia Richards, CEO of SelectHealth, this shared savi ngs plan differs significantly from traditional commercial insurance, in which any premium that remains af ter payment of fees to providers goes back to the insurer, so that providers have no financ ial incentive to decrease patient costs by providing higher-value care. The agreement between St. Lu ke's and SelectHealth, by contrast, provides Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 21 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 16 financial incentives to identify and reduce unnece ssary utilization of services and to perform services in the most appropriate cost environm ent. As William Deal, Director of the Idaho Department of Insurance, will explain, St. Luke's efforts to bring an entirely new insurance product into the Idaho market is a signif icant benefit to Idaho consumers. St. Luke's has worked to take on risk thr ough other measures as we ll. It was the only Idaho-based health care provider se lected by the federal government to participate as an ACO in the Medicare Shared Savings Program under the Affo rdable Care Act, and has been operating as ACO since January 1 of this year. It has also entered into a fully risk-based arrangement with Blue Cross of Idaho, called TrueBlue, which is a Medicare Advantage co ntract (essentially, an HMO for Medicare beneficiaries). And St. Luke's and its Select Medical Network are in final negotiations to enter into a total-cost-of-care co ntract with Regence, where St. Luke's has the opportunity to share modest upside gains and will transition to taking on downside risk. c. Moving physicians to value-based compensation With the data and analytical tools that St . Luke's now has, it is able objectively to evaluate the work of its providers. This enhances St. Luke's ability to reach agreements with its providers to move away from FFS compensati on toward value-based compensation based on metrics that providers agree fair ly measure performance. To da te, St. Luke's has entered into contracts with two of its phys ician specialties (cardiology a nd pulmonology) to accept value- based compensation. It will soon finalize a simila r agreement with its internal medicine group, and intends to negotiate such arrangement s with all other physicians as well. 2. St. Luke's programs exemplifying th e benefits of integrated care At trial, St. Luke's will de monstrate that the improvements in health care that it is effectuating through clinical in tegration, including with prev iously independent physician Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 22 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 17 practices, are not just theoretical. Numerous indi viduals will testify that the tight affiliation that St. Luke's is seeking to achieve in the Saltzer transaction yields c oncrete benefits for patients. For example, St. Luke's has initiated its CoPartner program, which uses a team-based care approach for chronic disease management of patients with multiple comorbidities. Using analysis of systemwide data, St. Luke's physicia ns will identify the approximately 5 percent of its member population that would benefit from upfront intervention and close monitoring, and provide such treatment in an effort to prevent th e need for costlier care (such as hospitalization) down the line. St. Luke's DEaM program (\"Di abetes Education and Management\") similarly incorporates an electronic registry of diabetic patients and patients at risk for diabetes across St. Luke's population. These patients will be provi ded with low-cost, high-value education and monitoring through a team-based approach, involv ing nurses, nutritionists, and educators, in order to improve their health and avoid the need for higher-cost care later. Additionally, St. Luke's Heart has, by ta king a team-based approach impossible in independent, FFS practice, reduced readmission s by half and populated significantly more regional clinics for patients who live far from Bo ise. And the Center for Spine Wellness has, by standardizing processes and thereby reducing utilization of unnecessary procedures and tests, reduced costs per patient by about $1,000 for empl oyees of Simplot, Inc. In terms of FFS revenues, this is a financial detriment to St. Luke's\u2014but a substantial benefit to patients. B. The PSA with Saltzer\u2014as Contrast ed with a Looser Affiliation\u2014Will Further Promote Integrated Care. St. Luke's will also demonstrate that the tran saction with Saltzer will permit the affiliated entities to achieve inte grated care\u2014particularly in Canyon County\u2014faster and more effectively than could happen if the transaction had not happened or were unwound. The transaction will produce multiple benefits that would not exist otherwise. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 23 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 18 1. Affiliating with Saltzer will promote St. Luke's efforts to bring integrated care to Canyon County. Plaintiffs contend that the Saltzer transact ion is unnecessary because St. Luke's could work with Saltzer through a l oose contractual affiliation rather than through the financial integration provided for in the PSA. To be sure , St. Luke's can and does work effectively with independent physicians. But St. Luke's leaders w ill explain why a tight in tegration with Saltzer through the PSA is material to St. Luke's abilit y to provide integrated care to the population it serves. St. Luke's and Saltzer leaders will fu rther explain how the aff iliated entities promote integrated care far more effectively than an independent Saltzer could. Initially, Saltzer is located in Canyon County, where St. Luke's had (before the Saltzer transaction) few employed or closely affiliated ph ysicians. It is essential to have a core or nucleus of employed or cl osely affiliated physicians in the regi on in order to achieve the benefits of coordinated, integrated care there. As Prof essor Enthoven will explain, employed or closely affiliated physicians have the proper incentives to integrate care, and empirical evidence demonstrates that the benefits of integrated care occur more quickly and in greater measure through closer integration. And the St. Luke's leaders will explain that, in their experience, physicians who are employed or under a PSA are more willing to be involved in the administrative and non-fee-generating as pects of clinical integration. Additionally, the St. Luke's leaders will expl ain that the transaction is particularly supportive of their mission of providing integr ated care because Sa ltzer is a group of predominantly PCPs who are committed to St. Luke's goals\u2014 i.e., the triple aim. Of all physicians, PCPs play a unique role because they serve as the access point for patients, and it is through PCPs that patients can be identified for programs lik e CoPartner or DEaM. The Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 24 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 19 transaction is thus important to ensure a clos e working relationship betw een Saltzer physicians and the St. Luke's physicians and administrators working to promote clinical integration. Close alignment with a substantial core of its physicians, especially its PCPs, also enhances St. Luke's ability to engage in risk-bas ed contracts like the Sele ctHealth product. Ms. Richards of SelectHealth will explain that the ability to compensate physicians based on their performance in providing high-value care and based on their non-fee-ge nerating contributions makes a system more successful in taking on risk b ecause they enable the system to contain costs while providing high-value care. Such compen sation schemes are significantly easier to implement and more effective when physicians are employed or subject to a PSA rather than merely loosely affiliated. Similarly, Scott Clem ent of commercial insurer Regence stated that Regence has been willing to engage in a risk-base d, \"total cost of care\" c ontract with St. Luke's due to St. Luke's substantial numbers of employed physicians.3 2. Saltzer patients will benefit from the transaction. Allowing the transaction to stand will also cr eate significant benefits for Saltzer and its patients. Significantly, as a result of the transa ction, the Saltzer physicians will have use of St. Luke's Epic system and WhiteCloud data analy tics tool. As discusse d above, those systems create substantial benefits for St. Luke's, all pr oviders in its system, and the entire population that St. Luke's serves. Indeed, although Epic has not yet been rolled out to Saltzer (as a result of a commitment made to this Court at the prelim inary injunction stage), data from the Saltzer physicians is already being incorporated into the WhiteCloud tool, for analysis and use by Saltzer physicians and for the broader system. Sa ltzer's Dr. John Kaiser will explain that access 3 Ex. D, Deposition of Scott Clement at 63:10-25, 162:16-23. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 25 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 20 to such technology\u2014which is extremely expensiv e\u2014was a major reason why Saltzer sought out the affiliation with St. Luke's. Plaintiffs have asserted that access to St . Luke's information technology will not create benefits of integrated care because Saltzer alre ady uses a different electronic medical record (\"EMR\"), eClinicalWorks. However, Dr. Kaiser will explain that the functionality of eClinicalWorks is dramatically le ss than that of St. Luke's Epic system and WhiteCloud tool. In particular, Saltzer's eClinicalWorks program doe s not perform several of the functions that experts agree provide the greatest benefits asso ciated with EHRs. The affiliation thus creates a significant technological improvement for th e Saltzer physicians and for patients. Plaintiffs also contend that Saltzer could benefit from St. Luke's information technology even without the transact ion if Saltzer paid to use that t echnology through St. Luke's anticipated (but not yet in place) affiliate program. Through the affiliate program, St. Luke's intends to subsidize the high prices that independent physician groups must pay to use the Epic system. Even with the subsidy that St. Luke's intends to offer, however, use of Epic remains highly costly, and, as desc ribed in Part IV, infra , Saltzer's financial conditi on would be tenuous if the transaction were to be unwound. Moreover, if Saltzer were to reve rt to its prior status as an independent group compensated on a FFS basis, it would have little incentive to pay for St. Luke's health technology, as one of the goals and effects of that te chnology is to reduce unnecessary (but, for FFS providers , profitable) u tilization. Additionally, St. Luke's affiliation with Salt zer will increase access to medical care for Medicaid patients in Idaho. St. Luke's is committed to providi ng quality care to all patients, regardless of their financial stat us or insurer. As Idaho Department of Health & Welfare Director Richard Armstrong will explain, maintaini ng health care access for Medicaid patients is Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 26 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 21 a significant concern for the Depa rtment, particularly in light of the expected increase in Medicaid enrollment. Significantly, as Professor Enthoven will explain, this is not an issue of Saltzer providing \"low-quality\" care in the past. Instead, the aff iliation will enable Saltzer to move away from providing FFS care as a stand- alone group, with the inherent limitations and misaligned incentives that (as plaintiffs' expert Dr. Kizer agrees) go along with providing care according to that framework. Professor Enthoven will explai n the substantial evidence that integration\u2014and particularly, the type of clos e financial integration reflected in the Saltzer/St. Luke's relationship\u2014is more effective at promoting inte grated care. While it is true that looser affiliations among independent organization can pr oduce some benefits of coordination, tighter integration has been shown to be more effectiv e. Professor Enthoven wi ll thus opine that the Saltzer transaction can be expected to produce the benefits of integrated care more effectively and more quickly than could occu r through any looser relationship. III. Plaintiffs' Evidence of Purported Anti competitive Effects Is Unpersuasive A. Plaintiffs' Claims of Supposed Harms from Concentration Are Overblown. Both sets of plaintiffs place heavy relian ce on the HHI analysis, contending that the Saltzer transaction creates a presumptively unlawf ul increase in concentration in the market for PCP services in Nampa. This increase in concentr ation, they assert, will give St. Luke's \"market power,\" which supposedly will lead to anticompetitiv e effects. Putting aside the limited value of HHI analysis in litigation, see p. 6, supra , plaintiffs' claims are flawed because they are based on an artificially narrow geographic market. Moreover, the specific facts of this case demonstrate that competition for the delivery of health care in southern Idaho remains vigorous. For these reasons, plaintiffs' wooden reliance on HHI analysis is misplaced. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 27 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 22 1. Plaintiffs Have Failed to Defi ne a Proper Geographic Market. As noted above, plaintiffs bear the burden of proving that they have properly defined the relevant geographic market. R.C. Dick Geothermal Corp. v. Thermogenics, Inc., 890 F.2d 139, 143 (9th Cir. 1989). A proper geographic market is \"an area of effective competition ... where buyers can turn for alternate sources of supply.\" Strand v. Radiology 1991). experts conte nd that the market for adult PCP services is limited to Nampa. But as defendants' expert, David A. Argue, Ph.D., will testify, that proposed definition excludes numerous providers who act as competitive constraints on providers in Nampa. Plaintiffs therefore inappropriatel y limit the scope of the relevant market. Dr. Argue has looked at patient or igin data for Nampa physicians\u2014 i.e., data showing the distances patients currently travel to seek treat ment by PCPs located in Nampa, a region called the providers' \"service area.\" He has looked spec ifically at service area zip codes that account for the top 90% of patients of the Nampa physicians, and determined that Nampa physicians account for only one-third of the PCP services provided to the patients in that 90% service area. The remaining two-thirds are provided by physicia ns located outside of Nampa. At the same time, his analysis demonstrates that nearly one-third of patients actually being treated by Nampa physicians come from outside of Nampa. That is, one-third of patients obtaining treatment in Nampa have chosen (under competitive conditi ons) to travel into Nampa for care. As these data demonstrate, a substantial vol ume of consumers already are, at currently competitive prices, willing to travel into and out of Nampa in order to obtain care. If prices were to increase to supracompetitive levels, health plans and employers could and would motivate patients to leave Nampa or to avoid traveling in to Nampa for primary care. Dr. Argue will thus opine that PCPs in Nampa are competitively co nstrained by physicians located outside of Nampa including at least those in Cald well, Meridian, and other areas of western Ada County. Further, Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 28 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 23 Dr. Argue will testify that, if St. Luke's were to raise prices above competitive levels, both St. Luke's and Saltzer would lose so many patients th at it would be unprofitable to do so. Indeed, the fact that Saltzer did not raise its prices above competitive levels when it had (according to plaintiffs) more than 90% of the Nampa mark et strongly supports Dr . Argue's conclusion. Although the two sides' experts dispute the best method for defining the market, the Court need not rely on theory alone. Instead, the Court can look to the experience of Micron Technology, which has some 2,000 employees in Na mpa. In 2008, Micron established a tiered health plan network insurance product that al lows employees to choose among narrow networks of physicians. The first, least expensive tier of providers that employees can use includes providers located at Micron's facility in Boise. The next tier comprises physicians in the Micron Health Partners Network (\"MHPN\"), which in cludes Saint Alphonsus providers but excludes Saltzer and St. Luke's providers. The third, and most expensive, network tier includes physicians in the \"Wise Network.\" Both Saltzer and St. Luke's were excluded from the Wise Network until January 2011, when Saltzer (but not St. Luke's) became part of Wise. Thus, from July 2008 through January 2011, Micron' s health plan successfully excluded both St. Luke's and Saltzer from its covered networks. Sin ce 2011, it has continued to exclude all St. Luke's providers.4 Importantly, Micron's employees responded to the differentials in copayments by using alternative providers. Ev en today, each time a Micron employee goes to a PCP, he or she must choose among the providers in the tiers, and the employees overwhelmingly choose the limited options in MHPN rather th an the broader options in the Wise Network (including Saltzer) for a savings of as little as $15 per visit. In other words, Micron's employees 4 Other employers, including WalMart, which employs some 1,500 in Ada and Canyon counties, have followed suit, signing onto Micron's \"high performance\" network that excludes both St. Luke's and Saltzer physicians. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 29 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 24 have demonstrated, contrary to plaintiffs' expert s' theorizing, that patients are willing to limit their physician options in response to sm all differences in their copayment. The sensitivity to small price differentials demonstrated by Micron employees makes it implausible to believe that other patients woul d not choose non-St. Luke's physicians to avoid higher copayments. Many of those patients would not even have to travel farther to do so\u2014they could use local, non-Nampa physicia ns rather than driving in to Nampa. As the Micron experience shows, health plans and employers can motivate patients to choose lower-cost physicians. Thus, an attempted above-competitive price increase by St. Luke's in Nampa could be defeated, and Nampa cannot be a properly defined market. 2. Notwithstanding the Saltzer Transaction, There Is Vigorous Competition in Any Properly Defined Relevant Market. Plaintiffs also fail to account for many circum stances specific to this region and industry that will prevent any supracompetitive pricing. For one, health care in southern Idaho is marked by intense competition by two major players\u2014Saint Alphonsus and St. Luke's. Such circumstances necessarily produce high HHI figures, but do not indicate a lack of competition. Additionally, the industr y features confidentia l bilateral bargaining between health care providers and sophisticated commercial insure rs. Markets characteri zed by such bilateral bargaining do not require competition from a la rge number of suppliers to yield competitive outcomes. Moreover, health insurers and empl oyers have demonstrated that through use of products such as tiered networks, they can effect ively encourage enrollees to use the least costly providers. See, e.g. , Baker Hughes , 908 F.2d at 986 (concentration held not indicative of anticompetitive effects where market involve d complex products sold to sophisticated consumers, not \"trinkets sold to small cons umers who may possess imperfect information and Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 30 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 25 limited bargaining power\"); Syufy , 903 F.2d at 670 (affirming judgment for antitrust defendant who \"[w]hile successful, [was] in no position to put the squeeze on distributors\"). Plaintiffs also give inadequa te consideration to the likelihood of entry by new physicians or expansion of capacity by existing physicians if St. Luke's engages in supracompetitive pricing. Both Canyon and Ada Counties are gr owing, with Canyon County alone seeing a 44% increase in population between 2000 and 2010. Both St. Luke's and Saint Alphonsus have been investing in expanding their operations in response to this growth. Wh ile plaintiffs' experts contend that recruitment of new physicians into the market is slow and uncertain, Dr. Argue will show that if a combined Saltzer/St. Luke's were in fact to impose supracompetitive pricing, recruitment and expansion by Saint Alphonsus and other competitors to defeat such pricing would soon follow, causing any such incr ease to be, at most, short-lived. Finally, the make-up of St. Luke's and its Bo ard further confirms the unlikelihood that it will seek to impose supracompetitive prices. St. Luke's is a charitable institution committed to enhancing the welfare of the population of southe rn Idaho. As the Court will hear from Arthur Oppenheimer, a member of St. Luke's Board of Di rectors, that Board incl udes representatives of employers who have a material interest in keep ing their employees' health care costs low. See, e.g., FTC v. Butterworth Health Corp. , 946 F. Supp. 1285, 1297 (W.D. Mich. 1996) (finding that \"the involvement of prominent community and business leaders on the boards of these [nonprofit] hospitals can be expected to bring real accoun tability to price structuring\"). B. Plaintiffs' Evidence of Supposed Pr ice Increases Is Unconvincing. Plaintiffs also point to St. Luke's prior transactions with othe r independent physician groups (primarily in the Magic Valley), as well as past negotiations between commercial insurers and St. Luke's and Saltzer, in an effort to support their claim of supposedly likely price increases. Neither is compelling. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 31 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 26 1. St. Luke's Past Transactions, in Other Markets, Do Not Support Plaintiffs' Claims That the Saltzer Transaction Will Result in Anticompetitive Effects in Nampa. Plaintiffs contend that prices have increased after St. Luke 's acquired the Magic Valley Medical Center, or acquire d or affiliated with other independ ent physician groups, and that this is supposed evidence that the Saltzer transaction will result in antic ompetitive pricing. For multiple reasons, however, the evidence does not support plaintiffs' claims. Initially, plaintiffs' experts have not undertaken any analysis of competitive conditions in the Magic Valley or the competitiveness of St. Luke's pricing more generally. This has two major consequences. First, it means that plain tiffs do not (and could not) show that the Magic Valley is sufficiently analogous to their alleged Nampa market to support an inference that supposed anticompetitive effects in the Magic Valley will occur in Nampa. See Ex. B, Aug. 26, 2013 Tr. at 38. Indeed, Dr. Argue will testify that the Magic Valley is not analogous to Nampa. Second, plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that any pri ce increases in the Magi c Valley (or elsewhere) are the result of St. Luke's exercising market power in order to engage in supracompetitive pricing. Contrary to plainti ffs' unsupported theories, St. Luke 's will show that any price increases in the Magic and Treasure Valleys are at tributable to other, le gitimate factors. One significant factor is in creases in reimbursement fr om Medicare due to provider- basing. As St. Luke's explai ned in its motion in limine regarding provider-basing, Dkt. 159, Medicare regulations provide that when a previo usly independent medical facility is converted into a hospital facility\u2014and when the facility satisfies a host of regul atory criteria, including providers' willing acceptance of Medicare and Medica id patients\u2014it is eligible to receive higher Medicare reimbursement. Thus, any price in creases from Medicare following St. Luke's provider-basing of previously inde pendent clinics is a result of federal regulations\u2014not market power. To be sure, in the commercial market, whether St. Luke's can obtain provider-based Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 32 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 27 reimbursement is a subject of negotiation with payers. Notably, however, the two largest commercial payers\u2014Blue Cross and Regence\u2014do not allow provider-based reimbursement. Plaintiffs also say that if St. Luke's conve rts a previously independent practice to an outpatient hospital department, St. Luke's may be gin billing for services at that location under St. Luke's contract rather than th e previously independent practice's. Plaintiffs contend that this results in commercial payers paying rates for an cillary, non-physician serv ices (such as X-rays) higher than what they paid when th e acquired sites were independent. See, e.g. , Dkt. 180 at 5-6. However, there is no \"ancillary services\" market at issue in this case . Plaintiffs have identified no evidence to suggest that St. Luke's will ha ve market power in any supposed market for \"ancillary services.\" Moreover, whether St. L uke's can bill under its contract for ancillary services at previously inde pendent locations is a subject of negotiation with payers. Finally, as St. Luke's leaders and physician s will explain, St. Luke's has invested tremendous resources to construct new facilities in Magic Valley, and has dramatically improved the accessibility and quality of care there. A ny increase in price in Magic Valley necessarily reflects these improvements. 2. Plaintiffs' Evidence of Price Nego tiations with Commercial Insurers Does Not Support Any Claim of Anticompetitive Pricing Plaintiffs also intend to present testimony fr om Jeffrey Crouch, a representative of Blue Cross of Idaho (\"BCI\"), relating anecdotes of past negotiations between St. Luke's and BCI in which BCI obtained less favorable terms than it wished. However, Mr. Crouch's subjective impression of those negotiations does not establish harm to competition in any relevant market. And plaintiffs' experts have not analyzed St. Luke's pricing in a manner that could offer objective support to the no tion that St. Luke's has exercised market power in its negotiations with BCI. Indeed, the evid ence is to the contrary. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 33 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 28 As Dr. Argue will show, St. Luke's acquisitions have not caused any increase in payments St. Luke's has received for phys ician services from commercial insurers\u2014 i.e., in the only product market the government pl aintiffs have alleged in this case. Indeed, Mr. Crouch has acknowledged that none of St. Luke's physician acquisitions resulted in any increase in physician fees paid by BCI to St. Luke's, and some have resulted in decreased physician fees. Similarly, plaintiffs' evidence of contract negot iations with commercial insurers fails to support their claims that Saltzer has market power in the alleged market for physician services in Nampa. Saltzer has always accepted BCI's statewide rate for physician services\u2014despite Mr. Crouch's characterization of Saltzer as a \"mus t have\" provider. Saltzer did obtain higher physician rates from Regence, another commercial insurer, as a result of its agreement to participate in Regence's development of a region al PPO network. As Dr. Argue will show, the circumstances of the contract do not support any claim of market power on the part of Saltzer. In any event, as a result of the transaction with St . Luke's, Saltzer physicians are now reimbursed at St. Luke's previous rate\u2014 i.e., Regence's statewide rate\u2014so that the challenged transaction has actually reduced the rates that Saltzer receives. Plaintiffs also claim that th e Saltzer transaction will perm it St. Luke's and Saltzer to exercise market power to raise prices for other services\u2014such as ancillary services. But, as noted above, no \"ancillary services\" market is at issue in this case . Basic economics dictates that unless it has market power in a relevant market for \"ancillary services\"\u2014which plaintiffs have not attempted to establish\u2014St. Luke's can not successfully charge supracompetitive prices in that market. Supposed power in one market does not, without substantially more, translate to an ability to engage in supracompe titive pricing in another market. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 34 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 29 C. The Hospital Plaintiffs' Claims of Unlawful Exclusionary Conduct Are Factually and Analytically Unsupported. The hospital plaintiffs (but not the government plaintiffs) contend that the transaction will harm competition in three additional alleged hospital services markets. In particular, they assert that by \"controlling\" a substantial number of PCPs in Nampa, St. Luke's will have the ability to deprive them of referrals from those PCPs, thus harming both the hospital plaintiffs and, they contend, competition. This position is flawed both legally and factually. As a legal matter, loss of referrals does not equate to harm to competition (as opposed to harm to a competitor) unless the loss is so great that it forecloses competition. See generally Areeda \u00b6 1010; Part I.B.2(b), Notably, the hospital plaint iffs' expert, Dr. Haas-Wilson, has failed even to attempt to assess whether the qu antity of referrals purportedly lost will cripple the effectiveness of Saint Alphonsus or TVH to compete in any market, or whether any purported effects on Saint Alphonsus or TVH will lead to harm to competition . As a factual matter, plaintiffs' claims of lo ss of referrals are uns upported. To begin, the foreclosure-related opinions of Dr. Haas-Wilson are based on her analysis of a half-dozen previous acquisitions of specialty physician gr oups by St. Luke's, including orthopedic surgeons, cardiovascular surgeons, and pulmonologists, who pe rform many of their serv ices in a hospital. She claims that following their affiliation with St. Luke's, the percen tage of inpatient and outpatient encounters at Saint Al phonsus and TVH attributable to these physicians decreased substantially. She relies on that evidence to in fer that admissions from Saltzer physicians will likewise decrease substantially. This analysis fails for several reasons. First, although Dr. Haas-Wilson points to a re duction in referrals from individual St. Luke's-affiliated practices, she has neither s hown nor even assessed whether Saint Alphonsus suffered a net loss in referrals or admissions as a result of the transactions. This is significant, Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 35 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 30 because the evidence will show that when pr eviously independent specialty physician groups became affiliated with St. Luke's, Saint Alphonsus PCPs reduced their referrals to those St. Luke's-affiliated specialists\u2014and in at least some cases instead di rected their referrals to non-St. Luke's specialists who continue d to admit their patients at Sa int Alphonsus. Thus, any loss of referrals is attributable to the conduct of Saint Alphonsus physicians. To take one example, Professor Haas-Wilson c ontends that Cardioth oracic and Vascular Associates (CVA) stopped admitting or admitted fewer patients to Saint Alphonsus after CVA affiliated with St. Luke's. However, the evidence shows that referrals from Saint Alphonsus PCPs to CVA surgeons went from 113 in the one- year period prior to their affiliation with St. Luke's to 37 in the one year-p eriod after they affiliated with St. Luke's. As Professor Haas- Wilson conceded in her deposition, she has ma de no effort to determine whether Saint Alphonsus actually \"lost\" admissions as a re sult of CVA's affiliation with St. Luke's\u2014or whether the change simply reflects that Saint Al's PCPs started sending their referrals to other cardiothoracic surgeons who continued to admit thos e patients to Saint Alphonsus. In fact, this latter explanation is the corre ct one. Indeed, Saint Alphonsus confirmed that it had not experienced any actual loss from CVA in a lett er to the Federal Trade Commission in July 2012. 5 Second, the methodology used by plaintiffs obscure s the fact that several referrals which Dr. Haas-Wilson regards as coming from Saint Alphonsus physicians came in fact from physicians associated with St. Luke's. Specificall y, the evidence will show that what frequently occurred is that a St. Luke's affiliated phys ician referred a patient to a Saint Alphonsus hospitalist. That hospitalist thus appears as th e admitting physician\u2014when in fact the referral came from a St. Luke's physician. This methodol ogical shortcoming taints the entire analysis. 5 Ex. E (TX 2231). Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 36 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 31 Finally, St. Luke's will demonstrate that it has not previously ordered and will not now order, or even incentivize, its affiliated physicians not to refer or admit patients to the hospital plaintiffs. In fact, as the Court will hear from Drs. Kaiser, Patterson, and Kunz, St. Luke's has assured the Saltzer physicians that they are free to make decisions on patient referrals based on the best interests of their patients and that th ey should continue to send patients to Saint Alphonsus-Nampa. These physicians w ill attest that this is precisely what the Saltzer physicians have done and what they intend to continue do ing. Physicians from other practices acquired by St. Luke's will similarly testify. To the extent re ferrals to the hospital plaintiffs from St. Luke's affiliated physicians have decreased, the expl anation does not lie in any St. Luke's mandate. IV. Divestiture Is Not an Appropriate Remedy The Court should hold that the Saltzer transa ction does not violate the antitrust laws. Should the Court find a violation, ho wever, it will have broad disc retion to fashion a remedy that is \"effective to redress the an titrust violation proved.\" United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. , 366 U.S. 316, 323 (1961). Here, divestiture would be inappropriat e for three reasons.6 A. Divestiture Would Not Inject Co mpetition into the Market To begin, far from injecting competition into the market, divestiture of Saltzer is most likely to lead to dissolution of that entity. As Saltzer's Chief Executive Officer, William Savage, will testify, Saltzer will face signi ficant financial difficulties if th e Court orders it divested from 6 While divestiture is a common remedy, it \"is not necessarily the most appropriate means for restoring competition.\" FTC v. PepsiCo, Inc. , 477 F.2d 24, 29 n. 8 (2d Cir. 1973). Indeed, \"divestiture ... should not be entered into lightly or without substantial ev idence that the benefit outweighs the harm. Its far-reaching effects put it at the least accessible end of a spectrum of injunctive relief.\" Garabet v. Autonomous 1172 (C.D. Cal. \"just as [a] merger must be vi ewed in the context of the particular market involved, its structure, history, a nd probable future, these considera tions must also be taken into account in determining the appropriate relief.\" United States v. Reed Roller Bit Co. , 274 F. Supp. 573, 585 (W.D. Okla. 1967) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 37 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 32 St. Luke's. As an independent group, prior to its affiliation with St. Luke's, the Saltzer physicians paid for a significant portion of Sa ltzer's operating expenses\u2014including the costs associated with its facilities and administ rative staff\u2014based on the proportion of each physician's revenues to Saltzer's total revenues. Compared to fiscal year 2012, Saltzer has lost a total of thirteen physic ians\u2014including Saltzer's seven highest -earning physicians, who left in late November 2012 to join Saint Alphonsus\u2014wh ile only starting a single new physician. Because the seven physicians who departed were the highest-earning Saltzer physicians, they also covered a disproportionate shar e of Saltzer's overhead expenses. St. Luke's expert Lisa Ahern will further offe r her opinion that if Saltz er were required to return to operations as an independent physicia n group, the Saltzer physicia ns would experience a decrease in compensation of 34% on average as compared to fiscal year 2012. Mr. Savage will testify that the loss of income that Saltzer physicians would suffer as a consequence of divestiture would make it difficult for Saltzer to retain its existing physicians or to recruit physicians to replace those who have departed Sa ltzer. Ms. Ahern's expert opinion similarly is that a compensation reduction of that magnitude will negatively affect retention and recruitment of physicians. Indeed, we will show that the mo st likely outcome of divestiture would be the break-up of Saltzer and possibly the depa rture of some physicians from Nampa. B. Divestiture Would Cause Substantial Harm To Consumers St. Luke's will also offer evidence to dem onstrate that divestiture would be highly detrimental. At a minimum, divesting Saltzer from St. Luke's would prevent St. Luke's and Saltzer from extending the benefits of integrat ed care to patients in Canyon County. Saltzer would no longer have access to the technological infr astructure that St. Luke's can offer, and it would be unable independently to engage in eith er risk-based contrac ting or population health management. Divestiture would thus risk thwar ting the goal of the Department of Health and Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 38 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 33 Welfare to transition from FFS to value-based deliv ery of care. It would pose a substantial risk of undermining the goal of the Department to pr ovide quality care to th e increasing number of Idahoans who are covered by Medi caid or are uninsured. And it would risk undoing the goal of the Department of Insurance to bring new forms of competition into the insurance market. Subjecting the people of Ada and Canyon counties to these harms is not necessary in order to \"effective[ly] ... redress\" an y supposed anticompetitive effects. E.I. du Pont , 366 U.S. at 323. Instead, the Court could avoid any concern that the combined market share of St. Luke's and Saltzer will lead to higher pr ices through the exercise of market power in negotiations with payers by use of a conduct remedy\u2014namely, requiri ng Saltzer to negotiate FFS contracts with payers independently from St. Luke's. In th ese circumstances, Saltzer would be solely responsible for negotiating such contracts with payers, and would be free to enter into agreements with payers that do not contract w ith St. Luke's. By limiting any such remedy to FFS contracts\u2014not risk-based contracts\u2014the Court can ensure that St. Luke's will retain the panel of physicians necessary to accept risk under such a contract. A conduct remedy that requires separate ne gotiation of FFS contra cts will address any concern that the transaction will allow St. Luke's to engage in supracompetitive pricing. Payers and employers who, for whatever reason, do not wish to engage in risk-based contracting with St. Luke's and Saltzer will be presented with the same contracting choices that they had prior to the transaction, and no payer or employer would be forced to pay more than competitive prices as a result of their transaction. No payer would have to agree to St . Luke's contract terms to gain access to the Saltzer physicians. Nor would any cu stomer have to agree to Saltzer's contract terms in order to gain access to St. Luke's inpatient, outpatient, or physician services. Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 39 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 34 Moreover, as compared to divestiture, a conduct remedy will offer consumers more choices and better care at lower cost. By ensuring that Saltzer will partic ipate in its risk-based contracts, St. Luke's will be able to offer payers and employers alternatives to FFS contracting. St. Luke's will also be able to move forw ard and expand its risk-based agreement with SelectHealth. Notably, the FTC has itself show n approval for a conduct remedy like this one. See In re Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Corp. , 2008 WL 1991995, at *3-4 (FTC Apr. 28 2008) (ordering combined hospitals to separately negotia te with payers).7 C. Given the Unique Structure of The Transaction, Divestiture Would Be Particularly Inappropriate at This Time In those cases in which divestiture is ordere d, divestiture is necessary at the time of the litigation because if the transaction is allowed to go forward, it can never be unscrambled. This case presents a notable contrast. As defendants will show at trial, Saltzer remains a separate corporation. Moreover, the tran saction documents set forth a detailed approach for separating Saltzer from St. Luke's should th e transaction, contrary to the st rong belief of the parties thereto, not engender the anticipated procompetitive benefits. In these circumstances, there is simply no reason to order divestiture now\u2014unless the Court concludes that there is absolutely no reas onable likelihood of procompetitive benefits if the transaction is allowed to go forward. Section 2 of the Sherman Act (prohibiting monopolization) and its analogue un der the Idaho antitrus t statute provide more than ample bases for ordering divestiture later if it turns out that St. Luke's raises prices above competitive levels or suppresses competition by excluding Saint Alphonsus or TVH from a sufficient number of referrals or networks to cripple the ability of these in stitutions to compete. And, as just noted, 7 Notably, just three months ago, the FTC accep ted a conduct remedy in another health care antitrust case. See FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health Sys., Inc. , No. 1-11-CV-00058 (M.D. Ga.) (Dkt. 129, June 15, 2013). Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194 Filed 09/10/13 Page 40 of 43 DEFENDANTS' PRETRIAL MEMORANDUM - 35 divestiture will be equally practicab le as a technical matter down the road as it is now. Indeed, holding off to see if the supposed consequences actu ally materialize has an additional benefit: If Saltzer is permitted to continue its affiliation wi th St. Luke's, it might be able to regain the strength needed to be an effective competitor in the event of subsequent divestiture. * * * * * At the end of the day, this case raises the que stion of whether a mid-sized market such as Ada and Canyon Counties can realize the benefits of the clinically integrat ed care that Congress in the Affordable Care Act sought to incentivize and that the best thi nkers in health policy believe to be our society's greatest hope for reducing cost while increasing quality. For the inescapable fact is that creat ion of a physician-hospital network on a scale necessary to permit transformation from volume-based to value-based b illing requires an integrated delivery system to align closely with a significant nu mber of PCPs in the market. On the facts of this case, if the Court were to find the Saltzer transaction unlaw ful, it would be sending a signal across America that wooden application of HHI numbers and th e recitation of speculativ e competitive harms will relegate people in such markets to what the Seventh Circuit has termed \"horse-and-buggy\" medicine. Marshfield Clinic , 65 F.3d at 1412. This would be the absolutely wrong signal to se nd. Foreclosing innovation in health care in this way is not consistent with\u2014much less required by \u2014the an titrust laws. This Court should not allow this case\u2014pressed by \"industry player s for whom such innovation poses a competitive threat\" and regulators flexing \"their muscles\" to \"demonstr ate their value to the public\"8\u2014to become yet another barrier to innovation in h ealth care. Judgment should be entered for defendants. At a minimum, divestitur e of Saltzer should not be ordered. 8 See Herzlinger, Ex. A.

A systematic assessment of the industry's innovation ills suggests some remedies and offers a framework for thinking about the obstacles to new ventures in any business. BIG PICTURE Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard by Regina E. Herzlinger Health care-in the United States, certainly, but also in most other developed countries-is ailing and in need of help. Yes, medical treat\u00ad ment has made astonishing advances over the years. But the packaging and delivery of that treatment are often inefficient, ineffective, and consumer unfriendly. The well-known problems range from medi\u00ad cal errors, which by some accounts are the eighth leading cause of death in the United States, to the soaring cost of health care. The amount spent now represents about one-sixth of the U.S. gross domestic product; it continues to grow much faster than the economy; and it threatens the economic future of the govern\u00ad ments, businesses, and individuals called upon to foot the bill. Despite the outlay, more than 40 million people have no health insurance. Such problems beg for innovative solutions involving every aspect of health care-its deliv\u00ad ery to consumers, its technology, and its busi\u00ad ness models. Indeed, a great deal of money has been spent on the search for solutions. U.S. government spending on health care R&D, which came to $26 billion in 2003, is topped only by the government's spending on defense R&D. Private-sector spending on health care R&D-in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical devices, and health services-also runs into the tens of billions of dollars. According to one study of U.S. companies, only software spawns more new ventures receiving early\u00ad stage angel funding than the health field. Despite this enormous investment in inno\u00ad vation and the magnitude of the opportunity for innovators to both do good and do well, all too many efforts fail, losing billions of investor dollars along the way. Some of the more con\u00ad spicuous examples: the disastrous outcome of the managed care revolution, the $40 billion lost by investors to biotech ventures, and the collapse of numerous businesses aimed at bringing economies of scale to fragmented physician practices. So why is innovation so unsuccessful in health care? To answer, we must break down the problem, looking at the different types of innovation and the forces that affect them, for HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW MAh~QQ\u00a7 ___ Page 3 of 12Regina E.

Consumer focused. Innovations in the de\u00ad livery of health care can result in more\u00ad convenient, and less-expensive treatments for today's time-stressed and in\u00ad creasingly empowered health care consumers. For example, a health plan can involve con\u00ad sumers in the service delivery process by offer\u00ad ing low-cost, high-deductible insurance, which can give members greater control over their personal health care spending. Or a health plan (or service provider) can focus on becom\u00ad ing more user-friendly. Patients, after all, are like other consumers: They want not only a good product-quality care at a good price\u00ad but also ease of use. People in the United States have to wait an average of three weeks for an appointment and, when they show up, 30 minutes to see a doctor, according to a 2003 study by the American Medical Association. More seriously, they often must travel from one facility to another for treatment, espe\u00ad cially in the case of chronic diseases that in\u00ad volve several medical disciplines. Technology. New drugs, diagnostic meth\u00ad ods, drug delivery systems, and medical de\u00ad vices offer the hope of better treatment and of care that is less costly, disruptive, and painful. For example, implanted sensors can help pa\u00ad tients monitor their diseases more effectively. And IT innovations that connect the many is\u00ad lands of information in the health care system can both vastly improve quality and lower costs by, for example, keeping a patient's vari\u00ad ous providers informed and thereby reducing errors of omission or commission. Business model. Health care is still an as\u00ad tonishingly fragmented industry. More than half of U.S. physicians work in practices of three or fewer doctors; a quarter of the na\u00ad tion's s,ooo community hospitals and nearly half of its 17,000 nursing homes are indepen\u00ad dent; and the medical device and biotech\u00ad nology sectors are made up of thousands of small firms. Innovative business models, par\u00ad ticularly those that integrate health care ac\u00ad tivities, can increase efficiency, improve care, and save consumers time. You can roll a num\u00ad ber of independent players up into a single organization-horizontal integration-to gen\u00ad erate economies of scale. Or you can bring the treatment of a chronic disease under one roof-vertical integration-and make the treatment more effective and convenient. In the latter case, patients get one-stop shopping and are freed from the burden of coordinating their care with myriad providers (for example, the ophthalmologists, podiatrists, cardiolo\u00ad gists, neurologists, and nephrologists who care Such \"focused factories;' to adopt C. Wickham Skinner's term, cut costs by improving patients' health. Furthermore, they reduce the likelihood that an individual's care will fall between the cracks of different medical disciplines. The health care system erects an array of barriers to each of these valuable types of innovation. More often than not, though, the obstacles can be overcome by managing the six forces that have an impact on health care innovation. The Forces Affecting Innovation The six forces-industry players, funding, public policy, technology, customers, and accountability-can help or hinder efforts at innovation. Individually or in combination, the forces will affect the three types of inno\u00ad vation in different ways. Players. The health care sector has many stakeholders, each with an agenda. Often, these players have substantial resources and the power to influence public policy and opinion by attacking or helping the innovator. For example, hospitals and doctors sometimes blame technology-driven product innovators for the health care system's high costs. Medical specialists wage turf warfare for control of pa\u00ad tient services, and insurers battle medical ser\u00ad vice and technology providers over which HARVARD Filed 09/10/13 Page 4 of 12Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard BIG PICTURE treatments and payments are acceptable. In\u00ad patient hospitals and outpatient care providers vie for patients, while chains and independent organizations spar over market influence. Nonprofit, for-profit, and publicly funded in\u00ad stitutions quarrel over their respective roles and rights. Patient advocates seek influence with policy makers and politicians, who may have a different agenda altogether-namely, seeking fame and public adulation through their decisions or votes. The competing interests of the different groups aren't always clear or permanent. The AMA and the tort lawyers, bitter foes on the subject of physician malpractice, have lob\u00ad bied together for legislation to enable people who are wrongly denied medical care to sue managed-care insurance plans. Unless innova\u00ad tors recognize and try to work with the com\u00ad plex interests of the different players, they will see their efforts stymied. Funding. Innovation in health care presents two kinds of financial challenges: funding the innovation's development and figuring out who will pay how much for the product or ser\u00ad vice it yields. One problem is the long invest\u00ad ment time needed for new drugs or therapies that require FDA approval. While venture capi\u00ad talists backing an IT start-up may be able to get their money out in two to three years, in\u00ad vestors in a biotech firm have to wait ten years Six Forces That Can Drive Innovation-Or Kill It Players The friends and foes lurking in the health care system that can destroy or bolster an innovation's chance of success. Funding The processes for generating revenue and acquiring capital, both of which dif\u00ad fer from those in most other industries. Policy The regulations that pervade the industry, because incompetent or fraudulent su ppl i\u00ad ers can do irreversible human damage. Technology The foundation for advances in treat- HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW MA 2006 ment and for innovations that can make health care delivery more efficient and convenient. Customers The increasingly engaged consumers of health care, for whom the passive term \"patient\" seems outdated. Accountability The demand from vigilant consumers and cost-pressured payers that innova\u00ad tive health care products be not only safe and effective but also cost-effective relative to competing products. even to find out whether a product will be ap\u00ad proved for use. Another problem is that many traditional sources of capital aren't familiar with the health care industry, so it's difficult to find investors, let alone investors who can pro\u00ad vide helpful guidance to the innovator. A frequent source of investor confusion is the health care sector's complex system of payments, or reimbursements, which typi\u00ad cally come not from the ultimate consumer but from a third party-the government or a private insurer. This arrangement raises an array of issues. Most obviously, insurers must approve a new product or service, and its pric\u00ad ing, before they will pay. And their perception of a product's value, which determines the level of reimbursement, may differ from pa\u00ad tients'. Furthermore, insurers may disagree. Medicare, whose relationships with its enroll\u00ad ees sometimes last decades, may see far more value in an innovation with a long-term cost impact, such as an obesity reduction treat\u00ad ment or an expensive diagnostic test, than would a commercial insurer, which typically sees an annual 20% turnover. An additional complication: Innovations need to appeal to doctors, who are in a position to recommend new products to patients, and doctors' opinions differ. From a financial perspective, a physi\u00ad cian who is paid a flat salary by a health main\u00ad tenance organization may be less interested in, say, performing a procedure to implant a monitoring device than would a doctor who is paid a fee for such services. Policy. Government regulation of health care can sometimes aid innovation (\"orphan drug\" laws provide incentives to companies that develop treatments for rare diseases) and sometimes hinder it (recent legislation in the United States placed a moratorium on the opening of new specialty hospitals that focus on certain surgical procedures). Thus, it is im\u00ad portant for innovators to understand the ex\u00ad tensive network of regulations that may af\u00ad fect a particular innovation and how and by whom those rules are enacted, modified, and applied. For instance, officials know they will be punished by the public and politi\u00ad cians more for underregulating-approving a harmful drug, say-than for tightening the approval process, even if doing so delays a useful innovation. A company with a new health care idea should also be aware that regulators, to dem- PAGE Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194-1 Filed 09/10/13 Page 5 of 12The competing interests of different players aren't always permanent. The AMA and the tort lawyers, bitter foes on malpractice, have lobbied together to allow patients to sue managed care plans. HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW MA 20 6 Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard BIG PICTURE onstrate their value to the public, may ripple their muscles occasionally by tightly inter\u00ad preting ambiguous rules or punishing a hap\u00ad less innovator. Technology. As medical technology evolves, understanding how and when to adopt or in\u00ad vest in it is critically important. Move too early, and the infrastructure needed to sup\u00ad port the innovation may not yet be in place; wait too long, and the time to gain competi\u00ad tive advantage may have passed. Keep in mind that competition exists not only within each technology-among drugs aimed at a disease category, for example-but also across different technologies. The polio vaccine eventually eliminated the need for drugs, devices, and services that had been used to treat the disease, just as kidney transplants have reduced the need for dialysis. Conversely, the discovery of an effective molecular diag\u00ad nostic method for a disease such as Alzhei\u00ad mer's would greatly enhance the demand for therapeutic drugs and devices. Customers. The empowered and engaged consumers of health care-the passive \"pa\u00ad tient\" increasingly seems an anachronistic term-are a force to be reckoned with in all three types of health care innovation. Sick people and their families join disease associa\u00ad tions such as the American Cancer Society that lobby for research funds. Interest groups, such as the elderly, advocate increased fund\u00ad ing for their health care needs through power\u00ad ful organizations such as AARP. Those who suffer from various ailments pressure health care providers for access to drugs, diagnostics, services, and devices they consider effective. What's more, consumers spend tremendous sums out of their own pockets on health care services-for example, an estimated $40 bil\u00ad lion on complementary medicine such as acu\u00ad puncture and meditation-that many tradi\u00ad tional medical providers believe to be of dubious value. Armed with information gleaned from the Internet, such consumers dis\u00ad regard medical advice they don't agree with, choosing, for example, to shun certain drugs doctors have prescribed. A company that rec\u00ad ognizes and leverages consumers' growing sense of empowerment, and actual power, can greatly enhance the adoption of an innovation. Accountability. Increasingly, empowered consumers and cost-pressured payers are de\u00ad manding accountability from health care in-novators. For instance, they require that tech\u00ad nology innovators show cost-effectiveness and long-term safety, in addition to fulfilling the shorter-term efficacy and safety require\u00ad ments of regulatory agencies. In the United States, the numerous industry organizations that have been created to meet these de\u00ad mands haven't fully succeeded in doing so. For example, a study found that the accredi\u00ad tation of hospitals by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health care Organizations (JCAHO), an industry-dominated group, had scant correlation with mortality rates. One reason for the limited success of these agencies is that they typically focus on process rather than on output, looking, say, not at im\u00ad provements in patient health but at whether a provider has followed a treatment process. However well intentioned, these bodies usu\u00ad ally aren't neutral auditors focused on the consumer but rather are extensions of the in\u00ad dustries they regulate. For instance, JCAHO and the National Committee for Quality Assur\u00ad ance, the agencies primarily responsible for monitoring compliance with standards in the hospital and insurance sectors, are overseen mainly by the firms in those industries. But whether the agents of accountability are effective or not, health care innovators must do everything possible to try to address their often opaque demands. Otherwise, innovating companies face the prospect of a forceful back:\u00ad lash from industry monitors or the public. The Barriers to Innovation Unless the six forces are acknowledged and managed intelligently, any of them can cre\u00ad ate obstacles to innovation in each of the three areas. In consumer-focused innovation. The exist\u00ad ence of hostile industry players or the absence of helpful ones can hinder consumer-focused innovation. Status quo organizations tend to view such innovation as a direct threat to their power. For example, many physicians resent direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertis\u00ad ing or for-profit attempts to provide health care in convenient locations, such as shopping malls, and use their influence to resist such moves. Conversely, companies' attempts to reach consumers with new products or ser\u00ad vices are often thwarted by a lack of devel\u00ad oped consumer marketing and distribution channels in the health care sector as well as a Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194-1 Filed 09/10/13 Page 6 of 12HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW MA 20 6 Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard BIG PICTURE lack of intermediaries, such as distributors, who would make the channels work. Oppo\u00ad nents of consumer-focused innovation may try to influence public policy, often by playing on the general bias against for-profit ventures in health care or by arguing that a new type of service, such as a facility specializing in one disease, will cherry-pick the most profitable customers and leave the rest to nonprofit hos\u00ad pitals. Innovators must therefore be prepared to respond to those seeking accountability for a new product's or new service's cost-effectiveness, efficacy, and safety. It also can be difficult for innovators to get funding for consumer-focused ventures be\u00ad cause few traditional health care investors have significant expertise in products and ser\u00ad vices marketed to and purchased by the con\u00ad sumer. This hints at another financial chal\u00ad lenge: Consumers generally aren't used to paying for conventional health care. While they may not blink at the purchase of a $35,000 SUV-or even a medical service not traditionally covered by insurance, such as cos\u00ad metic surgery or vitamin supplements-many will hesitate to fork over $1,000 for a medical image. Insurers and other third-party payers also may resist footing the bill for some consumer-focused services-for example, in\u00ad creased diagnostic testing-fearing a further increase in their costs. These barriers impeded-and ultimately helped kill or drive into the arms of a competitor-two companies that offered innovative health care services directly to consumers. Health Stop was a venture capital\u00ad financed chain of conveniently located, no\u00ad appointment-needed health care centers in the eastern and midwestern U.S. for patients who were seeking fast medical treatment and did not require hospitalization. Al\u00ad though designed to serve people who had no primary care doctor or who needed treat\u00ad ment on nights and weekends, Health Stop unwittingly found itself competing with local community doctors and nonprofit hos\u00ad pital emergency rooms for business. Guess who won? The community doctors bad-mouthed Health Stop's quality of care and its faceless corporate ownership, while the hospitals argued in the media that their emergency rooms could not survive without revenue from the relatively healthy patients whom Health Stop targeted. The criticism tar-nished the chain in the eyes of some patients. Because Health Stop hadn't fully anticipated this opposition, it hadn't worked in advance with the local physicians and hospitals to re\u00ad solve problems and to sufficiently document to the medical community the quality of its care. The company's failure to foresee these setbacks was compounded by the lack of health services expertise of its major investor, a venture capital firm that typically bank\u00ad rolled high-tech start-ups. Although the chain had more than 100 clinics and generated an\u00ad nual sales of more than $so million during its heyday, it was never profitable. The business was dissolved after a decade. HealthAllies, founded as a health care \"buy\u00ad ing club\" in 1999, met a sinlilar fate. By aggre\u00ad gating purchases of medical services not typically covered by insurance-such as orth\u00ad odontia, in vitro fertilization, and plastic surgery-it hoped to negotiate discounted rates with providers, thereby giving individual customers, who paid a small referral fee, the collective clout of an insurance company. It was a classic do-good, do-well venture, but it failed to flourish. The main obstacle was the health care indus\u00ad try's absence of marketing and distribution channels for individual consumers. Potential intermediaries weren't sufficiently interested. For many employers, adding this service to the subsidized insurance they already offered em\u00ad ployees would have meant new administra\u00ad tive hassles with little benefit. Insurance bro\u00ad kers found the commissions for selling the service-a small percentage of a small referral fee-unattractive, especially as customers were purchasing the right to participate for a one-time medical need rather than renewable policies. Without marketing channels, the company found that its customer acquisition costs were too high. HealthAilies was bought for a modest amount in 2003. UnitedHealth Group, the giant insurance company that took it over, has found ready buyers for the com\u00ad pany's service among the many employers it already sells insurance to. In technology-based innovation. The obsta\u00ad cles to technological innovations are numer\u00ad ous. On the accountability front, an innovator faces the complex task of complying with a welter of often murky governmental regula\u00ad tions, which increasingly require companies to show that new products not only do what's PAGE Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194-1 Filed 09/10/13 Page 7 of 12Because insurers tend to analyze their costs in silos, they may resist approving, say, an expensive new heart drug even if it will decrease the company's payments for cardiac\u00ad related hospital admissions. HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW MA 2006 Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard BIG PICTURE claimed, safely, but also are cost-effective rela\u00ad tive to competing products. As for funding, the innovator must work with insurers in advance of a launch to see to it that the product will be eligible for reimburse\u00ad ment (usually easier if it's used in treatment than if it's for diagnostic purposes). In seeking this approval, the innovator will typically look for support from industry players-physicians, hospitals, and an array of powerful intermedi\u00ad aries, including group purchasing organiza\u00ad tions, or GPOs, which consolidate the purchas\u00ad ing power of thousands of hospitals. GPOs typically favor suppliers with broad product lines rather than a single innovative product. The intermediaries also include pharmaceuti\u00ad cal benefit managers, or PBMs, which create \"formularies\" for health insurers-that is, the menu of drugs that will be made available at relatively low prices to enrollees. Innovators must also take into account the economics of insurers and health care provid\u00ad ers and the relationships among them. For in\u00ad stance, insurers do not typically pay sepa\u00ad rately for capital equipment; payments for procedures that use new equipment must cover the capital costs in addition to the hos\u00ad pital's other expenses. So a vendor of a new anesthesia technology must be ready to help its hospital customers obtain additional reim\u00ad bursement from insurers for the higher costs of the new devices. Even technologies that unambiguously re\u00ad duce costs-by substituting capital for labor, say, or shortening the length of a hospital stay-face challenges. Because insurers tend to analyze their costs in silos, they often don't see the link between a reduction in hospital labor costs and the new technology responsi\u00ad ble for it; they see only the new costs associ\u00ad ated with the technology. For example, insur\u00ad ers may resist approving an expensive new heart drug even if, over the long term, it will decrease their payments for cardiac-related hospital admissions. Innovators must also take pains to identify the best parties to target for adoption of a new technology and then provide them with com\u00ad plete medical and financial information. Tradi\u00ad tionally trained surgeons, for instance, may take a dim view of what are known as mini\u00ad mally invasive surgery, or MIS, techniques, which enable radiologists and other nonsur\u00ad geons to perform operations. In the early days of MIS, a spate of articles that could be inter\u00ad preted as an attempt by surgeons to protect their turf appeared in the New England journal of Medicine claiming the techniques would cause an explosion of unneeded surgeries. A little-appreciated barrier to technology in\u00ad novation involves technology itself-or, rather, innovators' tendency to be infatuated with their own gadgets and blind to competing ideas. While an innovative product may indeed offer an effective treatment that would save money, particular providers and insurers might, for a variety of reasons, prefer a com\u00ad pletely different technology. One technology-driven medical device firm saw a major product innovation foiled by sev\u00ad eral such obstacles. The company's product, an instrument for performing noninvasive sur\u00ad gery to correct acid reflux disease, simplified an expensive and complicated operation, en\u00ad abling gastroenterologists to perform a proce\u00ad dure usually reserved for surgeons. The device would have allowed surgeons to increase the number of acid reflux procedures they per\u00ad formed. But instead of going to the surgeons to get their buy-in, the company targeted only gastroenterologists for training, setting off a turf war. The firm also failed to work out with insurers a means to obtain coverage and payment-it didn't even obtain a new billing code for the device-before marketing the product. Without these reimbursement proto\u00ad cols in place, physicians and hospitals were re\u00ad luctant to quickly adopt the new procedure. Perhaps the biggest barrier was the com\u00ad pany's failure to consider a formidable but less\u00ad than-obvious competing technology, one that involved no surgery at all. It was an approach that might be called the \"Turns solution?' Ant\u00ad acids like Turns-and, even more effectively, drugs like Pepcid and Zantac, which had re\u00ad cently come off patent-provided some relief and were deemed good enough by many con\u00ad sumers. As a result, the technologically innova\u00ad tive device for noninvasive surgery was adopted very slowly, permitting rival firms to enter the field. Similarly, a company that developed a co\u00ad chlear implant for the profoundly deaf was so infatuated with the technology that it didn't foresee opposition from militant segments of the hearing-impaired community that ob\u00ad jected to the concept of a technological \"fix\" for deafness. PAGE 6 Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194-1 Filed 09/10/13 Page 8 of 12Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard BIG PICTURE In business model innovation. The integra\u00ad tion of health care activities-consolidating the practices of independent physicians, say, or integrating the disparate treatments of a particular disease-can lower costs and im\u00ad prove care. But doing this isn't easy. Many management firms that sought to horizontally integrate physician practices are now bank\u00ad rupt. And specialty facilities designed to verti\u00ad cally integrate the treatment of a particular disease, from prevention to cure, have gener\u00ad ally lost money. As with consumer-focused innovations, ven\u00ad tures that experiment with new business models often face opposition from local hos\u00ad pitals, physicians, and other industry players for whom such innovation poses a competi\u00ad tive threat. Powerful community-based pro\u00ad viders that might be harmed by a larger or more efficient rival work to undermine the venture, often playing the public policy card by raising antitrust concerns or making the most of prejudices or laws against physician\u00ad owned businesses. Nonprofit health services providers cannot Prescriptions for Public Policy In the United States, a few policy changes would jump-start the health care industry's ability to innovate. Aconsumer\"ilriven system. Giving U.S. consumers control over their health insur\u00ad ance spending would transform the health insurance market, better aligning consumers' and innovators' interests. We are already seeing this in the case ofthe increasingly popular low-cost, high-deductible health in\u00ad surance policies offered by many employers. To create a completely consumer\"ilriven sys\u00ad tem, we'd need to replace tax laws favoring employer-based insurance with individual tax credits for health insurance spending, thereby prompting the transfer of funds that employ\u00ad ers currently spend on employee health in\u00ad surance to the employees themselves. easily merge, because they tend to lack the cap\u00ad ital to buy one another. While capital is usually available for funding for-profit ventures that are based on horizontal consolidation, verti\u00ad cally integrated organizations may encounter greater difficulties in securing investment, be\u00ad cause there typically isn't reimbursement for integrated treatment of a disease (think of breast cancer). Instead, payment is piecemeal. Although Duke University Medical Center's specialized congestive heart failure program reduced the average cost of treating patients by $8,600, or about 40%, by improving their outcomes and therefore their hospital admis\u00ad sion rates, the facility was penalized by insur\u00ad ers, which pay for care of the sick and not for improving people's health status. The healthier its patients were, the more money Duke lost. Technology also plays a part in the success or failure of such operations. Without a robust IT infrastructure, an organization won't be able to deliver the promised benefits of integra\u00ad tion. This may not be immediately obvious to people in the health care industry, which is near the bottom of the ladder in terms of IT ance reimbursement. Disincentives to provide lower-cost care are common; making patients healthy usually doesn't pay. And in\u00ad tegrating care-offering the medical equiva\u00ad lent of an automobile, rather than a wheel, an engine, and a chassis-typically doesn't have a reimbursement code. Universal coverage. Ensuring that the 46 million or so uninsured people in the U.S. have health insurance would spur innovation by dramatically increasing the size of the market. But is it achievable? Universal cover\u00ad age is, after all, one of the most contentious political issues of our time. Switzerland offers some possible answers. The country requires people to buy health insurance, subsidizing the sick and those who can't afford coverage. Although the Swiss government constrains the design of benefits, Swiss insurers have greater incentives to respond to consumer needs than do U.S. insurers, which sell prima\u00ad rily to employers or to government-based or\u00ad ganizations. Switzerland's excellent health care system costs only 11% of G DP, versus 16% for the United States. More detail on the Swiss experience can be found in an article I coau\u00ad thored, \"Consumer-Driven Health Care: Les\u00ad sons from Switzerland\" Uournal the Ameri\u00ad can Medical Association, September 8, 2004). Market-based pricing. A system in which insurers set the prices that providers charge consumers is inefficient and a barrier to in\u00ad novative attempts to integrate health care ac\u00ad tivities.

While it has its flaws, the SEC gen\u00ad erally ensures that consumers have ade\u00ad quate information by requiring companies to publish financial results that are verified by an independent auditor.

A few simple steps can position your business to thrive. HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW MA 20 6 Why Innovation in Health Care Is So Hard BIG PICTURE spending and uniform data standards. Such obstacles contributed to the problems of MedCath, a North Carolina-based for-profit chain of hospitals specializing in cardiac surgi\u00ad cal procedures. In each of the 12 markets where it opened in the late 1990s and early 2ooos, the company faced resistance from general-purpose hospitals. They argued that in\u00ad stead of offering cheaper care and better out\u00ad comes because of its specialized focus (as the company claimed), MedCath was simply skim\u00ad ming the profitable patients. In some cases, local hospitals strong-armed commercial insur\u00ad ers into excluding Medcath from their lists of approved providers, threatening to cut their own ties with the insurers if they failed to blackball Medcath. The resistance was further fueled by resent\u00ad ment among local doctors toward Medcath physicians, all of whom were part owners of the chain. The ownership issue also raised problems on another front Spurred by argu\u00ad ments that conflicts of interest were unavoid\u00ad able at MedCath and other physician-owned hospitals, Congress in 2003 placed a morato\u00ad rium on the future growth of such facilities. Avoiding the Obstacles Only legislators can remove the barriers to health care innovation that are the result of current laws and regulations (see the sidebar \"Prescriptions for Public Policy\"). But compa\u00ad nies are far from helpless. A few simple steps can position your business to thrive, despite the obstacles. First, recognize the six forces. Next, turn them to your advantage, if possible. If not, work around them, or, if necessary, con\u00ad cede that a particular innovative venture may not be worth pursuing, at least for now. MinuteClinic, a Minneapolis-based chain of walk-in clinics located in retail settings such as Target stores, avoided some of the obsta\u00ad cles that hobbled Health Stop in its effort at consumerfocused innovation. Like Health Stop, MinuteClinic offers basic health care designed with the needs of cost-conscious and time\u00ad pressed consumers in mind. It features short waits and low prices-even lower than Health Stop's, because MinuteClinic treats only a lim\u00ad ited set of common ailments (such as strep throat and bladder infections) that don't re\u00ad quire expensive equipment. But the big differ\u00ad ence is that MinuteClinic hasn't antagonized local physicians. Because care is provided by nurse practitioners, the company doesn't rep\u00ad resent a direct competitive threat. Although some doctors have grun1bled that nurse practi\u00ad tioners might fail to spot more serious prob\u00ad lems, especially in infants, there has been no widespread outcry against MinuteClinic, mak\u00ad ing the establishment of in-network relation\u00ad ships with major health plans relatively easy. Medtronic was one of the first makers of im\u00ad plantable heart pacemakers, but over the years, the Minneapolis-based company branched into other medical and surgical devices. The company's success is partly based on its ability to avoid some of the barriers to technology in\u00ad novation that beset the previously mentioned developer of an acid-reflux device. For exam\u00ad ple, when Medtronic expanded into implant\u00ad able heart defibrillators, it worked directly with the surgeons who would be implanting them so that the company could identify prob\u00ad lems and set procedures. It confirmed the de\u00ad vices' safety and efficacy in clinical trials, which greatly simplified reimbursement ap\u00ad proval from insurers. And, of course, there was no effective Turns equivalent as an alternative. HCA (originally known as Hospital Corpora\u00ad tion of America) successfully pioneered a busi\u00ad ness model innovation that allowed it to consoli\u00ad date the management of dozens of facilities and thereby realize economies of scale unknown in the fragmented health care industry. The na\u00ad tional chain-currently 190 hospitals and 200 outpatient centers-succeeded in part because it didn't try to compete head-to-head with politi\u00ad cally powerful academic medical centers. In\u00ad stead, it grew mostly through expansion into underserved communities, where customers were grateful for a local hospital and where doc\u00ad tors welcomed the chance to work in modern facilities. The certainty of reimbursement from insurers and Medicare enabled HCA to borrow heavily for construction, and its access to the eq\u00ad uity markets as a public company offered fund\u00ad ing that was unavailable to nonprofit hospitals. In the late 199os, HCA was investigated for Medicare and Medicaid fraud and paid a settle\u00ad ment of $1.7 billion, the largest fraud settlement in U.S. history. No criminal charges were brought against the company, and some people wondered whether a nonprofit institution would have paid so dearly for its alleged mis\u00ad deeds. But the publicly traded company weath\u00ad ered the crisis and, with a new management team in place, has continued to perform well.

For example, in certain European countries, the government's role as the pri\u00ad mary payer for health care has created a differ\u00ad ent interplay among the six forces. For obvious reasons, the single-payer system hinders customer-focused innovation. But it also seriously constrains technology-based in\u00ad novation. The government's need to strictly control costs translates into less money to spend on care of the truly sick, who are the tar\u00ad get of most technology-based innovation. Con\u00ad sequently, a large venture-capital community hasn't grown up in Europe to fund new health technology ventures. Centralized health care systems, with their buying clout, also keep drug and medical device prices low-delight\u00ad ing consumers but squeezing margins for inno\u00ad vators. The centralized nature of the systems would seem to offer the potential for innova\u00ad tion in the treatment of diseases where a lot of integration is needed, but the record is mixed. Modified to fit the situation, this framework can also be used to analyze the barriers to in\u00ad novation in a variety of industries. Cataloging the types of innovation that can add value in particular fields and identifying the forces that aid and undermine those advances can un\u00ad cover insights on how to treat chronic innova\u00ad tion ills-prescriptions that will make any in\u00ad dustry healthier.

That's3 what I have to say, Your Honor.4 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.5 Well, Counsel, we will probably issue6 just a short written decision, but it may only be7 a page or two in length. My inclination is8 to -- again, I'm sure the plaintiffs won't want to9 phrase it this way -- but to grant the motion for 10 summary judgment but with the caveat that in11 essence it's simply making sure that our record is12 caught up with the facts of the case since the13 plaintiff has essentially agreed to forego that14 claim as of apparently December of last year. And15 that the only claims that are being made here is16 that, in fact, a claim of antitrust injury17 resulting from potential foreclosure from the18 market and not because of any increase in prices.19 I don't think that changes anything on the ground.20 I mean, we are where we are.21 What I'm probably not willing to do,22 though, is to preclude the private plaintiffs from23 at least trying to persuade me that there is some24 value to be added in putting on the kind of25 evidence that has been described here. And I'mCase 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194-2 Filed 09/10/13 Page 3 of 6Page 38 1 pretty confident I am going to be fairly rigorous 2 in requiring either a showing that the complained3 of action, that is, the acquisition that resulted4 in increased prices, actually occurred either in5 the same market or markets that are at issue here6 or that the plaintiffs can show that there is such7 a clear analogue that can be made that we -- that8 the court will -- there will be some value added,9 I guess, from that information. 10 But I think that's something that kind11 of remains to be seen. We may want to discuss12 that at the time of the pretrial conference. It13 might be a good time to just sort that out.14 Counsel, at this point, we'll issue a15 short written decision, but I think I'm pretty16 much where I started in this matter, unable and17 perhaps unwilling as Mr. Powers put it, to18 foreclose at this early stage in the game the19 private plaintiffs from putting on that evidence,20 but I have given, I think, Counsel, at least a21 pretty clear indication of some reservations I22 have and some things they will need to do before I23 can be persuaded to take the time to put on that24 additional evidence.25 Counsel, there were some kind ofCase 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194-2 Filed 09/10/13 Page 4 of 6Page 39 1 housekeeping matters that you wanted to take up. 2 We have been in trial all day, and I would prefer3 to go off the record because Ms. Hohenleitner has4 been -- we have been going since 9:00 without a5 break.

It is widely believed today that greater coordination of care will improve health outcomes and result in better healthcare value. There is general consensus am ong healthcare leaders, policymakers, academicians, and other healthcare st akeholders that there is an urgent need to re-engineer the delivery of healthcare to coordinate patie nt care across conditions, providers, settings, and time so that it is safe, timely, ef fective, efficient, and patient-focused. This vision of coordinated patient care is generally what is meant by the term clinical integration . 22. The terms integration and integrated are now commonly used in h ealthcare in reference to the delivery of patient care services, although often without pr ecision or clarity about their exact meaning.16 For example, the terms integrated delivery system and integrated patient care are sometimes used as if they were in terchangeable, incorrectly equating the legal structure utilized by a group of healthcare providers to organize themselves with the product produced by the providers through the organizational structure - i.e., patient care. The difference in meaning between integrated delivery system and integrated patient care was well demonstrated by the VA Healthcare System in the early 1990s, at which time it was unquestionably an integrated delivery system, but also unquestionabl y was not delivering integrated patient care.17 23. None of the terms integration, integrated, or integrated healthcare has a standardized definition in healthcare.18 Sometimes they seem to be used simply to refer to healthcare 16 CARING FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS , A HEALTH SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE (Ellen Nolte & Martin McKee eds., Open University Press 2008; S TEPHEN M.

The resulting lists of \"Five Thi ngs Physicians and Pa tients Should Question\" (representing over 100 tests and pro cedures in the aggregate at pr esent) are intended to spark discussion about the need - or lack ther eof - for many frequently ordered tests and procedures. From the initial pilot with th e National Physicians Alliance targeting the specialties of internal medicine, family practice and pediatrics , the Choosing Wisely Campaign's partners have grown to include 25 medical specialty so cieties in 2012, with another 27 expected to join in 2013. Consumer Reports and more than a dozen consumer and business groups, including the AARP, Nati onal Partnership for Women & Families, National Business Coalition on Health, and SEIU, are working in collaboration with these medical specialty societies to disseminate in formation and educate pa tients on making wise health care use decisions. 107. Whatever the exact timeline, it now seems evident that FFS payment for healthcare services in the U.S. will be largely phased out in coming years and replaced with value-based payment methods such as those mentioned above, as well as others still to be determined. Various macro-economic trends may well hasten this transition. As a result, healthcare providers of all types will, of necessity, adjust and accommodate to the emerging new healthcare economy, although this by no means equates with the demise of independent or autonomous medical practitioners. Instead, it simp ly means that healthca re providers of all types, regardless of their organizational stru cture, will have to learn to partner and collaborate to achieve clinical integration a nd to be better stewar ds of limited healthcare resources. 46 ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLYCase 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194-3 Filed 5Case 1:12-cv-00560-BLW-REB Document 194-3 Filed 09/10/13 Page 5 of 5 "}
