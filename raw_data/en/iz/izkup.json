Abortion Laws To Be Shaped By State's Now Liberal-Leaning High Court ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/wis-abortion-laws-to-be-shaped-by-states-now-liberal-leaning-high-court/) Judge Janet Protasiewicz was elected Tuesday to fill the open seat on Wisconsin's Supreme Court, in a closely watched race. Her win shifts the court's idealogical makeup to the left, which makes it more likely that a contested abortion ban could be struck down. [ Politico: Liberals Take Over Wisconsin Supreme Court \u2014 With Major Implications For Abortion ](https://www.politico.com/wisconsin-supreme-court-election) Liberals flipped the ideological makeup of Wisconsin's Supreme Court on Tuesday. Janet Protasiewicz's win in a high-stakes race for an open court seat means the new 4-3 majority is much more likely to strike down a controversial 19th century abortion ban there. Protasiewicz, a liberal judge from Milwaukee County, won her race, 56.9% to 43.1%, when the Associated Press called the race at 9:53 pm. She defeated conservative former state Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly. The court is technically nonpartisan, but now has a 4-3 liberal majority through at least 2025.

Republican lawmakers tried to add exceptions in 2022, but Democratic Gov. Tony Evers made clear he would veto any measure that upheld the overall ban. With a divided state government that puts the issue in the Wisconsin Supreme Court's hands. A ruling will likely be issued around a lawsuit brought by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul to block the law later this year. (Bailey, 4/4) How the fall of Roe v.

Judge Protasiewicz, 60, shattered long-held notions of how judicial candidates should conduct themselves by making her political priorities central to her campaign. She made explicit her support for abortion rights and called the maps, which gave Republicans near-supermajority control of the Legislature, \"rigged\" and \"unfair.\" (Epstein, 4/4) [ The New York Times: This Wisconsin Court Race Is Highly Partisan.

Jay Inslee, a Democrat, says that the state has bought 30,000 doses \u2014 an estimated 3-year supply \u2014 of the key abortion drug in anticipation that access could be limited due to court challenges.

Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, says he ordered the Washington Department of Corrections to use its pharmacy license to buy 30,000 doses of mifepristone, an estimated three-year supply for patients in Washington state. The pills were received on March 31.

The legislation faces an uncertain fate in a legal and political climate that's made Kansas an outlier on abortion policy among states with GOP-led legislatures. The bill applies not only to \"botched\" or \"unsuccessful\" abortions but also when doctors induce labor to deliver a fetus that is expected to die within minutes or even seconds outside the womb, which often occurs because of a severe medical issue. (Hanna, 4/4) [ The Texas Tribune: Texas Senate OKs Bill To Crack Down On Prosecutors Avoiding Abortion Laws ](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/04/04/texas-senate-district-attorneys-legislature/) A bill intended to rein in district attorneys who decline to pursue certain cases preliminarily passed in the Senate on Tuesday. The bill, a priority for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, is part of a larger effort to limit the power of elected prosecutors, especially in Texas' largest, left-leaning counties. Some district and county attorneys in Texas have said they will not prosecute people accused of violating the state's near-total abortion bans. There's also conflict over whether prosecutors will pursue allegations of election fraud, as well as cases involving first-time drug offenders or low-level theft. (Klibanoff, 4/4) From Maine and Indiana \u2014 [ AP: Maine Lawmakers To Consider Bills To Expand Abortion Access ](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-maine-state-house-4082b6cfa7b59ad26d26150f8ea6d9ea) Maine lawmakers are preparing to take up several proposals in the coming weeks to expand abortion access, including one by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills to allow women in Maine to get abortions later in pregnancy if deemed necessary by a medical provider. Current state law bans abortions after a fetus becomes viable outside the womb, at roughly 24 weeks. The governor's bill would allow later abortions with a doctor's approval.

The drugmaker on Tuesday said it's offering $8.9 billion over 25 years to resolve all lawsuits claiming that the company's talc-containing baby powders caused cancer. The deal proposal comes after years of litigation and a high profile, $2 billion verdict which J&J unsuccessfully appealed all the way to the Supreme Court. This settlement proposal could end what would otherwise take decades of legal proceedings, J&J's vice president of litigation, Erik Haas, said in a statement Tuesday. It would also compensate the claimants \"in a timely manner\" while allowing J&J to focus on its business, Haas added.

The company said the settlement is intended to \"resolve all the current and future talc claims.\" But for the settlement to come to fruition, the bankruptcy filing must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey.

The colossal demand for these drugs has spurred a competition in the pharmaceutical industry to develop even more potent and powerful medications. The first of them could become available as soon as this summer. For all its hype, semaglutide is the stepping stone and not the final destination of a new class of obesity drugs.
