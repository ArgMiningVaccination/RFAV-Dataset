Here's what people have to say about Saumya Ayurveda. \"Saumya Ayurveda has helped me to become reborn. With Veena's help, I have become more than ADHD. What I experienced with Veena allowed me not only a general understanding of health but sparked a lifelong journey to use my knowledge to advance the acceptance of Ayurveda as a needed modality of health. This is a feat, considering I had difficulty focusing and suffered with digestive issues, and now I am in medical school. Veena is a skilled healer with a solution to fit all.\" \"I was inflamed. I had trouble keeping weight on, I was diagnosed with incurable ulcerative proctitus, my energy was very low, and I was taking medications daily for a skin condition, and I had severe migraines. Following Veena's guidance, all these conditions have been nearly eliminated! The incurable ulcerative proctitus was recently given a Mayo Clinic Score of 0, normal or inactive disease. I'm very grateful to Veena for the wonderful results and the healthier quality of life we have attained together. Without reservation, I highly recommend Veena at Saumya Ayurveda.\" \"I sought support from Veena related to irregular menstruation, skin issues, and overall stagnation. After a comprehensive assessment, Veena provided an intuitive yet simple plan that included recommendations for gentle changes to diet, daily routine, and a few herbal remedies. The changes were profound. I had not had my period for six months and after four weeks of following Veena's suggestions, my period returned and has been regular since. Veena's approach works with available resources to make sure that change happens on a deeper level than medication can reach. I am so grateful for her help and would recommend her services!\" Meet Veena You are innately equipped with all you need to restore balance in your life, but you don't need to do it alone.
