Spring has already sprung for many of us and will soon be in the air for everyone. This season is always a time for hope and new beginnings, and this year, perhaps more than ever, we look forward to both. This issue's theme is \"Leadership and Mentorship,\" which is timed perfectly as we continue to lead through this pandemic and beyond. This topic is pertinent not only as we work in our own organizations to prevent healthcare-associated infections, but as we fulfill our mission to \"create a safer world without infection,\" as well. Each one of us who has experience as an infection preventionist (IP) understands the critical importance of leadership skills to succeed in this field. Our role is most often one of an influencer rather than an enforcer and it is our ability to influence that spreads passion for our work. True leadership is never about a title or a designation. Authority is not a prerequisite to lead, but the ability to inspire and build consensus is imperative to be a true leader. According to Kouzes and Posner in the book The Leadership Challenge, leaders influence and inspire others most often through the ability to connect emotionally. They explain that this connection is achieved through honesty, and by being authentic and humble. People will only be willing to follow a leader if they trust and respect that person. One of my favorite sayings when it comes to leading others is \"People don't care how much you know, until they know how much you care.\" With that in mind, it's important to avoid getting caught up in the trap of just collecting and sharing data and information that others don't have access to. Instead, we should spend at least as much time building relationships and edifying those we want to lead. Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu's said it powerfully: \"When the best leader's work is done, the people say, 'We did it ourselves.'\" An effective leader is also a mentor and the need for mentorship becomes more critical with each year, as a generation of IPs prepare to retire. Succession planning should be part of every infection prevention program so that our work can continue without interruption. Jack Welch, the famous General Electric CEO, summed it up well: \"Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others.\" I'll leave you with these famous words from Gandhi: \"A sign of a good leader is not how many followers you have, but how many leaders you create.\" Not only am I confident that we will continue to demonstrate great leadership as we carry on with our mission and vision, but I am equally sure that we will be creating great leaders along the way.

PUBLISHED MARCH 2021 VOLUME 14, ISSUE 1PreventionCEO'S MESSAGE AS WE CONTEMPLATE the theme of leadership and mentoring in this month's issue of Prevention Strategist , I want to introduce a term that I use quite often here at APIC, which is \"wagging the dog.\" According to Dict ionary.co m, the term originates from an 1872 newspaper, The Daily Republican , and comes from the longer form of the expression, \"the tail to wag the dog.\" This expression means that a small or unimportant entity (such as the tail) controls a bigger or more important one (such as the body). There is a tendency to look at leadership as a top-down monolithic entity that is reserved for specific individuals who hold specific roles (e.g., CEO). While leadership can and does happen in this way, research shows that the way organizations get things done is much more complicated, diffused, and networked. In our world of infection prevention, wagging the dog means that every IP, no matter what designation you have at your organization, is a leader. As a new IP, you can achieve this leadership through the relationships that you establish. These relationships allow you to create a network whereby you can build trust and influence those around you (i.e., managing sideways), and also by leveraging that same relationship building with your supervi - sor to manage upwards. For established leaders, leadership is progressive and builds on the same skills described above but extends into areas such as strategy, team development, and managing complex change. However, no matter where you sit in an organization, \"wagging the dog\" works. As a new IP or an established leader, you have an opportunity to build trust and leverage your knowledge and expertise to make a difference. Simply put, our voices are powerful within our organizations. \"Wagging the dog\" also applies to APIC as your professional home. This means positioning our organization to ensure that we are driving national and state policy and producing guidance that influences implementation approaches nationwide. APIC allows us to elevate our collective voices, so that we can indeed \"wag the dog\" on a national level and serve as a force for change and progress in infection prevention and control. Devin Jopp, EdD, MS APIC CEO 8 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention PROT ovedEVERY ANGE ES A EXCELLENCE WHEN THE WORLD came to a halt in 2020, infection preventionists (IPs) operated around-the-clock to fight the pandemic. I would like to express my appreciation to the infection prevention and control community for your tireless efforts to keep the public and your colleagues safe during these trying times. With the announcement and initial administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, a sense of hope is on the horizon. My gratitude goes out to past President Linda Goss, the CBIC Board of Directors, and CBIC staff for remaining available and focused on promoting infection prevention competency throughout the year. We launched and promoted several new initiatives, including recertification by Infection Prevention Units (IPUs) and the Associate - Infection Prevention and Control (a-IPC) entry-level examination in 2020. New opportunities in 2021 Many CICs submitted their portfolios, along with questions, insights, and support for the new IPU recertification pathway. CBIC has implemented this feedback into a revised 2021 IPU manual1 for those individuals due to recertify in 2021. We have adjusted the categories to reflect the new changes and added examples of acceptable activities for each category. We recognize that passing the CIC\u00ae examination is a professional milestone and showing off your credential is about to get easier. CBIC is thrilled to announce that digital badging through Credly is coming in 2021. Digital badging will allow CICs to promote themselves and their cer - tifications through social media, email, PDF, and print. When your digital badge is displayed on professional social media sites, potential employers will be able to view and verify your credential. On the horizon 2020 put the spotlight on infection prevention and control and accomplishing the goal of health - care without infection through verifiable competency continues to be critically important. If you lost a colleague, friend, or family member to COVID-19, please accept our heartfelt condolences. If you held window visits for family members, taught personnel how to don and doff N95s, if you worked late at night to acquire needed PPE, or any of the other thousands of needed tasks, we thank you. Your resilience and commitment to save lives is demonstrated in your competent performance. The CBIC Board and staff applaud your service and recognize your strength. I hope that we move into 2021 with a sense of optimism for the future. Our community is needed more than ever before and our commitment to infection prevention will continue to give us strength as we work towards the CBIC mission to provide pathways to assess and maintain infection prevention competency in all healthcare settings.

ABOUT APIC'S NEW MICROLEARNING AV E YOU HEARD !BRIEFS 14 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PATH TO IPC CAREERS APIC recently announced its intent to develop an infection prevention and control curriculum for colleges and universities. Through IP Academic Pathway , APIC plans to create an intentional track toward infection prevention certification and degree pro - grams. APIC will be soliciting input from both the infection prevention and higher education communities and seeking university partners that are willing to help design and pilot the new program. An APIC task force will develop the core concepts of the curricu - lum. For more information, go to https://apic.org/ip-academic-pathway/ . Want to get involved? Email universitypartners@apic.org . APIC ENDORSES ULTRASOUND REPROCESSING STATEMENT The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine has led a team of several professional societies to take a firm stance on an emerging controversy regarding the cleaning and disinfection of ultrasound equipment. There has been recent debate about the level of risk ultrasound probes used specifically for percutaneous procedures or for monitoring other invasive procedures pose to patients. Some organizations have endorsed the requirement of high-level disinfection for these probes, based on their interpretation of the Spaulding Criteria, while others have contended that low-level disinfection is sufficient. Following a critical review of the literature along with weighing the risk/benefit ratio of the level of disinfection, APIC is recommending the latter. APIC and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiologists of America (SHEA), along with colleagues in emergency medicine and vascular access, have taken the position that ultrasound transducers used for procedures such as vascular access, be done safely without requiring high-level disinfection prior to every procedure. The position statement notes sterile ultrasound gel and ultrasound transducer covers are necessary, and that low-level disinfection is adequate. For more information, see the statement here: https://apic.org/wp-content/ uploads/2021/03/2021-AIUM-Intersocietal-Position-Statement.jum_.15653.pdf . RN, NE-BC, CIC, FAPIC, and Bethany Phillips, MT, MPH, CIC, served as subject matter experts for APIC on this effort. APIC CELEBRATES ACHIEVEMENTS OF BLACK AMERICANS On March 26, The Honorable Louis W. Sullivan, MD, will speak with members and staff of APIC about his experiences growing up in rural Georgia, entering Boston University School of Medicine in 1954 as the only Black American in his class, and serving under President George H.W. Bush as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. Sullivan is president emeritus of Morehouse School of Medicine and the second Black American to hold the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services. He will share his thoughts on health disparities, as evidenced by the significant difficulty in reaching minorities with the COVID-19 vaccine and will also share his thoughts on how we can work to accelerate efforts to increase the number of Black Americans serving in critical healthcare positions, like infection prevention and control. ISTOCK.COM/FG TRADE www.apic.org | 15Brigette Tayag Lao, RN, MA, NEA-BC, CIC, has been in the nurs - ing field for 40 years in the areas of acute care, nursing education, and student health. For the past 5 years she has been the infection coordinator and nurse manager of the University of California Irvine, Student Health Center. Previously, she worked as the administrative manager and interim director of Whittier Hospital Medical Center for the Medical Surgical and Telemetry units. She has also worked as a clinical instructor and faculty member of the Azusa Pacific University School of Nursing and the University of the Philippines College of Nursing. She has participated in research studies on hypertension among Filipino Americans and has authored book chapters and articles. She has a Bachelor's of Science and Master's of Arts in Nursing from the University of the Philippines College of Nursing. She is a member of APIC's Communications Committee. What inspired you to become an infection preventionist? When I started working at a student health center, I found that there were many infection control practices and pro - cesses that needed to change. I worked with a responsive and receptive leadership who assisted in formalizing my training and certification. What were some of your challenges when you first entered the field? The slow process of change was the first challenge. One time, my team identified areas to install hand sanitizers at measured IP PROFILE A conversation with Brigette Tayag Lao, RN, MA, NEA-BC, CIC distances inside and outside the examina - tion rooms. We needed the approval of the fire marshal, facilities, budget, and others and this took a long time. I also encountered a small pocket of resistance from a segment of the health team who were used to the \" we do it this way\" train of thought regarding the use of exam rooms after caring for a patient with scabies, but, after repeatedly explaining the science of contact isolation, that went away in time. What has helped you most as you have progressed in your role as an IP? We use the CDC guidelines but the most important pieces came through my APIC membership, training, and gaining access to all the resources and journals. Initially, I was helped by a fel - low IP, Kim Boynton-Delahanty, in my quest to develop an annual infection prevention plan. She helped me take the baby steps. How has your background helped you in the IPC profession? Having long-term experience in the academe and acute care cemented my practice as IP in a student health setting, along with being a member of the SHC leadership team. Why is obtaining (or maintaining) the CIC credential important to you? My APIC training for credentialing made me confident to move forward and work with leadership teams. The certifica - tion cemented the credibility for the role.What is the best advice you ever received? If change is going to be attained, you have to put everything in writing (poli - cies, procedures, and guidelines), create the structure, and better yet, be part of the structure. Most importantly, work with various departments and teams and get the leadership to embrace the plan. What advice do you have for others who are new to the field or considering the field of infection prevention and control? Know the science and be ready to share it with others meaningfully. Repeat it in different ways until everyone hears it. Your hard work will pay off. When we created a video for COVID -19 Asymptomatic Testing for our students, I made sure that handwashing was featured prominently side by side with the specimen collection. In creating the set up for our various test - ing centers, hand hygiene opportunities were made available at every step. And when I went for my COVID-19 testing, I felt pride in the way that at every step, hand hygiene was integrated and had become a mandatory practice. \"The most important pieces came through my APIC membership, training, and gaining access to all the resources and journals.\" Choose your learning option apic.org/intensiveNAVIGATE INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL TO BETTER SERVE YOUR FACILITY Located at the convenience of your ngertips, in two dynamic formats, APIC's signature EPI\u00ae Education provides comprehensive training and competency-building in infection prevention and control (IPC).

Usually, this agenda is based on the political platform of the party in power. However, just like in 2020, the top pri - ority of 2021 is to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Never before have we seen a change in our government during a global pandemic, one that has been rag - ing for a year, infecting over 112 million people, and killing over 2 million glob - ally and more than 500,000 people in the United States (according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering COVID-19 Dashboard, February 23, 2021). The good news is that both parties are in agreement that COVID-19 is the top priority. Over the course of the current pub - lic health emergency, we have learned many hard lessons about responding to pandemics, some of which we could have anticipated, and some of which were anticipated but were difficult to execute. The APIC Government Affairs team will continue working with all relevant branches of our government to ensure that we can stop this pandemic and are prepared for the next emergency. The role of government Pandemic planning requires a coordi - nated effort at every level of government\u2014 local, state, regional, tribal, federal, and territorial. It also requires coordination and planning at every level of healthcare\u2014 public health; healthcare facilities, systems, providers; first responders; patients; care - givers; insurers; and medical equipment manufacturers and distributors. Lessons learned during the 2009-2010 H1N1 pan - demic and the 2014-2015 Ebola pandemic spurred the U.S. into action to prepare for the next pandemic. In 2010, the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health CAPITOL COMMENTS BY LISA TOMLINSON, NANCY HAILPERN, RICHARD CAPPARELL, AND ABIGAIL RICHARDS Administration (OSHA) began work on developing an Infectious Diseases Standard. Meanwhile, agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services\u2014including, CDC, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR)\u2014worked to develop an Emergency Preparedness Rule. Congress did its part by providing funding through the Pandemic and All- Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA), which was enacted to \"improve the Nation's public health and medical preparedness and response capabilities for emergencies, whether deliberate, accidental, or natural.\" In 2017, President Trump issued a series of Executive Orders to advance one of his Administration's top pri - orities of reducing regulatory burden. These Executive Orders directed fed - eral agencies to identify regulations to repeal or cease to enforce. Among halted regulations were the OSHA Infectious Diseases Standard; updates to the CMS Conditions of Participation for hospitals, critical access hospitals, and long-term care facilities requir - ing IP management of infection prevention and control programs; and the Emergency Preparedness rule requirements for annual training and testing of emergency preparedness pro - grams in all healthcare facilities. Next steps: Soon after taking office, the Biden Administration released the National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness (see Sidebar). Upon being appointed as the new CDC Director, Rochelle Walensky, MD, said that she will lead with facts, science, and integrity in order to restore public trust in the agency. CDC continues to update its guidance daily as new data become available. As COVID-19 continued to spread, the FDA issued emergency use autho - rizations (EUAs) for numerous PPE, testing, treatment, and prevention products. The agency continues to monitor all such authorized products, and updates EUAs as needed. OSHA has resumed work on its Infectious Diseases Standard. APIC participated in a listening session to keep the agency informed about issues of concern to stakeholders. APIC continues to work with all agen - cies that have a role in COVID-19 relief New administration, same pandemic J MAIN/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM 18 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention to ensure that infection prevention and control strategies are included in all mit - igation processes; that healthcare per - sonnel are protected; and that IPs have a seat at the decision-making tables. Congress and the Administration are expected to pass another COVID-19 Relief package that will include public health funding, unemployment relief, and direct payments. APIC continues to monitor state legisla - tion related to infection prevention and control issues. In 2021 so far, legisla - tion in many states has been focused on vaccination policies and long-term care (LTC) facilities. Long-term care Over the course of the pandemic, LTC facilities have been exponentially harder hit than other healthcare settings. While only about 5 percent of the COVID-19 cases in the U.S. have occurred in LTC facilities, this setting accounts for about 34 percent of COVID-19 fatalities. In 2017, major revisions to the Medicare Long-Term Care Requirements were final - ized that required each facility to have an infection prevention and control program under the management of an IP working at the facility at least part time. Before the COVID-19 public health emergency was declared, CMS had proposed reducing the staffing requirement from the minimum part-time requirement to \"sufficient time at the facility to meet the objectives of its infection prevention and control plan.\" This proposal was never finalized, but infection prevention and control program and staffing requirements were not imple - mented at the facility level. Nursing homes have, on average, about one third of a full- time equivalent staff assigned to infection prevention and control; very often this task is considered \"other duties as assigned,\" and frequently the staff person assigned to this task has little or no experience or training in infection prevention and con - trol. In fact, less than 10 percent of IPs in nursing homes are certified. This shortfall became apparent early in the pandemic. The infection prevention and control deficiency in LTC did not begin with the COVID-19 pandemic. A May 2020 report by the U.S. Government Accountability One of President Biden's first acts after taking the oath of office was to release the National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness . This multifaceted plan provides a roadmap for a coordinated effort by every segment of our country, from indi - viduals to the federal government, to address every aspect of the pandemic\u2014from safely reopening schools to restoring U.S. leadership in global health. The strategy is organized around seven goals, each of which include a number of key actions to accomplish them. A newly appointed COVID-19 Response Office within the White House is responsible for coordinating execu - tion of the pandemic response across all fed - eral departments and agencies, as well as state, local, territorial, and tribal governments; healthcare providers; businesses; manufactur - ers critical to the supply chain; communities of color; and unions. Here is a summary of the National Strategy: Goal #1. Restore trust with the American people. Key actions: Establish a national COVID-19 response structure where decision making is driven by science and equity. Conduct regular expert-led, science- based public briefings. Publicly share data around key response indicators. Engage the American people. Lead science-first public health campaigns Goal #2. Mount a safe, effective, and comprehensive vaccination campaign. Key actions: Ensure the availability of safe, effective vaccines for the American public. Accelerate getting shots into arms and get vaccines to the communities that need them most. Create as many venues as needed for vaccine administration. Focus on hard-to-reach and high-risk populations.NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR COVID-19 RESPONSE AND PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS, JANUARY 2021 Fairly compensate providers and states and local governments for the cost of administering vaccinations. Drive equity throughout the vaccina - tion campaign and broader pandemic response. Launch a national vaccinations public education campaign. Bolster data systems and transparency for vaccinations. Monitor vaccine safety and efficacy. Surge the healthcare workforce to sup - port the vaccination effort. Goal #3. Mitigate spread through expanding masking, testing, data, treatments, healthcare workforce, and clear public health standards. Key actions: Implement masking nationwide by working with governors, mayors, and the American people. Scale and expand testing. Prioritize therapeutics and establish a comprehensive, integrated COVID-19 treat - ment discovery and development program. Develop actionable, evidence-based public health guidance. Expand the U.S. public health workforce and increase clinical care capacity for COVID-19. Improve data to guide the response to COVID-19. Goal #4. Immediately expand emergency relief and exercise the Defense Production Act. Key actions: Increase emergency funding to states and bolster the FEMA response. Fill supply shortfalls by invoking the Defense Production Act. Identify and solve urgent COVID-19 related supply gaps and strengthen the supply chain. Secure the pandemic supply chain and create a manufacturing base in the United States. Improve distribution and expand avail - ability of critical materials.

Five residents required hospitalization, two of whom developed bacteremia. The Department of Public Health was notified on May 28, 2012, of all six cases. Three of the six residents died. A staff member from the same facility also became ill. Based upon your clinical acumen, you suspect this pathogen may be: pneumoniae A probable case with this pathogen was defined in a resi - dent or staff member who received a pneumonia diagnosis by a healthcare provider. A confirmed case met probable case criteria and had this pathogen isolated from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood, cerebral spinal fluid). Two residents developed invasive disease with Streptococcus pneumoniae , also known as the pneumococcus, serotype 3, with indistinguishable antimicrobial resistance patterns. All cases previously received the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPSV23) vaccine. In this case, the assisted-living vaccine protocol was consistent with the current recommendations issued by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The authors1 did not disclose the specific antibiotic therapy prescribed for the medical management of the ill residents. The specific therapeutic agent will vary, depending upon the infection site, e.g., otitis media, pneumonia, sinusitis, Hospital outbreaks are reported more often in the medical literature than occurrences in the long-term care (LTC) or behavioral health setting. By studying and learning from outbreaks in the LTC/behavioral health setting, infection preventionists (IPs) can glean additional knowledge and apply this information to hopefully prevent future infections and infection clusters in their facilities. This quarterly column helps the IP heighten awareness of appropriate interventions to prevent outbreaks. Focus on long-term care and behavioral health outbreaks Identify the pathogen! BY STEVEN J. SCHWEON AND LISA VITALE SVETLANA VERBINSKAYA/SHUTTERSTOCK.COMStreptococcus pneumoniaeIDENTIFY THE PATHOGEN! 20 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention etc. Additionally, there are a variety of types of pneumococcal bacteria that are now resistant to some of the antibiotics used to treat pneumococcal infections.2 Broad-spectrum antibiotics are used for invasive pneumococcal infections until the antibiotic sensitivity testing results are available. For controlling the outbreak, empiric postexposure chemoprophylaxis and the administration of 13-valent pneumo - coccal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) were implemented. Other control measures included written infection control poli - cies, such as work-exclusion policies that advised avoiding contact with residents when healthcare personnel are ill, appro - priate use of personal protective equip - ment, and the recognition of mandatory reporting of disease outbreaks to state public health authorities. The pneumococcus, a gram-positive bacterium, has more than 90 known sero - types,3 which are groups within a single species of micro-organisms that share dis - tinctive surface structures.4 This pathogen is a leading cause of serious illness world - wide,3 and besides pneumonia and bac - teremia, is also a causative organism for meningitis and ear and sinus infections. Adults 65 years of age and older are at increased risk for pneumococcal disease.5 Adults between 19 and 64 years of age are also at increased risk for pneumococcal disease, including those who5: Have chronic illnesses (including chronic obstructive lung disease, emphysema, and asthma; diabetes; or alcoholism). Have conditions that weaken the immune system (HIV/AIDS, cancer, or damaged/absent spleen). Have cochlear implants or cerebrospi - nal fluid leaks (i.e., escape of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord). Smoke cigarettes. The pneumococcus is transmitted from person to person by direct contact with saliva or mucus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recom - mends standard precautions when caring for a patient with pneumococcal pneumo - nia6; droplet precautions are implemented if there is evidence of transmission within a patient care unit or facility. Standard TAKE-HOME MESSAGES 1. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regulation 483.80 (d) (2)8, each long-term care facility must develop protocols for pneumococcal disease. The regulation specifies each resident is informed about the benefits and risks of the vaccination and has the opportunity to receive the pneumococcal vaccine unless medically contraindicated, already vaccinated, or refused. The regulation attempts to minimize the resident's risk to acquire, transmit, or suffer complications. Policies and procedures must include education on the risk and benefits of the immunization including side effects. Strict adherence to documentation is expected. 2. Assisted-living facility regulations may vary from state to state; consider performing a gap analysis to ensure current practices are adherent with regulatory bodies. 3. CDC recommends9 two pneumococcal vaccines for adults, the PPSV23 and PCV13. Both vaccines target multiple serotypes including serotype 3, which causes invasive disease. a. Evidence indicates PPSV23 and PCV13 also reduce antibiotic resistance by blocking the transmission of resistant Streptococcal pneumoniae strains.10 b. Persons who received a dose of PPSV23 before age 65 should receive another dose of the vaccine at age 65 or later if at least 5 years have elapsed since their previous dose.9 c. In some cases, the PCV13 vaccination could be considered for adults 65 years or older. PCV13 and PPSV23 should not be administered on the same visit.11 PCV13 must be administered intramuscularly and the preferred injection site is the deltoid muscle. PPSV23 can be administered either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. d. The annual influenza vaccination can be administered with either pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13 or PPSV23) during the same visit. Each vaccine is administered in a separate syringe at a different injection site.12 e. Annually educate and review with residents or their family members who initially declined pneumococcal vaccination if there's a renewed interest in receiving the vaccine. f. Have a written policy to assess risk for pneumococcal disease and provide screening to residents on admission, in addition to a standing orders program. 4. Nearly anyone can get pneumococcal disease, especially adults 65 years or older, cigarette smokers, and people with certain medical conditions. Educating all residents of the risks and benefits of the vaccination and distributing the most current federal Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) can contribute to informed decisions and positive resident outcomes as vaccine administration can greatly reduce the morbidity and mortality from pneumococcal disease. The Immunization Action Coalition ( www.immunize.org ) is a credible resource for VIS and additional educational materials. 5. Discouraging presenteeism in healthcare is not only challenging but also expensive. Challener et al13 indicate multiple examples of healthcare providers who worked while ill resulted in infectious patients. To prevent transmission, it is critical for healthcare organizations to support absences when there is exposure or illness. One example of a proactive approach to presenteesim is the development of policies and procedures that do not penalize with loss of wages, benefits, or job status. 6. Ensure which diseases are reportable to the public health department and the reporting mechanism within your facility. 7. CDC's \"Pink Book\" ( https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/index.html ) is another comprehensive resource with vaccine preventable disease information. 8. When meningitis is initially suspected, place a surgical mask on the patient and initiate droplet precautions until a confirmed diagnosis is made. 9. Promptly discuss with your administration and the department of health whenever an infec - tion cluster should develop within your facility. 10. Have supplies necessary for adherence to proper PPE use (e.g., gloves, gowns, masks) readily accessible, which can be challenging during a pandemic with the inherent PPE global shortages. 11. Have a written plan for an outbreak response that includes a definition, procedures for surveillance and containment, and a list of syndromes or pathogens for which monitoring is performed. Include a current list of diseases reportable to public health authorities. www.apic.org | 21precautions are used when caring for a patient with Streptococcal pneumoniae meningitis.

Glove/Sleeve Boot FlexThe \"Next THE PATHOGEN! 22 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention Making it on your own BY KATHERINE TRAIL Beginning work as an infection preventionist is overwhelming but beginning work as an infec - tion preventionist on your own is extremely overwhelming. Or at least that is how I felt 4 and a half years ago. I had no previous experience in infection prevention except when I worked as a bedside nurse and did the hand hygiene audits for our unit, so everything was new to me. The best thing I did was become a member of APIC and find a local chapter. Attending the monthly meetings and connecting with the other members resulted in me acquiring an amazing mentor that guided me through the IP basics. I also attended the APIC EPI Intensive training that was very helpful, but again, a little overwhelming. Using the APIC roadmap helped me set and achieve my professional goals.The challenges, rewards, and art of acting alone Inside the facility, I learned to rely on the knowledge of the subject matter experts such as engineering, environmental ser - vices, and microbiology. Building strong relationships with the department leaders and administration was imperative, as was collaborating with the staff in my build - ing. For example, I try to do an OR Day each month where I scrub in to observe surgeries and processes. I also round on the units several times a week to get to know the nursing staff, answer any questions, and review central lines and indwelling urinary catheters. I am fortunate that I have an amazing leadership team that is very supportive of the infection prevention program, and I feel like an integral part of the organization. There are many definitions of what a lone IP is, but my definition is sim - ply being the only IP in a facility. When you are solely responsible for surveillance, rounding, and reporting, then you are a \"lone IP,\" even if your facility is part of a system. I am the only IP for a small urban hospital with 130 staffed beds that includes two ICUs. While I might be Lone IPs: MIX AND MATCH STUDIO/SHUTTERSTOCK.COMLEADERSHIP & MENTORSHIP www.apic.org | 23I was not always a lone infection preventionist (IP). I work at a multi-hospital system that had multiple IPs at every campus. At my campus there were two IPs before the COVID-19 pandemic began. Then with transfers, and organizational changes within the system infection prevention department, I was the only IP at my campus by May 2020. Yes, I still had system resources, but like all other areas of the health system, infection prevention was stretched incredibly thin at every campus.the only IP, I think that it is important to make everyone feel an integral part of the infection prevention team, espe - cially the departments outside of nursing. Celebrating the environmental services, laundry, engineering, and sterile process - ing staffs are so important. What they do is essential to infection prevention, but they are seldom recognized. Prioritization is one of the most impor - tant skills a person can have when work - ing as a lone IP. I start each day with a \"to do\" list that never quite gets finished, some days I never mark a thing off. There are constant interruptions during the day. The easy interruptions are simple ques - tions, but others can require hours of \"These are the times that it would be nice to have an IP team.\" \"Being a lone IP means that there is no one else to share the load of any decision or process change that is made.\"'Alone but not lonely' BY JAY LIGGINStime. Data is time sensitive and report - ing deadlines are not negotiable, so often that must be a top priority. One of the most difficult things to do as a lone IP is to roll out new initiatives, espe - cially if they are facility wide. It requires a great deal of scheduling adjustments and relying heavily on educators and nurse managers to ensure that all shifts/staff are educated. New product implementation is usually easier because the vendors assist with the education and I only need to reinforce the education. These are the times that it would be nice to have an IP team. Working as a lone IP can be challeng - ing, but it is also rewarding. There is no greater feeling than when you see hand hygiene compliance improve by 30 per - cent and know that you were instrumen - tal in making that happen! Would it be nice to have a team of IPs, or even just one more? Of course, but I am grateful for the opportunity to be an IP and make a difference. Katherine Trail, BSEd, BSN, RN, CIC, is Manager, Infection Control & Prevention, at Mary and Elizabeth Hospital and Peace Hospital, in Louisville, KY. A lone IP is not just the obvious definition of being the sole IP at your hospital. A lone IP means that you are the resource every person turns to for guidance regarding communicable disease prevention at both the hospital and ambulatory clinics. Being a lone IP means that there is no one else to share the load of any decision or process change that is made. Being a lone IP means that despite the support you have from a sys - tem infection prevention department/ director (if you have one), any successes and any short comings are yours to bear. Being a lone IP can be terrifying when in uncharted territory, such as a pandemic with a novel virus. That weekend in March when the pandemic really broke out in Michigan, I received a page every 30 minutes. Those late night pages at 2 am were tough. We had practiced what to do should we get a COVID-19 patient. We had no idea how many of these patients we were going to receive in the ED in such a short time. Sure, there was guidance from the State Health Department and the CDC that I was following, but there is no one to share the burden or bounce thoughts off at 2 in the morning. In those times, you remember your training and go into every scenario with the mindset of \"how can I keep the patients, our staff, and any visitors safe.\" The best career advice I was ever given was to just talk to people. Thankfully, I am a people person. I love to talk to people, see how their day is going, ask them about weekday/weekend plans, etc. I do my best to try and get across the message that I am here to help them feel safe. I have been an IP for 3 years. If staff members become comfortable with your presence, they will be more open to sharing safety concerns with you. I make sure that I am out on the units every day to see how the staff is doing and how I can help them with any concerns they have. The best advice I can give to other lone IPs is to work with an \"ask me anything\" mindset. Come across as a resource and helping hand to all your hospital's staff, patients, and visitors. Build relationships with everyone. If you continue to have that mindset and build strong relation - ships, then you can turn \"lone IP\" into \"alone but not lonely.\" There is so much experience on your hospital's staff among the different medical disciplines and ancillary departments. You just have to tap into it! Jay Liggins, MS, is an infection preventionist at Beaumont Hospital Wayne in Wayne, Michigan. LEADERSHIP & MENTORSHIP 24 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention Luckily, being a member of APIC means \"never really being alone,\" since each time I go to www.apic.org I'm access - ing the brain trust of more than 15,000 professionals like myself, across the globe, supported by a strong headquarter staff. Aside from that, I consider the lone IP as a person without trained IP peers in the same building. Even if part of a larger network, working solo helps you develop an entire new set of skills. I like the way it forces me out of my comfort zone on a routine basis, especially since I wear more than one hat. Being the director of the program, I am my own administrative assistant, data abstractor, analyst, etc. The various roles force you to constantly learn and fine-tune time prioritization and the \"art of saying no.\" Certain skillset Having more than 5 years' experience as a lone IP is one strength I find that helps the most in my day-to-day routine. There are many things you just cannot study or teach a test, such as being strong at facilita - tion and leadership (seed planting for good outcomes), along with knowing your own Many hats, one head BY PATRICIA GRANT I first became a \"lone\" infection preventionist (IP) when I needed to be closer to home. My husband worked evenings and our daughter was in elementary school at the time. I know my manager would never deny me needing to attend a school function yet felt odd asking when I was one of many on the IPC team. So I took a job closer to home in a much smaller facility\u2014I enjoyed the rush of needing to act alone and quickly. \"Even if part of a larger network, working solo helps you develop an entire new set of skills. \"content. The caveats around delegation are critical strengths to develop and the rela - tionships you build while working through the delegation process; when you work alone you get good at knowing how and when to use resources (besides yourself!). Another important skill that comes in handy when working with other healthcare workers is that I do not have a problem saying \"I don't know about what YOU specifically do. We will match your content expertise with mine and solve the situation together toward better outcomes.\" If the references frequently fail, and a brick wall is in place, I ask them to provide their peer-reviewed literature, or code, or guidance, that \"makes it so.\" Working alone One specific time that would have been nice to have been part of a team was when I sent that 01/24/20 All Staff email broadcast about what we now call COVID-19\u2014there were many days (daze?!) working with a team would have been a gift. Having to be the sole person responsible for keeping current, setting up systems based on that information, with the frequent changing of \"gold standard\" made it hard to keep up with routine sur - veillance and relationship building. But, whether you work alone or as a member of a large IP team, make sure you network, volunteer within APIC, and give back to the profession. If it were not for the mentors that blessed me with their knowledge and patience, I never would have stayed the course.

Connecting APIC benefits to IPC problems With all these resources and flexibility, APIC's suite of member benefits can be overwhelming, especially for those new to the organization. To ease the process, it can be helpful to group the benefits under broad topics. For example, membership Individuals join an association because they have a challenge, and they think the organization can help them solve it. What does this mean for APIC? When someone becomes a member, they need to be able to easily and effectively apply their new suite of APIC resources, products, and programs to their challenge. And, because we want the IP to be a member for life, APIC must ensure your mem - bership addresses today's challenges as well as tomorrow's. \"APIC connects me to a vast network of experts when I have questions or need guidance.

Yet many of the new COVID-19- related activities, tasks, and experiences in which infection preventionists (IPs) are involved are helping to build new skillsets and aiding in professional development. The APIC Competency Model for the Infection Preventionist provides structure for professional development, and many other tools are available to help IPs advance through the compe - tency model and develop profession - ally throughout their careers. APIC's Professional Development Committee (PDC) outlines below the quick and easy-to-use tools available to IPs as they navigate professional develop - ment and document newfound skills and growth experiences. Updated tools The Future is Here: Applying APIC's Updated Competency Model to Guide IPC Practice. A short, members-only presentation by the 2020-2021 PDC Chair and Vice Chair that focuses on understanding, using, and applying the interactive APIC Competency Model in real-life situations.

Reaching out through your local chapter or through APIC's online communities (and APIC will be launching an official mentorship program later this year) to locate a mentor is an excellent way to receive support as you are learning the role. Infection prevention responsibility is vast, and the knowledge that is required takes time to develop. Understand that it will take time to develop skills that will make you a valuable resource to your team. A mentor can lead you to find helpful resources and guidance documents that are paramount to our practice. Dealing with stress and burnout Keep the goal of preventing infections a priority. What is the highest risk to the population you are serving? What steps can you take, with your team, to address these risks? Keep in mind that it is impossible to address all risks at one time! Having a prior - ity rating for the risks specific to your area helps you focus your energies. If a project or request does not fall within the priority list, place it on the list of things to do if time allows. Be open with leadership about what risks are highest and why. Explain their request is heard but will be attended to later. How APIC can help Did you know there are many resources available to you as an APIC member? Here are some of them (read more about Struggling? BY DEANN RICHARDS, BRENDA NAYLOR, AND SHERRY ACOSTA navigating APIC's many member benefits on pages 26-27). Support linked to various online communi - ties to join and obtain support from fellow infection preventionists. Some of the com - munities include ambulatory care, behav - ioral health, chapter leaders, consulting focus group, corporate/system level director, criti - cal access, EMS and public safety, minority health, oncology, pediatrics, public health, VA, and the broadest group\u2014IP Talk. E ducation provided through live and on-demand webinars, podcasts, confer and practice include: APIC Text (at https://text.apic.org/ for an additional fee), implementation guides, quick obser - vation tools, scientific guidelines, and cost calculators. What skills make the best IP? According to a Becker's Healthcare 2012 article, \"Five Must-Have Qualities of a 5-Star Infection Preventionist,\" the quali - ties needed build over time and most are obtained in the first 2 to 3 years of practice. 1. O btains certification in infection control. CBIC (Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc) cur - rently provides two levels of certification. Instituted in 2020, an associate-level cer- tificate for novice IP became available and is valid for 3 years. This level is for those starting in the field and promotes personal growth. The primary certification level, CIC(C), is valid for 5 years.2. D evelops leadership qualities. A good leader's characteristics include integ - rity, delegation, communication skills, empathy, courage, and respect. All of these assist the IP in their success. 3. D evelops a strong network of peers working in infection prevention. Net - working with other IPs both in your local area and around the world is sup - port for practice and wellbeing during times of increased workload and stress, as we have endured with the pandemic. APIC chapters offer support that can be extremely helpful as state and regional requirement challenges are faced and poten t ial solutions shared with all members. Some chapters have men - tors and study groups for certification. If you do not currently belong to a local chapter, contact membership@apic.org for assistance to join. 4. A cts on curiosity. A sense of wonder and wanting to learn are essential to infection prevention. Seeking out resources from a variety of research and guidelines to answer questions happens frequently. Knowing where to find the sources is vital to success in the role of infection prevention. 5. I s a patient advocate. Preventing health - care-associated infections is paramount to the role of infection prevention. While preventing infections in patients is essential, healthcare personnel, visitors, and all those who enter our facilities are our responsibility. Keeping them all safe and free from infection is the goal. Most IPs have struggled at some point during their career. With the pandemic, it has been even more of a challenge. There is much support available for those entering the field and those that need assistance.

For the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed an increased burden and strain on most infection preventionists (IPs). Even those with vast experience are stressed and overwhelmed. Those who are newer to the profession or just joining the ranks may feel entirely overcome and unprepared to deal with the additional stress and responsibilities brought on by the pandemic. The following are some strategies we hope will help new and even experienced IPs survive and thrive in this great profession.LEADERSHIP & MENTORSHIP 30 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention WITH AN EXCLUSIVE PORTFOLIO OF FULLY STERILE SKIN PREP APPLICATOR PRODUCTS.

How have you altered your training to prepare your clients for these and future unexpected challenges? We have taught our clients to \"pandemic proof\" their busi - ness by understanding fortitude is the new attitude, connectiv - ity is the new currency, and customer service has now shifted into customer love. Fortitude is having courage in the midst of adversity, despite the challenges of the pandemic. It's a mindset rooted in being authentic and empathic at the same time. Connectivity is understanding that we are all on the pan - demic ocean, however, many are in different boats and having different experiences. Leaders who find a way to connect to people is essential to them thriving and flourishing. Customer service is a department. Customer love is a mind - set. Leaders understand that during this time listening, caring, sharing, while innovating is critical to team members and organization survival. What can a healthcare professional expect to learn from your courses? What type of skill development would you focus on for today's healthcare professional in a pandemic climate? Adaptive Resilience (AR) is one of the most important skills that healthcare professionals need right now. AR is overcom - ing the unexpected. AR enables healthcare professionals to expand their capacity to lead, learn, let go of what is not working, and be positioned to embrace what wants to emerge. AR equips healthcare professionals with the skills to flourish in a world of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. AR challenges leaders to be adaptable, collaborative, and focus on the power of storytelling to increase trust. Speaking of a pandemic climate, many of our infection preventionists are experiencing burnout, lack hope, and morale is low. What advice do you have to motivate infec - tion preventionists right now? I would encourage infection preventionists to take their MEDS (Meditate, Exercise, Diet, and Sleep.) Remember that hope is your SuperPower. A hopeful pre - ventionist is a helpful one. Hope is a magnet that pulls you forward. Hope allows you to look through the windshield of what is possible instead of the rearview mirror of what happened. One of the best ways to stir up your hope is focus on what is right about you instead of what's wrong. You have experienced great success as a leader and with train - ing future leaders. To what do you contribute your success? This is not a dress rehearsal. Make the most of every moment, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. Lead, live, and love every day in every way. In your opinion, what does leadership need to focus more on in 2021? Leaders in 2021 need to focus on creating a culture where everyone matters, connecting with team members in a deeper way, sparking hope and kindness every day. Simon T.

Keynote Speakers at APIC's 2021 Annual Conference 32 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention Can you share with us some of the successes of IPATH, and why you believe phage therapy is making a comeback? When IPATH was founded in 2018 it became the first dedicated phage therapy center in North America. We have treated 13 patients at UC San Diego and dozens of others internationally in collaboration with our partners. Most have been successful. One of these cases was the first geneti - cally modified phage cocktail to have been success - fully used to treat a patient with a disseminated Mycobacterium abscessus infection, which lends hope that some day phage therapy could be used to treat TB. Over the past few years, other phage therapy centers have popped up too, most recently at the Mayo Clinic and Baylor University. IPATH will also launch the first NIH-funded phage therapy trial later this year. We need efficacious clinical trials before phage therapy can be approved by the FDA for broader use. My colleagues and I are also working hard to fundraise for a phage library, so it is easier to match phage to multi-drug resistant bacterial infections. You have shown great resilience during your research to cure your husband's illness. Do you have any advice for IPs who are currently experiencing feelings of burn out and exhaus - tion due to the pandemic? When my husband Tom was hospitalized for 9 months, I learned how important self-care was, and that it was OK to ask for help. Sometimes that was just asking someone be with him so I could have a breather, or taking a day off going to the hospital. I loved it when people brought Tom's daughters and I a home-made dinner. Sometime it's the little things like that that make us feel supported. I also found it very therapeutic to start journaling as an outlet for stress. That was how our memoir, The Perfect Predator , came to be. Since then writing has become recreational for me; I just finished my first novel. You are currently leading a multidisciplinary team of research on HIV risk behaviors among drug users and sex workers on the Mexico-US border. What is on the horizon with your HIV research? In 2020, I began a new binational project to study cross-border transmission of HIV, HCV, and SARS-CoV-2. It's ironic that with my HIV research, a virus is the enemy, but with IPATH, viruses are our friends. It's given me a whole new appreciation for the invisible world we share with them.Steffanie A.

Task force members have met weekly since February of 2020 to review evolv - ing guidance, discuss practice issues, and identify educational needs among IPs and the public. Their work has encompassed a variety of initiatives including: 2 020 Town Hall Webinars: C OVID-19 transmission routes and aerosol-generating procedures M anaging COVID-19 in long-term care facilities P PE: Extended use during COVID-19 P re-hospital care and interfacility transport C OVID-19 outbreaks: Lessons learned R esearch initiatives: PPE survey, March 2020 : To secure national attention for the dire shortages of PPE and other critical items, this sur - vey designed by the task force found that 20 percent of IP respondents had no respirators; 28 percent were almost out. These results were featured in national news outlets includ - ing CNN and were used to urge Congress and the White House to take immediate action. PPE follow-up survey, December 2020 : This survey revealed the extent to which U.S. healthcare facilities are implement - ing PPE crisis standards of care. Vaccine hesitancy survey, January 2021 : These data showed that IPs have high levels of acceptance for COVID-19 vac - cines and can be role models for other healthcare profes - sionals and the public. AJIC papers: Members of the task force are contributing to the evolving science and have authored several AJIC articles includ - ing: Availability of personal protective equipment and infection prevention supplies during the first month of the COVID-19 pan - demic and Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on hospital acquired infection rates in the United States: Predictions and early results. F ocus groups: To better understand member needs, the task force organized focus groups with various member segments. F act sheets: As education needs were identified, the task force guided the development of fact sheets for IPs and the public, available at: https://apic.org/covid-factsheets/ (see examples on pp. 35-37). 2021 initiatives In 2021, the task force is addressing contact tracing, vac - cine hesitancy, needs of home care and ambulatory care, and developing a white paper to outline the key role of the IP in pandemic planning. The task force is mobilizing quickly to hold webinars in real-time. For example, when the CDC issued guidance in mid-February about double masking for the public, the task force held a webinar 1 week later to answer member questions. They also created a fact sheet for the public (see image on p. 36, \"Should you double mask?\"). For archived webinars, visit https://secure.apic.org/web/apic/EStore/webinars.aspx . The task force wants to hear from you with any ideas on COVID-19 resources that are needed. Send an email to practice@apic.org with your questions and ideas.

Cover up: Make sure your face mask completely covers your nose and mouth and is secured snugly under your chin. Mind the gap: There should be no gaps around the side of your face where your breath can escape. Mold it to your nose: If your mask has a moldable piece running along the top edge, mold it over the bridge of your nose to help contain droplets. Tighten the ear straps: Knot the ear loops of a disposable mask, and tuck in the sides to get a better fit. Good Filtration: Keep small particles from entering or exiting your mask. Wear a mask with layers: If you wear a cloth mask, pick one with two layers of fabric to filter out small particles. Double up: If your mask does not fit snugly or only has one layer of material, consider double masking. This adds another layer of protection and helps your mask fit more snugly and filter better. Healthcare professionals: The CDC recommends medical-grade masks for healthcare professionals. Cloth masks are not considered adequate PPE in healthcare settings. Be sure to follow your facility's guidance. Remember the basics to prevent the spread of COVID-19: Clean your hands frequently. Maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from others when outside the home. Get the COVID-19 vaccine when it's your turn. Should you double mask? What you need to know about CDC's new guidance on masking When worn properly, face masks are an important way to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has new guidance to improve mask performance and provide better protection from COVID-19. Whether you double mask or not, your mask must fit snugly to your face. If it is a cloth mask, it must have at least two layers of fabric to filter out small particles. If your mask does not fit snugly or your mask does not filter well enough, consider double masking. In February 2021, the task force created a fact sheet for consumers to clarify new CDC guidance on masking. www.apic.org | 35High COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Among Infection Preventionists 85% have received the COVID-19 vaccine 2% have an appointment to take it soon 5% say they will get the vaccine at a later time 8% have not received itVaccine Received by IPs ABOUT THE SURVEY: APIC conducted an online survey of its 11,077 U.S.-based infection preventionist members January 20-25, 2021.

(Respondents could choose multiple responses.)Top Reasons IPs Cite for Vaccine Hesitancy Among Other Health WorkersThe COVID-19 vaccine is not safe. The FDA has determined that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective to use. The vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history, and vaccine developers followed all the necessary steps during clinical trials. The messenger RNA (mRNA) technology used to develop the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines allows for faster vaccine development and has been in use for years. The vaccine will alter my DNA. The mRNA in the vaccine does not enter the cell's nucleus, where your DNA is kept. The mRNA will not change your DNA, since the two do not interact. The vaccine will make me sterile/infertile. There is no evidence to suggest that a COVID-19 infection or vaccine could result in sterility or infertility. The vaccine will not be effective against the new strains, so I should just wait. The presence of new strains makes vaccination even more important. When more people are vaccinated, there are fewer chances for deadlier virus mutations to occur. The vaccine will give me COVID-19. mRNA vaccines do not contain a live strain of the virus that causes COVID-19 and, therefore, cannot give you COVID-19. The side effects from the vaccine are worse than getting COVID-19. The vaccines prevent you from getting sick from COVID-19, a disease that has killed many people in the U.S. You may feel achy and uncomfortable after your shot, but these symptoms are temporary and signal that your body is mounting an immune response to the virus. I have already had COVID-19, so I do not need to get vaccinated. It is possible to become re-infected, which is why everyone should be vaccinated against COVID-19 regardless of whether you have previously had it.COVID-19: Get the Facts Straight and Vaccinate As COVID-19 continues to surge across the U.S., everyone who is eligible needs to step up and get vaccinated when it is their turn. It is natural to have questions and concerns, and APIC is here to help. Let's get the facts straight vaccinate! 00821 APIC CovidVaccine Flyer.indd 1 2/11/21 9:01 AMVaccine hesitancy has been one of the biggest hurdles in the distribution process. This is not novel or unique to COVID-19, but the emphasis on protect - ing frontline healthcare workers in the first wave of vaccinations has been par - ticularly hindered by such reticence. Such hesitation is a bit more complicated this time, fueled by not only misinformation/ disinformation through an endless stream on social media, but also politicization of the vaccine and pandemic. So how can we tackle such a challenge? One thing in particular I've learned throughout this is that transparency and empathy are critical. We've learned that if public health leaders were more upfront about things that weren't known, people would've felt more confident in the begin - ning.1 As we have conversations about COVID-19 vaccine facts and myths, it's important to explain that there are indeed areas we're still working to understand, like how long immunity will last and the potential for asymptomatic infection. That being said, there is still a critical need to get vaccinated and to continue using infection prevention efforts, like isolation precautions, PPE, etc. Infection prevention rounding on units and in clinics can be a great opportunity to talk to staff about the vaccine and ultimately to answer questions about BY SASKIA POPESCU The world of infection prevention and public health was shaken in early 2020 when a novel respiratory pathogen triggered a worldwide pandemic. In an effort no less than Herculean, researchers developed three efficacious vaccines that, through review and Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) via the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), were released for distribution late last year. Despite the immense effort it took to develop these vaccines, the distribution process has been rocked by supply chain challenges and the reality of trying to vaccinate the majority of a large population during a pandemic. COVID-19. There are a few myths and topics that have been particularly preva - lent, so here are some strategies for dis - cussing and countering them. Conspiracy theories have run rampant and these include concepts like micro - chips in the vaccines, that DNA is being collected or altered as a result of the shot, vaccines were developed for profit, and that COVID-19 has been exaggerated. It's important that judgment not be placed on those falling into these misinformation traps, so start first with the vaccine does not alter or collect DNA, and it doesn't allow for any kind of tracking. Those are more sci-fi movie plot lines than reality. The COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA vac - cines to help the body build antibodies to fend off the virus if it is exposed later on. Lastly, vaccines are exceedingly expensive and difficult to make, so while pharma - ceutical companies can make money down the road from selling the vaccine, it is a huge gamble to put time and money into developing a vaccine without a guarantee of success.2 Working to develop a vaccine in a pandemic is extremely difficult, but also an effort that is built off the desire to save human lives. Herd immunity is always a goal with vaccine-preventable diseases, but that sim - ply might not be possible with COVID-19. Even as we work towards it, herd immunity requires that everyone who is eligible receives the vaccine. That means it's impor - tant to initially focus on high-risk groups, like essential workers and those at risk for severe disease, but ultimately everyone needs to be vaccinated if they can. As vaccines are being made more available, it's important that if you are able to be vaccinated, you do so. While there has been some discussion about delayed sec - ond doses, to get the full efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, both doses are neces - sary. A recent study revealed that there was roughly 52% vaccine efficacy between the first and second dose, which emphasizes just how important not only the second dose is but also why we continue to wear PPE and utilize infection prevention mea - sures during these doses (and after).3 Health concerns are often voiced by those hesitant to get the vaccine. This isn't unique to COVID-19, but really what this comes down to is fear. While we don't know their personal health history, it's helpful to reiterate that the FDA takes painstak - ing efforts to ensure safety before issuing an EUA. I always encourage people to talk to their personal medical provider to inquire about vaccine contraindications. For those pregnant or breastfeeding, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Society for \"I only need one dose.\" \"The side effects are dangerous.\"\"The vaccine was created too quickly and isn't safe.\"\"I've had COVID so I don't need to get vaccinated.\" TACKLING VACCINE HESITANCYCOVID-19 38 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention \"My DNA will be collected and used in governmental studies.\" \"I'm not eligible because I'm pregnant.\"\"The vaccine will give me COVID.\"\"The coronavirus is exaggerated by the media/ experts.\" TACKLING VACCINE HESITANCY Maternal-Fetal Medicine all recommend vaccines be made available to those who are breastfeeding or pregnant.4 The vaccine does not contain a live virus, so it can't cause infection or a positive test result in the person being immunized. One of those unknowns\u2014immunity\u2014is why it's impor - tant to be vaccinated even if you've already had COVID-19. While we're learning more about long-term immunity, we have a pretty good understanding of immunity right after infection and know that it doesn't last forever. Reinfection can and does hap - pen, so even if someone had COVID-19, they still should get vaccinated. One of the more challenging pieces to navigating a pandemic and novel vaccines is that we have never seen vaccines devel - oped during an emergent situation. Safety concerns around vaccines developed and approved with EUA are fair, but this is also an opportunity to share just how much work goes into vaccine development and safety testing. With such attention and scrutiny, the FDA and the pharmaceutical companies are that much more invested in safety as adverse events would be determi - nantal to vaccine distribution and trust, and also have serious implications for pandemic response. There are rigorous standards for clinical vaccine trials and four phases that they must go through prior to public release to ensure there are not dangerous side effects.5 The FDA and the CDC also closely monitor those who are vaccinated to track problems or side effects. Currently, there is no evidence of long-term side effects from the vaccine, and those side effects, like arm pain and fatigue, are short-lived after receiving the vaccine. Share the CDC's webpage on COVID-19 vaccine safety with people, as this can answer a lot of great questions and encourages transparency.6 While we may not be able to get every - one to realize that these myths are born in misinformation, it's important we try. It's not just a matter of providing accu - rate information, like pointing people to the CDC vaccine website, but also hav - ing conversations about their concerns to ensure there is empathy and patience as we navigate these challenging times. Infection prevention isn't just about ensuring isolation precautions and sur - veillance, but is also about education and science communication with the public and our healthcare partners.

Guidry Linnea I. Laestadius et al. American Journal of Infection Control 49(2);137-142 Published online: November 19, 2020 www.apic.org | 39How will the vaccine community address variations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus? The trouble with addressing the evolution of variants is that we can't predict which variants will evolve next. We can only address the ones we know about. We've only known about SARS-CoV-2 for a year, so we don't know much about the important parts of its genome, and that makes it hard to predict which part of the spike protein will mutate and cause some sort of change (for instance, a functional change will give a new property to the virus, or it will change to better evade the immune system). Mutation in the receptor binding domain will be a problem. We can speculate on what will be important for immunity, but we don't know what will be important to evolution. So, it's difficult for vaccine manufacturers to be one step ahead and anticipate what kind of mutation will accu - mulate in order to pre-emptively create a booster as the virus continues to evolve. How do SARS-CoV-2 and influenza compare? The vaccines are different, as are the viruses (influenza and SARS-CoV-2). The big difference is that the most common vac - cine used for the flu is inactivated, meaning that you are chemi - cally inactivating influenza and giving it to people. Inactivated vaccines are less durable, but for seasonal flu they are okay because you'll be receiving one every year. For SARS-CoV-2, the vaccine should be durable because you are getting a booster for most of them (note that this is not true for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine). However, durability remains to be seen as the expedited vaccine process prevented researchers from getting information on durability. SARS-CoV-2 is widespread, so it continues to evolve and accrue mutations whenever it replicates. The more people it infects, it will have more chances to replicate, and it will acquire more mutations. Right now, SARS-CoV-2 is circulating only in one species. But influenza has multiple variants circulating, H1N1, H2N3, etc., plus a bunch of subtypes that don't infect people. Subtypes circulate in migratory birds, domestic animals, pigs, other living entities. One more key difference: the genome of influenza is in eight different segments, so if you are infected with two different kinds of flu, segments shuffle in a process called reassortment, and you get new viruses that are combinations, with unpredictable properties. Those emerge rapidly and is what we refer to as \"the antigenic shift.\" The \"antigenic drift\" is the normal process of Angela Rasmussen, PhD, is a virologist and Research Scientist at the Vaccine Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan and an Affiliate of the Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security. Prevention Strategist talked with Angela to get an expert's thoughts on the COVID-19 vaccine and what it will take to stop the next pandemic. mutation that those viruses acquire as they circulate through species. There are lots of opportunities for different flu viruses to emerge rapidly, which is why annual vaccination is neces - sary. The strains are challenging to predict, because influenza is seasonal, due to the fact that flu circulates in migrating birds which travel around seasonally. The southern hemisphere will track the influenza circulation in the northern hemisphere and vice versa, and from there we try to guess the best strain and manufacture the appropriate vaccine for the upcoming flu season. Everyone gets or has had the flu, and so everyone has different levels of immune background. It's recommended to get a shot every year because the vaccine will provide some protection against disease and lower hospital burden. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate at the levels in human population the way it is, we will eventually have variance as more people get vaccinated. We don't know how long that will take. Get vac - cinated now and reduce transmission so there is less chance those variants will emerge and acquire adaptations. If there are fewer viruses circulating, there are fewer variants to acquire these adaptations. There aren't a lot circulating in other species to add that additional evolution of unpredictability to it. Right now, the guess is less than once a year, but we aren't really sure. Why are there such stark differences in the experiences of the disease? Is this strictly a function of an individual's immune response or something else? It depends on a combination of things: potentially the variant they are infected with, potentially the route by which they became Interview with Virologist ANGELA RASMUSSEN SIMON KADULA/SHUTTERSTOCK.COMCOVID-19 40 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention infected, although data indicates dose doesn't determine disease severity, and then there is host response. Genetic differences, epigenetic differences (changes made directly to DNA), but the most easily understandable reasons are previous medical status and comorbidities, diet, sex, levels of hormones, medications; all of those things influence how you will respond. What we know is that people with severe COVID-19 have a delayed innate antiviral response; your body's virus protection system is called interferon (which is also used as a drug). Cells detect a viral infection, and they induce the interferon system (sort of like a fire alarm and sprinkler system into one). It then triggers a bunch of cell processes to target virus infection and send out signals to trigger B and T cells, adapt the immune system, recruit immune cells, responses, get the whole thing running. In people with severe COVID-19, this system is impaired for some reason. It could be because viruses evolve to evade or antagonize the interferon system. We don't know. For one reason or another, their system is not recognizing they are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Pre-existing genetic/epigenetic environmental medical risk factors have not been identified yet. Because viruses have been advancing, were we destined for a pandemic? Yes. We haven't discovered the vast majority of viruses and there are millions in circulation and many are from families that include human pathogens, so given climate change, ecological disruption, and people encroaching on wild spaces, there are more opportunities for exposure to pathogens that haven't been replicated in humans before. Many will be a dead-end host. But for some viruses, through serendipity, they will efficiently infect the host and transport from person to person. I don't know anyone in biodefense, infection prevention, epidemiology, or biosecurity who didn't expect another pan - demic. There are always influenza pandemics happening every decade, but everyone expected a pandemic of something else, and the way that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted, its always been at the top of the list. The real irony of working with emerging viruses is no one knows if you are successful at preventing a pandemic. Only after the virus emerges and causes the pandemic do people appreciate the danger. In 2003 we had SARS classic and 2013 we had MERS, and then we received more funding for coro - navirus research, but a few years passed without a pandemic so the money went away because there was clearly not a threat. It's a boom and bust cycle of research and funding. It's really important for people to understand that in order to be prepared for the next big one, we need sustained investment in every - thing: basic research and translational applications, vaccine manufacturers, and new therapeutics. microbial surveillance testing MADE EAS Y NOW!

The mRNA enters the cell and allows our cells to produce the spike protein. The mRNA is then eliminated in 1 to 2 days. It does not modify our DNA; it does not even go into the nucleus where our DNA is. We make antibodies that attach to the virus and keep it from binding to our cells. We also make \"killer\" T cells that seek out and destroy cells that are infected. Do the COVID-19 vaccines work? The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are both reported to be more than 90% effective in preventing disease. They both probably reduce infection and trans - mission, but the clinical trial design to measure these outcomes takes longer. Moderna has tested their vaccine with a 4-week interval between doses. Pfizer used a 3-week interval. When receiving the vaccine, the first dose stimulates protective antibodies and T cells. But these will fade in a couple of months. The second dose produces stronger, longer lasting immunity. Currently we anticipate protection last - ing a few years, but we only have about 6 months of data. What about the new virus variants? Will the COVD-19 vaccine protect against those strains as well? Viruses all mutate. With hundreds of millions of infections, there are thousands of variants out there. So far, the antibodies produced by the vaccines react slightly less against newer variants of concern (e.g., UK, Brazil, South Africa, etc.). We need more analysis of this question, though. T cells may still be protective. But reducing the number of infections via vaccination will reduce the appearance of new variants. STEVEN SINGER, PHD, APIC consultant, is a full professor in the Biology depart - ment at Georgetown University. He is the director of the undergraduate program in Biology of Global Health and the gradu - ate program in Global Infectious Disease. Singer was a molecular biology major as an undergraduate at Princeton University and earned a PhD in Microbiology and Immunology from Stanford University, where he studied immunology and juve - nile diabetes. While at Stanford, he was bitten with the parasitology bug and sub - sequently did two postdoctoral fellowships studying parasitic infections at Harvard Medical School and the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, respectively. He has been on the faculty at Georgetown since 1999 where he runs a lab focused on immune responses to intes - tinal parasitic infection and teaches classes on immunology, infectious disease, and global health. The lab has been continu - ously supported by grants from the NIH for 20 years. He is a deputy editor for the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases and an associate editor for the journal Infection & Immunity . To learn more about COVID-19 vaccination, APIC sat down with Singer and asked some of the most popular questions on the subject.A Conversation with APIC Consultant Steven SingerCOVID-19RIDHOBADAL/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM 42 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention We may need second generation vaccines that include some of the variants (e.g., flu shots are quadrivalent\u20144 strains), but I think it is unlikely that we will need annual vaccines like we have for influenza. Do I still need to wear a mask after I had the vaccine? The CDC has issued new guidance on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 transmission after you have been vaccinated. To see what you can do after you've been fully vaccinated, visit https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html . What do you say to those who are worried that the vaccine was rushed to market too quickly? mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for about 20 years and teams even started clinical trials. Approval was not received in the past because the epidemics had faded, and the fund - ing was pulled. Coronavirus biology and immunity has been extensively studied, allowing immediate focus on the spike protein as a vaccine target. Once the sequence was made available last January, scientists designed the vac - cines in less than a week based on past research and work done. I AM IRIX/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM TELNOV OLEKSII/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM Editor's note: APIC and the field of infection preven - tion are at the intersection of healthcare and public health, and as such we recognize that vaccine equity is a global issue. COVID-19 is a global health crisis and requires vaccine distribution on a global scale to combat disease transmission. www.apic.org | 43Because of all this, preclinical studies were skipped and vaccines went straight from development into human trials with the following schedule: Phase I safety trials were performed and evaluated under normal FDA review. Phase II studies (dosing and immune responses) began immediately after Phase I. Phase III studies for efficacy were launched ASAP with over 30,000 participants in each. Study designs and endpoints were published in advance. FDA requirements for Emergency Use Authorization were also discussed and published in advance (e.g., 50% efficacy.) There is a significant effort to enroll broad demographic participation, and par - ticipants are being followed for 2 years with blood tests, phone calls, and app-based reporting. If I had COVID-19 and/or have antibodies, do I need the vaccine? Yes, reinfection with COVID-19 has been documented. Moreover, the vaccines produce a more robust immune response than natural infection. If you were treated with antibodies (Regeneron, Eli Lilly, or convalescent plasma) you should wait 90 days before being vaccinated. Do I need to receive my doctor's approval to receive a vaccination? No, the vaccines are approved for general use. Of course, you can always discuss any decision like this with your doctor.I am over 60 and have pre-existing health conditions. Should I get the vaccine? Definitely. You are at elevated risk for COVID-19, but not from the vaccine. If I had cancer, should I get one of the current vaccines? Yes, if you are currently being treated, discuss with your oncologist. But given the extra risk due to infec - tion, getting the vaccine makes sense. Current cancer patients should not get live vaccines like the AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Who should NOT get the vaccine? Anyone having a known severe allergic reaction to components of the vaccine. How long does it take for the vaccine to work? Data indicate that antibodies are measurable by 2 weeks after the first dose and symptomatic infections are reduced at this time. But the second dose of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines provide stronger, longer-lasting protection.

What lessons have they learned over the past year? Is there an end in sight to the PPE problem? APIC reached out to Strategic Partners 3M and Medline for insight.An interview with PPE manufacturers 3M and Medline A HOW CAN THE SUPPLY EVER MEET THE DEMAND? It appears that healthcare workers are not as strapped for PPE as they were in the beginning of the pan - demic, yet many are still operating in crisis mode. What have the manufac - turers done to ramp up production? 3M: Healthcare workers are facing extraordinary challenges every day as they fight COVID-19. During the pandemic, 3M remains committed to delivering the majority of our respiratory protec - tion products to healthcare and front - line workers. 3M manufactured 2 billion respirators globally in 2020\u2014tripling production since 2019. 3M is now mak - ing more than 95 million respirators per month in the U.S. alone, more than quadrupling domestic production since 2019. This effort included ramping up production of reusable respirators and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) as potential alternatives to N95s and other filtering facepiece respirators, per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. In addi - tion, 3M partnered with the U.S. govern - ment and the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to facilitate the import and distribution of 3M res - pirators produced in other countries to support American frontline healthcare workers. 3M has also accelerated produc - tion of other solutions used in the response to COVID-19, including biopharma fil - tration, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants. Medline: Throughout the pandemic, Medline has been laser-focused on imple - menting new ideas to combat the national shortage of medical supplies. In particular, customers have a critical need for readily available face masks. Medline expanded its Lithia Springs, Georgia, plant to begin manufacturing level-1 ear loop procedure masks. When its two lines are fully opera - tional later in 2021, Medline will produce 36 million face masks per month. This is the third U.S-manufacturing expansion by Medline in 2020, as part of the company's North American Manufacturing Expansion Initiative. In April 2020, Medline launched hand sanitizer production at its Hartland, Wisconsin, plant to help meet a nation - wide shortage. Medline redeployed manu - facturing capabilities there to produce 80 percent ethyl alcohol-based hand sanitizer and retrofitted production rooms for the new product. The com - pany also shifted manufacturing focus in its Meriden, Connecticut, plant to manufacture alcohol gel packets during the height of the shortages. By the end of 2020, Medline had shipped more than 20 billion pieces of PPE to healthcare providers nationwide. What is your advice for organizations that are still having difficulty sourcing PPE? 3M: Some healthcare facilities have increased their consumption of PPE by up to 20 to 40 times over pre-pandemic levels. 3M is making more respirators than ever before; however, the demand for N95 respirators and other PPE continues to far exceed supply for the entire indus - try. Working through your current 3M authorized distributor is the best way to order 3M N95 respirators and other PPE. We also urge organizations to review the KATARINANH/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM COMPILED BY ELIZABETH HABERKORNCOVID-19 48 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention PPE Crisis Standards of Care For which of the following has your hospital or agency implemented PPE crisis standards of care (i.e., decontamination, extended use, or re-use) at any time by relevant govern - ment agencies, such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), local departments of health, FEMA, and other federal and state agencies. These groups may also have information about PPE distribution within their chain of custody. 3M is working with govern - ments, health agencies, distributors, and others to prioritize supplies to the most critical customer and public health needs. 3M is also aggressively fighting price gouging and counterfeiting. We have launched a global effort to combat fraud and price gouging and help protect heroic nurses, doctors, healthcare work - ers, and first responders against those who try to exploit the demand for critical 3M products during a pandemic. 3M has launched a website ( www.3M.com/ covidfraud ) that provides more infor - mation on these and other 3M efforts to fight respirator fraud, counterfeiting, and price gouging. How has COVID-19 impacted your company's business practices and philosophy? What innovations came about as a result? 3M: Early in the outbreak, 3M began addressing the COVID-19 pandemic from all angles from innovation on 3M solutions to new interactions with other companies and organizations. 3M has helped healthcare institutions imple - ment additional respirator options such as reusable half-facepiece respirators which can be cleaned and reused many times. 3M developed a novel exhalation valve filter as an accessory for the 3M 6000-Series Half Facepiece Reusable Respirator. The exhalation valve filter is designed to help filter the wearer's exhaled breath to provide source control when worn with 3M 6000-Series Half Facepiece Reusable Respirators. It is the first such NIOSH-approved accessory for a reusable respirator. Other interaction examples include providing expertise in personal safety equipment, technology, and regulatory requirements to help Ford Motor Company rapidly design a new powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). 3M also partnered with engine manufac - turer, Cummins, to increase production \"Early in the outbreak, 3M began addressing the COVID-19 pandemic from all angles from innovation on 3M solutions to new interactions with other companies and organizations.\" \u2014 3M An APIC survey of 1,083 U.S. IPs released in December of 2020 revealed that many hospitals have implemented PPE crisis standards of care.

Medline: Medline has more than 27,000 employees around the world and more than 17,000 in the U.S. working to provide healthcare with vital medical supplies. The company's 20-plus North American manufacturing plants and more than 45 distribution centers across the U.S. worked all shifts to produce and deliver products. To move these lifesaving products around the U.S., Medline's more than 1,000 trucks also continue deliveries to ensure healthcare providers have what they need to remain effective and opera - tional. Medline's transportation division, MedTrans, enables the company to provide 1-day delivery to 99 percent of the U.S. The health and safety of team members always is a top priority, so the company continues to follow all CDC guidance at its facilities. The company established social distancing guidelines in all Medline buildings, instituted temperature checks before entry, and provided facemasks and gloves to workers. What trends have you noticed in the industry and are you following in early 2021? 3M: Even with accelerated production from 3M and other personal protective equipment (PPE) manufacturers, the demand for commonly used PPE includ - ing respiratory protection and eye and face protection far exceeds supply. This has created a need for health care insti - tutions to implement strategies to opti - mize their PPE supply and also consider broader options. For example, 3M is seeing an increase in use of reusable res - pirators with replaceable filters and pow - ered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) as potential alternatives to N95s and other filtering facepiece respirators to help keep nurses, doctors, and frontline workers protected. In healthcare organizations, decisions about PPE use and infection prevention should be made in consultation with applicable requirements and guid - ance, including from infection preven - tion and occupational health and safety teams. Healthcare organizations need to understand and account for all aspects of health care professionals' potential expo - sures as well as relevant healthcare-specific considerations, such as requirements for surgical procedures and maintenance of sterile fields. This is driving an increasing need for training materials and technical resources to help organizations understand the PPE options and implement selected solutions at scale during the pandemic and as we move into the future. Medline: The pandemic has shed light on supply chain challenges that the healthcare industry faces. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, Medline has collaborated directly with industry and government agencies to improve the overall supply chain. Medline initially provided ongoing weekly communication to customers with transparent updates on the state of product availability and supply chain actions and introduced a comprehensive COVID-19 Resource Center ( https:// www.medline.com/covid19/ ), with product and supply chain information, clinical resources, industry news, expert insights, and links to critical government updates. Today, the company provides monthly updates specific to pandemic supplies to customers. \"Medline has more than 27,000 employees around the world and more than 17,000 in the U.S. working to provide healthcare with vital medical supplies.\" \u2014 Medline READ MORE ABOUT PPE IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL Availability of personal protective equipment and infection prevention supplies dur - ing the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic: A national study by the APIC COVID-19 task force Terri Rebmann, Angela Vassallo, Jill E.

CDC notes that approximately 1.3 million Americans reside in nursing homes and another 800,000 in assisted-living facilities (ALFs). For over a decade, care in these facilities has transitioned from custodial to sometimes very complex and sophisticated medical care, however, they were not prepared for the demands brought forward by the pandemic. unsettling; as evidenced by previously documented outbreaks, inappropriate dia - betes care, cleaning practices, inadequate adherence to hand washing, and appro - priate use of PPE underscored by a lack of education and resources were issues prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While some if not most of this went unnoticed, COVID-19 unveiled these deficits for the world to see. The most important thing this country can do once the pandemic has subsided is not slip back into apathy. I have heard this described as \"panic-neglect.\" History has demonstrated that we often \"panic\" when an unusual adverse event happens (the pandemic), devoting a lot of money, attention, and resources to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, those activities are not always sustained (neglect) once the event is over and we revert to status quo. It is unacceptable for us to allow that to happen in this situation. The first critical step in that direction, at least in my opinion, is to ensure LTCFs have adequate staffing to oversee the IPC program and that the IP has been pro - vided with sufficient time, resources, and specialized training to carry out these responsibilities. Historically, LTCFs have been inadequately staffed (four-fold less than acute care), wear multiple hats, and less than 10 percent of staff have special - ized training. Acute care facilities typi - cally require staff to be certified, but LTC staff never had those requirements. As COVID-19 demonstrated, an IPC program is crucial for protection of resi - dents and healthcare workers. CDC now recommends one IP per LTCF that has more than 100 residents; not just during the pandemic, but also after. It is possible some other states will do what California did and require one IP on staff all the time. I would like to see this at a federal level, because a decision like this should not be left up to the states. There are just too many variables and we need to recognize that every LTCF in this country needs help. This can only be resolved on a federal level. Key lessons learned from pandemic Adhering to stronger IPC practices must become a habit to healthcare per - sonnel. IPC is not just about complying with correct practices because surveyors are in the building. Proper hand hygiene and PPE usage, as well as cleaning the environment appropriately, are a standard way of providing care and fundamental to the success of any IPC program. You can always provide education to build on skills but having strong practices in place and robust policies for people to follow are essential to building good infection prevention habits. Sometimes, what makes the difference is ensuring the basics are done correctly and consistently. If your facility has a sound IPC program, when the next pan - demic comes, you will be better prepared. Needed change It comes down to the development of strong and robust IPC programs and policies, as well as leadership support. Turnover has always plagued LTCFs and it can be demoralizing when a new RN BY EVELYN COOK EVELYN COOK, RN, CIC, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF SPICEThe North Carolina Statewide Program for Infection Control and Epidemiology (SPICE) has provided evidence-based training and consultation to thousands of health care personnel in North Carolina for more than 35 years. Since the out - break, SPICE in partnership with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) is uti - lizing CDC grant funding to continue providing education and training for long-term care facilities (LTCFs), ALFs, and other healthcare facilities through - out North Carolina, to aid in their pre - paredness efforts against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Critical next steps What the pandemic unveiled to the general population regarding LTCFs was COVID-19 www.apic.org | 51or CNA is hired, oriented, and leaves a few months later for more pay or better hours. Every LTCF needs leadership that can provide structure and support and empower staff to do the right thing. Just providing orientation and training is not sufficient. For instance, think about having processes in place that monitor adherence to recommended practice(s). Involve frontline staff in the process and provide findings and constructive feedback in a timely manner (related to the event) not just during performance evaluations. Selecting the right person for the IP position is essential. Find someone who has the proper qualifications, experiences, certifications, and desire, but also be sure to provide them with the necessary sup - port and resources. It really does not mat - ter how smart and certified they are, if they have too much on their plate, they cannot do the job properly. We need to advocate for legislation directing LTCFs to have one full-time person on staff with oversight for infection prevention only. Pandemic care in LTCFs LTCFs are not designed for pandemic care. These facilities are homes for the residents, so there are visitors constantly. Friends and family often assist staff with resident care, and participation in com - munal activities are encouraged. In LTCFs, most rooms are not private, and facilities were never expected to have PPE items such as respirators, and fit testing of staff. Historically, if that level of care and precautions was needed, the resident went to the hospital. That all changed when the pandemic happened. LTCFs had their world completely turned upside down. They were expected to provide the same compliance as acute care, without having the infrastructure to do so. I do not think those of us in the world of infection prevention were surprised at how lethal COVID-19 was once it entered the facilities. Given residents underlying health conditions, the confined environ - ment, the nature of congregate care, and lack of experience with emerging patho - gens, it was almost inevitable. What makes it even harder to compre - hend is that this patient population can be easily disoriented, especially when they cannot identify their caregiver. They are confused and don't understand what's going on. Some of them are suffering from hearing loss and trying to under - stand someone who is speaking through a mask is hard for the average person. The most tragic impact was residents who died of COVID-19 died in isolation, without their families and loved ones. Healthcare professionals were the only ones who could be present for them. It has been a very difficult time and unfortunately so much understanding of what a LTCF is and does was lost in the transition of care and criticism. Vaccine rollout There does seem to be a little \"discon - nect\" with COVID-19 vaccination. We have cars lined up at vaccination sites and individuals willing to wait for hours to receive the vaccine. On the other hand, we seem to have a lot of vaccine hesitancy from our healthcare personnel. While there are no easy answers, infec - tion prevention experts and facility lead - ers must consistently and continuously provide accurate information to form a base of trust. It may be true that we don't know the long-term effects of vaccination just yet, but we do know that COVID-19 By February 25, 2021, about 1% of America's population resided in LTCFs. Of the deaths from COVID-19, 36% were from this population. Source: The COVID-19 Tracking Project. The Atlantic Monthly Group. https://covidtracking.com/nursing-homes- long-term-care-facilities .

TAMPA GENERAL PARTNERS survival of local businesses and ensure a safer, healthier community. His team of experts quickly worked together to turn his vision into a reality. The long-range goal included assessment of current envi - ronment for the feasibility of operating safely on site, versus maintenance of vir - tual work patterns, if in place. Tampa General's Prevention Response Outreach, or TPRO, program was launched in May 2020 and began to partner with a variety of businesses and WITH COMMUNITY Many organizations were forced to shut down or change to remote ser - vices as COVID-19 cases climbed in their communities. In Florida, Tampa General Hospital President and CEO John Couris had a vision to support the From left to right: Steve Chew, MHA, CPC, Seetha Lakshmi, MD, Peggy Thompson, BSN, MPH, CIH, CHMM. www.apic.org | 53community organizations that do not operate remotely as well as they do in offices and onsite locations. These have included utility companies, schools, entertainment arenas, and many others. The program is a collaboration between TGH, USF Health physicians, and private community physicians. The TPRO team consists of infectious disease physicians, infection prevention clinicians, and an industrial hygienist with oversight from the senior administrator of the Infectious Diseases service line. TPRO provides a wide range of ser - vices to help these organizations lower the risk of infection and operate more safely. These include walk-through evaluations of workspaces, written rec - ommendations for improvement oppor - tunities, review of available disinfectants and hand sanitizer, and virtual education on hand hygiene, proper mask usage, and COVID-19 prevention strategies based on guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For example, we worked with Tampa Preparatory School, a private school for middle and high school students, to help them develop a plan to adjust classroom schedules, facilitating a hybrid approach to keep class sizes down. This allows them to adhere to the 6-foot recommendation for distance between students. They started preparing early, making personal protective equipment, disinfectant, and hand hygiene stations readily available. Additional modifica - tions have included eliminating use of the cafeteria in favor of using outdoor space for eating, modifying athletic activities to limit over-crowding, and enhancing disinfection of high-touch surfaces. We continue to work with them as guidance documents change and they have been able to control transmission of COVID-19 within the school when com - munity positivity rates have been high. Last summer, TPRO helped the Florida Aquarium safely re-open. TPRO helped them develop policies to enforce use of masks for guests as well as employees, eliminate unnecessary use of disposable gloves, establish barriers to eliminate high- touch displays, and create safer traffic pat - terns to avoid crowding of enclosed spaces. More recently, TPRO worked side- by-side with the leadership team of the Florida Senate to provide guidance so that employees and legislators could return safely to the state Capitol. Tampa General continues to partner with them to ensure a lower risk of infection as in-person meet - ings resume. We have provided guidance to several organizations in the Tampa Bay area, including the Tampa Electric Company, the Straz Center for the Performing Arts, Amalie Arena, and the Tampa Bay Lightning. TPRO completed training for every employee at Tampa Electric that included explaining the \"why\" behind our recommendations, as people are more likely to comply with safety measures if they understand why they are effective. This virtual education platform provided them the opportunity to interact with the presenter to ask questions as well as see the proper way to don and doff a mask and per - form hand hygiene. The Straz used our rec - ommendations to facilitate a safe summer program for aspiring theater students; pres - ent small, socially distanced indoor theater performances; and host a live performance of the Nutcracker, outdoors and masked! The Straz also incorporated our recommen - dations into their protocols for the eventual reopening of their larger theaters. We continue to work with multiple schools in the area as well, ensuring that schools operate hand hygiene stations, provide educational signage, and arrange classrooms, cafeterias, and break rooms to increase physical distancing and lower infec - tion risk. We offer resources to them to help them write policies for the safe practices they have enacted to decrease the risk for trans - mission in their settings. We also visit schools to advise on improvement opportunities if their COVID-19 case numbers increase.

If you are working 6 days a week doing your epidemiology job plus giving life-saving COVID vaccines too. You cringe when you watch people wearing gloves in the drive-thrus/ restaurants and don't change them or perform hand hygiene...all while constantly touching their face and mask. You enter a nursing department and the staff freeze before checking themselves nonchalantly for illegal PPE like booties or gloves before heading to the hand sanitizer... You think it's a compliment when people see you and then go to the sink to wash their hands. You get excited every time when someone does hand hygiene.Your husband asks what he's contaminated NOW. Since you have THAT look on your face. If you just can't understand why all these precautions like cleaning high touch areas in public places weren't happening before COVID? You can't relax at the dentist. You haven't had a day off in a year. If you walk on the unit and everyone hides their snacks! You tell people what they don't want to hear. If you protect patients and staff from infection transmission. As part of APIC's Self Care Sunday, members shared thoughts on how to tell if you are an IP. 56 | SPRING 2021 | Prevention Office found that, according to CMS data, infection prevention and control deficiencies were the most common type of deficiency cited in surveyed nursing homes, with 82 percent of surveyed nurs - ing homes having been cited in one or more years from 2013 through 2017. CMS noted in its 2019 proposed rule to revise Medicare LTC Requirements mentioned above that \"infection is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among 1.7 million residents of U.S. nurs - ing homes.\" It further noted that between 1.6 million and 3.8 million infections occur each year in these facilities, with almost 388,000 deaths attributed to these infections. Next steps: APIC began the \"Certification: The Defining Difference\" campaign in 2018 to promote state legislation to require hospital IPs to be certified in infection prevention and control. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear that LTC infection control was a crisis, so APIC expanded the campaign to build attention on protecting seniors from inad - equate care in nursing homes by calling on policymakers to: Require a minimum of one full-time certified IP in each nursing home as has been called for by the CDC. Ensure that infection prevention per - sonnel in nursing homes are trained and certified in their field of expertise. Require health departments to collect and publicly report data on infection rates. More details about this campaign will be available in the Capitol Comments department in the summer issue of Prevention Strategist . Personal protective equipment (PPE) supply chain Availability of PPE became a chal - lenge immediately after COVID-19 was identified. Because of the novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, little was known at the beginning of the pandemic about the virus's transmissibility. As the sci - ence evolved, evidence-based PPE guid - ance also evolved; however, this was complicated by the fact that several agencies have a role in providing direc - tion related to PPE. CDC's National Institute on Occupational Safety and Goal #5. Safely reopen schools, businesses, and travel while protecting workers. Key actions: Implement a national strategy to sup - port safely reopening schools. Support safe operations at childcare centers and at-home providers. Support equitable reopening in higher education. Protect workers and issue stronger worker safety guidance. Provide guidance and support to safely open businesses. Promote safe travel. Goal #6. Protect those most at risk and advance equity, including across racial, ethnic, and rural/urban lines. Key actions: Establish the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force. Increase data collection and reporting for high-risk groups. Ensure equitable access to critical COVID- 19 PPE, tests, therapies, and vaccines. Expand access to high-quality healthcare. Expand the clinical and public health workforce, including community-based workers. Strengthen the social service safety net to address unmet basic needs. Support communities most at risk for COVID-19. Goal #7. Restore U.S. leadership globally and build better preparedness for future threats. Key actions: Restore, strengthen, and reform the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization. Surge the international public health and humanitarian response. Restore U.S. leadership to the international COVID-19 response and advance global health security and diplomacy. Build better biopreparedness and expand resilience for biological threats. Health (NIOSH) evaluates and approves products that meet established perfor - mance standards. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the use of PPE that are identified as medical devices. The CDC provides guidance on the use of PPE for healthcare provid - ers and the public. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards establish requirements for employers to provide PPE appropriate to ensure the safety of their employees. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response monitors the Strategic National Stockpile to ensure adequate supplies of PPE are available during national emergencies. All of these agencies make evidence-based decisions; however, the evidence was changing rapidly, making it difficult for agencies to keep up and also to coordinate with each other. Another complication was that most PPE used in the U.S. is not manufac - tured in this country. In fact, many PPE manufacturers are located in the Hubei province in China, which was hard hit early in the pandemic. This led to severe shortages of PPE. Shortages also led facilities to stockpile and ration PPE, and also to reuse or reprocess PPE intended for single use. Next steps: APIC will continue to provide guidance to OSHA as it resumes development of the Infectious Disease Standard, including promoting the use and availability of appropriate PPE for the setting and the situation, as well as encouraging OSHA coordination with CDC, CMS, and other agencies to ensure consistency of guidance and oversight. Congress dedicated funding to studies in order to examine the PPE supply chain and to find ways to prevent such shortages in the future. APIC looks forward to the findings of these studies and will work with stakeholders when - ever possible.
