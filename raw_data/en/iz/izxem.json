Federal labeling law requires that ingredients added to provide a pleasant scent, or to mask a bad one, need only be listed under the generic term \"fragrance\" or \"parfum.\" This so-called \"fragrance loophole\" allows companies to hide ingredients under the protection of trade secrets. So is there anything being done to protect consumers? Yes! [The California Fragrance and Flavor Ingredient Right to Know Act](https://www.cosmeticsbusiness.com/news/article_page/California_passes_Cosmetic_Fragrance_and_Flavor_Right_to_Know_Act/170342) requires that companies have to disclose to California if their fragrances contain any harmful ingredients and if they do, then the state of California will make it public. The Act comes into effect on January 1, 2022. This is a great first step in disclosing information that consumers have the right to know. WHY WE ARE SWAPPING OUT 'CLEAN & CLEAR ESSENTIALS FOAMING FACIAL CLEANSER' CONS: - Contains parabens - These are artificial preservatives that studies suggest can disrupt hormones in the body (referred to as 'endocrine disruptors'). Parabens can be identified on the ingredient label as isobutyl-, butyl-, isopropyl- and propylparaben. - Contains \"fragrance\" - One little word that can be a blanket term for up to 3,0000 different chemicals (many endocrine disrupting). - Contains artificial color additives - Many of these toxic colors are made by using coal tar, petroleum or heavy metals.
