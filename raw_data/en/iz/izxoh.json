This study aimed to explore the beliefs and willingness of parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders about COVID-19 vaccine and understand how certain factors in\u0000uencing the vaccine decision-making process differ between them and other parents' groups. Methods: A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted between August to November 2021. 400 parents from all 6 major regions in Saudi Arabia participated in an Arabic online survey and shared their beliefs about the new COVID-19 vaccination for their children. Results: The Cronbach alpha for Arabic version score was 0.71. 381 participants were eligible to answer the survey (95.2%) from 400 participants. The total number of parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorder was 158 (41.5%). 85 (53.8%) of them were ready to vaccinate their children with COVID-19 vaccine. While 36 (22.8%) were hesitant, the rest 37 (23.4%) did not want to vaccinate their children at all. Only a small number 16 (10.1%) have beliefs of vaccines as a cause of their child's neurodevelopmental disorder. A total of 79 out of 131 responses were received from both parents' groups. Fear of long-term side-effects was the most common reason reported by 41 responders out of 64 (64.06%) from parents of healthy children and 38 responders out of 67 (56.71%) from parents of diagnosed children. Another reason reported by parents of younger children in both groups was the child's age. Having a healthcare relative worker was signi\u0000cantly associated with the vaccine decision making (p < .001). Conclusion: Although the majority of the respondents were willing to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, there are a number of parents around 45.14% who strongly refuse vaccination or are undecided about it yet. More information about the importance and safety of the vaccine should be accessible to those parents. Introduction COVID-19 pandemic is a global issue that emerged in December 2019 when Wuhan, China, reported the \u0000rst case. Since then, the number of cases has been increasing and documented in many different countries. As COVID-19 is an infectious disease, vaccination is one of the most successful and effective ways to control the pandemic worldwide. Saudi Arabia has a well strict structured response in controlling the pandemic, providing the required healthcare equipment, and placing testing and vaccination centers in all major six regions. However, the logistical challenge is that the government is trying different strategies to convince millions of people of the bene\u0000ts, safety, and necessity of being vaccinated against COVID-19. Concerns about any new vaccine are an issue the world faces as the public refuses to take it. On the other hand, vaccines may cause unintended consequences or side effects. These side effects andPage 3/17consequences build a barrier of hesitancy in accepting to be vaccinated by a new vaccine. One of the reasons to refuse the vaccination is a child's illness, including neurodevelopmental disorders. Many studies gave facts about the rate of parents who discontinue or stopped following their child's vaccination schedule on purpose after receiving their child's diagnosis. Moreover, they developed the misbelief that vaccination caused their child's neurodevelopmental disorder. In addition, the parents started to refuse to vaccinate their other healthy children [1, 2]. In a cross-sectional study conducted in the United States from October 2016 to November 2017, showed a high vaccine hesitancy among parents of children and that they attributed autism spectrum disorder to toxins in vaccines leading them to be concerned about making their child's disorder worse after taking future vaccine shots [3]. Other studies, in the United State, which was conducted between 1995 and 2015, showed that children with ASD and their younger siblings were undervaccinated compared with the general population [4, 5]. Hence, vaccination success will rely on public awareness and willingness to be vaccinated, making the awareness campaigns a priority and goal for the government. Under current circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic; This study aims to explore the beliefs of parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders about the COVID-19 vaccine, examine their hesitancy in vaccination, and understand how certain factors in\u0000uencing the vaccine decision-making process differ between parents with a child diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders and other parents with healthy children. Methods Study design, participants, and sampling This cross-sectional study was conducted from August to November 2021 using a convenient sampling statistical techniques to quantify the acceptance of Covid-19 vaccination between parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorder compared to other children and explore their beliefs regarding their vaccination hesitancy. An online survey was distributed to parents in all six Saudi Arabia regions through social media applications. For parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, the survey was sent to them via the national centers for neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders, and speci\u0000c social media groups that those parents are part of. Participation in the study was voluntary, and all answers were anonymous. Parents were queried and approached to \u0000ll in the questionnaire about their acceptance of Covid-19 vaccination to their children aged 18-years-old or under. The questionnaire was completed autonomously by the respondent after obtaining online consent. A sample size of 385 subjects was calculated based on the number of people who are married, divorced, or widow in KSA taken from population census done by the General Authority for Statistics in 2020, and that represent Around 9,233,466 people, 33.77% of them are married, 1.27% are divorced, and 0.5% are widow. Using a con\u0000dence level of 95% and margin error of 0.05, the suitablePage 4/17sample size was 385 subjects using Steven equation[6]. However, the \u0000nal sample size has been increased up to 400 to reduce the sample bias. Reducing the selection bias for convenient sample was done by two different ways. First one by using the probability sampling along with convenient sample and the diversity. This was done by distributing the questionnaire though the social media; among all Saudi's social media users, which gave them the same chance and probability to answer the questionnaire, in addition to the diversity of distributing the questionnaire through different applications, different days, and different times a day, and all were done without making a previous judgment about who will be interested in answering the questionnaire and who is not. Second one was by collecting large data and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria on them. The collected responses were 400 response, 381 participants matched the required criteria to \u0000t with the study, and the rest of the (19 participants) were excluded as they did not match the criteria either in the age of children, parents of children with other health issues, or parents of children from other countries. The questionnaire included 30 questions categorized into speci\u0000c items: (A) demographic, (B) socioeconomic, and (C) diagnostic information. 10 questions were focused on demographic and socioeconomic data, whilst the rest of them focused on vaccination, neurodevelopmental disorders, and parents' beliefs. Questions included parents' age, educational level, marital status, geographic location, employment status, number and age of children, and the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders. To identify their point of view behind their vaccination hesitancy, all respondents were asked about missing any shot of the vaccination schedule on purpose. Parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders were asked speci\u0000cally if they have any thoughts or beliefs of a relation between the vaccines and the cause of their child's diagnosis. The average time of survey administration and the purpose of the study were both provided to the participants. All the methods used in this study were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Translation into Arabic The questionnaire in this study was \u0000rst written in Arabic by the investigators themselves then it has been translated into English by professional-level translators. Some questions have been taken from the Parent Attitude about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) validated survey [7]. The translated survey went through a back-translation process to con\u0000rm that the items matched accurately, reliable, and validated. The internal consistency of the Arabic version of the questionnaire was tested using Cronbach Alpha test giving the score 0.71 as a reliable and validated questionnaire. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by The Local Committee for Scienti\u0000c Research Ethics at King Fahad Hospital. Statistical analysis IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science) for Windows, 28.0 version and Microsoft Excel 2016 were used to analyze the research data. The frequency of the variables was calculated to show thePage 5/17exact number and percentage of each item. Chi-square was used as the main test to analyze the data and achieve the goals of this study in exploring the beliefs and willingness of parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders about COVID-19 vaccine along with comparing the decision-making process between parents with diagnosed children and parents with healthy children. Results 1.2 Survey results In total, 381 out of 400 completed the online survey and matched the required criteria in the sample simultaneously, with a (95.25%) response rate. (Table 1) shows the sociodemographic characteristics, including the parents' age, educational level, marital status, living area, and the number of children. This section includes questions regarding the perception of the COVID-19 pandemic and whether the parents are healthcare workers or have a relative working in a health institute, which represents important factors that could be a reason for the vaccination decision. The majority of the participating parents were above 35 years old, married, had an association or bachelor educational degree, living in the east region area of Saudi Arabia, and raising three children. The data analysis proves that most participants were not healthcare workers (81.9%), but they do have a healthcare relative worker (73.2%). 158 out of 381 participants were parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (41.5%). This 41.5% represents the percentage of parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders that included in this study sample. Most of the respondents were parents of children with attention-de\u0000cit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (41.7%). After that came the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (34.8%), language and speech disorders (15.1%), Intellectual disability (6.9%), and Motor disorders like developmental coordination disorder (1.2%), making it the least recorded disorder in this study. Table 1 shows the socio-demographic characteristics for the respondents. The majority of the parents were above 35 years of age, married, have an association or bachelor degree, living in east region of Saudi Arabia, raising three children, not healthcare worker but have a relative healthcare worker.Page 6/17Table 1 Socio-demographic characteristics (n=381) Characteristics 18-35 Above 35 Mother's education level: Middle school or below High school Associated or bachelor Master or above Uneducated Father's age: 18-35 Above 35 Father's education level: Middle school or below High school Associated or bachelor Master or above Uneducated Marital status: Married Separated Others Living area: South North Central West East161 220 19 90 225 39 8 100 281 45 95 177 57 7 359 12 10 13 13 54 35 266 63 73 245 69 312 27942.3 57.7 5.0 23.6 59.1 10.2 2.1 26.2 73.8 11.8 24.9 46.5 15.0 1.8 94.2 3.1 2.6 3.4 3.4 14.2 9.2 69.8 16.5 19.2 64.3 18.1 81.9 73.2Page 7/17Characteristics N % Number of children: One child Two children Three children Healthcare worker parents Yes No Relative healthcare worker Yes No102 26.8 (Table 2) shows the primary goal of the research by interpreting the vaccination acceptance (32.5%), refusal (12.6%), or hesitation (13.4%) among parents with healthy children compared to the vaccination acceptance, refusal, or hesitation among parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders (diagnosed children) (22.3%), (9.7%), (9.4%) respectively. The results also explore the attitudes and beliefs about the previous vaccines and whether they have already missed any vaccine for personal reasons other than health issues such as allergies or illnesses. Table 2 shows three factors that in\u0000uence parents' vaccine-decision making process regarding COVID-19 vaccination. The majority of parents, would like to vaccinate their children whether they have diagnosed or healthy children, agreed that doctors recommendations are an important in\u0000uence.Page 8/17Table 2 Variables associated to vaccination beliefs and decision -making of COVID-19 vaccinationDiagnosed children (n=158=41.5%), Healthy children 158% 41.5%N 223% 58.5% Decision of vaccinating your child Yes Not sure (hesitant)85 37 3622.3 9.7 9.4124 48 5132.5 12.6 13.4 Hesitation on a scale* Not hesitant at all Not hesitant Neutral Hesitant Extremely hesitant25 8 21 14 296.6 2.1 5.5 3.7 7.645 11 29 27 2311.8 2.9 7.6 7.1 6.0 \"Doctor's recommendation is an important factor in vaccination decision-making\" Strongly disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly agree19 9 29 13 885.0 2.4 7.6 3.4 23.125 11 46 20 1216.6 2.9 12.1 5.2 31.8 \"It is better for my child to develop immunity by getting sick than to get a vaccine shot\" Strongly disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly agree67 11 34 9 3717.6 2.9 8.9 2.4 9.793 25 56 13 3624.4 6.6 14.7 3.4 41.5%N 223% 58.5% \"Vaccine convinces (vaccination method, frequency, distance to vaccination sites, etc.) is an important factor in vaccination decision making\" Strongly disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly agree38 9 35 18 5810.0 2.4 9.2 4.7 15.236 11 53 39 849.4 2.9 13.9 10.2 22.0 *Not required question (Table 3) represents speci\u0000c factors that have been found to be a contributor in the vaccination-decision making process.

However, parents who have relative health care workers show the highest level of acceptance among parents of healthy children. Table 3 shows the relationship between the contributing factors and the decision of vaccination both healthy and diagnosed children. Most of the variables have a signi\u0000cant relationship, therefore the decision of the parents' decision was in\u0000uenced by these different variables.Page 10/17Table 3 The relationship between the decision of vaccinating healthy and diagnosed children, in association to different variables.

A total of 79 out of 131 responses were received from both parents' groups. Fear of long-term side-effects was the most common reason reported by 41 responders out of 64 (64.06%) from parents of healthy children and 38 responders out of 67 (56.71%) from parents of diagnosed children. Another reason reported by parents of younger children in both groups was the child's age. 2.2 Interpretation of the associated factors and beliefs that in\u0000uence vaccination decision When measuring the relationship between the different variables and the vaccination decision, some showed a signi\u0000cant relationship when others did not. The results have shown that having healthy or diagnosed children has a non-signi\u0000cant association with vaccination decision-making as it does not make any difference. In addition, vaccination decisions have neither a relationship to a speci\u0000c neurodevelopmental disorder nor a relationship with children who have been diagnosed with more than one disorder. Most of the sociodemographic characteristics had a non-signi\u0000cant relationship with the vaccination decision, with a>0.05 p-value, including educational level and marital status, except parents' age, which showed a signi\u0000cant relationship with the vaccination decision in both healthy and diagnosed children. There is a non-signi\u0000cant relationship between the healthcare parents' worker and the decision of vaccinating their healthy or diagnosed child. Surprisingly, statistics have shown a signi\u0000cant relationship between having a healthcare relative worker and the decision of vaccinating their healthy or diagnosed children (p=0.002), (p=0.006), respectively. The analysis showed a signi\u0000cant relationship between the respondent's perception of the pandemic and their decision to vaccinate healthy and diagnosed children (p=0.0001). As shown in (Table 2), some variables stand for a valid role in the decision-making. Doctor's recommendations and vaccine convinces have shown a signi\u0000cant relationship between vaccination decision-making in healthy and diagnosed children (p=0.0001). In addition, there is a signi\u0000cant relationship between the beliefs of getting the immunity by getting sick rather than getting a vaccine shot and the vaccination decision in both healthy and diagnosed children (p =0.0001). Discussion The Arabic version of the questionnaire has a Cronbach Alpha score of 0.71 as a reliable and validated questionnaire compared to other translated questionnaires. This study is one of the \u0000rst studies measuring the difference in COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rate between parents of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and other parents' groups.Page 12/17The results suggested that most parents of both diagnosed and healthy children's groups would vaccinate their children (54.8%), with the highest level of acceptance shown by parents of healthy children (32.5%) as shown in (Fig. 1). Varying from a recent study in Saudi Arabia reported (53.7%) of the parents with healthy children were willing to vaccinate their children among 333 respondents [8]. Another study in China reported (72.6%) vaccination acceptance rate [9]. The difference in the acceptance rate is likely related to the different targeted populations, and possibly because COVID-19 vaccine is considered as a new vaccine compared with other vaccines. Unlike the previous studies, which focus on the general population, this study is more speci\u0000c to target both parents of healthy children and neurodevelopmental disorders children. Even though the majority of respondents showed a high acceptance rate, If the hesitant parents were added with parents who refused to vaccinate their children to create one group, around 45.14% (the total number (n) 172 out of 381) will be almost equal to the number of parents who accept to vaccinate their children 54.85% (n=209 out of 381) with a small difference between these two groups. These \u0000ndings play a crucial role in showing the importance of establishing new interventions and campaigns to increase their education about vaccines. To the unexpected, this study demonstrated a correlation between parents' perception of the COVID-19 pandemic and their decision to vaccinate their children of both groups, as shown in (Table 3). Most parents in this study who thought the COVID-19 pandemic was dangerous would vaccinate their children (50.3%). In contrast, most parents who believed that the pandemic was exaggerated would not vaccinate their children (9.1%), and one of the causes was that they thought it was better for their children to develop immunity by getting sick than to get vaccinated, in addition to long term side effects. In another study done in the United Kingdom, addressing parental vaccine hesitancy and childhood in\u0000uenza vaccine, parents believed that their children should build immunity by getting sick rather than getting vaccinated [10]. Con\u0000rming the existence of this belief. There was no signi\u0000cant relationship between being a parent working in the health \u0000eld and accepting COVID-19 vaccination, as shown in (Table 3). This result could be impacted by the low number of parents working in the health \u0000eld involved in this study. This study results here, however, is similar to a study conducted in China, which revealed that Chinese healthcare workers showed relatively low parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years [11]. On the other hand, being a parent with a relative who is a healthcare worker showed a signi\u0000cant relationship with the COVID-19 decision-making process, as these parents were more likely to vaccinate their children. These results are similar to another study done in Turkey, which showed that vaccine uptake of children with parents who have a health care worker, friend, or relative was higher [12]. Parents' age seemed to affect their vaccination decision. The majority of parents who would vaccinate their children were above 35 years of age for both diagnosed and healthy groups. This \u0000nding was in contrast with a study conducted in the United Arab Emirates, showing that parental vaccine hesitancy has no signi\u0000cant association with parents' age [7].Page 13/17A study in the United States revealed that the level of parental education is a contributing factor to vaccine hesitancy [13]. Several studies demonstrated that parents with less formal education have greater distrust in the medical community, express more concerns about vaccine safety, and have less belief in the necessity and e\u0000cacy of vaccines. Also, it has been found that parents with less than 12 years of education were more likely to report not having enough vaccination information compared with parents with some graduate school education [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. As with many other studies, this study results have revealed that parents of both diagnosed and healthy groups who are willing to vaccinate their children were in\u0000uenced by doctors' recommendations, as shown in (Table 2). Similar results were found in a study in Turkey, showing that physicians had a positive effect on the parents who accepted the vaccine [12]. The role of healthcare providers is crucial to overcome vaccine risks and to bene\u0000t from the communication with the parents in the matter of in\u0000uencing their decision of vaccinating their children [19, 20]. Other studies discussing vaccines preventing otitis media and seasonal in\u0000uenza revealed that parents valued their physicians' recommendations and are in\u0000uenced by them [21, 22]. In relation to perception, parents of healthy children who thought that the pandemic was dangerous were affected by doctor's recommendations and would vaccinate their children. However, parents of healthy children who believed that the pandemic was exaggerated were not affected by these recommendations. According to parents of diagnosed children, there was no relation between doctor's recommendations and parents' perception. More than half of parents (60%) from both groups who refused the new COVID-19 vaccine expressed their fear about the safety and long-term side effects of the vaccine on their children, especially since this vaccine is still under trial for this age group and there are not enough studies about it. Another possible reason for the high rejection rate is that many parents, particularly those with affected children, believe that vaccines cause neurodevelopmental disorders in their children and since COVID-19 is a newly discovered virus, many people believe it never existed in the \u0000rst place, and that it is a conspiracy to destroy humanity. It could also be linked to the fact that many parents are waiting for some time before deciding to vaccinate their child since they want to make sure it is devoid of side effects \u0000rst. A national survey involving more than 11,000 parents in the USA identi\u0000ed that parents who delayed and refused vaccines were more likely to have vaccine safety concerns and perceived fewer bene\u0000ts associated with vaccines [23]. Similar results have been found in another study which reported that vaccine safety issues were one of the parents' top concerns [7]. Recommendations As doctor's recommendations signi\u0000cantly impact parents' decisions from both groups, national campaigns involving pediatrics providing educational interventions for parents, especially vaccine- hesitant parents, will considerably improve the acceptance rate. Additional information about the safety and e\u0000cacy of COVID-19 vaccine on children through trusted channels besides web-based vaccine information with social media applications targeting especially the younger parents will help to increase the acceptance rate and build trust; hence the young parents showed lower acceptance rate [24]. AnotherPage 14/17possible effective strategy to increase the acceptance rate is to conduct in person meetings with parents of unvaccinated children to relieve their fears and to correct the misconceptions. A reminder about the role of vaccines in overcoming the previous pandemics and expansion of vaccine centers with additional facilities can help as well. Limitations This study has a few limitations, one of them was that healthcare worker parents who refused the vaccine were considerably low in number compared to parents with a relative in the health \u0000eld. Another limitation was the participants in the Eastern region were overly represented in this study compared to other regions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In addition, parents' decisions could be in\u0000uenced by other factors which were not asked in the distributed questionnaire and not explored in this study indeed. Conclusion About 54.8% of both parents' groups in the studied sample showed the willingness to vaccinate their children with the COVID-19 vaccine. Parents' age, beliefs, and perception of the pandemic were associated with the decision to vaccinate their children. In addition to doctor's recommendations, vaccines convince and having a relative health care worker. On the other hand, almost half of the remaining participating parents refused or were unsure about vaccinating their children, and the fear of the side effects was the most important reason.
