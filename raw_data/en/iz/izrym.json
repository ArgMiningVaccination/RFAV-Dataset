Seizures can happen when the brain cells are not working or firing normally or working faster than normal. Most seizure medicines slow down these electrical discharges to stop seizures. - Levetiracetam works differently from most seizure medicines. It joins with a protein (called SV2A) that is involved with the release of certain chemicals called neurotransmitters in the brain. The exact way that these actions lead to decreased seizures is not fully known. [How does the body digest Levetiracetam?](#688745866) How the body absorbs, digests, and breaks down or gets rid of a medicine is called metabolism. The way the body metabolizes a medicine affects how often it must be taken. This process can also affect if it will interact with other medicines. If a person has liver or kidney problems, a person's metabolism may be affected. Some important points about levetiracetam: - The tablets and liquid take the same amount of time to be absorbed. - Taking levetiracetam with food may slow down the time it takes for the body to absorb the drug by about 1 hour. - The highest blood levels are reached in 1 to 2 hours after taking a dose of this medicine. - The liver does not affect how levetiracetam works in the body. - The body gets rid of the drug through the kidneys.

(This means that the number of seizures each month was at least cut in half.) - Most people did not have many problems with side effects in these studies. - At least one study found that levetiracetam may be helpful when used alone in people with focal (partial) seizures. - Since this medicine does not interact with other seizure medicines, it is easier to use with other seizure medicines. [What are the most common side effects of Levetiracetam?](#688745866) In the early tests of levetiracetam, people who took this medicine were only slightly more likely to stop the drug because of side effects than people taking a placebo (inactive drug).

According to the FDA's Alert, among the patients with epilepsy in these drug studies, more had symptoms of suicidality than people taking a placebo or inactive substance - 3.5 of 1,000 people taking a seizure medicine had suicidality compared to 1 of 1,000 people taking a placebo. - Taking seizure medicines may increase the risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. - Do not make any changes to the medicines without first talking to the prescribing health care provider. - Pay close attention to any day-to-day changes in mood, behavior and actions.

This vitamin is thought to help prevent birth defects affecting the brain and spinal cord, called neural tube defects. The most common of these is known as spina bifida. - Women at high risk of having a child with a birth defect (such as those with a birth defect in a previous pregnancy or taking certain seizure medicines) may be asked to take 4 mg (4000 mcg) daily before and during pregnancy. - Talk to your health care provider about using folic acid and how much to take. - Start taking this vitamin before you become pregnant.
