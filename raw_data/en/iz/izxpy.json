I started to write based on only a few memories, but as the writing developed, more and more came to me from the cosmic void of the Akashic Record. This recovering of memory seems to be an ongoing process, and as more details and memories enable me to fill out the missing parts of the text, further editions of this book may well be published. Nothing of what is written here can be proved in conventional scientific terms, but for me it is a truth - a clear remembrance and guideline in my ongoing work to relieve the world from the curse of the translocation of disease. I have several times been directed to my incarnation in China, around 4,000 years ago, working at the royal court of the emperor as a doctor of medicine. This work, as well as the court itself, was for many hundreds of years strongly influenced by the legendary so-called Yellow Emperor,* who ruled China some 1,000 years before I came to dwell in that region. The first person who directed me to this incarnation was a German colleague, who told me about my incarnation in ancient China as one of the head physicians at the court of the emperor. At that time I had apparently misused my magical powers as a healer, and because of this misuse certain celestial forces had taken my healing powers away, leaving me in darkness. In this - my present - incarnation I had finally chosen the right path, and the healing forces had been given back, partly to me and partly to my daughter. All this is described in detail in the first part of my book The Forgotten Mysteries of Atlantis, although in that book only vague mention is made of my incarnation as a physician at the royal court in China. In the present book, I will first describe how this incarnation in China has influenced my work as a veterinarian in modern-day Norway, and how I was brought to a deeper remembrance of this fatal Chinese experience. As mentioned already, in my current daily practice as a veterinarian I observed quite early on in my career that all treatments conducted by either orthodox medicine or alternative medicine - especially alternative medicine based on traditional Chinese medicine - caused a translocation of disease. That means that the deeper cause of the disease was transferred to other human beings or to animals, and was not really healed or transformed. I soon began to understand - actually to remember - that the possibility for this to happen was due to some important changes in the philosophical system and practice of medicine made by the Yellow Emperor himself. These changes were refined and developed in the following years by his successors and the leading physicians of his court - through all of whom the Yellow Emperor himself worked spiritually. This included me, and that worried me immensely. What should I do with this knowledge? The next person who directed me to my Chinese incarnation was also a German (Thomas Mayer), who specializes in reading the Akashic Record when meeting people. While I was explaining the function of the translocation of diseases to a group of Rudolf Steiner's followers in Berlin (I had still not revealed anything about my part in all of this), he told me afterwards that I myself had been a central person in developing the foundations of translocation at the court of one of the Chinese emperors around 4,000 years "}
