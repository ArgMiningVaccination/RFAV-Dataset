A recent report by the Center for an Urban Future highlights the trends shaping this massive demographic shift. New York City's 65-and-older age group grew by 36 percent over the past decade. New Yorkers ages 50 and older comprise nearly one-third of the City's population. Even more striking, the number of older adults living below the poverty line has increased by 37 percent. These realities call for increased material support for our older neighbors. However, the Mayor's proposed budget falls well short of making the needed investments that allow us to ensure our parents, grandparents and other loved ones can live safely and with dignity in the city they call home as they age. The Council is united in efforts to close these gaps in funding. Despite serving as linchpins to our city's economy and cultural life, and making up the city's biggest volunteer base, our older New Yorkers have been left to struggle. More than half spend too much of their income on housing. One in ten is food insecure. And because of the prohibitively expensive cost of medication, too many go without life-saving prescriptions. [Crystal's Corner: Land Use by the People, for the People](https://www.brooklynpaper.com/op-ed-crystal-hudson-land-use-for-the-people/) Brooklyn Paper, April 28, 2023 Take a moment to imagine yourself standing in the middle of Downtown Brooklyn or Williamsburg or Prospect Heights. Look around. The overbearing luxury glass towers - residential, commercial, or both \u2014 beaming into the skyline, likely make up part of what you see. Ten, twenty years ago, these buildings weren't there. Their blueprints likely didn't even exist. Yet, their ubiquitous presence today has undoubtedly reshaped entire neighborhoods and, in most cases, offered the communities in which they were built very little in return. So, how did we get to the point where huge projects spring up quicker than we're able to keep track of them? And why do our communities play only a cursory role in the decision-making process, if they get the chance to participate at all? [Our Communities Need Fair Pay for Home Care Work; Albany Leaders Must Hear Them](https://www.gothamgazette.com/130-opinion/11955-communities-need-fair-pay-home-care) Co-Authored with Bobbie Sackman, Gotham Gazette, April 18, 2023 For the first time in United States history, a president has [declared](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/03/31/a-proclamation-on-care-workers-recognition-month/) April as Care Workers Recognition Month.

Jackson Women's Health Organization last spring left the vast [majority](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23167397/abortion-public-opinion-polls-americans) of the nation lurching. In the weeks after the decision was leaked to the press, we were forced to grapple with the reality that an unelected, undemocratic body could inflict such harsh consequences on our communities and scrambled to continue delivering necessary abortion and reproductive care to all who needed it. The Dobbs decision left us in \" [a different world](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/03/schumer-abortion-rights-roe-draft-opinion-00029573).\" It made clear that long established legal protections can readily be struck down, and it dangerously [undermined](https://news.gallup.com/poll/402044/supreme-court-trust-job-approval-historical-lows.aspx) our faith in an institution meant to safeguard the very democratic principles this nation supposedly holds so high. More than that, the Dobbs decision showed us that the fight for reproductive justice--one where the struggle for racial equality, gender equity, and economic liberation converge to underscore the plight of Black women, Black LGBTQIA+ folks, and poor and working class people across the country, in particular--has not yet been won. [Crystal's Corner: Protecting Black Futures is a Moral Obligation to Expand and Fully Fund Right to Counsel](https://www.brooklynpaper.com/op-ed-crystals-corner-right-to-counsel/) Brooklyn Paper, February 28, 2023 From 2010 to 2020, New York City saw a 9% decline in its Black population. In just the last decade, the District I represent - which includes the neighborhoods of Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, and Bed-Stuy - has experienced a 20% loss in its Black population. In neighboring communities across the city, the same housing and affordability crisis wreaking havoc in traditionally Black neighborhoods is actively undermining the wellbeing of all poor and working class communities across the five boroughs. In the last two decades, the city and state have taken outwardly hostile stances toward our most vulnerable tenants and moderate and low-income homeowners, worsening economic strain and deepening housing instability. Understanding, then, the mechanisms driving the affordability crisis and enacting meaningful solutions--those that adequately address the material needs of our most vulnerable neighbors \u2014 is critical. [Crystal's Corner: Accountability matters. Why do we exempt the worst landlords?](https://www.brooklynpaper.com/oped-crystals-corner-accountability-why-exempt-worst-landlords/) Brooklyn Paper, January 20, 2023 Every New Yorker knows there are a handful of fundamental truths about living in the greatest city in the world: Times Square should be avoided at all costs, we have the best bagels, and your landlord is probably terrible. Horror stories of persistent leaks, ceiling collapses, and rodent infestations are all too common. To be clear, big, corporate landlords with several multi-unit buildings are disproportionately the problem, not smaller independent landlords who rely on rental incomes to get by. [Op-Ed | Crystal's Corner: 311 is good.

I'm as local as it gets. My team and I see it all, and more: Noise complaints. Evictions. Alternate-side parking. Public safety. Sanitation. Our mission, since we've been in office together, is to make city government and its resources more accessible, reliable, and responsive to the needs of all our neighbors. Consider Ms. Mobley. At ninety-six years old, she's lived in Fort Greene for more than seven decades. After living in the same apartment all those years, she decided it was time to downsize. Moving around her home was difficult, and getting to her appointments became taxing. Yet, Ms. Mobley remains an independent woman, continuing to do the things that keep her happy, healthy, and thriving. She came to us seeking something that is too frequently denied to older New Yorkers across the five boroughs, and that is the opportunity to [ age in place](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-nyc-aging-not-ready-20220915-6yfsrsyupvcubal7pozw3fzdaq-story.html) affordably, with dignity and comfort in the city we call home.

Its effects are not only unquestionably tangible today but also a harbinger of crises to come. Presently, skyrocketing rents undermine the health and wellbeing of our communities, forcing scores of long-time residents out of the neighborhoods they've long called home and making our city uninhabitable for the millions of poor and working class, Black and Brown New Yorkers continually pushed into the margins of society. But have you considered the effects this crisis has on older New Yorkers \u2014 those living on a fixed income, those with mobility limitations or chronic illness, those living close to the loved ones that care for them, or those who simply want to age in place in the comfort of their own homes?

Once you get there, you work for 24 hours straight but only get paid for 13 because of an archaic state law. And you're forced to go into work during a global pandemic even if you're not feeling well. Odds are you'd likely join the millions of workers who are voluntarily quitting their jobs and try your luck finding a new one. But many workers don't have that choice. News [Dense Housing, Job Creation Prioritized in Community-Led Plan for Atlantic Avenue Rezoning](https://www.brownstoner.com/development/atlantic-avenue-rezoning-community-report/) Anna Bradley-Smith, Brownstoner, August 30, 2023 A report released Tuesday by Crown Heights Council Member Crystal Hudson and the Department of City Planning details how locals want to see development play out around an industrial corridor of Atlantic Avenue largely in Crown Heights. If adopted, it would lead to a dramatic transformation of the area with new mixed-used but largely residential high-rise developments. The Atlantic Avenue Mixed-Use Plan Community Vision and Priorities 2023 report springboards off the more than decade-old Community Board 8-led M-CROWN rezoning plan, which sought to protect manufacturing and jobs in the largely industrial area between Vanderbilt and Nostrand avenues and Bergen Street while allowing for some residential development. [Brooklynites Push for Safer Streets, Affordable Housing in Atlantic Avenue Rezoning](https://commercialobserver.com/2023/08/brooklynites-push-for-safer-streets-affordable-housing-in-atlantic-avenue-rezoning/) Rebecca Baird-Remba, Commercial Observer, August 30, 2023 The desires of long-suffering residents in one of Brooklyn's fastest gentrifying neighborhoods are finally being heard. After several months of meetings about rezoning the industrial borderlands of Crown Heights and Prospect Heights for residential development, the Department of City Planning has released a report detailing what central Brooklynites want from the city as part of the process, including pedestrian upgrades along Atlantic Avenue, better homeless services and more affordable housing. The project \u2014 formerly known as M-CROWN but now called the Atlantic Avenue Mixed-Use Plan (AAMUP) \u2014 hopes to transform 13 blocks between Atlantic Avenue, Vanderbilt Avenue and Nostrand Avenue from a mix of low-slung commercial buildings and retail into housing, green space and modern commercial, industrial and community facility spaces. \"The AAMUP rezoning has been a long time in the making,\" said Crystal Hudson, the City Council member representing Brooklyn's District 35. \"For more than a decade, the community surrounding Atlantic Avenue has called for a new vision for this dangerous corridor that delivers more deeply affordable housing, increased investments in the area's local economy, safer streets, and greater consideration of local infrastructure needs.\" [Affordable housing for homeless, low income seniors will take over city-owned parking lot in Prospect Heights](https://www.brooklynpaper.com/affordable-housing-for-homeless-low-income-seniors-will-take-over-city-owned-parking-lot-in-prospect-heights/) Ximena Del Cerro, Brooklyn Paper, August 17, 2023 In with the new. As New York City faces an ongoing housing crisis, a parking lot that sits in Prospect Heights keeping a handful of cars owned by the city off the street, will become a housing development for homeless and low-income seniors. The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development selected Jobe Development Corp. to convert the 17,145 square-foot parking lot on 542 Dean St. into an all-affordable housing development. Given the location, the new homes will be connected to health and wellness amenities, social services, community facilities and open recreational spaces. The redevelopment is part of the Atlantic Avenue Mixed-Use Plan. Neighboring blocks in Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant will feature new developments with housing, retail, commercial and industrial spaces \u2014 and safer, more pedestrian-friendly streets. During the community outreach for AAMUP, Crown Heights and Bed-Stuy residents indicated a desire that the city prioritize creating 100% affordable housing on public, city-owned sites, according to HPD. Terms of purpose for HPD developments will last for at least 30 years.

City lawmakers also voted for a separate bill barring the city from cooperating with out-of-state investigations related to gender-affirming care, [backing up](https://gaycitynews.com/new-york-state-trans-safe-haven-bill-nyc/) an executive order signed by Mayor Eric Adams last month and complementing a state-based law of the same nature that was signed by Governor Kathy Hochul on Pride Sunday in New York City. The New York City Council on July 13 voted to approve two pieces of legislation intended to protect transgender individuals, including a bill requiring the Department of Correction to report on information pertaining to trans people in custody. The DOC bill, which passed out of the Health Committee on July 13 in unanimous fashion, was approved by the full City Council later that same day. The legislation requires the DOC to report on information pertaining to those in custody whose gender identity is not aligned with the one they were assigned at birth. The legislation stipulates that the DOC must report on housing placements as well as when individuals request to be housed in accordance with their gender identity but are rejected. The bill calls for the commissioner to submit the report \u2014 which would contain information including the number of trans people in custody and their housing settings \u2014 to the mayor, the City Council speaker, and the public advocate, and to post it online. [Street in Crown Heights co-named after 'Carnival Queen' Joyce Quamina](https://www.caribbeanlife.com/street-in-crown-heights-co-named-after-carnival-queen-joyce-quamina/) Nelson King, Caribbean Life, June 28, 2023 In picture-perfect weather, family, friends, carnival organizers and lovers, soca artistes and elected officials were on hand Saturday for the co-naming ceremony of a street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn after renowned Trinidadian \"Carnival Queen\" Joyce Quamina, a long-standing treasurer of the Brooklyn-based West Indian-American Day Carnival Association (WIADCA), organizer of the annual, massive West Indian American Day Carnival Parade on Brooklyn's Eastern Parkway. The street at President Street and Nostrand Avenue was co-named Joyce Quamina's Way after a 1 \u00bd-hour-long ceremony at the corner of President Street and Nostrand Avenue that featured, among other things, speeches, soca and steelpan music, costume displays and Stilt Dancers. Quamina, one of the former stalwart executive members of WIADCA and a long-time Brooklyn resident, died on March 1, 2022 - incidentally, the same day as \"Carnival Tuesday\" in Trinidad and Tobago - at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital in Oceanside, Long Is., her only daughter Michelle Quamina told Caribbean Life. She was 85. City Council Member Crystal Hudson, the representative for the 35th Council District that encompasses Crown Heights, described Quamina as \"a titan in her field who was known and beloved by many in Crown Heights and across Brooklyn.\" But Hudson, the daughter of Jamaican and Honduran immigrants, first thanked pre-eminent Grenadian-born entertainment promoter Derek Ventour, a Brooklyn resident, \"who has shepherded this co-naming from start to finish. \"He presented before Community Board 9, worked with my staff to collect all the information necessary, and is a major reason we are all here today,\" she said. \"Please show Derek some love.\" Hudson said \"there may have been no single individual who embodied this (Caribbean culture and heritage) more than Joyce, our 'Carnival Queen'.

The renaming process, meant to honor people who have made \"extraordinary\" contributions to a community for 10 years, was hugely expedited, Council Member Crystal Hudson told to News 12. The process that normally takes two to three years took only 6 months. Quamina, who died in 2022 at 85-years-old, is credited with spearheading beloved local traditions, like Children's Carnival, and a steelband fundraiser and Brooklyn's Boys and Girls High School.

The package of four bills - which also included a measure that would create a task force to consider reparations - comes just ahead of Juneteenth and as the state continues to wrestle with how to address the lingering impacts of slavery and systemic racism. Even in New York City, the vestiges of slavery can be found all over the five boroughs. For example, Stuyvesant High School, Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village and Bedford-Stuyvesant are named for Peter Stuyvesant, a prominent figure in city history who enslaved 15 to 30 people in the 17th century.

[Council member, advocates criticize reduced city funding for senior meals](https://www.cityandstateny.com/personality/2023/05/council-member-advocates-criticize-reduced-city-funding-senior-meals/386051/) Annie McDonough, City & State, May 8, 2023 New York City Mayor Eric Adams has consistently said that his citywide savings initiatives - known as Programs to Eliminate the Gap - have been achieved without layoffs, furloughs or cutting services. How, then, do these plans achieve billions in savings? One strategy is vacancy reductions, in which agencies eliminate currently vacant positions, sometimes in large numbers. In the latest round of budget cuts included in Adams' executive budget for fiscal year 2024, city agencies more frequently identified savings through cost \"re-estimates,\" defined as an agency spending less on a program or service because it cost less than they expected. But ahead of a new round of City Council budget hearings set to begin on Monday, some council members and advocates are arguing that some of those re-estimates could threaten the city's ability to adequately provide a service that New Yorkers rely on - meal programs for older New Yorkers.

Fitzsimmons, The New York Times, February 17, 2023 In the summer of 2020, New York's progressive movement looked more robust than ever before. The murder of George Floyd by the police led activists to occupy City Hall Park for a month and prompted the City Council to pass a budget that called for $1 billion in cuts to the New York Police Department. It quickly became voguish for Democratic politicians, especially in New York City, to proclaim their progressive bona fides \u2014 and suddenly everybody was aligning themselves with the left. So leaders of the City Council's Progressive Caucus decided they needed to establish a litmus test: a \"statement of principles\" that called for a commitment to a lengthy agenda including universal early childhood education, affordable housing and, most controversially, a reduction in the Police Department at a time when major crime rose by 22 percent last year.
