No, essential oils aren't magic and you won't drop 30 pounds in 30 days, but by ingesting, diffusing or applying essential oils topically, you can promote weight loss by giving your body the tools that it needs to burn fat, lesson cravings, and increase stamina to stay physically active. Here are five essential oils that, along with a healthy diet and exercise, can promote positive weight loss and vitality. 1. Peppermint Oil Not only does peppermint oil boost energy levels, it can also help soothe sore muscles, minimize recovery time and help you get back to working out sooner. Research published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition found that ingesting peppermint oil with water enhanced exercise performance in male athletes by relaxing the bronchial smooth muscles and increasing the ventilation and brain oxygen concentrations. Peppermint can help you power through a tough workout without getting out of breath as quickly. Peppermint is a natural energy booster that reduces fatigue and improves focus. It also reduces hunger cravings and can help you to feel full faster. Peppermint oil has a cooling sensation when you use it topically, so just rubbing one to two drops into your temples and behind your neck can give you the energy and pain relief you need. You can also diffuse peppermint oil for a quick energy boost; Add five to 10 drops to bathwater to soothe achy muscles; add one to two drops to a glass of water; or even mix in a couple drops with your toothpaste before brushing. 2. Lemon Oil Research shows that breathing in the scent of lemon essential oil improves the neurological activity that promotes the breakdown of body fat. Lemon oil actually has both stimulating and calming properties, and it promotes a positive mood, which can be extremely helpful when you are working to reach your weight-loss goals. It also enhances the body's detoxification capabilities and supports healthy digestion. Try adding two to three drops of lemon oil to water, salad dressing or a smoothie, or you can diffuse it at home or at work. If you are feeling groggy during the day, inhale lemon oil directly from the bottle for a quick pick-me-up. 3. Grapefruit Grapefruit essential oil helps to activate enzymes in the body that work to break down body fat. Grapefruit benefits weight loss because it contains compounds like D-limonene, which helps to support your metabolism and cleanse your lymphatic glands so they can carry nutrients between the tissues and the bloodstream. Studies also show that using grapefruit oil affects autonomic nerves, which regulate important body functions like heart rate and digestion, and reduce appetite and body weight. To use grapefruit oil for weight loss, add two to three drops to a glass of water, diffuse it in your home or office, or massage two to three drops onto your chest and wrists when a craving strikes. 4. Ginger One of the most important benefits of ginger essential oil is its ability to support digestion and the absorption of nutrients. By improving the absorption of the vitamins and minerals that you're consuming, ginger oil is supporting the body's cellular energy and, in effect, promoting weight loss. A key compound in ginger oil, called gingerol, also effectively reduces inflammation in the body and possesses antioxidant activity. This process naturally reduces pain and swelling, which helps keep you active and burning more calories. Add one to two drops of ginger essential oil to tea or a green smoothie for the best results. You can also diffuse ginger at home or work, inhale the oil directly from the bottle or apply two to three drops topically to the stomach area after eating. 5. Cinnamon Cinnamon oil helps to balance blood sugar levels, thereby aiding weight loss and reducing sugar cravings. When your blood sugar levels are unstable, you may find yourself overeating and gaining weight. Plus, when your energy levels are low, it's difficult to exercise and burn calories. Using cinnamon oil will help reverse these issues that are standing in your way and, as an added bonus, cinnamon oil serves as a cardio protective agent that reduces the risk of heart disease and inflammation.
