Our Mission The Spirit Seed is a community where magic meets medicine. It is a place where we gather to learn the soul medicine that was once passed down like old recipes, and bring healing to our families, our communities, our clients, and ourselves. Whether we are licensed wellness professionals, or the one our families call when they need soul support, we all have an important role play in healing ourselves and our communities. At this critical time in the world, we are invited to expand our awareness. We are remembering how to honor the magic of spirit, and the wisdom of nature. We are paying attention to our deepest desires. We are facing our fears. We are reaching for our dreams. We are leaning on one another. We are agents of change. Come discover how to make this sacred medicine your own. Because magic is our birthright. Because we ARE the ones we've been waiting for, and the best is yet to come! \"When I was first introduced to The Spirit Seed School, my only intention was to learn more about flower essence therapy for my own healing. I wanted to know more about the beautiful magic blends that have been supporting me since 2020. I had no idea, that months later, I would be pursuing flower essence practitioner certification! Lindsay Fauntleroy is a gifted and wise teacher. She has the ability to take an abstract concept and break it down into a practical wisdom. I have taken five courses in The Spirit Seed School and each one builds on the last. I cannot wait to dive in even more! I am forever grateful to Lindsay and her ancestors for creating such a wonderful learning space, welcoming people from all walks of life. Thank you Lindsay & thank you to The Spirit Seed!\" \u2014 Ivy A.
