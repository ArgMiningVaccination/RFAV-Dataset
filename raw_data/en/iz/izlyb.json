In 2008 we established a framework for tackling Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage, with six ambitious targets to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. These targets were agreed with all states and territories through the Council of Australian Gover nments. As part of this framework, we have provided unpr ecedented levels of investment, underpinned by a series of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander -specific and mainstream National Partnership Agreements between the Australian, state and territory governments. This work is beginning to make a difference to the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This year's Closing the Gap Report shows we are on track to achieve our tar get on under-five mortality by 2018 and we ar e continuing our efforts to close the gap in life expectancy . As part of our ef forts to close the gap, since 2011, the Australian Government has worked with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to pr oduce this National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan, providing an opportunity to collaboratively set out a 10 year plan for the dir ection of Indigenous health policy. No plan will succeed without a robust partnership, particularly between the Australian Gover nment and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community organisations and their peak bodies. This Health Plan has been developed in partnership with all these groups, a partnership that has been over twelve months in the making. The National Congress of Australia's First Peoples has provided a critical role through the National Heath Leadership Forum in ensuring input and feedback into the development of this Health Plan. Partnerships require effort and commitment as we work to find common MInIsteR's F o R e W o RD 23 ground. I am very grateful for the courage and contribution that the National Health Leadership Forum and others provided in the development of this Health Plan. Our vision is bold - we want to close the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health inequality . In order to make a difference over the next decade there are some things that we need to continue to hold firm on. There are also new agendas that we need to embed. Finally, we need to be able to respond to new and emerging challenges - things as yet unseen. There are a number of things that we must continue to do. We need to continue to address the pressing social inequality and determinants of health that are so pivotal to long term health impr ovements. In this Health Plan we place priority on social and emotional wellbeing and the issues that impact on it including alcohol and other drugs. Because we know that health outcomes are life outcomes that are af fected by a broad range of factors, we have a comprehensive approach to tackling health inequality through each of the Closing the Gap building blocks. This Health Plan builds on that approach. We also need to drive health system impr ovements and maintain a clear priority on primary health care system reform. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled health services will continue to be supported to fulfil their pivotal role in improving Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander health outcomes. Research and data will be needed to build our evidence- based practice and policy. I am also very clear that we will need to open up new agendas for change. This Health Plan pr ovides a clear focus on strategies to address racism and to empower people to take control of their own health. While we need to continue to str engthen healthcare we also need to enhance our focus on specialist care and hospital care in the secondary and tertiary systems. It is also important to place great emphasis on building pathways into the health professions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This Health Plan also provides a focus on the wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with a disability, young people and for healthy ageing. As such it builds on our commitment to new Closing the Gap targets, including our new target aimed at increasing access to services for Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander people with disability. Importantly , in this Health Plan we signal the need to expand our focus on children's health to br oader issues in child development. We have much more work to do in developing robust r esearch and data systems. I am also resolved that we will tackle the difficult and distressing issues of violence, abuse and self-harm. As always, the Government remains committed to fearless accountability and we will be r eporting annually on progress against measures and targets aligned to this Health Plan. Our implementation plans and their associated strategies will respond to new challenges and pr ovide the detailed architecture to meet the challenge and vision that we have set ourselves. THE HON W ARREN SNOWDON MP MINISTER FOR INDIGENOUS HEALTH 4In 2008 Australian Governments committed to work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on an incredibly important task - to achieve equality in health status and life expectancy between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous Australians by the year 2031. The commitment - in the form of the Close the Gap Statement of Intent - cr eates the platform for this National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan, which has been developed in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their r epresentatives. This Health Plan provides a long-term, evidence-based policy framework as part of the overarching Council of Australian Gover nments' (COAG) approach to Closing the Gap in Indigenous disadvantage, which has been set out in the National Indigenous Reform Agr eement (NIRA) signed in 2008. The NIRA has established a framework of national targets and policy building blocks. Two of the Closing the Gap targets, to halve the gap in child mortality by 2018 and close the life expectancy gap by 2031, go directly to health outcomes, while others addr ess social determinants of health such as education and employment. The Health Plan builds on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It adopts a strengths-based approach to ensure policies and programs improve health, social and emotional wellbeing, and resilience and promote positive health behaviours. It emphasises the centrality of culture in the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the rights of individuals to a safe, healthy and empowered life. The Health Plan also builds on existing strategies and planning approaches to improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, outlined at Appendix A. The Health Plan also aligns with other gover nments' plans and strategies which support better health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, including the National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (NSFATSIH) 2003-13. It will PReFACe5also link in with the other arrangements currently being negotiated or implemented, such as the r enewing of the National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health Outcomes. The Health Plan is central to the Australian Gover nment's targeted approach to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can enjoy the same standard of health as other Australians. The 10-year life of this Health Plan comes at a critical time in ongoing efforts to close the gap, during which our collective efforts must be targeted to ensure the best outcomes can be realised. To help achieve this, the Australian Government undertakes to: continue working across governments and sectors to close the gap in Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander disadvantage; invest in making health systems accessible, culturally safe and appropriate, effective and r esponsive for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; and support good health and wellbeing across the life course, and continue to target risk factors at key life stages. The different stages of life provide strategic points of intersection between health, mental health and social and emotional wellbeing, and provide a patient-centred platform for dif ferent agencies, organisations, government, stakeholders and representative bodies to work together to plan and deliver better coordinated and focused programs. The different life stages also provide an opportunity to focus on specific health priorities and reduce health inequalities at the point at which they are most likely to occur. Sustained improvement to the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people requires system-level action across the health system and the social determinants of health. Implementation of this Health Plan will ensure that progress towards health equality can be monitor ed over time. Implementation plans, subsequently developed, will set progress targets which will be aligned to established best practice and respond to new and emerging needs. The Australian Government commits to developing a Commonwealth cross- sectoral implementation plan and will work with each state and territory government to develop implementation plans that align with the Commonwealth's implementation plan. Individuals, families, communities and their representatives, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled health or ganisations and mainstream health service pr oviders are encouraged to align their strategic planning to the principles and priorities and publicly report on how their activities are achieving the goals and vision of this Health Plan. The Australian Government further commits to public reporting on the Australian Government's pr ogress in meeting this Health Plan's policy objectives, through a high-level annual report to the Australian Parliament and detailed bi-annual r eporting through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Performance Framework (Health Performance Framework).HeAltH PlAn A t A Gl A n C e 67IMP leMentAtIon PG. 39-41 IMPleMentAtIon M on I to RI n G ACC ount A b I l I tyPRInCIPles PG. 10-11 PRIoRItIes PG. 14-38HeAltH equ AlIty A n D A u MA n RIGH ts APPR o ACHAbo RIGI n A l A n D t o RR es st RAIt Isl A n D e R C o MM un I ty C ont R ol A n D en GAG e M entP AR tne R s HIP A CC ount A b I l I ty continually striving to improve accessibility, appropriateness and impact a robust, strong, vibrant and effective community controlled health sector based on the best possible evidence free of racism and inequality supported by housing, education, employment and other programs focused on eliminating the causes of health inequalityindividuals and communities actively engage in decision making and controlsocial and emotional wellbeing as a central platform for prevention and clinical careolder people are able to live out their lives as active, healthy, culturally secure and comfortable as possiblemothers and babies get the best possible care and support for a good start to life growth and development of children lays the basis for long, healthy lives youth get the services and support they need to thrive and grow into healthy young adults adults have the health care, support and resources to manage their health and have long, productive livesVIsIon The Australian health system is free of racism and inequality and all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have access to health services that are effective, high quality, appropriate and affordable.

ReCoGnItIon stAteMent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are the first people of Australia. The culture of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is dynamic and continues to evolve and develop in response to historical and contemporary circumstances. The Australian Government recognises that dispossession, interruption of culture and inter generational trauma have significantly impacted on the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and that they share a continuing legacy of resilience, str ength and determination. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities are diverse, including gender, age, languages, backgrounds, sexual orientations, r eligious beliefs, family responsibilities, marriage status, life and work e xperiences, personality and educational levels. The Australian Government accepts and acknowledges difference and diversity among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and values the contributions that all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make to generating new ideas and innovative solutions to improve health. stRAteGIC F RAM e W o R ktHe CentRAlIty o F Cultu Re A n D W ellbe I n G I n t H e H e A lt H o F Abo RIGI n A l A n D t o RR es s t RAI t Isl A n D e R P eo P le \"We represent the oldest continuous culture in the world, we are also diverse and have managed to persevere despite the odds because of our adaptability, our survival skills and because we represent an evolving cultural spectrum inclusive of traditional and contemporary practices. At our best, we bring our traditional principles and practices - respect, generosity, collective benefit, collective ownership - to our daily expression of our identity and culture in a contemporary context. When we are empowered to do this, and where systems facilitate this reclamation, protection and promotion, we are healthy, well and successful and our communities thrive.\"1 Professor Ngiare Brow N Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people view health in a holistic context as reflected in the holistic definition of health contained within the National Aboriginal Health Strategy (1989): \"'Aboriginal health' means not just the physical wellbeing of an individual but refers to the social, emotional and cultural wellbeing of the whole Community in which each individual is able to achieve their full potential as a human being, thereby bringing about the total wellbeing of their Community. It is a whole-of- life view and includes the cyclical concept of life-death-life.\" 2 There is a wealth of evidence that supports the positive associations of health, education and employment outcomes as well as general wellbeing with language and culture.3 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages are inseparable from culture, and form the foundation for learning and interacting pr oductively with others.Wellbeing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people incorporates broader issues of social justice, equity and rights. The significance of culture to wellbeing, and therefore good health, is also demonstrated by using traditional knowledge and the practices of traditional healers, which are adapted by many people for complementary use with western science in an integrated health care system. Culture can influence Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's decisions about when and why they should seek health services, their acceptance of treatment, the likelihood of adherence to treatment and follow up, and the likely success of prevention and health pr omotion strategies. Ensuring that health services and providers are culturally competent will lead to more effective health service delivery and better health outcomes. Culture, in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander context, needs to be differentiated from the excessive behaviours which can have a detrimental effect on the health and wellbeing of people, their families and communities. These excessive behaviours have no basis in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. Indeed it is the restoration and continuation of cultures which provide both the reason for change, and the pathway for securing it. 910PRInCIPles The following principles inform the approach of this Health Plan. He A lt H e qu A l I ty A n D A Hu MA n R IGH ts A PPR o ACH The principles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and other human rights instruments support Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander people in attaining the highest standard of physical and mental and social health. \"The right to health is not to be understood as a right to be healthy. This cannot be guaranteed by governments. A human rights-based approach to health is about providing equal opportunities to be healthy, it's about participation and progressive realisation.\"4 Mr Mick gooda A rights-based approach is about providing equal opportunities for health by ensuring availability, accessibility , acceptability and quality health services. This frames both policy development and the development of goals and targets. A human rights approach helps highlight additional risks and opportunities for health and wellbeing pr ograms before any final decisions are made. In this way, a rights-aware approach is not necessarily about more services, but about better services through better informed policy, practice and service delivery decisions, and the pr ocesses that enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to participate in all levels of health care decision-making. Constitutional recognition is seen by many Australians as a pivotal and desirable reform which provides the constitutional architecture upon which strategies for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health gain can be mobilised. The Australian Government is committed to pursuing meaningful change in the Australian Constitution - change that unites the nation and reflects the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Stewar dship of health is the responsibility of each person to whom health has been entrusted. Cr eating the personal, environmental, and social conditions for good health is a joint r esponsibility\u2014public, community, private, gover nment, organisation and individual. Abo RIGI n A l A n D t o RR es s t RAI t Isl A n D e R Co MM un I ty Cont R ol A n D e n GAG e M ent There is a full and ongoing participation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and organisations in all levels of decision-making affecting their health needs. \"Health issues must be addressed at a community level. The community needs to control its health services so that they are concentrated on the important issues in that community.\" 5 alyawarr iNgkerr-we Nh aBorigi Nal c or P oratio N Through community consultations, individuals and communities voiced their desire to be involved in the service planning, design and implementation of policies to support their health and wellbeing. In order to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to participate, Gover nment must grow more opportunities for engagement and collaboration with individuals, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community contr olled health organisations and other health and related services. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community contr olled health organisations provide unique contributions in delivering holistic, compr ehensive and culturally appropriate health car e. All services delivering primary health care at the local, regional and state levels should seek to optimise their engagement and involvement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to impr ove health outcomes.PARtneRsHIP Partnership and shar ed ownership between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, Governments and service providers operates at all levels of health planning and delivery. \"We are witnessing a new and exciting era...the burgeoning of a new relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, including governments, based on respect and partnerships. Now is the time to capitalise on the momentum and move forward together.\"6 dr toM calMa, ao Working in partnerships to remove barriers to good health and building the evidence around health interventions is critical for improving the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander people. Partnerships also pr ovide a mechanism to effectively engage with communities on their goals and priorities for health. The Australian Government will seek to partner with state and territory governments and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their representatives to implement the priorities outlined in this Health Plan to ensure that its implementation will meet the diverse needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians of all ages, backgrounds and locations. These priorities were derived from the feedback r eceived through the consultation process, written submissions and other evidence. A CC ount A b I l I ty Structures are in place for the regular monitoring and review of implementation as measured against indicators of success, with processes to share knowledge on what works. \"This is the future of reconciliation and it has to involve all Australians in closing the unacceptable gap in life expectancy. So let us now be prepared to focus ourselves on this task, and to be measured and accountable on the success of our efforts.\" 7 Professor Mick dodso N, aM This Health Plan will direct future action. Implementation arrangements will be developed by the Australian Government and each state and territory government in the context of their tar geted activity. The non-government sector will be encouraged to demonstrate their commitment to action by aligning their strategic planning to include reference to this Health Plan. The Australian Government is committed to high quality monitoring and evaluation, and to public accountability for its efforts to close the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. Pr ogress targets for the Health Plan will be developed using best practice methods8 which ar e specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound. In support of this, the Health Plan will include the development of high quality measur ement systems - which align reporting systems, data development priorities and target setting with strategic priorities. Further details on accountability and monitoring mechanisms are provided in the 'Implementation' section of this document. 11tHe so CIAl D ete RMI n A nts o F H e A lt H\"It is important to address the social and cultural determinants of health as there are many drivers of ill health that lie outside the direct responsibility of the health sector.\"9 close the gaP steeri Ng coMMittee su BM issio N GoAl Ef fective strategies that address environmental, economic and social inequalities which are pivotal to achieve health equality. This requires action across key social determinants such as health, housing, education, employment, the alignment of program goals across sectors of government and the development of collaborative cross-sectoral pr ograms at a local level. Context Between one third and one half of the life expectancy gap may be explained by differences in the social determinants of health.10 They affect the health of people and can also influence how a person interacts with health and other services. For example, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults are less likely to smoke if they have completed Year 12, are employed and have higher incomes.11 Additionally, higher levels of education are associated with healthier lifestyle choices and improved health literacy . Alternatively, rheumatic heart disease is associated with environmental factors such as poverty and poor living conditions, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will r emain at risk while socioeconomic disadvantage and barriers to accessing health care persist. Research has demonstrated associations between an individual's social and economic status and their health.12 For example, poor education and literacy are linked to low income and poor health status (e.g. ear disease), and af fect the capacity of people to use health information; poverty reduces access to health car e services and medicines; overcrowded and run-down housing associated with poverty contributes to the spread of communicable 12disease; and smoking and high-risk behaviour is associated with lower socio-economic status.13 Where a person lives also contributes to health, with isolation in remote and very remote communities reducing access to services. The health sector also has a role in realising necessary improvements in education and employment outcomes. For example, chronic ear disease negatively affects the education attainment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander school children, and poor health explains 42.7 per cent of the known gap in labour force participation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males and 13.9 per cent of the gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females in non-r emote locations.14 Improvements in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's health requires an integrated appr oach encompassing the strengthening of community functioning, reinforcing positive behaviours, improving education participation, r egional economic development, housing and envir onmental health, and spiritual healing. It is vital for communities and individuals to have the ability and freedom to be empowered and able to translate their capability (knowledge, skills, understanding) into action. While acknowledging that there is a growing level of education and affluence for some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, generally the relative socio-economic disadvantage experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people compared to non-Indigenous Australians means they are more likely to be exposed to behavioural and environmental health risk factors because a higher proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander households live in conditions that do not support good health.15 The need to progress action across all these r elated areas has been recognised by all gover nments in the Closing the Gap framework - the building blocks and targets focus efforts on key areas of disadvantage and provide a framework for ongoing action to improve outcomes across social determinants of health.The targets under the Closing the Gap framework are: close the life expectancy gap within a generation (by 2031); halve the gap in mortality rates for i ndigenous children under five within a decade (by 2018); ensure all i ndigenous four-year-olds in remote communities have access to early childhood education within five years (by 2013); halve the gap for i ndigenous students in reading, writing and numeracy within a decade (by 2018); halve the gap for i ndigenous people aged 20-24 in year 12 attainment or equivalent attainment rates (by 2020); and halve the gap in employment outcomes between i ndigenous and non- i ndigenous a ustralians within a decade (by 2018). k ey s t RA te G I es to ACHI e V e t HI s Go A l Governments work together across all building blocks to: >leverage existing frameworks and strategies to achieve the Closing the Gap targets; >take action acr oss key social determinants such as health, housing, education and employment; and >align pr ogram goals across sectors of government.

Context Racism is a key social determinant of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and can deter people from achieving their full capabilities, by debilitating confidence and self-worth which in turn leads to poorer health outcomes. Evidence suggests that racism experienced in the delivery of health services contributes to low levels of access to health services by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.18 There are a number of pathways from racism to ill-health - experiences of discrimination, linked with poor self-assessed health status, psychological distress, depression and anxiety, and health risk behaviours such as smoking and alcohol and substance misuse. Experiences of racism are compounded by the traumatic legacy of colonisation, forced removals and other past government discriminatory policies. The consequences of these events have been profound, creating historical disadvantage that has been passed from one generation to the next.19key stRAteGIes to ACHI eVe tHIs Go Al Imp lement the National Anti-Racism Strategy 2010-2020.

Context Effective health systems contribute to improved health outcomes. They need to be: tailored to individual health needs; clinically effective; accessible and culturally competent; integrated into a system of care where needs ar e complex; and well governed, cost effective, evidence-based and accountable. Australia has a world class health system that is not accessed equally by all Australians accor ding to need. The data shows that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people access health services at 1.1 times the rate of non-Indigenous Australians even though their need for health services is estimated to be 2-3 times higher due to their poorer health status. Evidence also indicates that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are receiving fewer procedures and prescriptions than non- Indigenous Australians with the same health conditions.21 To reduce these inequalities, the next decade should continue to focus on improvements to clinical care, increased access to services, better use of evidence-based guidelines and reduced systemic racism. There will continue to be a need for complementary targeted programs to addr ess specific areas as well as investments in population-wide health interventions, such as strategies to reduce smoking rates. Thr ough the National Health Reform Agreement, the Australian Government and state and territory governments will deliver better health and better hospitals for the future, ensuring that all Australians can access the best health car e where and when they need it. Health r eform presents an opportunity to make the health system more responsive to the needs of all Australians, including Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander people. This will make a significant contribution to our efforts to close the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander life expectancy. As a result of many of the health r eforms, health services will be more in touch with communities and tailored to meet local needs to deliver improvements in health care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. A focus on the patient journey which meets the clinical health care needs as well as cultural and social needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their families will produce better health outcomes. This includes effective coor dination and integration between health service providers. The use of regional or placed-based approaches can also contribute to efficient and sustainable service delivery, based on economies of scale and sustainable service populations. This appr oach recognises the urban, regional, rural and remote diversity of Australia, particularly in those regions where geography, language, cultur e and behaviour may present obstacles to the effective access to and delivery of services. The development of regional infrastructure is needed to allow for effective planning and coor dination across services and the delivery of strategies targeted at local needs. Local services can potentially benefit from regionalised support for corporate support systems, quality and accreditation programs, and workforce development initiatives. In addition, effort to support transport options to health services is important, particularly in regional and remote communities. key stRAteGIes to ACHI eVe tHIs Go Al Continue ef forts under the Closing the Gap agenda and health reform to contribute to improved health outcomes.

Further effort is needed at the national, state and territory and local level to improve data collection, availability , quality and analysis. Under -identification of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people hampers the effective monitoring of health outcomes and more work must continue to be done to address these barriers. Health services and professionals need to foster culturally supportive and culturally safe environments to ensure Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander patients feel comfortable identifying. This needs to be complemented by appr oaches to address systemic racism within the health system. New and innovative mechanisms are enabling better access to information and resources that support evidence-based practice and decision making including data linkage methods, impr oved information management systems, the e-health infrastructure connecting the health system, patient-controlled electronic health r ecords and web-based reporting of national Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and other information. Further, many of these technologies place the individual at the centre of their own healthcare by enabling access to health information and engaging personally with their health management. At the national level, mechanisms are in place to share important learnings. The Closing the Gap Clearinghouse collects, analyses and synthesises research and evaluation on what works to close the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage. The Lowitja Institute, Australia' s National Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Research, is dedicated to achieving equity in health outcomes thr ough innovative, collaborative and inclusive research and knowledge transfer. Through the Clearinghouse and the Lowitja Institute, policy makers, service providers, academics and the public have access to a continually growing evidence base about addressing Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander health and disadvantage. Supporting skill development to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to actively participate in and conduct research r elating to their own cultures is also important. It is recognised that many local services, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community contr olled health organisations, already contribute to the evidence base through local r esearch, cultural knowledge and data collection, analysis and evaluation. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should feel respected and valued throughout r esearch and evaluation activities and be pr ovided with an opportunity to access research findings in a culturally appropriate and relevant manner . The research process should be r egarded as an equal partnership recognising that the intellectual 'input' from communities is equally important as the intellectual 'output' by r esearchers.key stRAteGIes to ACHI eVe tHIs Go Al Continue ef forts to ensure the accuracy and consistency of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander data, including increased identification.

Social and emotional wellbeing strategies are integrated in all health care service delivery and health promotion strategies. Context Social and emotional wellbeing problems are distinct from mental illness, although the two interact and influence each other. Even with good social and emotional wellbeing people can still experience mental illness, and people with a long-term mental health condition can live and function at a high level with adequate support.24 Ment A l He A lt H The concept of mental health comes from an illness or clinical perspective and its focus is on the individual and their level of functioning in their envir onment.25 Ther e is no single experience of mental health conditions. While some people have only ever had one episode of mental illness, others have r ecurrent illness. Where mental illness cannot be prevented, effective clinical and non-clinical interventions can assist individuals in maximising their wellbeing.26 Mental health conditions are the principal reason for 7% of hospital admissions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, with rates highest in the 25-44 year age group.27 The risk of developing a mental illness is higher when a person is socially excluded and isolated or experiences poverty, neglect, abuse or trauma; misuses drugs or alcohol; is in poor physical health; or has a physical or intellectual disability .28 Alcohol and drug misuse can lead to violence or mental illness and also be a co-morbidity. Better supporting drug and alcohol treatment services and building their capacity to better identify and tr eat coinciding mental illness and substance misuse (co-morbidity) will help improve the health and social outcomes of Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander people with substance use issues including aiding recovery and reducing homelessness or the risk of homelessness and violence. The suicide rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for the period 2001-2010 were twice that of non-Indigenous Australians.29 Incar ceration can have a harmful effect on rates of suicide and self-harm. Prisoners are at heightened risk of suicide and overdose death in the immediate post-release period and therefore gr eater support is required during this period. While not all mental health illnesses are pr eventable, steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood that people at risk will go on to develop mental illness and that if they do, they will have better access to quality support and car e.30 National policy should promote positive mental health and address the determinants and risk factors associated with poor mental health. It should also focus on building the mental health and social and emotional wellbeing workforce, including increasing the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people working in this field, strengthening the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled health sector and developing the cultural competence of mainstream mental health services.soCIAl AnD eMotIonAl Wellbe InG Social and emotional wellbeing is a holistic concept which recognises the importance of connection to land, culture, spirituality, ancestry, family and community, and how these affect the individual. Social and emotional wellbeing can be affected by the social determinants of health including homelessness, education and unemployment and a broader range of problems r esulting from grief and loss, trauma and abuse, violence, removal from family and cultural dislocation, substance misuse, racism and discrimination and social disadvantage.31 It is important that policy approaches recognise the legacy of intergenerational trauma on social and emotional wellbeing. Social and emotional wellbeing is the foundation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander physical and mental health. It results from a network of r elationships between the individual, their family, and their kin and community. A positive sense of social and emotional wellbeing is essential for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to lead successful and fulfilling lives. Social and emotional wellbeing provides a foundation for ef fective health promotion strategies. Culture and cultural identity is critical to social and emotional wellbeing. Practicing culture can involve a living relationship with ancestors, the spiritual dimension of existence, and connection with traditional lands and languages. Individual and community control over their physical envir onment, dignity and self-esteem, respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's rights and a perception of just and fair treatment is also important to social and emotional wellbeing. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in contact with the criminal justice, detention and car e systems, incarceration can have a significant impact on health, particularly in regard to social and emotional wellbeing, with each period of contact interrupting education and employment opportunities, disrupting family life and confirming the normalcy of these outcomes. Issues with family separation and removal from one's homeland and culture can also have a detrimental impact on wellbeing. Impr ovement in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's social and emotional wellbeing r equires effort from all levels of government and acr oss sectors. Services at the local level should recognise the pr otective factors of culture, and the strong connection between culture and positive wellbeing, to help improve Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander people's access to timely and culturally appropriate mental health care. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families and communities should also be supported by services and programs that promote child development and effective parenting to foster healthy and resilient children. At the same time, it needs to be recognised that a person's choices may be limited by environmental factors which have a dramatic and negative impact on the social and emotional wellbeing of and within communities. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with poor social and emotional wellbeing are less likely to participate in employment, consume higher levels of alcohol and other substances and are also less likely to access health services. It is recognised that sport can play a role in str engthening an individual's self-esteem and dignity and can assist in connecting people to their local community and improving social and emotional wellbeing. 2122For thousands of years traditional healers have nurtured the physical, emotional and social wellbeing of their people. To increase understanding and encourage collaboration with mainstream health services and the wider community , in some communities, traditional healers have forged partnerships with health pr ofessionals and practitioners of western medicine. It is widely accepted that combining traditional treatments and western medicine is necessary for the wellbeing of the whole Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person, which leads to patients being more satisfied with the health services they receive. k ey s t RA te GI es to ACHI e V e t HI s Go A l Continue to implement the Roadmap for National Mental Health Reform 2012-2022, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Suicide Prevention Strategy 2013 and the renewed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social and Emotional Wellbeing Framework.

Continue support for counselling, health promotion and early intervention services to promote social and emotional wellbeing amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, including members of the Stolen Generations. Promote links across mental health and drug and alcohol services and continue to increase community awareness and education about the range of options for dealing with the impact of the use of drugs, both licit and illicit, and alcohol and tobacco.

Institutional and organisational structures and pr ocesses harness human and community capability and enhance its potential. Context Human and community capability encompasses: the need to invest in education, employment and other social determinants of health to cr eate a more equal playing field; systems that support communities and individuals to make informed choices and to participate in health planning and the delivery of services; a focus on workforce development to the benefit of individuals and health services; planning and governance structures and pr ocesses so communities can benefit and health services can work together to deliver impr oved outcomes; and impr oved health literacy across the community.Governance is one of the key ways in which human and community capability can be str engthened. It is important in improving service delivery and in raising the health and pr osperity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.33 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled health or ganisations are an important element of the health system and provide a mechanism for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to actively lead, develop, deliver and be accountable for culturally appropriate health services. Community governance also helps shape communities. The capability of the community, and community members, will be strengthened by supporting community decision-making and contr ol over health organisations, and building on people's skills, personal and collective contributions, and shared commitment to gover nance processes, goals and identity. It is recognised that aspects of community gover nance vary in different settings and it is ther efore important that differing traditions and cultur es are recognised and accommodated in a way that contributes to good community gover nance. There is strong leadership at the national level of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander r epresentative groups and organisations. This includes the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, incorporating the National Health Leadership Forum. There is also strong capability and leadership at the national level in mainstream health groups and organisations and through key bodies such as the National Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander Health Equality Council. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health pr ofessionals are essential to the delivery of culturally safe care, in primary health care settings with a focus on health promotion, health education, in specialist and other health services, and the engagement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in their own health. The employment of Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander health professionals also contributes to the development and maintenance 24of culturally safe workplaces and assists in addr essing institutionalised racism. Further, all health professionals delivering health care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have the capacity to influence health policy and health pr ofessional systems and contribute to health r esearch and infrastructure. The Review of Higher Education Access and Outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People has placed a high priority on the development of stronger and enhanced pathways for Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander people into the professions, including the health professions. According to the 2012 independent review of the Australian Government's Health Workforce Pr ograms, the most significant health workforce issue in some rural and remote areas is not one of total supply of health workforce but one of distribution of the workforce due to inadequate or non-existent service provision.34 Support for pathways to health careers in Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander health, and in rural and r emote areas, has multiple benefits including incr easing the education and economic participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander practitioners and health workers and the cultural competency of services. It is also recognised that this Health Plan, and contributions to the improvement of human capability within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, also extends to the private and not-for-profit sectors. There is already much philanthr opic and private investment underway in areas of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment, education and mentoring, and this Health Plan provides a framework for and encourages further future activity in this area. Health literacy is fundamental if people are to successfully manage their own health. A person' s ability to make informed health- related choices is determined by their ability to understand health information and their ability to negotiate the health care system. Access to education, particularly early childhood education opportunities, improves health literacy in an individual, and therefore their family and community.25key stRAteGIes to ACHI eVe tHIs Go Al Impr ove workforce capability through the continued implementation of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workforce Strategic Framework, including supporting the take-up of health careers and support for people working in the health and healing professions.

Context Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are thr ee per cent of the total Australian population, which has increased by 30 per cent from June 2006, with a birth rate which is 25 per cent higher than for non-Indigenous Australians. Sixty two per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are less than 30 years of age and just three per cent are aged 65 years and over , compared to 14 per cent of non-Indigenous Australians.36 The younger age profile of the Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander population requires a focus on well-designed and implemented antenatal car e and early childhood programs, along with ef fective interventions to support young adults to adopt healthy lives.37 However there will also be increases in the number of older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the coming decade. The key challenge here will be to deliver person-centred, culturally appropriate health care for older people that maximises their function and independence thr ough access to a flexible range of general and specialist health services. Applying a whole-of-life perspective recognises the different stages in life, highlights key transition periods for individuals and provides strategic points of intersection between health and mental health and social and emotional wellbeing. Addressing health risks earlier in the life span, through prevention and early intervention during developmentally sensitive 2627periods, provides greater returns for the r esources invested. A life course approach is necessary in order to address the inter- generational mechanisms that impact on health inequalities. For example, delays in child development impact on education progress which in later life can impact on employment and opportunities, and consequently reinforces the social inequalities that produce health inequalities in subsequent generations. HeAltH IMPAC ts ACR oss t He l IF e C ou R se There are a number of health conditions that significantly contribute to the disparity in the health status between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the non-Indigenous population. Interventions on these issues need to recognise the importance of a multi-layered appr oach to risk factor modification including system-level and community responses alongside programs targeted at individuals. The top seven risk factors that require a continued focus are illustrated below. Smoking leads to higher incidence of a number of diseases, including chronic lung disease, car diovascular disease and many forms of cancer . Obesity, which can result from the combination of poor nutrition and physical inactivity , increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. The nutritional status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is influenced by socio- economic disadvantage and geographical, envir onmental and social factors. While food supply can be more limited in rural and remote ar eas, including quality, variety and cost of fresh fruit and vegetables,39 food supply problems are also evident in urban poor communities. Violence and hospitalisations for injuries arising fr om assault are higher for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They also have three times the rate of road death and injury than other Australians, a result of lower seatbelt use and driving on lower-standard roads in vehicles with a lower safety standard. Alcohol is also often a factor in road crashes.

Such factors tend to be mor e prevalent where there are higher rates of unemployment, lower levels of income, poorer diet and living conditions, and poorer access to adequate healthcare. In addition to these risk factors, governments also need to focus on the greatest disparity wher e quality of life is significantly reduced. This includes fundamental issues such as eye, ear and oral hygiene and car e, and safe sexual health practices. The gap in life expectancy reflects differences in the age profile of deaths between Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous Australians. A very high percentage of deaths occur before the age of 65 years. The graph above shows the largest gaps between the populations are in the 0-4 age group followed by the middle years (35-39 years). An understanding of the impact of age at death helps direct policy to the issues facing the age groups most affected.The gap in potential years of life lost before age 65 years per 1,000 population between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous Australians, by age for 2007-11 (source: ABS mortality database (unpublished).

It is important for services to acknowledge and include men in the raising of children in a culturally appropriate way .45 Family and kinship define obligations and r esponsibilities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and are important elements in child rearing. At the individual level, health risk factors such as maternal smoking, alcohol and other drugs consumption by both parents, inadequate nutrition, stress, illness and infection can all disrupt the development of the child before birth and are associated (along with young maternal age) with low birth weight, which connects with long-term effects on learning and behaviour, and the development of chronic disease later in life. In particular, drinking alcohol while pregnant may r esult in a range of impairments and cognitive social and emotional dysfunction over the child's lifetime, otherwise known as foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).46 30MAteRnAl HeAltH AnD PAR ent I n G \"Birth weight is important\u2014in a sense, it is the first outcome.

Context Early childhood is when children develop a range of essential capabilities including social, emotional, language, cognitive and communication skills that provide the foundations for formal learning and relationships in later life. During the middle childhood period (appr oximately 6-10 years) physical and mental development occurs and learning and social behaviours are established. Health care in the early years (including good nutrition, immunisation and addressing threats to health such as tobacco smoke) are crucial for healthy physical and social development. Early engagement with parents, families and carers emphasises a whole of family responsibility for children's health, including the elders and grandpar ents. Positive role modelling by parents, families and carers encourages compassion, autonomy, self-r eliance and early learning. Early childhood development programs that include access to early childhood education, family support and parenting are a highly effective means of reducing health inequalities and providing additional life-long health benefits and educational and economic achievement. In addition, initiatives that facilitate a strong sense of identity and pride in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people can play a role in developing positive health and wellbeing. Negative role modelling around gambling, drinking and other substance misuse, as well as the absence of a mother or father due to incar ceration, can contribute to child abuse and neglect. When developing national childhood development policy, coordination must occur among health, education, housing, families, and community services agencies, and the non- government sector to address these system- wide issues. Envir onmental factors also impact on health and wellbeing. Programs to improve environmental health help prevent eye and ear health problems which are more prevalent in Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander communities.

Young people should have opportunities to contribute to policies and programs that impact on them. Adolescence and youth are key life stages with great personal change including physical development, the establishment of a sense of identity and values, and emotional development including relationships and aspirations for the futur e. It is also the age where health enablers, such as positive role models and healthy behaviours, as well as factors negatively impacting on health and wellbeing such as racism, discrimination and limited access to education and social services, affects self- perception and behaviours. Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people grow up in difficult circumstances, including living with the impacts of inter generational trauma and families and communities with lesser housing, education and employment opportunities. In some cir cumstances they may suffer from a disrupted home life and family disruption typified by alcohol and other substance abuse, welfare dependency , contact with the justice system and family violence. Rates of mental illness and suicide are also higher amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people compared to the broader Australian population. Developing resilience, str ong support networks, strong connection to culture, a sense of belonging and problem solving skills from an early age can help to pr omote positive mental health and wellbeing and act as protective factors against mental illness and suicide.

Programs and services at the community level need to support and continue to encourage healthy lifestyle behaviours, chronic disease pr evention and management, and social and emotional wellbeing. Responsive health systems as well as addressing system-wide determinants of health are critical. The use of the health system is greatest in this and the older age group, with more than half of all potentially preventable hospitalisations from chr onic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, angina, hypertension and congestive heart failur e.50 It is important that the health system works and provides optimal clinical care. Increased opportunities for education to improve health literacy will further enable Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander adults to make informed health choices for themselves and their families. Chr onic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and kidney disease contribute to two-thirds of the health gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous Australians.51 Pr emature mortality from chronic diseases is unacceptable in this age group and policies should target conditions that most contribute to this outcome. Additionally, rheumatic heart disease, and poor eye and oral health are also highly prevalent in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults. Health checks and follow up support at this stage of life can assist all people to make the necessary lifestyle changes to prevent or delay the onset of chronic disease. Aboriginal men have the worst health outcomes of any group in Australia. Aboriginal men die earlier from chronic diseases, such as car diovascular disease, injury, respiratory disease, cancer and endocrine disease. They have higher rates of suicide than non-Aboriginal men, and have similar death rates from assault to females. Aboriginal men often do not talk about their health and as a consequence, problems ar e often not acknowledged until they become too serious to ignore. All evidence shows that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men use pr eventative health services less often than any other group.

Context Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elders play a vital role in sustaining strong cultural practices and traditions within their communities with important roles and responsibilities such as passing on knowledge, languages and customs, participating in decision-making ceremonies, and 'looking after country'. Older Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander people also often still have caring responsibilities, sometimes of multiple generations. Many older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will have been impacted by historical policies leading to the forcible removal of childr en. The consequences of these removal policies have long-term resonance, including social, physical and psychological devastation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people dir ectly involved, as well as their families and communities.53 National policy needs to r ecognise this history and continue to provide social and emotional support for those who have been affected. Older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should have the option to choose their envir onment where they feel most comfortable to age particularly if affected by ill-health and disability . Options for the increasing numbers of older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will be needed for those who will be seeking to age on country and may require access to appropriate services that maximise their independence. Aged care facilities need to be culturally sensitive to the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elders and health care workers need to have the skills to meet this need. This includes palliative care services to ensure Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander people receive culturally appr opriate care for the end stages of life. Support is also important for the families who have caring responsibilities of older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with health pr oblems or disabilities. k ey s t RA te GI es to ACHI e V e t HI s Go A l Adopt coordinated and innovative models of care that provide opportunities for older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to maintain social and cultural connections and age on country. Engage elders and senior community members as key stakeholders and role models to champion culturally appropriate choices and approaches to health and wellbeing. Build the capacity of the health and aged care workforce to be sensitive to the needs of older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Review and improve the implementation of the Indigenous Chronic Disease Package over the next decade - a Commonwealth contribution to the National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health Outcomes. 39 IMPleMentAtIonWhile this Health Plan focuses on directing implementation by the Australian Government, it is important to acknowledge the essential r ole of the partners - individuals, families, communities and their representatives, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled health organisations, mainstream health service pr oviders and state and territory governments - and foster their support to implement the Health Plan. This will be achieved through the development of a Commonwealth cross-sectoral implementation plan, as well as implementation plans with each state and territory in the context of their existing targeted activity. The Australian Government also encourages the non-gover nment sector to demonstrate their commitment to this Health Plan by aligning their strategic planning and public reporting to r eference this Health Plan. The initial Australian Government implementation plan will be developed within 12 months of the r elease of this Health Plan, and will be reviewed and re-developed regularly thereafter (no less than every three years) to give effect to this Health Plan. Each implementation plan will build on existing arrangements and collaborative pr ocesses such as the ongoing Closing the Gap effort, to ensure a cohesive approach to health outcomes. Each implementation plan will set measureable benchmarks and pr ogress targets, identify how strategies will contribute to the Closing the Gap targets, outline accountability mechanisms, and specify the r oles and responsibilities of each stakeholder in pr ogressing this Health Plan. Each government implementation plan will also acknowledge that investments outside of the health system, such as in education, housing and employment, offer great returns on health outcomes. This requires a two-tiered approach of good policy and programs in health services and policy , and interventions in other sectors related to the social determinants of health. Policy intervention will present strategic choices about which frame to use to best leverage change. Where possible, improved outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can be delivered through broader public policy interventions or general health policy interventions. Change can also be pursued thr ough specific Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health policy interventions if these br oader routes are not available. Targeted population health strategies will continue to be developed within the broad context established by this Health Plan. Such strategies play a key role in organising actions as they: address a significant proportion of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander burden of disease and risk, such as chronic disease or tobacco control; provide an organising framework for health conditions that coordinate activities across primary care, specialist services and other non- health services, such as eye health, ear health, oral health or injury control; address the health needs of specific and often vulnerable populations such as Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander people with disability or those who are in or have recently been r eleased from prison; address issues that are politically and socially challenging such as sexual health or strategies to address violence, self-harm and abuse; and address those diseases and conditions which may be increasingly uncommon but are usually associated with extremes of poverty and marginalisation, such as rheumatic heart disease, trachoma and tuberculosis, and which r equire specific expertise and services to addr ess them. Mon ItoRInG AnD ACCount AbIlIty This approach enables the monitoring of health systems performance in improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health outcomes. The progress against social determinants of health will continue to be reported as part of the broader Closing the Gap Framework and other reporting such as the Prime Minister's Closing the Gap Report, the Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage Report, the Indigenous Expenditur e Report and individual agency Annual Reports. In addition, public reporting on the Australian Gover nment's progress in meeting this Health Plan' s policy objectives will occur through two mechanisms: a high-level annual report to the Australian Parliament; and detailed bi-annual reporting through the Health Performance Framework. The Health Performance Framework was developed as the primary report for measuring the impact of the 2003-13 National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health. The results from each Health Performance Framework report have been used to review Australian Government commitments and guide further comprehensive and coor dinated effort, and will continue to do so for this Health Plan. Underpinning the Health Performance Framework reporting will be data and monitoring and evaluation material collected and analysed at all levels of government. This information will provide good evidence to track the impact of the directions set out in this Health Plan, including factors such as smoking, health status and outcomes (for example, mortality disease rates, hearing loss, low birthweight) and health system performance (for example, antenatal car e, chronic disease management, access to services compared with need). The Australian Gover nment remains committed to improving the 4041coordination, collection and monitoring of data and to working with other governments and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health sector to support this aim. This Health Plan commits to the development of Health Plan implementation progress targets using the national target setting instrument developed by the National Indigenous Health Equality Council 54 (NIHEC, currently known as NA TSIHEC, played a key role in the development of monitoring of progress towards a set of health-r elated goals and targets to support the Australian Government's commitments on life expectancy and child mortality through its National T arget Setting Instruments). Targets can be an effective tool in the development and monitoring of health policy where they ar e developed in consultation with all relevant stakeholders and there is a shared commitment to their achievement. Targets need to be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-Bound. In the context of this Health Plan, a commitment to continued collection, refinement and use of the information contained in the Health Performance Framework will continue to inform policy development across governments and be a sour ce of information for reporting against targets once developed. The annual report to the Australian Parliament is a new reporting mechanism being introduced in support of this Health Plan.

Prior to 1967, all existing services including health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were exclusively a state responsibility and were not delivered within a national policy framework. Between 1967 and 1995 there was little action at the Commonwealth level in the mainstream heath system to improve services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In 1995-96, r esponsibility for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and substance misuse programs was transferred from the Aboriginal a nd T orres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) to the then Department of Health and Aged Care. nA t I on A l Abo RIGI n A l A n D t o RR es s t RAI t Isl A n D e R He A lt H s t RA te G y (1989) In 1989 the National Aboriginal Health Strategy (NAHS) was established as a landmark document in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health policy which articulated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's health aspirations and goals within a rights-based framework. The 1994 Report of the Evaluation of the NAHS found that it was 'never effectively implemented'.55 It cited that one of the significant challenges in its implementation was that the Strategy lacked any concerted partnership appr oach to support implementation by all the necessary stakeholders and lacked commitment by Australian Governments.56 Abo RIGI n A l A n D t o RR es s t RAI t Isl A n D e R He A lt H Go A ls A n D tARG ets ( I nte RIM ) (1991) In 1991, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Goals and Targets (interim) was published. The goals and targets proposed in the paper built on the National Aboriginal Health Strategy, 43and were designed to promote discussion about tar get setting in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. To capture the holistic approach to understanding and monitoring Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander health the interim goals and tar gets were grouped into five sections including: health outcomes; access; health support; education; and training. The framework sought to avoid unbalanced tar gets by selecting a range of complementary tar gets including: 1. Health status targets - addressing death, disease and disability; 2. Risk reduction targets - aimed at behavioural risks to health; 3. Public awareness targets - intended to incr ease public awareness about health risks or appropriate prevention; 4. Professional Education and Awareness targets - encouraging an increase in the proportion of professionals who are aware and trained to pr ovide appropriate interventions; and 5. Service and Protection targets - addressing the need to increase comprehensiveness and accessibility of services.57 Importantly, the paper acknowledged that r egional variation is the norm, rather than the exception, in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, and questioned that if this diversity of circumstance were to be collected then consideration should be given to how to define local measures to capture this information. Abo RIGI n A l A n D t o RR es s t RAI t Isl A n D e R He A lt H F RAM e W o R k A GR ee M ents (F RAM e W o R k A GR ee M ents) (1996) Between 1996 and 1999 all jurisdictions (including the Torres Strait) signed Framework Agr eements between the Commonwealth, state/ territory governments, the community controlled health sector, and ATSIC. Since 1996, the Framework Agreements through their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Forums or Partnerships were established to oversee the following key areas of work:1. joint planning; 2. access to both mainstream and Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander specific health, and health r elated services; 3. increased level of resources allocated to reflect need; and 4. improved data collection and evaluation. In August 1999 all jurisdictions commenced r eporting to the then Australian Health Ministers' Confer ence (the now Standing Council on Health) on their progress with realising the commitments made in the Framework Agreements. From 2004-05, Framework Agreement reporting has been incorporated into the reports against Implementation Plans for the National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health 2003-2013. CoAG W H ole o F Go V e R n M ent APPR o ACH to In DIG enous AFFAIR s (2002) In 2002, COAG agreed to a trial of a whole-of- governments cooperative approach in up to 10 communities or regions (the Department of Health and Ageing's Trial Site was the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia). The aim of the trials was to improve the way governments interacted with each other and with communities to deliver more ef fective responses to the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As part of this approach the government implemented Shar ed Responsibility Agreements and Regional Partnership Agreements. In 2002, COAG leaders also agreed to commission the Steering Committee for the Review of Commonwealth/State Service Pr ovision (SCRCSSP) to produce a regular report to COAG against key indicators of Indigenous disadvantage. The framework includes three priority outcomes to reflect a vision of how life should be for Indigenous people, and includes: > twelve headline indicators which measure the major social and economic factors to be impr oved; and > seven 'strategic areas for action' which potentially have a significant and 44lasting impact in reducing Indigenous disadvantage, and are amenable to policy action, so that, over time, improvements in the headline indicators and priority outcomes can be achieved. Each 'strategic ar ea for action' is linked to a set of 'strategic change indicators'. These indicators are designed to show whether activities are making a difference, and to identify areas wher e more attention is needed. T o underpin government effort to improve cooperation in addressing this disadvantage, in June 2004, COAG also agreed to a National Framework of Principles for Government Service Delivery to Indigenous Australians. The principles addr essed sharing responsibility, harnessing the mainstream, streamlining service delivery, establishing transparency and accountability, developing a learning framework and focusing on priority areas. nA t I on A l s t RA te GIC F RAM e W o R k F o R Abo RIGI n A l A n D t o RR es s t RAI t Isl A n D e R He A lt H 2003-2013 The National Aboriginal Health Strategy (NAHS) was a foundational document for developing the National Strategic Framework for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (NSFATSIH). The NSFATSIH was intended to complement, rather than replace it, and address contemporary approaches to primary health care and population health within the current policy envir onment and planning structures. The NSFATSIH aimed to provide government w ith sound advice about evidence-based appr oaches for improving health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Framework clearly articulated that health gains cannot be made in isolation, therefore, it adopted a multi-sectoral approach to improve housing, education, and employment to support and sustain improvements in health. The NSFATSIH committed governments to work together on joint and cross-portfolio initiatives to improve health system deliverables and addr ess the social determinants of health so that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can enjoy a healthy lifestyle equal to that of the general population. The agreed policy priorities in the NSFATSIH wer e developed without imposing specific targets or benchmarks on the Commonwealth, state and territory governments in recognition of the dif ferent histories, circumstances and priorities of each jurisdiction. This approach allowed jurisdictions to surface local and regional issues and address them through specific strategies or programs. Specific strategies were subsequently developed by state and territory governments to support the overall goals and objectives of the NSFATSIH. The flexibility of the NSFATSIH allowed jurisdictions to develop strategies that sought to address their local and regional issues, while complementing the overall strategic direction of the NSFATSIH. An appraisal of the NSFATSIH was conducted to identify key learnings, which have been incorporated into this Health Plan to ensure a cumulative learning approach to Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander health policy. Abo RIGI n A l A n D t o RR es s t RAI t Isl A n D e R Co MM un I ty Cont R olle D He A lt H o RGA n I s A t I ons The first Aboriginal medical service was established in the Sydney suburb of Redfern in 1971, with the aim of improving access to health services for the local Aboriginal community by cr eating a culturally appropriate environment. Accor ding to the National Aboriginal Community Contr olled Health Organisation (NACCHO), the national body representing Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander community controlled health organisations throughout Australia, these or ganisations are primary health care services initiated and operated by local Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander communities to deliver holistic, comprehensive and culturally appropriate health care to the community that controls it (thr ough a locally elected board of management). Ther e are currently over 170 Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander community controlled health organisations in Australia. These services ar e unique in their management and funding structur e, and their community base. 45nAtIonAl He AltH ReFoRM Australia' s health system is amongst the best in the world. However, demands on the system ar e increasing due to an ageing population, incr eased rates of chronic and preventable disease, new treatments becoming available and rising health care costs. Working in partnership with states and territories, the Australian Government has taken action to address these challenges and in August 2011, secured a national agreement that will deliver the funding public hospitals need, with unpr ecedented levels of transparency and accountability , less waste and less waiting for patients. Key components of the National Health Reform Agr eement (and the related National Partnership Agr eement on Improving Public Hospital Services and the National Healthcare Agreement 2011) that are directing the changes to Australia's health system include: a new framework for funding public hospitals and an investment of an additional $19.8 billion in public hospital services over this decade; a focus on reducing emergency department and elective surgery waiting times; incr eased transparency and accountability acr oss the health and aged care system; a stronger primary care system supported by joint planning with states and territories and the establishment of Medicare Locals; and the Australian Government taking full policy and funding responsibility for aged car e services, including the transfer to the Australian Government of current resourcing for aged care services from the Home and Community Care (HACC) program, in most states and territories except Victoria and W estern Australia.

A Stakeholder Advisory Group was established to guide development of the Health Plan and br ought together government and organisations with expertise in Indigenous health and broader health issues. The Stakeholder Advisory Group was co-chaired by David Learmonth, Deputy Secr etary, Department of Health and Ageing and Ms Jody Broun, co-Chair of the National Congr ess of Australia's First Peoples. nA t I on A l Abo RIGI n A l A n D t o RR es s t RAI t Isl A n D e R He A lt H e qu A l I ty Coun CI l - t e RM s o F Re F e R en C e NATSIHEC will advise the Minister for Indigenous Health: 1. on the development of a National Indigenous Health Plan; 2. on the development and monitoring of health r elated goals and targets to support the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) commitment to closing the gap in outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; and 3. on other Ministerial priorities as requested, including child and adolescent health, drug and alcohol, mental health, social and emotional wellbeing and health workforce issues. 46In developing this advice, NATSIHEC should consider a range of matters, including but not limited to the following: how current activities to improve health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people align with the Government's commitment to close the gap and improve health outcomes for all Australians; existing health policy and programs and their ef fectiveness at a regional, rural, remote, metro and national level; work being progressed through other fora including but not limited to the COAG Health and Ageing Working Group and the COAG W orking Group on Indigenous Reform; curr ent barriers to Indigenous people accessing adequate health services and how these might be best overcome; the interaction between mainstream health services and Indigenous-specific health services; the need for a whole-of-government approach to improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and well-being; the need for coordination and integration of various national, regional, remote and rural pr ograms and initiatives; existing gaps in data and how these might be addr essed in the future; the social and environmental determinants of health that impact on Indigenous health to ensure goals and targets to support the Gover nment's commitment to improving Indigenous life expectancy and reducing child mortality are properly evidence-based; national and international strategies for impr oving Indigenous health and building capabilities; and how to maximise effective internal and exter nal stakeholder relationships and increase community involvement in the Government's Indigenous health agenda. nA t I on A l Abo RIGI n A l A n D t o RR es s t RAI t Isl A n D e R He A lt H Pl A n s t A ke H ol D e R A DVI so R y G R ou P - t e RM s o F Re F e R en C e The Stakeholder Advisory Group will advise on the development of the National Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander Health Plan (NATSIHP). The advisory group will bring together government and organisations with expertise in Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander health, the health sector, and the social determinants of health. Role and Function The role of the advisory group is to: Drive and inform the development of the NA TSIHP through a meaningful partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Support the development of the NATSIHP by pr oviding advice on the key policy priorities to be addressed in the plan, including: > r eviewing current policies to identify gaps and emerging issues relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander well-being; and > how best to address and position the social determinants of health.

Frequency of meetings The advisory group will meet up to six times a year , and more frequently if required. Meetings will include face-to-face meetings and teleconfer ence. Issues may be considered out of session and bi-laterally with member organisations where r equired. Governance and ReportingThe advisory group will report to the Minister for Indigenous Health through the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing. Relationship to other Committees The Stakeholder Advisory Group will work closely with the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Equality Council (NATSIHEC) and the National Health Leadership Forum of the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples. NATSIHEC will advise the Minister for Indigenous health on development of the Plan. The Stakeholder Advisory Group will invite exter nal advice on specific issues as required. Consult AtIon P RoCess Community ConsultationsThe Australian Government held a series of 17 nation-wide open community consultations, including a youth specific consultation, and conducted an online submissions process to captur e different views and ideas. To provide context and guidance for the consultations and submissions process, the Department developed a Discussion Paper which sought responses to a range of questions to help shape the development of the Health Plan. On behalf of the Australian Government, the National Centre for Indigenous Excellence, in partnership with Mirri Mirri Productions and the George Institute for Global Health, facilitated the youth consultation. KPMG, in partnership with Mr William 'Uncle Benny' Hodges, facilitated each of the 16 community consultations. The consultation and submission process pr ovided an opportunity for key stakeholders to play an active role in ensuring the Health Plan identified the key health issues and necessary priorities to further close the gap in health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.770 representatives from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, health and social determinants of health organisations, peak bodies and state and territory governments participated in the 17 community consultations and provided information across a range of issues to inform the development of the Health Plan. The key themes which emerged from the community consultations included: access to health services, including the availability of specialists or transport to medical services; the importance of education, not just about formal schooling (although this is very important), but also about health education and literacy; workforce including the recruitment, retention and training of not only Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health professionals but also mainstr eam health workers in regional and r emote areas; the need for more integration and coordination of service provision; food and nutrition including the affordability and availability of healthy foods, particularly the importance of this in the early years; and mental health and grief and loss and the impacts this has on overall health and wellbeing, including that of Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander community controlled health organisation workers in communities. Details about the locations and representative or ganisations at each community consultation can be found at the National Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander Health Plan website (www. health.gov.au/natsihp).48Written submissions A total of 141 written submissions were received fr om individuals and organisations from across the country. Some of the key issues discussed in the submissions were: A comprehensive approach to primary health care is required that takes into account the social determinants of health, health inequalities, health promotion, illness pr evention, treatment and care of the sick, community development, advocacy, r ehabilitation, inter-sectoral action and population health approaches; racism and experience of discrimination is linked to poor self-assessed health status and has a negative impact on health; a focus on mental health and the impacts this has on overall health and wellbeing; workforce issues, such as recruitment of more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the health workforce; additional support to r etain health professionals in rural and remote locations; and a culturally competent workforce in health and other services sector; and an evidence-based approach to making the health system work better for Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander people. A list of the published written submissions r eceived can be found at the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan website (www .health.gov.au/natsihp). e xpert Forums NATSIHEC hosted thr ee forums as an opportunity to bring together experts from around Australia in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and mainstr eam health and determinants. The purpose of the meetings was to provide an opportunity to build the vision and identify the opportunities and risks that needed to be consider ed in developing the Health Plan. A list of the organisations/experts in attendance at each forum can be found at the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan website (www.health.gov.au/natsihp).t hemed Roundtables On behalf of the SAG, National Congress of Australia' s First Peoples hosted five thematic r oundtables to leverage constructive outcomes and recommendations on key issues to guide the development of the Health Plan. The locations and organisations/experts in attendance at each roundtable can be found at the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan website (www.health.gov.au/natsihp). 49APPenDIx C: Gloss ARy AnD De FI n I t I ons This National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan is underpinned by the following definitions which are threaded through the Health Plan. These are well established and accepted principles that are generic to a number of longstanding national and state Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander planning and policy documents. Antenatal Car e Includes recording medical history, assessment of individual needs, advice and guidance on pregnancy and delivery, screening tests, education on self-care during pregnancy, identification of conditions detrimental to health during pregnancy, first-line management and r eferral if necessary. Acute Rheumatic Fever Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF) is a disease caused by an auto-immune reaction to a bacterial infection with Group A streptococcus. ARF is a short illness, but can result in permanent damage to the heart - rheumatic heart disease (RHD). A person who has had ARF once is susceptible to r epeated episodes, which can increase the risk of RHD. Following an initial diagnosis of RHD, patients require long-term treatment, including long-term antibiotic treatment to avoid infections that may damage the heart. Cardiovascular Disease Disease of the circulatory system, namely the heart (cardio) or blood vessels (vascular). Includes heart attack, angina, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Also known as cir culatory disease. Child Mortality The death of a child before the age of five. Closing the Gap A commitment made by Australian governments in 2008 to improve the lives of Aboriginal and T orres Islander Australians. The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agr eed to six specific targets and timelines to r educe disadvantage among Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander Australians. These targets acknowledge the importance of reducing the gap in health outcomes and improving the social determinants of health. They are to: close the life expectancy gap within a generation (by 2031); halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous childr en under five within a decade (by 2018); ensure all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities have access to early childhood education within five years (by 2013); halve the gap for Indigenous students in r eading, writing and numeracy within a decade (by 2018); halve the gap for Indigenous people aged 20-24 in Year 12 attainment or equivalent attainment rates (by 2020); and halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a decade (by 2018). Cross-sectoral coordination The cooperation and collaboration of different ar eas of government. Diabetes A chronic condition marked by high levels of glucose in the blood. This condition is caused by the inability to produce insulin (a hormone pr oduced by the pancreas to control blood glucose levels), or the insulin produced becomes less effective, or both. Three main types are Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. Evidence-Based Practice Evidence-based practice entails finding, appraising and using the most current and valid r esearch findings as the basis for decisions. Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Conditions that may result from foetal exposure to alcohol during pregnancy. Disorders include foetal alcohol syndrome, neurodevelopmental disor der and alcohol-related birth defects. disor ders antenatal and postnatal growth r etardation, specific facial dysmorphology and functional abnormalities of the central nervous system.50Health Literacy An individual's ability to read, understand and use healthcare information. Illicit Drugs Illicit drugs include illegal drugs (amphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, heroin, hallucinogens), pharmaceuticals when used for non-medical purposes (pain-killers, sleeping pills) and other substances used inappropriately (inhalants such as petrol or glue). Intergenerational Trauma Exposur e of an earlier generation to a traumatic event that continues to affect the subsequent generations. Life Expectancy The average number of years of life remaining to a person at a particular age. Life expectancy at birth is an estimate of the average length of time (in years) a person can expect to live, assuming that the currently prevailing rates of death for each age group will remain the same for the lifetime of that person. Life Course The period from birth through to death. Low Birth Weight Infants born weighing less than 2500g. Medicare Locals Primary health care organisations established as part of the National Health Reform to coordinate primary health care delivery and address local health needs and service gaps. Their purpose is to drive improvements in primary health care and ensur e that services are better tailored to meet the needs of local communities. Palliative Care Palliative care is provided to people of all ages who are going through the end stages of life. Primary Health Care The World Health Organization Alma-Ata declaration of 1978 defines primary health care as essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination. It forms an integral part both of the country's health system, of which it is the central function and main focus, and of the overall social and economic development of the community. It is the first level of contact of individuals, the family and community with the national health system bringing health care as close as possible to wher e people live and work, and constitutes the first element of a continuing health care process. Respiratory Disease Respiratory disease includes conditions affecting the respiratory system - which includes the lungs and airways - such as asthma and pneumonia. Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) RHD may develop after illness with rheumatic fever , usually during childhood. Rheumatic fever can cause damage to various structures of the heart including the valves, lining or muscle and this damage is known as RHD (see also acute rheumatic fever). Risk Factors The factors that are associated with ill health, disability , disease or death are known as risk factors. Risk factors may be behavioural, biomedical, environmental, genetic, or demographic. Risk factors often coexist and interact with one another. Secondary Health Care Secondary health care refers to particular services provided by hospitals, such as acute car e, as well as services provided by specialists. Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) An infection that can be transferred from one person to another through sexual contact. Social Determinants of Health The conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and r esources at global, national and local levels.

Systemic Racism Failur e of the health system to provide an appr opriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin. T ertiary Health Care T ertiary health care refers to highly specialised or complex services provided by specialists or allied health professional in a hospital or primary health care setting, such as cancer treatment and complex surgery. Trachoma T rachoma is an eye infection that can result in scarring, in-turned eyelashes and blindness. Australia is the only developed country where trachoma is still endemic and it is found almost exclusively in remote and very remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Trachoma is associated with living in an arid environment (including the impact of dust); lack of access to clean water for hand and face washing; over crowding and low socioeconomic status.

Current member Community Controlled Health Services of the IUIH has developed an evidence-based Model of Chronic Disease Car e (the Model) for implementation across the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled health organisations in south east Queensland. The Model aims to ensure a comprehensive patient journey for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients accessing primary health car e services. It is a 'wrap around' model of care that is patient centric and includes Closing the Gap initiatives, and other services funded thr ough Indigenous-specific and mainstream programs. To make the Model evidence-based the IUIH uses detailed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population counts. A key principle of the IUIH Model is that Indigenous-specific funding is used to supplement Medicar e Benefits Schedule (MBS)-funded services, providing the additional preventative and primary care elements necessary to addr ess a population with a high burden of chronic disease. The IUIH currently supports 13 clinics (with two more proposed) acr oss four member organisations: ATSICHS Health Service; and Yulu-Burri-Ba. Although full implementation of the Model is in its early days, there is strong evidence that improved outcomes are being achieved.53neWly CReAteD PeRMA nent AGeD CAR e jobs AnD tRAInInG ACHI e V e M ents o F Abo RIGI n A l A n D t o RR es s t RAI t Isl A n D e R AG e D CAR e W o R ke R s A t I MA bulk A G e D C AR e s e RVIC es\u2014 b elyuen n o R t H e R n t e RRI to R y I MA bulk A G e D C AR e se RVIC e - b elyuen, n o R t H e R n t e RRI to R y. Three aged care workers, Shirley, Catherine and Elizabeth have achieved Certificate III in Home and Community Care and are now completing Certificate III in Aged Care. Trudi Mardi will receive Certificate III in Home and Community Care early next year. HK Training & Consultancy is the training organisation that has pr ovided aged care training to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander aged care workers at the service since 2010. Imabulk Aged Care pr ovides Home and Community Care and Community Aged Care Packages to 18 clients and three clients live at the centre in supported accommodation. In 2009 three permanent part-time jobs in aged care were created under the Northern Territory Jobs Package and HK Training and Consultancy has been delivering training to the staff in these positions and other staff at the service through funding from the Northern T erritory Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Aged Care Training Pr oject since 2010. Staffing is very stable and there are close family links between the staff at the service. The training and mentor support has become such a part of their jobs the staff have said \"now we have done so much training I can see how it all joins together. Everything we have learnt helps us do our job better, so our old people are better looked after... Sometimes it is a case of you don't know what you don't know. What a difference r egular training and mentor support makes!\" T wo staff Catherine and Shirley completed the Certificate III in Home and Community Care in 2011 and a third staff member, Elizabeth Mar di completed in 2013; this is a great achievement for them and a gr eat boost to the community. They continue to do training and are now enrolled in Certificate III Aged Care. The other staff are at various stages of completion of the Certificate III in Home and Community Care. While the achievement of getting a nationally recognised qualification is undoubtedly significant, other outcomes are also impressive. The Imabulk staff love training and actively participate in all sessions. The training, while complying with the VET Quality Framework r equirements, is tailored at the specific learning needs of the staff and has included a number of off-site visits. 54Inte GRA teD AnD CAR e\u2014A PAtIent's jou R ney Weste R n ns W Me DICAR e l o CA l A 42 year old Aboriginal man, with sleep apnoea, diabetes, post- traumatic stress disorder, and Ischemic Heart Disease was referred to the Closing the Gap - Care Coordination and Supplementary Services (CCSS) Program. The Care Coordinator was able to arrange an appointment with a respiratory physician and continued car e with mental health professionals. By leveraging linkages with the Closing the Gap - Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Pr ogram and Indigenous Chronic Disease program, which provides funding for outreach services delivered by multidisciplinary teams, the Care Coordinator was also able to access, at the one centre, all the providers needed for the patient's diabetes care. This included an optometrist, dietician, diabetes educator, podiatrist and endocrinologist. Thr oughout this process the Medicare Local regularly engaged with the local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled health organisations, primarily the Orange Aboriginal Medical Service. The patient has indicated that this integrated and coordinated delivery of health care has changed his life. He has joined a gym and is well enough to have his first holiday in 20 years.55FRoM CoMM unIty CRIsIs to CoMM unIty Cont Rol In tHe F I tz R oy V A lley: tH e M AR ulu* Foet A l Al C o H ol sP e C t R u M D I so RD e R s (FA s D) s t RA te G y: M A k I n G FA s D HI sto R y I n R e M ote Abo RIGI n A l C o MM un I t I es.

In 2007, Fitzroy Valley community leaders decided to address increasing violence and dysfunction in their communities caused by alcohol abuse. The community fought to introduce local alcohol restrictions that generated positive health and social results. Furthermore, community elders recognised that drinking during pregnancy was leading to children born with FASD. The subsequent severe learning and behavioural difficulties in affected children threatened the continuation of their culture. Since 2008, led by Nindilingarri Cultural Health Services and Marninwarntikura Women's Resource Centre, the communities have progressed the Marulu strategy with strong local, national and international partnerships. The Fitzroy Valley communities initiated prevention strategies including local alcohol restrictions, education campaigns and support for pr egnant mothers. In partnership with The George Institute for Global Health and Sydney University, from 2009-2012 they conducted The Lililwan Project, Australia's first FASD prevalence study. This study r eports among the highest rates of FASD worldwide. Yet there is hope in the Fitzroy Valley: by evaluating elements of effective prevention strategies and implementing these, FASD could be considered 'something that used to happen'. In planning the Marulu Strategy 2013-2017, the comprehensive strategies around prevention, diagnosis and management will be progressed and evaluated through the community's partnerships, including with the Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, WA. This work has been featured in the 2010 Australian Social Justice Commissioner' s Annual Report, presented at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples in 2011 and 2012, directly supported by the Governor General of Australia and commended by an Australian Government Inquiry into FASD. Crucially, the strategy used in the Fitzroy Valley is represented in a National FASD Action Plan presented to Government in 2013. *Marulu relates to children, and means 'precious, worth nurturing' in the Bunuba language.56buIlD It AnD tHey WIll CoMe: out CoMes FRoM A suCCessFul CARDIAC R e HA b I l I t A t I on PR o GRAM A t A n Abo RIGI n A l A n D t o RR es s t RAI t Isl A n D e R C o MM un I ty C ont R olle D H e A lt H o RGA n I s A t I on.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading disease burden in Aboriginal Australians, but culturally appropriate cardiac rehabilitation pr ograms are lacking. To help address this service gap, a cardiac r ehabilitation program was jointly established by the National Heart Foundation, Derbarl Yerrigan Health Service (DYHS) and the Royal Perth Hospital (Cardiology Department) in DYHS (an Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander community controlled health organisation) and its uptake, impact on health management and cardiovascular risk factors wer e documented. The program was conducted onsite to provide a culturally secure envir onment for the provision of exercise and education to address car diovascular health. The name of the program, 'Heart Health - for our people, by our people' (Heart Health) reflected ownership by DYHS and the broader Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community . Participants enrolling in Heart Health were invited to take part in a formal research project to evaluate the program. Participants' perceptions of the program and the impact on risk factors were evaluated following 8 weeks of attendance. In twenty- eight participants (20 females) who completed 8 weeks of sessions, body mass index, waist girth and blood pressure decreased and 6- min walk distance increased. 'Yarning' helped identify and address a range of chronic health issues including medication compliance, risk factor review and chest pain management. The evaluation concluded that the program led to improved cardiovascular risk factors and health management and an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community controlled health organisation is an ideal location for managing cardiovascular health and provides a setting conducive to addr essing a broad range of chronic conditions.57APPenDIx F: Re FeRenCes AnD s e MI n A l Re ADI n G s 1 Brown, N 2012, Pacific Caucus Intervention to the 12th Session of the United Nations Per manent Forum on Indigenous Issues, New Y ork, 20-31 May 2012. 2 National Aboriginal Health Strategy Working Party 1989, National Aboriginal Health Strategy, Canberra. 3 Commonwealth of Australia House of Repr esentatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs 2012, Our Land Our Languages: Language Lear ning in Indigenous Communities, Canberra. 4 Gooda, M 2010, The practical power of human rights, Queensland University of Technology, Faculty of Law Public Lecture Series, Brisbane, 19 May 2010. 5 Alyawarr Ingkerr-when Aboriginal Corporation 2012, Submission to the Australian Government for the development of a National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan. 6 Calma, T 2009, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner , Australian Human Rights Commission, (http://www. humanrights.gov.au/news/speeches/maximising-opportunities-new-era-indigenous-affairs.) 7 Dodson, M 2006, 'The Future of Reconciliation', Evatt Foundation, (http://evatt.org.au/papers/futur e-reconciliation.html) 8 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Equality Council 2012, Best Practice Framework for Setting Targets, Canberra. 9 Close the Gap Steering Committee 2012, Submission to the Australian Gover nment for the development of a National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan. 10 Booth, A & Carroll, N 2005, The health status of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, Centr e for Economic Policy Research, Australian National University, Canberra; DSI Consulting Pty Ltd & Benham, D 2009, An investigation of the effect of socio-economic factors on the Indigenous life expectancy gap, DSI Consulting Pty Ltd. 11 Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council 2012, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Performance Framework 2012, Canberra. 12 Marmot, M and Wilkinson, R (eds) 1999, Social Deter minants of Health, Oxford University Press, New York. 13 Jarvis, M & Wardie, J 1999, 'Social pattering of individual health behaviours; the case of cigar ette smoking', in ibid. 14 Kalb, G, Le, T & Leung, F 2011, Decomposing differ ences in labour force status between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research Report, Melbourne. 15 Australian Bureau of Statistics 2005, The Health and W elfare of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, ABS Cat.

Navigating by land and sea, we ar e the Custodians of this place - it nurtures us, sustains us, provides for us and heals us. We are connected, we are one. Our ancestors protect and guide us, teaching us the ways of the past, strengthening our knowledge of Culture and directing our pathways, working together towards a brighter future. t H e C ultu R e o F H e A l I n G: The artwork for the Department of Health and Ageing 'The Culture of Healing' brings together many people from Government to community all acr oss Australia to address the theme of health and wellbeing for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The 'Health Plan' is a whole of government appr oach, the aim of which is to initiate genuine discussion, solutions and community driven outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples within the area of health. The foundation of the artwork is set in a grid patter n. Each area consists of different cultural markings and motifs from the Torres Straits and across mainland Australia. These markings ar e the tracks left by the Rainbow Serpent, the Cr eation Spirit, and they represent the diversity of country. The lines that make up the grid formation are the navigational pathways and meeting places. Three stars represent these navigational pathways for Government and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The plant and animal motifs represent traditional health and wellbeing - 'bush tucker'. The central figures represent Aboriginal and T orres Strait ancestors who teach us the traditional ways so we can keep our culture str ong today and into the future. The circular motif towards the bottom of the artwork r epresents Government and communities coming together in discussion, working together to cr eate better health outcomes for Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander peoples. The inner circle r epresents the Government from the Minister, to staff and other stakeholders and moving outwar ds to the Communities. The 'U' shaped motifs represent people seated in discussion, or a 'Yarning Circle'. The pathways that lead out from these people r epresent the expertise and cultural knowledge and understanding that each individual brings to the table of their family, their community and their people and how the 'Health Plan' can best benefit them for a happier, healthier and brighter futur e together.
