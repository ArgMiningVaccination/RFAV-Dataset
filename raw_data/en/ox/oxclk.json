To explore more of your soul in therapy than just what isn't working in your life? Perhaps you want to explore the purpose of it all? Or even your own life's purpose? Are you feeling uncertain, or empty inside? Sometimes, the world and our path and place in it can feel extremely uncertain and scary. You might feel especially alone and confused or mired in uneasiness. Maybe you feel stuck and unable to move forward. Therapy that addresses the soul or spirit can help you to find grounding in your own inner truth. That's where spiritual healing therapy comes in. Spiritual healing therapy can help you to feel more whole and less alone. What is Soul-Based, or Soulful Therapy? Did you know that the origin of the word psychotherapy comes from the Greek words for tending to the soul?! Therapy that is soul-based does not see you as broken and needing to be fixed. It sees you as someone that would benefit from wholeness and care and us, as psychotherapists, as attendants to the soul. By looking at all of the aspects of you, you and I can work together to help you feel whole and truly uncover your brilliant, authentic self. The ME-Therapy Approach to Spiritual Healing and Soulful Therapy At ME-Therapy I see soulful therapy as a sacred healing endeavor. I see you as a whole person - mind, body, and spirit. I practice therapy that is holistic, which includes spiritual therapy. Learn more about this [here](https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/holistic-psychotherapy). I am passionate about accompanying you on your journey to wholeness, about helping you find your life's path and your own work in the world. ME-Therapy is a wholeness and authenticity focused healing space. I welcome all the parts of you that are looking to grow and heal. From this viewpoint, I will help you to feel more grounded and less alone. You will find more of your purpose, feel less uncertain (or more in acceptance of the uncertainty that exists). I can help you feel more connected. Mind. Body. Spirit. I have the training, education, and experience in various mind, body, energy, spiritual philosophies, and paradigms. I also recognize that it is not my place to tell you how and what to believe. This is your journey of discovery and I can hold the light up so that you can see the path before you better. I will go with you on the journey to discovering and embodying what works best for you. Learning about what nourishes and fortifies you. And, finally, what awakens and enlivens you. Attending to soul pain allows you to heal from the traumas of the past in a more whole way. It allows you to be more present to the gifts of the future. Soulful/spiritual therapy requires that your therapist also engages in the work of their own whole person healing. I am committed to engaging in my own personal healing work. It makes me a better therapist and helps me hear and understand your pain better. Attending to the wellness of your soul and spirit can be an integral part of whole-person wellness. It can help you feel more connected to yourself, those around you, and something greater than you. No part of you exists in a vacuum. Mind, body, spirit, energy, emotions - it is all connected and part of YOU. Now is a great time to level up. Begin spiritual healing therapy in St. Petersburg, FL now.
