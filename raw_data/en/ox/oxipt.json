[ProstaClear](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/prostaclear): Great Supplement for Prostate Enlargement (BPH) ProstaClear is one of the leading prostate health supplements because it's one of the few solutions that target hormonal imbalance, which may be linked to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The ingredients in ProstaClear come from plants and have properties that help rebalance your hormones, reduce prostate size, and lower urinary tract symptoms. The prostate supplement focuses on reducing symptoms of BPH, including urinary symptoms, to improve the quality of life of men with prostate diseases. Benefits These are the main benefits of taking ProstaClear: - Support urinary health - Reverse prostate growth - Improve sleep - Enhance male vitality ProstaClear has no artificial ingredients, toxins, fillers, or GMOs, making it safe for everyday consumption. Like many prostate supplements available online, you can save a significant amount of money by ordering bundles instead of single bottles of the dietary supplements. Additionally, Prostaclear has one of the best customer satisfaction policies. With a 180-day money-back guarantee, you have about six months to test ProstaClear risk-free. Since ProstaClear can reduce your BPH symptoms in as little as 30 days, 180 days should be plenty of time to find out if the prostate health supplements work for you. If not, you can contact support for a refund \u2014 no returns necessary. How It Works ProstaClear has two primary functions: decrease the conversion of testosterone into estrogen and remove excess estrogen from your body. The prostate health supplement does this with clinically and historically proven ingredients that naturally inhibit estrogen production to increase testosterone levels and support your liver to flush out estrogen. To improve your prostate health with ProstaClear, you have to follow a simple routine. You'll take two capsules daily, preferably at night. These two pills contain potent quantities of each beneficial ingredient, ensuring you can experience the effectiveness of these prostate health supplements. Ingredients The three main ingredients that address hormonal imbalance are: - Chrysin - Indole 3 carbinol - Eurycoma longifolia Chrysin is an effective inhibitor of an enzyme known as aromatase, which converts testosterone into estrogen. It can help boost testosterone levels, reduce inflammation, and boost your immune system. Indole 3 carbinol helps reduce estrogen levels in your body by speeding up your liver function, which could aid in decreasing the size of your prostate gland. The last primary ingredient, Eurycoma longifolia, boosts testosterone levels, an especially valuable benefit for aging men who might experience a drop in the hormone. ProstaClear also contains a lineup of natural supplements, like fenugreek extract and nettle root, to lower urinary tract symptoms of BPH and improve your overall health.

[VigRX Prostate Support](https://www.chronotherapeutics.org/go/vigrx-prostate-support): Good Prostate Pills for ED VigRX Prostate Support is one of the top prostate health supplements available, and it's a favorite choice for men experiencing a dip in libido. An enlarged prostate can cause sexual dysfunction on top of the typical symptoms, including difficulty urinating and frequent urination. The VigRX prostate health supplement uses organic ingredients to mitigate the symptoms of prostate enlargement, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It can also help prevent BPH and improve your overall urinary and sexual health.

Ingredients The main ingredients in VigRX include: - Saw palmetto - Beta-sitosterol - Stinging nettle - Pygeum The popular prostate health supplement ingredient, saw palmetto, provides a host of advantages, such as improving urinary health and lowering dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. High levels of DHT might lead to an enlarged prostate when your testosterone levels become low, which happens naturally as you age. Beta-sitosterol is a plant-based substance that can inhibit the activity of a specific enzyme, 5-alpha-reductase, reducing DHT levels. In some studies, men with BPH who took beta-sitosterol prostate supplements noted improved urinary symptoms and better urinary flow. Stinging nettle and pygeum are common ingredients in herbal medicine around the world. The uses of these herbs include addressing prostate enlargement, supporting urinary health, and fighting erectile dysfunction.

Prostate supplements are blends of natural ingredients that companies finely tune to tackle various prostate health issues. They typically come in the form of capsules, but some supplements, such as Prostadine, are liquid. In either case, you should take these prostate health supplements daily to provide your body with effective doses of each ingredient. A prostate health supplement primarily addresses the symptoms of problems with your prostate gland, including: - Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): enlargement of the prostate due to age - Acute or chronic prostatitis: infection or inflammation of the prostate gland - Prostate cancer: the most common cancer diagnosis for men and the fourth leading cause of men's cancer-related deaths While prostate supplements can't cure chronic prostatitis or stop you from developing prostate cancer, there's some clinical evidence backing up their use for alleviating the symptoms associated with these diseases. Besides helping with the irritating urinary symptoms associated with poor prostate health, some prostate supplements can also improve sexual health. Men experiencing a lack of libido or sexual dysfunction could benefit from dietary supplements with natural ingredients that target men's sexual health. How to Choose a Good Supplement for Prostate Health A prostate supplement doesn't have to adhere to as many regulations as prescription medicine, so it's crucial to research these products to ensure they're coming from a trusted source and don't contain any toxic chemicals or fillers that could harm your health. While reviewing the best prostate supplements, we looked at the following factors to judge the quality of the products: Ingredients The best prostate supplement contains clinically backed ingredients, like saw palmetto and stinging nettle, that have evidence showing their ability to improve prostate health. The formula should only include natural ingredients and be free of toxins and fillers, ensuring the supplement is safe to take on a daily basis. We also looked for supplements with ingredients that have other benefits besides supporting a healthy prostate, such as enhancing sexual performance, reducing fatigue, and improving immunity. Many prostate supplements include components like vitamin E and vitamin D to support both gut and prostate health. Dosage A prostate supplement can contain all the best ingredients for prostate health and still be ineffective because the daily dose needs to include an effective quantity of each component to make a difference. The finest prostate supplements have clinically accurate amounts of ingredients like saw palmetto, pumpkin seed oil extract, and green tea, resulting in a healthy prostate formula that's potent enough to address your symptoms. Scientific Proof Clinical trials are the key to determining the effectiveness of particular ingredients and blends, so some supplement companies invest in scientific research on their product. Having clinical evidence to back up their formula is a definite bonus when choosing a prostate supplement. If a company mentions they did clinical studies, you should be able to find and review the research. Even if a company didn't go all out and invest in a clinical study, it can still back up its product with third-party research from credible sources. When you're reading up on a prostate supplement, it's a good sign if you see genuine scientific research links on the website. Brand Transparency As you should do with any dietary supplement, we checked each prostate supplement to see if the manufacturer included a full list of ingredients in their proprietary blends. When you look at the ingredient label of a prostate supplement, you should be able to see a list of every substance in the formula and the amount of each one. Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't regulate dietary supplements, it's vital to research each product to avoid sketchy companies that hide artificial fillers and other potentially harmful ingredients behind the \"proprietary blend\" label. Following Legal Requirements Supplements don't have to adhere to the rules of the FDA, but that also means they can't claim to be a treatment, cure, or preventative solution for medical conditions. Legitimate prostate supplements will have clear language stating that they can support prostate health and help with symptoms, not cure the disease. We only included brands on our list that used honest descriptions of their products, avoiding language that misleads customers. Customer Reviews One of the best ways to find out whether a product is right for you is to check the customer reviews on the supplement company website or other buying sources. Reviews let you know how well the prostate supplement works, how long it might take to show results, and whether it has any side effects. We chose prostate supplements with excellent reviews, showing that many people benefitted from the products and that there aren't any adverse effects. Refund Policy Everyone has a unique body chemistry, so it's possible that a prostate supplement that works wonders for one person will have no effect on another. Therefore, we wanted to only include supplements that come with at least a 60-day money-back guarantee, allowing you to try the prostate health supplement for up to two months without the risk of losing money if it doesn't work for you. The supplements on our list provide hassle-free refunds for unsatisfied customers. Manufacturing Standards We only included supplements made in FDA-approved facilities, ensuring the products adhere to high manufacturing standards for your safety. The ingredients in the supplement should be high quality and pure, including no additives or fillers. The product should also be free of GMOs and any potentially harmful substances. When checking a product website, you should be able to find out what type of facility the company used to manufacture its prostate supplement. If you can't find any information about the manufacturing process, it could be a sign that the supplement came from a facility with low manufacturing standards or used low-quality ingredients.

Extensive research and herbal medicine have informed us about certain ingredients that are especially beneficial for men's health. Below, we go into more detail about the most popular ingredients in prostate health supplements. Lycopene Lycopene is a potent antioxidant found in fruits like watermelon, tomatoes, and pink grapefruit. It's known as a carotenoid, which is an organic pigment that gives fruits and vegetables a red color. Studies have shown a link between lycopene and a reduced prostate cancer risk, making it a common ingredient in supplements that maintain prostate health. Lycopene protects against cell damage and might also prevent cell mutation, which leads to cancer. It also has associations with a lower risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia and better urine flow. Lycopene inhibits the growth of human prostate cancer cells and reduces oxidative stress, similar to the clinical benefits of green tea. The carotenoid might also improve cardiovascular health and provide anti-aging benefits, adding to its powerful effects on men's health. Beta-Sitosterol Beta-sitosterol is a common compound known as a plant sterol or phytosterol, which is a naturally occurring steroid with links to health benefits, including prostate support. The clinical research on beta-sitosterol shows that it potentially lowers the risk of prostate cancer and has powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, making it a popular prostate supplement ingredient. Beta-sitosterol is present in saw palmetto, but enriching the plant with more phytosterols might increase the potency of the ingredient, according to research. Its ability to reduce inflammation and strengthen prostate cell membranes helps your body regulate your prostate size and function. Prunus Africana Prunus africana, also known as pygeum, is another one of the most common prostate health supplement ingredients. It originates from the bark of the African plum tree and is associated with benefits like reducing frequent urination, strengthening urine flow, and improving the ability to fully empty your bladder. Besides reducing some of the most annoying symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, some studies have linked pygeum with decreasing inflammation from acute and chronic prostatitis and protecting against cancer cell growth. The herbal remedy might also help shrink an enlarged prostate, helping reverse the age-related issue that many men face as they get older. Stinging Nettle Stinging nettle is a common plant in herbal remedies for urinary health and prostate support. It contains multiple plant compounds that have effective antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, and it's a popular prostate supplement component. Research has discovered that men with an enlarged prostate could combat their symptoms by taking potent doses of stinging nettle. Additionally, stinging nettle might have anticancer effects, meaning it could be an excellent ingredient for preventing prostate cancer. While study results are promising, this particular effect of stinging nettle requires more research for a definitive conclusion. Pumpkin Seed Another common prostate health supplement ingredient is pumpkin seed extract. In clinical trials, pumpkin seed extract alleviates the symptoms of men with an enlarged prostate gland and improves their overall quality of life. Pumpkin seed oil contains potent amounts of phytochemicals and zinc. Phytochemicals can reduce the effects of DHT on the prostate, and zinc is essential for healthy prostate function. Men with prostate cancer or BPH have significantly lower levels of zinc in the prostate, but pumpkin seed extract can help you maintain healthy zinc levels. As an anti-inflammatory, pumpkin seed oil can improve urinary symptoms linked with BPH, including an overactive bladder. The substance might also help treat side effects of chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, an infection that becomes more common as men age. Saw Palmetto Saw palmetto is one of the most prevalent ingredients of prostate supplements, and it comes from plants native to the southeastern U.S. The ingredient can help with a few of the most bothersome symptoms of BPH, including getting up in the middle of the night to pee, weak urine flow, and painful urination. A saw palmetto supplement might also improve sexual function, hair loss, and inflammation. However, one of the most meaningful ways saw palmetto helps maintain a healthy prostate is through its ability to reduce DHT levels. The enzyme 5-alpha reductase converts testosterone into DHT but saw palmetto decreases the activity of the enzyme, which lowers DHT and preserves your testosterone levels. Since DHT can cause your prostate to enlarge, taking saw palmetto supplements could improve prostate health and inhibit the progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Vitamin D Vitamin D is essential for bone health and supporting your immune system, and some studies have found a connection between low vitamin D levels and an increased chance of prostate cancer. Your body breaks vitamin D down into calcitriol, a compound that might slow the progression of cancers. Low levels of vitamin D also have a link to higher inflammation, which is a risk factor in many diseases, including prostate cancer and chronic prostatitis. Numerous prostate supplements contain this ingredient to help you maintain your vitamin D levels and encourage a healthy prostate. Pollen Extract Pollen extracts are an alternative to medications like ibuprofen and aspirin, reducing pain and inflammation naturally. Chronic prostatitis is the inflammation of the prostate, which causes symptoms like painful urination and ejaculation, reduced sexual function, and pelvic pain. Pollen extract can ease symptoms of chronic prostatitis and improve the quality of life of men who have the condition. One of the most common types of pollen extracts is rye pollen extract, which can help with symptoms including: - Frequent urination - Painful urination - Weak urine stream - Urgent need to pee - Dribbling after urinating Symptoms of an Enlarged Prostate As we previously mentioned, BPH is a condition where the prostate becomes enlarged, causing it to put pressure on the urethra, the tube that urine travels through to get out of your body. As the urethra becomes constricted, it causes problems with the lower urinary tract. Men over the age of 40 are more likely to develop an enlarged prostate, so it becomes even more crucial to be on the lookout for symptoms of BPH. Below, we provide a list of some of the common symptoms with a short description to help you identify whether you are experiencing them: - Frequent urination: You're constantly going to the bathroom to pee, and you even have to get up multiple times in the middle of the night. - Difficulty urinating: When you try to urinate, it feels difficult to start. - Weak urine stream: Your urine stream is weaker than usual, and it's hard to maintain a stronger flow. - Incontinence: You struggle to control urination and have urine leakage. - Urgency: You suddenly have a strong need to urinate and can't wait another minute to go. - Incomplete emptying: You feel like your bladder isn't empty, even right after urinating. - Interrupted flow: Your urine stream starts and stops. These symptoms happen because the enlarged prostate puts pressure on the urethra. As a result, the bladder has to work harder to get urine out of the body through the increasingly smaller opening. However, the size of the prostate doesn't always determine the severity of the symptoms. For instance, some men with substantially enlarged prostates experience mild symptoms, while others with slightly enlarged prostates have severe symptoms. In some cases, men with BPH might experience no symptoms at all. While BPH shares some of its urinary symptoms with prostate cancer, such as weak urine stream and the need to frequently urinate, the symptoms of prostate cancer can be much more serious. These symptoms might not emerge until the cancer has progressed, and they include the following: - Blood in urine or semen - Discomfort or pain during sex - Pain in the lower back, hips, or thighs Frequently Asked Questions About Prostate Supplements The following are a few of the most common questions about prostate supplements: Can an Enlarged Prostate Go Back to Normal? In most cases, an enlarged prostate is reversible. Mild cases of BPH can even clear up without medical intervention, but men with more severe symptoms should discuss treatment options with their doctor. What Is the Main Cause of Prostate Enlargement? The cause of prostate enlargement isn't clear, but it might be the result of hormonal imbalance as you age. Besides aging, the risk factors of an enlarged prostate also include a family history of prostate issues, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. What Foods Inflame a Prostate? Red and processed meat, saturated fat, alcohol, and high-fat dairy are foods you should avoid to keep your prostate in good shape. Research shows that a healthy diet with high amounts of fiber, fruits, and vegetables could prevent prostate cancer. How Long Does it Take for Prostate Supplements to Work? The length of time it takes for prostate supplements to start working depends on the product and the person taking it. For example, an ingredient like saw palmetto can take around four to six weeks to work. Final Thoughts on Prostate Supplements With so many prostate supplements available online and in stores, it can be difficult to know which products are actually safe and effective for improving prostate health. We reviewed the leading prostate supplements, taking an in-depth look into their reviews, ingredients, dosage, brand reputation, and more. Using the information we found, we created this list of the best prostate supplements, including details about ingredients and prostate health, to help you make more informed decisions when searching for a supplement. Hopefully, we made it easier to identify which products are best for your specific situation. Before adding a prostate supplement to your daily routine, you should speak with your primary care doctor to ensure it won't interfere with any medications. If you have noticeable symptoms, such as difficulty urinating or reduced sexual function, it's always best to talk to your doctor first. Catching the signs of BPH early can help you avoid developing severe prostate issues.
