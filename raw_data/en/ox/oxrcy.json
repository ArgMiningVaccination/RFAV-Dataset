Elsberg Foreword The second in a projected four-volume series that will cover the history of the Army Medical Department from 1775 to 1941, this volume traces the de\u00ad velopment of the department from its establishment on a permanent basis in 1818 through the final days of the Civil War in 1865. The uninterrupted existence of the Medical Department after 1818 made possible the gradual transformation of its staff from a collection of physicians of varying skills and attitudes into a group of highly trained and disciplined medical officers, proud of their organi\u00ad zation and of their roles in it. Although the state of the art of medicine before 1865 gave the military surgeon few effective weapons against illness and infec\u00ad tion, after 1818, as this most recent volume in the series demonstrates, the length of the military career of the average medical officer and his professional attitude toward the challenges he met led him to concentrate his efforts on the Army's health problems and to work persistently to improvise ways in which to meet them. The Army Medical Department, 1818-1865 is, like its predecessor, a significant and long-needed contribution to the history of military medicine. Washington, D.C. 6 November 1986 v WILLIAM A. STOFFT Brigadier General, USA Chief of Military History The Author Mary C. Gillett attended Wellesley College from 1946 through 1949 and received a B.A. degree in history from The American University in 1966. She received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in modern European history from The Amer\u00ad ican University in 1971 and 1978, respecti vely. Before entering graduate school, she worked from 1966 through 1969 for the Naval History Division of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. In 1972 she joined The Historical Unit of the Army Medical Department, which was absorbed by the Center of Military His\u00ad tory in 1976, and is now a member of the General History Branch of the Center's Histories Division. She is the author of The Army Medical Department , 1775-1818, published by the Center of Military History, and of articles con\u00ad cerning the history of military medicine in the United States. VI Preface When the first volume of this series was started, no plans had been made to carry the history of the Army Medical Department beyond 1818, when that organization was first established on a permanent basis. Nevertheless, some of the precedents set in Volume I have been followed in Volume 2. Thus the coverage of military operations is limited to that necessary for an understanding of the work of the Medical Department, and the efforts of medical officers are evaluated according to the standards of their time. Since the permanent establishment of the Army Medical Department favored the systematic maintenance of records by the Surgeon General's Office, the research involved in the writing of this volume has involved a challenge far different from that of the preceding volume. Indeed, the wealth of records de\u00ad riving from a multiplicity of sources made the task of dealing with the Civil War quite complicated. The author has attempted, however, to focus primarily upon the history of the Medical Department rather than upon the medical his\u00ad tory of the Civil War. In dealing with the period from 1818 to 1865, the author has received in\u00ad valuable assistance from too many sources for it to be possible to name them all. She is once again, however, particularly indebted to Dorothy Hanks and the staff of the History of Medicine Division of the National Library of Medicine, including Lucinda Keister of the Arts Section, and to Elaine C. Everly of the National Archives and Records Service, as well as to William A. Deiss of the Smithsonian Institution and to Carol Anderson , former Librarian of the Center of Military History, for their help in obtaining the books and documents nec\u00ad essary to the research phase of her work. The author is also indebted to those who helped in the search for illustrations, particularly William Straight, M.D., Stanley B. Burns, M.D., and Michael J. Winey of the U.S. Army Military History Institute at the Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. Many scholars have reviewed the manuscript of this volume in whole or in part and enriched the author's understanding of her subject by their comments and suggestions. Among them are Maj. Gen. James A. Weir, MC (Ret.); Col. Robert J. T. Joy, MC (Ret.), and Peter Oleh, M.D., both of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences; Jack D. Welsh, M.D., of the College of Medicine of the University of Oklahoma; professors Edward M. Coffman of the University of Wisconsin, K. Jack Bauer of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and John Duffy of the University of Maryland; and Dr. Straight, who shared his considerable expertise concerning the Second Seminole War as well as his photographs. VII Members of the staff of the U.S. Army Center of Military History have also contributed significantly to the current volume. Albert E. Cowdrey, Chief of the Special History Branch, reviewed all drafts of the manuscript and assisted ma\u00ad terially in their refinement. David F. Trask, Chief Historian, Col. James W. Dunn (Ret.), then Chief of the Histories Division, and John W. Elsberg, Chief of the Editorial Branch, joined Dr. Cowdrey, Dr. Duffy, and Colonel Joy on the ad\u00ad visory panel that was responsible for the volume's final review before its ac\u00ad ceptance for publication. Roger D. Clinton was responsible for the maps, which were prepared under the supervision of Arthur S. Hardyman, Chief of the Car\u00ad tographic Branch, who assisted in the selection and preparation of the illustra\u00ad tions for this volume as he did for the first. The author is also grateful to her editor, Marilee S. Morgan, for the patience with which she gave the manuscript a final polishing as she prepared it for the printer. Others of the author's colleagues at the U.S. Army Center of Military History have also contributed significantly to this volume. Paul J. Scheips offered helpful advice concerning Army surgeons in the West, while Kim B. Holien and Dwight D. Oland shared their Civil War expertise . Graham A. Cosmas repeatedly made his profound understanding of the history of the U.S. Army available so that the medical picture could be accurately placed into the overall military context. The author would like to add one final word of gratitude-to R. Clark Gillett, Jr., M.D., for the patience and forbearance with which he has always answered those medical questions with which the author hesitated to bedevil anyone else. As always, the responsibility for all errors is entirely that of the author. WaShington , D.C. 6 November 1986 Vlll MARY C. GILLETT Contents CIlllfJ/er 1. THE STATE OF THE ART Medicine. . . . 2.

Doubts as to the validity of time\u00ad honored medical practices were growing. Licensing requirements fell victim to egal\u00ad itarianism, and medical education became a profit-making venture. In any army, dis\u00ad ease still caused more deaths than wounds, even during wartime. A few significant new developments, however, stood in stark con\u00ad trast to the generally stagnant state of the art, and disillusionment with old ways was already beginning to stimulate a search for more scientific methods. Before the start of the Civil War in 1861, an increasing awareness of the need for research and crit\u00ad ical observation was emphasizing the Army Medical Department's potential for major contributions to medical science. Medicine Early in the nineteenth century, elabo\u00ad rate theoretical systems that used one or two principles to explain all disease and its cure began to lose popularity among or\u00ad thodox physicians, who came to regard those who devised and supported such sim\u00ad plistic explanations as quacks and cultists. The public's distrust for conventional med\u00ad icine led to increased success for homeo\u00ad paths, hydropaths, thomsonians, and eclectics, some of whom had their own medical schools and journals, and many of whom had a common distrust for the tra\u00ad ditional massive dosing with mercurials.' The decline of their faith in rigid theo\u00ad retical systems left many orthodox doctors confused or uncertain. Fact did not always substantiate the newer theories concerning the causes, nature, and spread of disease, but suggestions that minuscule animals or fungi might cause disease were generally ridiculed. The possibility of insect vectors was rarely mentioned. Vigorous debate raged over the question of contagion, but the most popular theory on the cause of disease attributed much sickness to malig\u00ad nant fumes or miasmas arising from de- 'Much of the background material in this chapter is based upon the works of Richard Harrison Shryock, especially l\\4etiicil/e alit!

Although some regarded fever as a symp\u00ad tom of disease, many still believed that conditions involving fever were all merely outward manifestations of a single under\u00ad lying ailment whose symptoms varied with the climate and weather, the passage of time, the medicines and treatments used, or the condition of the patient' 2Charlcs Caldwell, AlI(lIysis oj Fever(Lcxington, Ky.: Privately printed. 1825), MilIaria: Its Group 0/ Diseases From Their loss of faith left many physicians uncertain not only about the cause of dis\u00ad ease but also about its treatment. Critics of prevalent practice inveighed against \"the tendency to self-delusion, which seems in\u00ad separable from the practice of the art of healing\" and also against the tendency \"to afflict\" the patient \"with unnecessary prac\u00ad tice\" while ignoring the fact that \"some dis\u00ad eases are controlled by nature alone.\" An increasing number of doctors were aware that overmedicat ion could cause harm, but a Global Standpoint . 2 vols. (Philadelphia: W. 8. Saun\u00ad ders Co .. 1949). THE STATE OF THE ART the pressure upon physicians to prescribe active treatment was great, partially be\u00ad cause the patient himself might insist \"on being poisoned.\" As a result, in the pre\u00ad Civil War period, practice did not quickly reflect the discoveries of researchers and statisticians.) Nevertheless, as the nineteenth century progressed, many of the most prominent physicians in both the United States and Europe turned hopefully to the careful, de\u00ad tailed statistical studies being undertaken in the new and highly respected clinics of the Paris Medical School. Since Army sur\u00ad geons were stationed at posts scattered over the entire nation and were subject to an overall discipline , their experience as a group was readily available to those gath\u00ad ering data for statistical studies in the United States. With the support and en\u00ad couragement of civilian physicians , the Army Medical Department collected in\u00ad formation concerning the influence of me\u00ad teorological factors on health from post surgeons, who recorded the details of the weather, climate, and geographical features at the various forts and of the nature of the diseases affecting the men under their care. The science of gathering and using such data in the study of disease, however, was in its infancy. More effort continued to be expended in collecting this information than in forming valid conclusions based on it, and speculations based on personal }Quotes from Oliver Wendell Holmes, \"Currents and Counter-currents in Harley Warner, Heresy: American Physicians and the Con\u00ad cept of the Healing Power of Nature in the 1850s and 18605,\" Perspectives ill American Hislory 11 (1977-78):299-300: see also \"Review of A Li\u00ad brary oj Medicine .) impressions still played an important role in ostensibly scientific discussions. The break with the old medical theories and their one-or two-cause explanations for disease placed an increased emphasis upon finding ways to differentiate between various diseases. The new instruments and techniques that physicians began to use added to their understanding of disease as well as to the accuracy of their diagnoses. The laryngoscope and ophthalmo scope were of recent introduction and had not become popular tools by the time of the Civil War, but the microscope, while still available only to a few doctors, permitted 6 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTME NT, 1818-1865 DR.

The stethoscope was growing in popularity, while the thermometer came into ils own in the great medical centers of Europe with the realization that fever was a symptom, not a disease. The old procedure of ex\u00ad amining the urine to detect disease re\u00ad ceived new life with the growth of interest in pathological anatomy and the discovery of the relationship of albumin found in urine to disease. Following the lead of Paris-trained physicians, doctors at\u00ad tempted to correlate symptoms and test findings with abnormal changes found in the body's organs and tissues after death. New medicines were also used in the treatment of disease. Most important among them was quinine, long used in the treatment of fevers bUI before 1820, always in the form of the bark of the cinchona tree. Not long after quinine sulfate was first ex\u00ad tracted from cinchona bark, those using it began 10 comment on the ways in which its operation differed from that of the bark itself; reports maintained that quinine was more consistently retained in the stomach than bark and that it could be used in larger amounts, thus increasing its effectiveness. In the South, where malaria posed a par\u00ad ticularly formidabl e problem, some phy\u00ad sicians began to realize that as many as twenty or thirty grains of quinine at a time, a dose much larger than had been custom-THE STATE OF THE ART ary, were exceptionally effective. They also learned that administering this drug while the patient was in the midst of a fever pa\u00ad roxysm did not trigger the dire conse\u00ad quences that had been expected. As a result, in 1843, shortly after the end of the Second Seminole War in Florida, the surgeon general of the Army Medical De\u00ad partment sent a questionnaire to the sur\u00ad geons serving under him inquiring about their experiences with quinine sulfate. He asked about the exact nature of the drug they were using, the impurities present in their supply, the size and timing of the doses administered, and any adverse ef\u00ad fects that might have resulted from its use. Although the fifty-seven replies that he re\u00ad ceived contained many subjective impres\u00ad sions and conclusion s, they revealed that, in the case of malaria, the use ofa few large doses of quinine instead of many small ones was a relatively well-accepted practice in the Army. Most Army surgeons did not blame the increase in bowel disorders among soldiers on heavy dosing with qui\u00ad nine. In spite of its relative scarcity and the resultant high cost, they were using the new drug almost indiscriminate ly for many dis\u00ad eases other than malaria. Its ability to re\u00ad duce fever and relieve physical discomfort may well have given it an undeserved rep\u00ad utation for aiding the treatment of typhus and typhoid fever, cholera, pneumonia, and other illnesses.' 4Charlcs McCorm ick, the Usc and Sulphate of Quinine in Large Nell' C.

De\u00ad velopment of the EITective Dosage,\" JOl/mal oj the 7 In the early years of the nineteenth cen\u00ad tury, opium was prescribed mainly for dys\u00ad entery or extreme pain, many physicians deploring its constipating effects and re\u00ad garding it as harmful if used alone for a fever. Nevertheless, a wider use of narcot\u00ad ics in general followed the refinement of morphine and codeine from opium in the first half of the century. By the Civil War era, tincture of opium, or laudanum, was a familiar household remedy. The addic\u00ad tion that sometimes resulted was not al\u00ad ways condemned , even when the addict was an Army officer on active duty who spoke openly of his problem. Doctors ex\u00ad perimented with the dosages of narcotics in an effort to obtain a maximum of benefit with a minimum of unpleasant side effects. Both new opiates were, like opium itself, given by mouth. Doctors also made at\u00ad tempts to administer morphine by scraping away the top layer of the skin and applying the drug to the surface thus revealed. By midcentury, a few also administered mor\u00ad phine by injection, initially by cutting open a vein and using a regular syringe and, after 1860, with the newly developed hypoder\u00ad mic. Physicians favored the new approach because it enabled them to use drugs that otherwise would be adversely affected by their passage through the digestive system. By the 1850s doctors were also resorting increasingly to alcohol, long also used to dull pain, as a stimulant for the weak and debilitated.'

The mercurial s remained the favorite purges. Calomel, in particular, had enthu\u00ad siastic proponents, but as time passed, a growing number of physicians expressed reservations concerning its use. Impressed by the havoc that mercury could wreak upon the body, some began to seek ways to eliminate its horrible side effects by either reducing the dosage or eliminating its use. Some physicians also recognized the need to avoid constant irritation to the digestive system, and although emetics remained popular because of the belief that they re\u00ad lieved inflammation and fever, the profes\u00ad sion in general used greater restraint in prescribing both these drugs and purgatives. Although faith in emetics and purgatives was still strong in 1818, venesection, once the mainstay of any course of treatment, had already become somewhat controver\u00ad sial. Physicians used it with increasing cau\u00ad tion as a generalized treatment for disease. By 1825, even those who favored its use against fevers and inflammati ons ques\u00ad tioned the desirability of venesection in hot climates and for old, weak patients. A growing number of doctors preferred local bleeding to venesection, using for the pur\u00ad pose leeches or vacuum cups placed over cuts made in the skin. A controversial but influential book published in 1830, Re\u00ad searches Principally Relative to the Morbid and Curative Effects of Loss of Blood by Marshall Hall, emphasized the unfavorable short-term reactions that could follow ex\u00ad cessive blood loss from any cause. It em\u00ad phasized that very little had been done to determine the long-range effects of bleed\u00ad ing. In 1836 Pierre Louis, the father of the use of statistical studies in medicine and a teacher of American students in Paris, pointed out that bleeding as therapy for inflammatory disease, although possibly helpful, had been overrated. The lise of venesection declined slowly throughout the l840s and 1850s, but by the time of the start of the Civil War, many surgeons re\u00ad sorted to bleeding only when the desired relaxati on of the body could not be achieved by cathartics or changes in the diet. 6 The principal diseases against which Army surgeons used their remedies in the period 1818 to 1861 were those then classi\u00ad fied as fevers. Of these, malaria represented perhaps the greatest continuing health problem facing the Army Medical Depart\u00ad ment. Although it was receding from the eastern seaboard, malaria remained to varying degrees a threat throughout the en\u00ad tire nation, posing a surprisingly severe problem in the Midwest. It was generally regarded as a disease of the countryside, where mosquitoes could abound in num\u00ad bers almost inconceivable today, but it ap\u00ad peared occasiona lly in large towns and cities as well. The fact that a so-called animalcu le-bearing mosquito (Anopheles) rather than evil vapors spread the disease was not definitely established, however, until near the end of the century. In the mid-nineteenth century, malaria in its various forms had many names. It appeared in the records of the time as, among other things, remittent , intermit\u00ad tent, marsh, miasmatic , as the fied as intermittent fevers were those that fol\u00ad lowed a regular pattern of fever alternating 6James Jackson, to Researches 01/ Ihe E.Dects of Blood-felling ... , by P.

THE STATE OF THE ART with a return to normal temperatures. The remittent form, in which the fever fluc\u00ad tuated but never quite reached normal, was presumably either typhoid fever or today's falciparum malaria, always dangerous if not treated promptly , capable of mimick\u00ad ing many other diseases, and most preva\u00ad lent in warmer climates. Patients who were infected with malaria on separate occa\u00ad sions might experience symptoms that fol\u00ad lowed different cycles. Once infected by malaria, a soldier's health might be per\u00ad manently threatened. The enlarged spleen and liver could be accompanied by a slight jaundice resembling that of yellow fever. A scarlatina-type rash could be present, or the patient's flushed face, reddened eyes, hot, dry skin, agonizing headaches, and aching muscles might suggest typhoid. Bronchitis or even pneumonia could de\u00ad velop to further complicate the diagnosis. The presence of diarrhea might be mis\u00ad leading; diarrhea accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain mimicked cholera. The difTiculty of distinguishing malaria from other diseases made credible a theory that malarial fevers were antago\u00ad nistic to typhus and typhoid fever and that the prevalence of malaria and the typhoid\u00ad typhus types of fever varied inversely.

At least one Army surgeon blamed relapses on the effects of drafts when the victim was hot, overexposure to the sun, overeating, and constipation. In patients weakened by poor diet, overwork, stress, or disease, moreover, any form of malaria could be fatal.

Oc\u00ad casionally typhus fever was actually used to denote any type of fever believed to orig\u00ad inate in miasmas. By 1837, research by William Gerhard, an American physician who was a former student of Louis' in Paris, had made it possible to distinguish between the two diseases. Even after this point, the cause of typhoid remained un\u00ad clear and its treatment debatable, but the disease was probably widespread.

In its initial stages, dengue was char\u00ad acterized by fever and nausea. Contemporary descriptions noted that, in this disease, vomiting generally began sev\u00ad eral days after the fever broke for the first time and that a rash then followed the nau\u00ad sea. The rash suggested scarlet fever rather than measles and consisted of \"minute pa\u00ad pulae of a norid red, slightly elevated, and distributed in irregularl y shaped patches,\" appearing first on the face and trunk. After the rash was fully developed, the fever gen\u00ad erally reappear ed. The swollen glands and painful joints that also characterized den\u00ad gue could persist for weeks or months. The disease tended to cause great suffering but few, if any, deaths. In the late 1820s, the recomme nded treatment called for anti\u00ad monials in the earliest stage, bleeding in the so-called innammatory stage, diaphoret ics such as Dover's powder, which contained opium and ipecac, and of course, cathartics, I I 'OCooke, W.

Dur\u00ad ing this period, through their study of pathological anatomy, scientists first began to suspect that yellow fever was a distinct disease. Although it was not found endem\u00ad ically where the temperature dropped be\u00ad low 710 F., it could be imported into areas of moderate temperatures during the sum\u00ad mer by ships from tropical ports carrying infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which were capable of spreading the disease for up to sixty days. The role of the mosquito was suggested as early as 1848, but au\u00ad thorities generally blamed yellow fever on the combined effects of heat, moisture, and decaying animal and vegetable matter. Al\u00ad though they recognized the fact that few ever had the disease twice, they debated its contagiousness and the value of quaran\u00ad tines against it. Writers urged that treat\u00ad ment be started early in the course of an attack of yellow fever. In addition to the usual purges, doctors might use quinine to treat it. Some also advocated the raising of blisters on the spine and upper abdomen. A number of less devastating diseases also bore the name cholera in the nine\u00ad teenth century, but only the disease known as Asiatic cholera inspired more terror than yellow fever. At their worst, the symptoms of this disease were dreadful to witness, al\u00ad though they could actually vary consider\u00ad ably in intensity. A patient with a slight case might suffer only a diarrhea so mild that, without modern techniques, the di\u00ad agnosis was uncertain.

Because of the present understanding of the way in which it is transmitted and because modern san\u00ad itation methods limit a population's ex\u00ad posure to cholera, deaths from this disease now usually occur only in areas that are both extremely backward and crowded. A water-borne bacterium (Vibrio cJ/O/erae) causes cholera, entering the body through the mouth, usually in drinking water, in fish or shellfish, or on vegetables and sim\u00ad ilar foods. The organisms may also be spread by flies or by healthy human car\u00ad riers and can live in moist earth one to two weeks, in shallow well water three to fifteen days, and as long as four months in ice. Heat, sunlight, or an acid medium kills the vibrio quickly. The incubation period var\u00ad ies, but rarely exceeds fi ve to ten days and averages about three. Endemic in parts of India, cholera first brought widespread fear in 1814 to 1815, when it struck Asia, the Near East, and Russia, bringing with it a death rate offrom 40 to 75 percent. It began to inspire terror on a worldwide scale only after 1830, reap\u00ad pearing periodically in the United States from 1832 until the time of the Civil War, and striking with particular frequency in the years 1848 to 1852. The overall death rate of the first epidemic in the 1830s var\u00ad ied between 10 and 15 percent, although during its initial appearance in New York City in 1832, the death rate among those contracting the disease reportedly ap\u00ad proached a frightening 50 percent. In the 1840 epidemic the national mortality rate dropped below 10 percent.\" IlJohn Duffy, \"The G. Before the Civil War, Asiatic cholera was most commonly blamed on miasmas or meteorological conditions, but even in the 1830s a few scientists theorized that small living creatures played a role in this dis\u00ad ease. Very few physicians thought that it was actually contagious, but some believed that its spread must in some way be related to its human victims rather than to the at\u00ad mosphere. Others, however, doubted that Asiatic cholera existed as an entity separate from ordinary digestive upsets with similar symptoms or from fevers such as typhus or malaria. Excessive nervous strain as well as intemperance, debauchery, and filth were believed to predispose to the disease.\" Steps suggested to protect the population from cholera varied. Cleanliness and tem\u00ad perance and the avoidance of dampness, chills, and fear were often urged upon the populace as were regular exercise and a proper diet. The most popular approaches to the treatment of the disease resembled those fOllowed for other illnesses. Many au\u00ad thorities undertook bleeding at the slightest sign of a fever and administered calomel and opium early in the course of an illness. Less popular remedies included cupping the temples and abdomen, giving ice in\u00ad ternally, and administering enemas com\u00ad posed of such ingredients as hot water and brandy, which aided in warming the pa\u00ad tient, or a tobacco infusion, which stimu\u00ad lated the circulation, eased cramps, and stopped vomiting and diarrhea.

Although the new technique was used several times on moribund pa\u00ad tients, whose demise it failed to prevent, several alleged successes were also reported. \" By 1849 cholera was once again sweeping the United States. In SI. Louis it caused almost 68 percent of the deaths recorded in the period from 23 April to 6 August 1849. In 1852 it struck with force once again, only to fade out two years later. Dur\u00ad ing this epidemic a British scientist, noting the relationship of cases of cholera to water drawn from a particular well, began to sus\u00ad pect that cholera was a water-borne dis\u00ad ease, but animalcules and fungi were still generally dismissed as possible causes. In the United States, treatment during the second and third nationwide epidemics varied, but did not differ appreciabl y from that favored in 1832.

As with other diseases, the question of whether either was contagious continued to be a topic for debate. Little distinction was made between the two; an Army surgeon stated in 1852 that the prin\u00ad cipal difference between diarrhea and dys\u00ad entery lay in the fact that the former affected the small intestine and the latter the large. Theories attributed the cause of this form of illness to bad air, inappropriate food, too much purging with harsh medi\u00ad cines, meteorological factors, especially high temperatures, and alcohol, when ap\u00ad plied internally and too liberally. Both diarrhea and dysentery had been known as camp diseases for centuries, but it was only in 1859 that the ameba causing one form of dysentery was actually identified.\" The treatment for dysentery and diar\u00ad rhea in many ways resembled that for other diseases: bleeding, emetics, purgatives, quinine, opium, blisters, and occasionally less common remedies such as combina\u00ad tions of alum with either white vitriol (zinc sulfate) or sulfate of iron, or of acetate of lead with opium and ipecac. At least one physician stated that there was no proof that mercurials were helpful in cases of dys\u00ad entery. Doctors cast doubt on the possi\u00ad bility that a patient with either dysentery or diarrhea could be cured while remaining in a tropical climate; they suggested sea voyages, visits to mineral springs, and travel to a cooler climate for chronic cases,lS '7Forry, Climate, p. 298; on the Chronic Fluxes or the Bowels.\" in Gert H.

In 1819, for example, the Army re\u00ad corded 7 cases with no deaths, but in 1820 there were 734 cases with 190 deaths. In most years during the period from 1819 to 1838, no deaths were recorded. Factors that contributed to scurvy's appearance were recognized , but the unique impor\u00ad tance of fruits and vegetables as both pre\u00ad ventives and cures only gradually came to be understood. Such factors as fatigue, cold, anxiety, dampnes s, overwork , and the excessive use of salt continued to be im\u00ad plicated as causes rather than merely con\u00ad ditions that diminished ascorbic acid reserves.

They still placed much unwar\u00ad ranted faith in the antiscorbutic effects of vinegar, but more correctly inferred that potatoes relieved the symptoms of scurvy. Many posts were relati vely isolated, espe\u00ad cially during the winter, and the difficulty of bringing in antiscorbutics caused sur\u00ad geons to look for native plants with such properties. In the Southwest, medical of\u00ad ficers discovered that the plant called the maguey proved even more effective in treating scurvy than limejuice, while poke\u00ad weed, prickly pear, and wild onions were also effective antiscorbutics easily found near many forts.:w Among other health problems afflicting soldiers in the 1818 to 1861 period were rheumatic and respiratory conditions and venereal diseases. The number of cases of venereal disease reported in this period dropped considerably. As a result, Army records devote little space to this problem, although it appears that, without the ben\u00ad efit of blood tests to prove them wrong, physicians assumed that they could easily cure syphilis in its earliest stages. They still relied heavily on mercury as a treatment not merely for syphilis but for all forms of venereal disease and applied both inter\u00ad nally and externally. A new refinement of an almost abandoned technique was intro\u00ad duced in this period, however, to treat res\u00ad piratory disease. When a patient's pleural cavity filled with Ouid, relief was provided by means of thoracente sis, a surgical punc\u00ad ture of the chest, which eliminated the need 2\u00b0Glover Perin, \"Maguey, or Agave Americana: A Remedy for Scorbutus,\" New York Journal ojMedicine and the Collateral Sciences, n.s., 7 (1851):179 -83: Thomas l.

The pneumonia patient would probably still be bled, as would the patient with rheumatism or similar problems. The victim of gout might also be afnicted with blisters or dosed with colchicum, guaiacum, iodide of potash, opium, or turpentine. Another problem that was far from rare was ophthalmia, which might be treated with silver nitrate in the form of a solution called \"lunar caustic in distilled water.\"\" A more unexpected health problem that also appeared in the Army during this pe\u00ad riod was lead poisoning. On one post the source of the problem was traced to drink\u00ad ing water collected after it had run down the surface of a lead-covered roof. At an\u00ad other, sheet lead covering kitchen equip\u00ad ment was held responsible, while at a third, white lead used to clean soldiers' gloves and boots had caused illness. Lead poison\u00ad ing was treated with bleedings, purgatives , including calomel, and blisters, but some patients remained partly palsied despite all that could be done for them.\" Preventive medicine in the pre-Civil War period was a relatively unsophisticated art, and few American physicians displayed an interest in the growing public health move\u00ad ment in Europe.

In both civilian and military life, emphasis was placed on the need for in\u00ad creased cleanliness and improved ventila\u00ad tion and water supplies. Medical officers, like their civilian coun\u00ad terparts, also recognized intemperance as an important cause of ill health. Surgeons often worked closely with temperance so\u00ad cieties to reduce the consumption of al\u00ad cohol by soldiers. Post commanders tried varying approaches to the problem. In Florida in 1837, for example, double ra\u00ad tions of sugar and coffee were substituted for liquor and, although it was impossible to prevent the soldier from purchasing li\u00ad quor on his own, drunkenness was severely punished ,23 More successful than the temperance movement was the Army's requirement that all soldiers be vaccinated. The Medical Department usually shipped material for vaccination in the form of crusts, the scabs from a cowpox pustule, although in 1849 the department also tried shipping the vi\u00ad rus in liquid form in glass tubes. A de\u00ad partmental regulation issued in September 1818 specified that every soldier not al\u00ad ready immune to smallpox be vaccinated at once and that surgeons keep the neces\u00ad sary material for vaccinatio n on hand and in good condition. The regulation was rig\u00ad orously enforced; in 1847 an Army surgeon maintained that he had never seen a single case of smallpox among regular troops. Ep\u00ad idemics among the civilian population proved, however, that vaccination did not always protect completely against this dis- D\"Recoltcctio ns of a Campaign in Florida,\" Yale VIera,,), Magazille II (1846):76; Forry, Climale, p.

The apparent failures of the proce\u00ad dures led to speculation that some vaccine had been imprope rly obtained, perhaps from an immatur e vesicle, or that failure to become immunized might be related in some way to the temperament of the pa\u00ad tient. Also considered was the possibility that lymph obtained from a human patient who had himself been recently vaccinated was weaker than that obtained directly from the cow or that the passage of time might reduce the effectiveness of vaccina\u00ad tion. Suggestions were made that the pro\u00ad cess be repeated at intervals, although at least one physician insisted that the effect of the initial vaccination was as strong after twenty-five years as after one. In the 1840s the surgeon general began urging that his surgeons time their vaccinations so that a continuou s supply of fresh vaccine was al\u00ad ways available, but requests for crusts con\u00ad tinued to come into Washington from the field.24 Diet as a factor in the maintenan ce of health was a problem of particular concern to the Army and a matter to which Surgeon General Joseph Lovell devoted consider\u00ad able thought from the beginning of his ten\u00ad ure in 1818. He was concerned with the state of the culinary art as practiced by the average soldier who, unaccustomed to cooking for himself, would eat salt pork raw and, when confronted with fresh meat, broil it \"to a cinder.\" Instead of tea, the soldier \"warms his stomach with a gill of diluted, corroding whiskey; and, after liv- 2~Harvey E. to Charles McCormick and to Samuel De Camp (both 10 Jun 1843) and to other surgeons, RG 112, enlry 2, 14:309, 325, 331, 337; Henry Heiskell to Benjamin King (20 Aug 1849), RG 112, entry 2, 20:216.

Believing that man was naturally herbivorous, he thought a vegetable diet best for the maintenance of health and vigor. He commented unhappil y upon the fact that, although the Army allowed each man, as part of his regular rations, twenty ounces of beef, twelve ounces of pork, and a gill of whiskey a day, it made no allow\u00ad ances for vegetables.25 Lovell's specific recommendations for a soldier's diet included a warm beverage with morning and evening meals; peas, beans, and rice as dietary staples; kiln\u00ad dried cornmeal instead of flour; and as high a proportion as possible of fresh in pref\u00ad erence to salted meat. Beer or molasses and water should be substituted for hard liquor, and a plentiful supply of pickles should be available to aid the digestion and correct any superabundance of bile. Ideally, a large proportion of the soldier's rations should be served in the form of soup. The need for fresh vegetables and ripe fruit in the diet was being emphasized by 1861, and the use of fresh fish and meat was still en\u00ad couraged. By 1847 the notion that those sick with fever should be starved to reduce it and the accompanying tension had ap\u00ad parently been abandoned.26 Lovell's successor as surgeon general, Thomas Lawson, believed that most people in the United States ate more than was good for them, and certainly more than they needed to. When asked to give his opinion on decreasing the size of the Ar\u00ad my's food allowance, he suggested that the 2sJoseph Lovell, \"Report to Hon. J. C. Calhoun, Secretary Porler, \"NOles\" 26:320. THE STATE OF THE ART amount of food as well as the amount of clothing issued could well be reduced. The advice on diet given by Lawson and Lovell has a very modern sound, but it does not appear to have been acted upon.\" Surgery The sick formed a majority of the Army surgeon's patients, but even in peacetime he occasionally cared for an injured man. In either situation he was handicapped. He did not understand the cause of the infec\u00ad tions that so often frustrated his attempts to save lives, and in the first half of the century, he had no way to completely deaden the suffering of his patients on the operating table. As a result, for the tor\u00ad mented and struggling patient as well as for the surgeon, speed was of the essence and elaborate or time-consuming procedures were impossible. With its horrors and un\u00ad certain results, surgery before the era of anesthesia tended to be a procedure of last resort and a specialty to which few doctors cared to restrict themselves. Specialization within the field was only in its infancy at the outbreak of the Civil War. Neverthe\u00ad less, since major surgery required skills that the quack could not pretend to possess, the surgeon's prestige did not suffer from the competition of cults.\" !'Ltr, Lawson to Sec War (5 May 1841).

Experts rec\u00ad ommended that the patient be carefully ob-served while under anesthesia so that if he began to snore or his pulse became weak or slow, the sponge could be removed until he returned to a more normal state.'o The Army used anesthetic agents only very briefly during the Mexican War (1846- 1848), trying ether but quickly abandoning it as too dangerous. One physician serving with U.S. troops in Mexico even com\u00ad mented that \"anesthetics poison the blood and depress the nervous system, and, in consequence, hemorrhage is more apt to occur, and union by adhesion is pre\u00ad vented.\" Ether was first used in the Army with official sanction in 1849 to detect a malingerer whose supposedly immobile knee flexed readily when he was anesthe\u00ad tized. The standard supply table allowed two pounds of sulfuric ether for every 100 men by 1849, at which time chloroform was also added to the list of regularly used drugs, and by 1852 medical officers at many and perhaps all posts administered anesthetics during operations.\" Reports of deaths reSUlting from anes\u00ad thetics, especially from chloroform , began to appear early in the history of their usc, although a physician who had adminis\u00ad tered one or the other to 600 patients re\u00ad corded no fatalities.

THE STATE OF THE ART found to prevent these tragedies , some sur\u00ad geons still used this anesthetic at the time of the Civil War, and it became popular during that connict because, unlike ether, it was not nammable and it put the patient under quickly and peacefully. Chloroform remained the anesthetic of choice for eye surgery until the introduction of cocaine as a local anesthetic after the Civil War. Sul\u00ad furic ether, however, was regarded with less suspicion. Some saw its odor as its only significant drawback, and poorly trained doctors tended to prefer it because of its supposedly foolproof character. Statistics on deaths associated with the use of ether became available at midcentury. They re\u00ad vealed that, whatever the reason, death rates during and after surgery without anes\u00ad thesia were higher than those for opera\u00ad tions conducted upon an etherized patient. 32 In the period before 1861, sulfuric ether and chlorofor m (or a combination of the two) were the two most popular anes\u00ad thetics, but other forms were tried. Most often mentioned was a product mislead\u00ad ingly called chloric ether, which was ac\u00ad tually chloroform dissolved in alcohol in various proportions. Many surgeons at Boston's Massachusett s General Hospital preferred chloric ether to either sulfuric ether or chloroform in its regular form.

Despite the willingness of younger surgeons to be more adventurou s, as late as 1861 severe compound fractures or ex\u00ad tensive damage to a joint, blood vessels, or nerves still dictated immediate amputa\u00ad tion, particularly for a soldier wounded in the field. Each instance of compound frac\u00ad ture was usually considered individually, however, before a decision for or against amputat ion was made. The mortality rate appeared to vary with the amount of limb removed.3S Other types of surgery performed before the Civil War included the removal of large portions of bone from shattered limbs, a procedure used in an attempt to avoid am\u00ad putation; ear and eye surgery; restorative surgery, which included the rebuilding of damaged lips and checks and the relief of the binding of burn scars; and abdominal surgery. Successful abdominal surgery to deal with intussusception (prolapse of a length of the intestine into itself) and ob\u00ad structions, though rare, was reported as early as the 1830s. Doctors often dosed the victim of a penetrating abdominal wound with opium to quiet the bowel and then left him to nature's mercy, but at least one sur\u00ad geon, Samuel Gross, had experimented soci(JIiOfi 13 (1860):436-37, quote from p. 436; J.

Venesection was customary for the victim of an abdominal wound although this practice was losing popularity by 1861.36 By the outbreak of the Civil War, the instruments regularly used by the military surgeon might well include at least three tourniquet s, two saws of different sizes, several bone-cutters, silver catheters of varying diameters, a stomach pump, and small and large syringes. Artery forceps were used to clamp off arteries during sur\u00ad gery, and the tenaculum, a hooklike instru\u00ad ment, played a progressive ly more important role in surgery as greater care came to be taken in isolating blood vessels. Surgeons were beginning to use catgut for ligatures because it could be left in place and silver wire for sutures and ligatures be\u00ad cause it seemed to promote healing and lessen the danger of hemorrha ge. A new splint had been developed in 1858 that proved simpler to use and less expensi ve to make than its predecessors.\" Although the role played by germs in wound infection was not generally recog\u00ad nized before the Civil War, a few surgeons appear to have at least suspected the role of heat in preventing the spread of infec\u00ad tion and took the precaution of boiling their instruments. Chlorine vapors were sometimes used to disinfect the sickroom, despite the inconvenience caused by the need to remove the patient while the room was treated. Physicians used such antisep\u00ad tics as chlorine or creosote in alcohol, io- \\~Samllc l D. Gross, York: Paul B.

It was more probable, however, that wounds would be dressed with warm water, to which might be added a small amount of spirits of camphor. Regardless of the pre\u00ad cautions taken, infection was always expected.\" The ignorance of physician s concerning the cause of infection and the ways in which it could spread led to complications not often seen today. With hospitals both few and small, hospital gangrene, an infec\u00ad tion probably caused by streptococci, was not common in the United States before the Civil War. Septicemia was frequent and the outcome generally fatal despite bleed\u00ad ings, blisterings, and purgings. Erysipelas was also often seen during the entire pe\u00ad riod, especially in hospitals. In 1818 its treatment called for purging and the ap\u00ad plication of warm, weak mineral water to the inflamed area, but by 1861, dilute tinc\u00ad ture of iodine and soothing lotions were favored as local applications, and quinine, tincture of iron, and nutritious food and drink were also recommended.\" Surgeons of the pre-Civil War period were familiar with tetanus, or lockjaw, al\u00ad though they did not understand its cause, and the various approaches they suggested JlMadgc E.

Opium was popular throughout the period, applied externally or given internally. Tincture of Cannabis, a blister along the spine, and cro\u00ad ton oil were also considered for this pur\u00ad pose. The inhaling of chloroform was suggested, as was the use of morphine with camphor and antimony.'o Even before the wounded could be treated, however, Army surgeons faced the problems of moving them from battlefield to hospital. In an era when the ill and in\u00ad jured were for the most part cared for at home, the problem of transporting these patients was essentially a military one, one that the Army did not face on a large scale until the war with Mexico. During the Sem\u00ad inole wars in Florida, there was no orga\u00ad nized system for moving the wounded to safe and convenient places where they could be treated. During the conflict in the swamps and jungles, wagons or horse litters were used to carry those unable to walk, with the latter favored for particularly dif\u00ad ficult terrain. Since ready-made litters were not issued to Army units, it was necessary to construct them on the battlefield. The litter was generally slung between two horses, which also required both a large number of horses and a considerable pe\u00ad riod of time to fashion the litters from blan\u00ad kets and rawhide; the desirability of having litters made up before the need for them arose soon became obvious. The two-horse litter was used to move the wounded after clashes with the Indians in the West and on at least one occasion in the Mexican War, but wheeled vehicles were more pop\u00ad ular for this purpose. Until the Civil War, however, efforts to have the Army obtain 4OHand, House Surgeon, p. 33; Chisolm, Mallllal, pp. Surgeryallhe Nell' York HospiralOne Hundred Years Ago (New York: Paul B.

The number of medical schools increased in re\u00ad sponse to the need for physicians to care for an increasingly scattered population. Most schools were designed to bri ng ina profit, and since licensing requirements were generally absent, the competition among them resulted in a general lowering of the demands made upon their students. Although a few institutions stood out above the others, most were, as medical historian Richard Harrison Shryock con\u00ad cluded, \"mediocre schools ministering to mediocre personnel.\" Even the best schools fell short of the standard set by the best European teaChing institutions, and the conscientious physician who did not go abroad for his training might be forced to attempt to complete his professional edu\u00ad cation on his own initiative after he had received his medical degree. If he wished to expand the bounds of medical knowl\u00ad edge through research, he would find him\u00ad self almost alone.\" ~IGeo rge A.

O'Malley. ed., The History of IHedical Edllcmiol1 THE STATE OF THE ART The relatively low caliber of many of those admitted to medical schools as well as that of the schools themselves tended to give a bad reputation to all who attended them. A prominent physician of the time, Daniel Drake, maintained that students \"too stupid for the bar, or too immoral for the Pulpit chose to study medicine.\" An\u00ad other commented that because of the de\u00ad ficiencies in his premedica l education , such a student might be \"so ignorant and illit\u00ad erate as to be unable to write his own lan\u00ad guage.\" Although proprietary medical schools often required a three-year appren\u00ad ticeship in addition to attendance at two sessions of lectures, the knowledge gained during the apprenticeship varied widely, according to the interest and competence of the preceptor. Work as an apprentice might, nevertheless, offer the future phy\u00ad sician his only opportunity for training at the patient's bedside. Clinical instruction did not receive the emphasis in the United States that it did in Europe; as late as 1849 only nine medical schools in this country made hospital attendance a requirement, while only sixteen schools so much as of\u00ad fered their students an opportunity for clinical training. Few students were likely ever to have seen a stethoscope, clinical thermometer, ophthalmoscope, or micro\u00ad scope, since most schools did not own such instruments. Medical college libraries tended to be quite small. The training of\u00ad fered in anatomy was likely to be weak since cadavers were difficult to obtain, and rumors of grave robbing could still precip\u00ad itate scandals.\" (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: UCLA Press, 1970), pp. 476, 483, 486, 501. 4JQuotcs from Daniel Drake, Praclical Essays all 6-7, and F.

The U.S. Army, which after 1832 accepted physicians only after they had passed an examination , found that, as late as 1860, 50 percent of the ap\u00ad plicants were unqualifi ed, many being de\u00ad fective in the areas of preparatory education, practical anatomy , pathology, and clinical medicine. The fact that these candidates had failed the Army's exami\u00ad nation did not, of course, prevent them from practicing medicine as civilians wher\u00ad ever they chose, no matter how slight their skill, since very few states retained licen\u00ad sing requirements. When a physician concerned by the weakness of his own professional training wished to remedy its deficiencies by pri\u00ad vate study, he often turned to medical so\u00ad cieties and professional publications. Although their number grew with time, medical societies during the first half of the century were few and were usually located in large cities. The number of medical pub\u00ad lications available also grew, although some journals were very short-lived. By 1851 eighteen were being published within the United States. These journals, as well as books, many from abroad, enabled the American physician to keep abreast of medical developments in the United States and in Europe.\" Many Army surgeons in the period con- Andrew Boardman, \"An Essay on the Means of Im\u00ad proving Medical Education and Elevating Medical Character,\" in \"The the American of tile Medical Sciences,\" ,'.tledical Life 36 (1929):587 -88; Nathan Smith Davis, History q/ Medical Edllcatioll and Illstitutions ill tile United Slates (Chicago: S.

Their ar\u00ad ticles covered such disparate topics as cures for scurvy, medical topography , or anat\u00ad omy, erysipelas of the head, amputation at joints, inflammation and fever, and vac\u00ad cination. Among books by Army surgeons were Samuel Forry's The Climate of the United States and lls Epidemic Influences and several volumes replete with detailed statistics and other data concerning mete\u00ad orology and disease published by the Med\u00ad ical Department. Army surgeons were also caught up in what has been called a \"com\u00ad pulsive obsession \" to learn more about nat\u00ad ural science and anthropology and worked to catalogue or record their observations and collections made on the nation's frontiers.4 5 ~5Edward Lurie, \"An Interpretation of Science in American physicians of the period pre\u00ad ceding the Civil War devoted little time or interest to learning through research. One of the few exceptions to this rule was an Army surgeon, William Beaumont. Beau\u00ad mont took advantage of the opportunity presented him in the form of a permanent fistula in the abdomen ofa private patient, Alexis St. Martin, who was suffering from the effects of a shotgun wound. From 1822 to 1834, whenever his reluctant patient could be persuaded to remain with him long enough, the Army surgeon performed experiments aimed at discovering the se\u00ad crets of human digestion.\" The book Beaumont published in 1833 on his experiments described how he in\u00ad serted various morsels of food by means of a silk string into St. Martin's stomach and observed their fate in order to study the process of digestion. In one series of ex\u00ad periments Beaumont recorded the temper\u00ad ature of that organ during the process. It is interesting to note that he was intrigued by the possible effects of weather and soil con\u00ad ditions upon the digestion. He enrolled St. Martin in the Army as an orderly in 1832 to ease the burden of supporting him, but early in 1834 the unenthusiastic patient crossed the Canadian border in the general direction of his former home. On this oc\u00ad casion, Beaumont was able to persuade St. Martin to return to him so that he could resume his research. the Nineteenth Century: A Study in History and Beaumont's Rendezvou s With Yale Journal oj Biology and Medicine 8 (1938): 113-26.

Beaumont's efforts to learn the exact composition of the gastric juice he ob\u00ad tained from St. Martin's stomach, however, met with repeated failure. None of the ex\u00ad perts he consulted could add much to what he was able to ascertain for himself. Even the great Swedish biochemist Jacob Ber\u00ad zelius disappointed Beaumont , blaming his inability to determine its exact chemical composition on the age and small quantity of the nuid sent to him. The final blow fell in the spring of 1834 when, after accom\u00ad panying him on a series of visits to medical societies, Beaumont 's sole source of the vi\u00ad tal nuid left again on what was to have been a short visit to his family in Canada, but this time never returned. Repeated at\u00ad tempts over a period of many years to get him to do so failed, and thus Beaumont 's experiments came to an end. Beaumont was among a very few Amer\u00ad ican physicians conducting research of real significance in the first half of the nine\u00ad teenth century, and his work received fa\u00ad vorable international attention. The attitude toward such endeavors prevalent in medical circles in the United States, 25 BEAUMONT'S ILLUSTRAT ION OF ST. MAR\u00b7 TIN'S WOUND IVilh the stomach prolapsed.

Conclusion In the period from 1818 to 1861, medi\u00ad cine and surgery were slowly approaching a new era. These four decades, however, were for many doctors a time of increased confusion and uncertainty. The gradual death of the dogmatic , unscientific medi\u00ad cine of centuries past brought both physi\u00ad cians and their patients face to face with the profession's ignorance and helplessness in the face of infection and disease.The use of anesthes ia brought some relief from suf\u00ad fering in the 1850s, but it was not accom\u00ad panied by a significant saving of lives. Although the life-and health-saving prop\u00ad erties of Quinine sulfate were recognized , they were not understood. The drive for the reform of medical education and the search for fact rather than theory would gain 26 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTME NT, 1818-1865 strength in the generation after 1870 and lead to rapid progress in medical science. Only in the next century, however, would the United States assume a position of leadership in the medical world. For the patient, military or civilian, who was con\u00ad cerned with his health and his life, the pe\u00ad riod from 1818 to 1861 was a bleak one. CHAPTER 2 Laying the Foundation, 1818-1835 The War of 1812 did not dispel tradi\u00ad tional American distrust of a strong per\u00ad manent military organization. At the war's conclusion, the U.S. Army was allowed for a few years to revert to its previous peace\u00ad time character as a small collection of reg\u00ad iments without either an overall command or a central organization. When, however, in the spring of 1818, the reform efforts of such men as Secretary of War John C. Cal\u00ad houn finally bore fruit, one of the first three permanent staff departments Congress created for the Army was a Medical Department. Organization and Administration As formed in 1818, the new Army Med\u00ad ical Department strongly resembled the or\u00ad ganization that had been created as a temporary expedient during the War of 1812. Medical officers, although commis\u00ad sioned, had no rank and thus remained out\u00ad side the military hierarchy and without status. The principal departure from the previous pattern involved eliminatin g the positions of hospital surgeon and hospital surgeon's mate, changes apparently dic\u00ad tated by a belief that the general hospitals they staffed would not be necessary for a scattered peacetime army of 7,000 men. The head of the new department, who re\u00ad ported directly to the secretary of war, was given the title of surgeon general. A sub\u00ad ordinate Apothecary Department, man-aged by an apothecary general, was reestablished to handle the purchasing as well as the compoundin g of medicines. Francis LeBaron, the same physician who had served as apothecary general during the War of 1812, was reappointed to the position. Although at this time Congress allowed the apothecary general only one as\u00ad sistant, during the three years that his de\u00ad partment existed he actually had two, just as he had had during the War of 1812.' The classifications of post surgeon, reg\u00ad imental surgeon, and regimental surgeon's mate were retained. Men serving as hos\u00ad pital surgeons and hospital surgeon's mates, among them some of the ablest phy\u00ad sicians in the Army, were offered commis\u00ad sions as post surgeons, despite the fact that they would thereby be reduced to a posi\u00ad tion inferior to that of regimental surgeons. Congress retained the ratio of one surgeon and two mates to a regi ment and placed a ceiling of forty on the number of post surgeons. The responsibility for setting up the new medical department was given to Joseph I Unless otherwise indicated, material in this section is based on SGO, !lilli/wi Reports, 1818-61; John F.

The respect his colleagues held for him appears to have eased any resentment that the selection of so young a man for so great a challenge, over more experienced surgeons, might otherwise have caused. His appointment as the first surgeon general proved a wise one.2 In eliminating the positions of hospital ~Ltr, Calhoun to Brown (25 Apr 1818), in The Papers oj 10/111 C. Calhollll, ed. Robert L.

If he adhered strictly to the letter of the law and a war were to erupt, a pos\u00ad sibility the legislature perhaps did not want to consider, Lovell would have no one ready to staff the general hospitals that would receive the seriously ill or wounded together with the overnow of smaller fa\u00ad cilities. Lovell appears to have been well aware of the problems this arrangement could cause. In the regulations he issued for the departm ent, he outlined an organ\u00ad izational framework different from that created by Congress, detailing the duties to be undertak en by hospital surgeons and mates and other staff members. He intro\u00ad duced the position of the medical director, who would be responsib le for the medical care of the sick and wounded of an entire army or of a large geographical area. And for greater efficiency in the management of his staff, Lovell insisted that all surgeons, regardless of their duties, report directly to him in Washington. In 1821 Congress abandoned its at\u00ad tempts to dictate the structure of the Med\u00ad ical Department and classified all medical officers as either surgeons or assistant sur\u00ad geons. In so doing, the new legislation elim\u00ad inated the Apothecary Depart ment entirely, allowing Lovell to assign whom\u00ad ever he wished to handle purchasing. Al\u00ad though the physician appointed to serve as the chief medical purveyor in New York City continued for the remainder of his ca\u00ad reer in that post, the surgeon general was free to change the assignments of all of his purveyors as he wished. The result of the reorganization was a medical department still too small to care for an Army divided into small units func-LAYING THE FOUNDATION , 1818-1835 tioning independently yet flexible enough to minimize the effects of its inadequate size. The complete solution to the problem of understaffing was not within the surgeon general's power. Already the law of 1818 had reduced by fi ve the number of physi\u00ad cians serving in the Army. Although Lovell admilled that a sufficient number re\u00ad mained at that time to give each post one doctor, he emphasized that a single phy\u00ad sician could not adequatel y serve the needs of either the very large or the very un\u00ad healthy post. Unimpressed, in the course of cutting back the size of the Army in gen\u00ad eral, Congress in 1821 again reduced the authorized size of the staff, from 64 to 53, of whom 45 were assistant surgeons. Among those the surgeon general dis\u00ad missed was the once widely respected Ben\u00ad jamin Waterhouse , who had introduced vaccination to the United States but who had also acquired a reputation of being vit\u00ad riolic and greedy, \"a man of talents and sciences [who) has not made himselfa good practical physician.\" Another physician of much military experience who was dropped was one whose \"conduct for in\u00ad temperance\" had become \"a matter of some notoriety,\" and whose mind was \"too much affected to allend regularly to business.\") As the nation expanded westward and the number of posts increased, Lovell con\u00ad tinued to make temperate but insistent pro\u00ad tests against the inadequate size of his department. He pointed out that the stan\u00ad dards of medical care offered to the na\u00ad tion's soldiers would deteriorate if the ratio of surgeons to posts and men as established in 1821 was not maintain ed. He empha\u00ad sized to the secretary of war that, because lFirst quote. Ltf, Calhoun to Monroe ([8 198: remaining Foster Swift to Lovell (9 Jan 1821), RG 112. entry 12. 29 BENJAMIN WATERHOUSE.

Lovell reminded the secretary that the shortage of Regular Army surgeons made it necessary at times to pay private physicians to handle department duties and that in some areas doctors willing to do so were hard to find. Furthermore, they were neither as careful in their use of supplies nor as capable of supervising the sick and wounded as their military counterparts. Lovell maintain ed that a Regular Army surgeon should per\u00ad form the physical examination of recruits because it was more likely that an Army physician rather than a pri vate physician would spot defects that would cause a man to be unfit for military duty. Despite Lov\u00ad ell's arguments, it was not until June 1832 30 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 that Congress authorized the president to name four more surgeons and ten more assistant surgeons to the Medical Department. ' Nevertheless, the law of June 1832 only partially alleviated the shortage of physi\u00ad cians in the Army. To guarantee care for the Army's sick and injured, further re\u00ad strictions on the leave taken by Army sur\u00ad geons soon became necessary. After 1835, granting any leave longer than seven days required approval of the secretary of war. Ironically, in the early 1830s, at the very time that Lovell was urging the appoint\u00ad ment of more medical officers to the de\u00ad partment, a new secretary of war, operating under the mistaken impression that the po\u00ad sition of surgeon general was superOuo us, proposed to abolish it, thus ending the Medical Department's existence as a sep\u00ad arate entity. Secretary John H. Eaton con\u00ad cluded that the surgeon general's duties involved only supply and that these re\u00ad sponsibilities were actually being handled by the Quartermaster's Department. Lovell countered by pointing out that regulations prohibited the Quartermaster's Depart\u00ad ment from buying medicines and hospital supplies, which since 1821 had been pur\u00ad chased by a Medical Department surgeon stationed in New York City. He also em\u00ad phasized that the administrative respon\u00ad sibilities of the Surgeon General's Office were broad and included \"securing the professiona l responsibility of [the department's] several officers, a strict ac\u00ad countability for public property and a ma- ~Ltrs.

' The caliber of the surgeons serving under him was another of Lovell's concerns. He sought both to attract promising young physicians by increasing their salaries and to weed out incompetents by means of ex\u00ad aminations for entry and promotion. His campaign for higher salaries was launched in the fall of 1818, when he pointed out to Secretary of War Calhoun that competent surgeons would be reluctant to join the Army or to remain long in it if their com\u00ad pensation was not increased above the $40 to $45 a month then offered. a sum less than that paid line officers with similar lengths of service. Calhoun's initial efforts to have the salaries of Army surgeons raised were not successful. The surgeon general was himself paid $2,500 a year, a salary lower than that of many comparable officers in other branches of the service. Urged on by the pleas of his subordinates, however, he continued to emphasize the need for higher salaries. In 1828, for ex\u00ad ample, he commented that, except for the forage allowances for their horses, the most senior assistant surgeons received only $3 a month more than the greenest second lieutenants' At last, in 1834, the Medical Depart\u00ad ment's entire pay scale, except for the sal\u00ad ary of the surgeon general, was raised and the principle of greater pay for longer ser\u00ad vice established for its members.

Those who served in eithcr rank more than ten years were to receive double rations. Nevertheless, although their pay was keyed to that of Regular Army officers, Army sur\u00ad geons still had not been given rank.' The shortage of Army surgeons forced Lovell to sign contracts from time to time with civilian physicians, who were paid by the department on the basis of the size of the units to which they werc assigncd. Those caring for the sick and wounded of a unit of 100 or more men recei ved $40 a month. For 50 to 100 men, the fee was $30 a month; for 50 or less, $20 a month. The doctor providing his own medicines or sup\u00ad plies might receive 25 to 50 percent above these rates, Although higher pay might encourage able physicians to enter the Medical De\u00ad partment, it obviously would neither dis\u00ad courage incompetent s from applying nor cause those already in the departmcnt to resign. Lovell emphasized the problem he faced in this regard when he described one physician in his department as \"so illiterate that he cannot spell his own name,\" so old that he had no intention of ever joining his regiment, and so unequal to the responsi\u00ad bilities of an Army surgeon that hc had been forced to resign an earlier appoint\u00ad ment as regimental mate \"to avoid an ar\u00ad rcst for incompetence.\" Neither the legislation of 1818 nor the dcpartment's regulations, however, made provision for weeding out such men. Appointments were 7Llrs. Calhoun to Johnson (21 Dec 1818), in Ca/\u00ad houn Papers 3:413: Lovell to Sec War (8 Nov 1828) and to Thomas H.

Since the examination was rarely given, only Lovell's vigilance could bar entry to incompetent surgeons or elim\u00ad inate those already there. Nevertheless, the department's physicians soon acquired an enviable reputation among those most fa\u00ad miliar with their work. In 1827, for ex\u00ad ample, the inspector general of the Army, George Croghan, commented that \"The army is truly fortunate in having such a medical corps ... More than once I have questioned myself, how it could be that the government were enabled to employ such professional worth and talents at so paltry a price.\"8 Some question exists as to exactly when Lovell modified his regulations to include the requirement that all candidates for ap\u00ad pointment to the department or for pro\u00ad motion within it pass an examination by an Army medical board. This requirement was first activated in 1832, at a time when states were beginning to eliminate licensing exams for pri vate physicians and exams were not required for other Army officers. From that time onward, no one joining the Medical Department was spared these tests. Even former Army surgeons desiring to return to the department were required to take them.

Phy\u00ad sicians appoint ed to the department between the time when the new regulation was issued and that of the first examination a year later received conditional appoint\u00ad ments and either took the tests when of\u00ad fered or left the Army. Assistant surgeons who had served five years in the depart\u00ad ment were required to take the promotion test in order to remain in the Army. They were not required to take a promotion should they pass; since assignments were based on seniority within grade, and tran\u00ad sition from senior assistant surgeon to ju\u00ad nior full surgeon might bring with it an undesirab le change of post, refusal of pro\u00ad motion was not unusual. Those who failed might try the exam again after two years, but a third attempt was not permitted. To retain eligibility, any candidate who passed the examination but did not receive an ap\u00ad pointment within two years had to repeat the process' Lovell's campaign to upgrade the de\u00ad partment still faced serious obstacles. The relatively low salaries and the specter of months of constant exposure to disease in desolate surroundings undoubt edly dis\u00ad couraged many able young doctors. One department physician pointed out, \"The 9Thc two preceding paragraphs dealing with Med\u00ad ical Department examinations are based upon Rod\u00ad ney Glisan, Journal oj Army Life (San Francisco: A.

Neverthe less, Lovell could offer intangible rewards to the ambitious. He encouraged his surgeons to send geological, zoological, and botanical specimens back to interested scientific in\u00ad stitutions. His open and unselfish support of Army surgeon William Beaumont's pi\u00ad oneering work in the field of human diges\u00ad tion suggested that, despite the hardship s, the Army Medical Department could offer opportunities to men of talent. ,. Lovell's concern for the welfare of the department' s surgeons also led him to at\u00ad tempt to consider the preferences of indi\u00ad vidual physicians when making assignments. The alternatives for full sur\u00ad geons were few; in mid-1826, for example, Fortress Monroe, Virginia, and West Point were the only posts open to them, and the remainder were assigned to regiments. The choices available to assistant surgeons were more numerous and some medical officers remained at one post for as long as twenty years, but both surgeons and assistant sur\u00ad geons, as a rule, were quick to request transfers if their assignments were not en\u00ad tirely to their liking. In 1825 the depart\u00ad ment initiated a requirement that Army physicians remain at least two years at their IOFirst quote, Ltr, Lea to Lovell (2 Oct 1820). and second, Ur, T. J. C.

But the problem was still not entirely solved, and Lovell was irritated to learn that some med\u00ad ical officers, including Thomas Lawson, who would be his successor as surgeon gen\u00ad eral, were rushing to request changes of as\u00ad signment as soon as the two-year period had passed.\" Lovell's attempts to please everyone ac\u00ad tually led to discontent among some mem\u00ad bers of the department. Lawson, who responded to Lovell's suggestion that he was too \"pugnaciou s\" with a fourteen-page letter of 16 October 1825 reciting his su\u00ad perior's failings, accused the surgeon gen\u00ad eral of, among other things, favoritism in the granting of appointments. \"Some of the Surgeons,\" Lawson wrote, were \"about to apply for a Reorgani zation of the Medical Staff\" and unless prevented from doing so by difficulty in agreeing about how to pro\u00ad ceed, they would formally try to \"effect a new organization, or to produce a change in the present system of government under the existing organi zation of the Medical Staff.\" In 1830 the secretary of war as\u00ad sumed the final responsib ility for assign\u00ad ments, but some relaxation in this rule was allowed in 1834, when those with three years or more of service within grade were granted their choice of vacant posts.\" Despite their many duties, some sur\u00ad geons, particularly those assigned to small posts, had free time. With salaries less than generous, the temptation to take on private patients must have been strong.

Early in October 1818, for example, Lovell wrote Calhoun that a surgeon at Norfolk, Virginia, was being permitted to continue treating pa\u00ad tients who had no connection with the Army. In 1820 Beaumont mentioned seek\u00ad ing permission to care for sick and injured civilians at Mackinac Island, where no other physician was available for 300 miles; fortunately for American medicine , his re\u00ad quest was granted. In 1834, although the prohibition against private practice had been reiterated, the adjutant general ruled that several military surgeons who had raised the question had permission to treat civilians as long as their doing so did not interfere with the performance of their as\u00ad signed duties. This ruling appears to have 34 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 represented the official attitude toward pri\u00ad vate practice. I J In the course of his private practice, the Army surgeon also often cared for civilian workers and military families on the base. The extent to which he was officially re\u00ad sponsible for civilians in these categories, however, was not always clear, even to members of the department. By the time of Lovell's death, it was apparently under\u00ad stood that the surgeon was not required to care for anyone who was not in the Army, although it appears that he was permitted, as a rule, to supply medicines for the fam\u00ad ilies of the soldiers at their posts and to provide hospital stores for ci vilian workers. In unusual circumstances, surgeons could also supply medicines to anyone in des\u00ad perate need who was unable to pay for his own.14 Lovell's ambitions for his surgeons ex\u00ad tended beyond the provision of the best possible medical care for the Army's sol\u00ad diers. His appreciation of the new depart\u00ad ment's unique opportunity for significant contributions to medical science led to a requirement that department physicians participate in attempts to establish the re\u00ad lationship of meteorological factors to health, a step he had urged before he be\u00ad came surgeon general and one proposed during the War of 1812 by James Tilton, then head of the U.S. Army's medical ser\u00ad vices. Early in the course of his service as surgeon general, therefore, Lovell ruled that the surgeons under him must submit reports on the diseases they treated and on the weather and climate, as well as on land\u00ad scape features, such as elevation, drainage , IlLtrs, Lovell to Calhoun (2 Oct 1818), in Calholln Papers 3:185; Adjutant General (AG) to J.

Lovell did not initially receive the cooperation he wished from his sur\u00ad geons, who appear to have retained the nonchalant attitude toward reports that characterized their predecessors. Within two years, however , he was able to com\u00ad ment that his orders were being obeyed.\" With the aid of these detailed reports, it is possible to achieve some understanding of the sick rate with which the Medical De\u00ad partment had to contend more than 150 years ago. One author has determined that the rate of hospital admissions, largely as a result of fevers, digestive ills, and respi\u00ad ratory diseases, was on the average live times higher from 1819 to 1829 than, for example, it was in 1949 and that the mor\u00ad tality rate was fifteen times higher. Since no separate reporting category listed the number of men suffering from alcoholism and the effects of intemperance, even Lov\u00ad ell himself could only assume that this problem played an important role in much illness and death attributed to other causes. Although these morbidity and mortality rates seem shocking in the late twentieth century, they did not seem so to Lovell, who commented in 1822 that the death rate in the Army was less than that among young men in civilian JifeY' Lovell's interest in the way in which his surgeons performed their duties did not blind him to the important role that non\u00ad professiona ls, such as nurses, cooks, ward\u00ad masters, and stewards, played in the care of the sick and wounded.

LAYING THE FOUNDAT ION, 1818-1835 years, civilians could be hired to fill these positions, but in 1822 the adjutant general decided, despite criticisms of the poor work performcd by soldiers in hospitals, that only enlisted mcn selccted by the sur\u00ad geons for whom they would work should be assigned thcse responsibilities. Although the permission of the enlisted man's com\u00ad manding officer was necessary for his as\u00ad signment to hospital duty, once the appointment had been made, the attendant was subject only to the command of the surgcon, except in cascs of great emergency. This system did not work as well as the adjutant general had assumcd it would. In 1833 the secretary of war gave doctors in charge of Army hospitals permission, when absolutely necessary to obtain suitable at\u00ad tendants, to enlist into the Army directly from civilian life men who appeared par\u00ad ticularly well qualified.\" Guidelines concerning the size of staffs required by Army surgeons to man their hospitals were set forth in the departm ent regulations. Initially, these regulations statcd that a gcneral hospital would need a steward and a wardmaster , one nurse to every ten patients, one matron to every twenty, and a cook for every thirty. A reg\u00ad imental hospital staff might consist of a noncommissioned officer who served as both steward and ward master, two ma\u00ad trons, a cook, and four nurscs, chosen from among the privates in thc regiment. A hos\u00ad pital for a post garrisoned by a single com\u00ad pany would probably have a private serving as wardmaster and steward and either two nurses or a nurse and a matron. A post of I1Ltrs.

The pay of civilians working in Army hospitals varied from $ I 0 to $ I 6 a month for hospital attendants to $5 for matrons, while enlisted received only their regular pay for hospital work. Whether the matron at this time was still a supervisor of nurses as she was in the Continental Army is not c1car, but she apparently was responsible for cooking, nursing, washing, and clean\u00ad ing. The worth of an intelligent and dedi\u00ad cated steward or attendant was well recognized, but shortages of funds and the absence of a legislative or regulatory pro\u00ad vision permitting an additiona l allowance often frustrated attempts to give enlisted men and noncommissioned officers extra pay. Neverthe less, despite the low pay, at least one steward in the Army in 1835 was himself a highly respected physician.\" The administrative staff assisting Lovell in his Washington office consisted of a sin\u00ad gle clerk, also a physician. He was paid $1,150 a year, and his responsibi lities ap\u00ad parently included a small but growing col\u00ad Icction of books and journals started by Lovell and continued by his successors, the first volumes in what would eventua lly be\u00ad come a vast medical library.

He believed that his close supervision of the work of his sur\u00ad geons and, in particular, his insistence upon regular and systematic reports con\u00ad cerning their use of all forms of department property were responsible for important savings. In the autumn of 1822 he com\u00ad mented that he had succeeded in creating \"a perfect system of responsibility for all public property from the period of its pur\u00ad chase to that of its expenditure\" and that there was no longer any \"possibility of fraud, extravagance or undue expendi\u00ad ture.\" The figures he cited to prove his point appear not to have included the sal\u00ad aries of either regular or contract surgeons but to have been limited strictly to supply and housing costs. They showed that from 1816 to 1818, $7 was paid out per man per year for medical care, but that by 1820 the figure had dropped to $3. It reached a low of $1.72 in 1824 before starting to rise again to $4.60 in both 1827 and 1828; it then dropped again to below $3.20 The overall annual expenses of the de\u00ad partment during the 1820s apparently ran between $23,000 and $30,000, including the costs of hiring private physicians. (Ex\u00ad act figures are not easily obtained because Lovell often reported in the fall only for the preceding eight months of the calendar 19Ltrs, Lovell to Calhoun (24 Jan 1821) and to Sec War (9 Oct 1833), both in RG 112, entry 2, 2: III and 6:252, respectively; Dorothy M.

As Army units were sent ever further west and the need for more sur\u00ad geons grew, the departmen t's annual ex\u00ad penses grew also, approaching $34,000 in 1834. Of these sums, a large proportion went to pay private physicians, an expense the surgeon general had not included in his figure for the average cost per man. In the first eight months of 1824, for example, $5,152.30 was paid out to civilian doctors, while by 30 September 1829, the figure av\u00ad eraged more General's Of\u00ad fice managed actual purchasing for the Medical Department. After the abolition of that office, supply responsibilities were given to a few surgeons and assistant sur\u00ad geons. Items such as cooking utensils, hos\u00ad pital furnishings, and the food used for a regular diet were obtained through the commissary of purchases, the military storekeeper, or the Quartermaster's De\u00ad partment, as appropriate. But medicines, instruments, and special diet items were, as a rule, obtained by medical purveyors directly from merchants. In 1820 Calhoun required that the Medical Department be guided in its ordering of medicines by the \"General Pharmacopoeia\" then being pre\u00ad pared by a medical convention\" The role of the Quartermaster's Depart\u00ad ment in supplying the Medical Department varied. In 1819, for example, Lovell urged that supplies be obtained through the quar\u00ad termaster only when absolutely necessary, but surgeons continued to ignore this in- 21Amel'icall Stale Papers: Military Ajjairs Papers 4:568; Ltrs, Lovell to Lawson (14 Feb 1823) and to O.

Regardless of how supplies were ob\u00ad tained, however, shortages could result from problems created by distance, ship\u00ad wrecks, and confusion over troop move\u00ad ments.

Nevertheless , since Lovell could exert but little control over the sit\u00ad uations his subordinates faced in the field, the Army's physicians were to a large de\u00ad gree on their own in handling the varying difficultie s that they encountered at their posts or while accompanying detachments on the move.24 SUigeons in the Field The life of the Army surgeon and the problems he encountered varied consid- BLtrs.

In the East, a relatively civilized life was possible, but in the West, isolation and an unfamiliar environment often gave rise to situations for which the eastern-raised and trained young physician was not prepared. In the Northeast, many of the diseases he was called upon to treat were the familiar ones of the respirator y system, but in the West, he often encountered malaria and, in the winter and early spring, scurvy as well. In the deep South he fought not only malaria but also diarrhea- like diseases and quite possibly yellow fever. Moreover , the gar\u00ad rison of the fort to which he had been sent might have its own peculiar problem s, those that resulted, for example, from bad water, lead poisoning, or alcoholism, all factors that might be included among the \"morbific agents ... which it falls to the lot of [the military doctor) to encounter.\" \" Wherever he was stationed, east or west, the Army surgeon, unlike his civilian coun\u00ad terpart, had to deal with men living closely together, among whom disease could spread rapidly. Once enlisted men fell ill, they would be gathered together in one place and, being subject to military disci\u00ad pline, were easier to treat than civilians, each in his own home. On the other hand, in the military hospital, and especially in wartime , soldiers would be exposed to cross infection, a problem that was essen\u00ad tially nonexisten t in private homes. Unfortunate ly, the facilities available for the accommoda tion of the Army's sick often left much to be desired, even by the standards of the time. In one instance, a \"small, but conveniant [sic) Hospital ... comfortabl 1839 (Washington: Jacob Gideon, Jr., 1840). p. 62 (hereafter cited as Statistical Repol\"I. 1819-39). 38 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 plied\" managed by \"a competent, in\u00ad telligent and faithful Steward\" lacked an attending surgeon. In many more in\u00ad stances, the reverse was true; the surgeon was present at the post, but no hospital fa\u00ad cilities awaited his patients. The housing that sheltered the sick and injured at such posts was often so damp, poorly ventilated, and crowded as to further threaten their health. In late 1835, of the thirty-one posts in states along the East and Gulf coasts and in the District of Columbia from which surgeons reported, twelve had no hospitals, and those at three more were rated as poor.26 One of the eastern posts without hospital facilities was Fort Hamilton in New York Harbor. Here the sick were housed in case\u00ad mates that lacked adequate ventilation and heal. Even in moderate weather the rooms might become unbearabl y hoI.

Initially, Stewart blamed the most common ailment, \"an cons/ipGliol1 oj/he il1leSlines\" accompanied by fever, on the water, which tasted strongly of iron, but he later suggested that the cause was rather a steady diet of salt pork. A surgeon sent to inspect the post disagreed, stating that he believed the con\u00ad stipation to be \"merely symptomatic, pro\u00ad duced by a peculiar state of the bile, and of course referable to all those causes which affect the bilious secretion. At Fort Mc\u00ad Henry these natural causes,\" he added, were \"aided by habits of inveterate dnlll\u00ad kenness; for I never, among the same num\u00ad ber of men, heard of so many addicted to intemperance,\" 28 The disease afnicting the men at Fort McHenry and nearby Fort Severn appar\u00ad ently grew worse with time, and by 1819 its victims were being stricken by \"frequent attacks of inflammation of the brain, end\u00ad ing in delirium, apoplexy, and death.\" In the year from March 1819 to March 1820, thirty-nine men at Fort McHenry were af\u00ad flicted in this manner, and sixteen died from convulsions. The number of cases dropped when a unit camped at some dis\u00ad tance from the fort (and possibly also at some distance from the suppliers of hard liquor), and speculation arose that the cause of the illness lay in the atmosphere at Fort McHenry.

By 1826 it had become customary to send the troops from the fort to camp at Huntington, Maryland, in late June.\" Although meningitis could have caused some of the illness at Fort McHenr y, it is entirely possible that chronic alcoholism was a basic part of the health problems there, accompanied, perhaps, by malaria during the summer and early fall months. Many symptoms could have resulted from lead in the cheap whiskey the men drank, since in 1829 the formation of a temper\u00ad ance society at the post was followed by an improvement in the health of the garrison. ~'JQuotc from War Department, SGO.

In the second quarter of 1822, for example, twenty-eight of the Army's total of forty-one deaths took place there. Dysentery, diarrhea, and malaria, all complicated by intemperance , took a high toll at Baton Rouge, where, in 1819, 1822, 1827, and 1830, the threat of yellow fever also added to the sufferings of the garrison. Despite the post's notorious reputation , its hospital facilities were entirely inadequate .\" The surgeons who struggled to deal with the problems at Baton Rouge blamed the poor health of the garrison on the lack of acclimatization of the recruits, the intem\u00ad perance of the men, their long work in the hot sun, their poorly constructed barracks, and even, in June 1822, on the \"entire ab\u00ad sence of rain.\" Lovell, on the other hand, eventually concluded that the presence of ponds, old buildings , and a graveyard lo\u00ad cated south of the barracks was responsibl e for the high rate of disease, apparentl y be\u00ad cause of the miasmas they engendered .\" The problem of inadequate housing for the men at Baton Rouge was solved in 1824 with the construction of a new barracks, and it appears that by 1825 the health of the men was improving .

It would appear, however, that by the time the hospital was completed in 1839, the need for such a facility was no longer as great as it had been in the 1820s when Lovell first urged that it be built.\" In contrast to Baton Rouge and Fort McHenry , Fort Mackinac , on Mackinac Is\u00ad land in Lake Michigan , was representative of the healthiest posts in the nation. (Map /) In a cool climate and cut off from the rest of the world from November through the winter, the fort shared the is\u00ad land with 500 French Canadian s and half\u00ad breeds who lived in the village of Macki\u00ad nac, one of a chain of trading posts that lay along the Mississippi River and the shores of Lakes Michigan, Superior, and Huron. From Mackinac each fall, voyageurs, among them at one time Beaumont' s fa\u00ad mous patient, Alexis St. Martin, set out in boats laden with goods to trade with the Indians for furs, returning in June and July of each year. Indians also came to Macki\u00ad nac to trade, and the population fluctuated by several thousand , according to the season. )4 In 1821 Fort Mackinac consisted of three intersecting lines of blockhous es and a wall of ten-foot-high pickets, placed at the top of a steep hill.

The fort's isolation made supply particular ly difficult, the post medical officer occasionally having to pro\u00ad vide medical services as long as eighteen months without receiving new stocks of medicine. Surgeons ensured a proper diet for their patients by establishing a hospital garden on part of the post's open ground, growing vegetab les as well as opium poppies.\" Its best known Army surgeon, William Beaumont , arrived at Fort Mackinac in 1820, shortly after he was commissioned in the Army for the second time. Because Fort Mackinac was a healthy post, much of Beaumont's work involved maintainin g the health of the 50-to 100-man garrison and treating the victims of various mishaps. These responsibilities were not overly de\u00ad manding, and Beaumont , like his prede\u00ad cessor, was able to gain permission to conduct a private practice, since no other physician lived nearby. J6 From the outset, Beaumont' s concern that the post should have a garden to ensure the continued health of the garrison antag\u00ad onized both the Indian agency on the island and the fort's commanding officer, who had given the agency permission to erect a )sLtr, Beaumont to Lovell (I Nov 1820), RG 112. entl)' 12; Surgeon's Quarterly Rpt, Fe Mackinac (30 1820), 94, entry 634; Bailey, \"Army Sur\u00ad geon,\" p. 574.

But because Beaumont believed so strongly in the importanc e of the garden for the health of the men, he wrote the War De\u00ad partment to complain; his plea was appar\u00ad ently heeded, and the garden remained.\" Partially as a result of his concern for the prevention of disease, many of Beaumont 's patients were the victims of mishap rather than illness. Among those he treated was an artillery private who had been clubbed in a brawl. Although the surgeon trephined the victim's skull in an attempt to relieve the pressure on the brain and to remove bone fragments, he was unable to save this patient's life. He was more successful with a would-be deserter who had survived a week wandering without food, drink, shel\u00ad ter, or a source of warmth at a time when the nighttime temperature s ranged from 200 to _140 F. A visitor who had experienced a relapse of what he reported as \"lake fe\u00ad ver\" (presumab ly malaria) while traveling from Detroit to Mackinac was one of Beau\u00ad mont's few patients suffering from disease. Although he had initially appeared to be hopelessly ill, under Beaumont's care the newcomer recovered.38 Although the demand placed on the hos\u00ad pital at Fort Mackinac did not equal that at such posts as Baton Rouge and Fort McHenry, Lovell, Beaumont, and Beau\u00ad mont's successor at Fort Mackinac in 1825 all urged the construction of a new hospi\u00ad tal. Lovell pointed out that the old struc\u00ad ture was not fit for the use of healthy men, much less for the sick, who, because of the leaky roof, occasionally had to abandon their beds during heavy storms.

When rebuilt on the same foundation, this facility was capable of sheltering up to four\u00ad teen patients and remained in use as a post hospital until 1859.\"1 The life of the surgeon whose assignment sent him to the farthest reaches of the west\u00ad ern frontier could be particularly grim. Many posts were even more isolated than Fort Mackinac and yet they suffered dis\u00ad ease rates that at one time or another ri\u00ad valed those at Baton Rouge and Fort McHenry. Isolated garrisons might be spared the inroads of such diseases as chol\u00ad era or typhoid fever but suffer terribly from scurvy during the winter and early spring, when fresh vegetables and fruits were unobtainable, and from malaria in the summer and early fall. Disease often dec\u00ad imated expeditions sent out from Western forts to explore unfamiliar territory, escort traders, or contact Indian tribes. Although some surgeons might regard an assignment to a frontier post as a challenge, at least one mourned the necessity of spending \"his best years ... on a pestilential frontier. with no incentives to honorable ambition, & no society save that of drinking, swear\u00ad ing, tobacco chewing companions.\"\u00b7o Among the frontier posts established early in the period when Lovell was sur\u00ad geon general was Fort Snelling, located in present-day Minnesota at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. One ofa chain of forts designed to guard against the inroads of both Indians and British fur traders, Fort Snelling occupied a site of great natural beauty and, initially, of great isolation.

Supplies intended for the men who were to build Fort Snelling were damaged in transit, and the fort itself had not yet been built when, despite the efforts of the Army surgeon who accompanied the men, disease struck the 228-man garrison. It appeared \"in almost malignant form, and raged so violent that, for a few days, garrison duty was suspended, there being barely well men enough in the command to attend to the sick, and to the interment of the dead.\" Symptoms appeared so sud\u00ad denly that a man who went to sleep ap\u00ad parently healthy might never awaken. The surgeon general, assuming the problem to be scurvy, blamed the absence of vegeta\u00ad bles, but he considered hard work and sleeping in wet clothes to be additional fac\u00ad tors contributing to the sickness that swept the camp. Others, however, blamed the lack of fresh food and bread covered with mold. From the suddenness with which the disease produced fatalities, something other than scurvy may have also been af\u00ad flicting the garrison. Given the inadequate 44 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 ~ '. -, , .; . it ! , MISSOURI: dated 23 November /8/9, (Courlesyo!Western Americana Collection, The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale Universily.) diet, it is possible that the sudden deaths were related to a thiamine deficiency, But surgeons of the period were too familiar with scurvy and its causes to have entirely misdiagnosed the problem, and sudden death can result from scurvy after any sud\u00ad den and marked fall in blood pressure, Re\u00ad ports on the number of deaths vary, but it appears that as many as 40 or more out of the 100 men in the 5th Infantry died in the cold of 1819 to 1820, before the use of rem\u00ad edies such as \"strong decoctions of hem\u00ad lock boughs\" and the arrival of supplies from the South brought the problem to an end.41 4(First quote, H.

Six of the ten rooms in a stone bar\u00ad racks became the home of the hospital. The lesson of the preceding winter had not been forgotten , however, and the soldiers took time off from the construction work to plant ninety acres to corn, potatoes, wheat, peas, and other crops. The availability of fresh vegetables no doubt played a role in the fact that the annual death rate from 1822 through 1825 was I to 4 in a garrison of 250 to 300 men, and that most of these deaths resulted from respiratory diseases rather than dietary deficiencies. \" The physicians assigned to Fort Snelling during the 1820s and 1830s included sev\u00ad eral who gained distinction for reasons not directly related to their professional tal\u00ad ents. The first officer to die while on duty at Fort Snelling, for example, was the post surgeon, Assistant Surgeon Edward Pur\u00ad cell, who fell victim to an unspecified ill\u00ad ness in 1825. A second surgeon, Robert C. Wood, gained a small amount of fame by marrying a daughter of the future president of the United States, Zachary Taylor, the colonel command ing Fort Snelling in 1828. In so doing, Wood also became for a brief time brother-in-law to the future president of the Confederate States, Jefferson Davis, whose first wife was also a daughter of Zachary Taylor. Another doctor, John Emerson , assigned to Fort Snelling in the Evan Coward-McCann, 1966). At Ft.

The surgeon was often the best-educated man at a post; hence it is not surprising that one of the finest accounts oflife at Fort Snelling came from the pen of yet another medical officer there, Nathan Jarvis. Jarvis was also reputed to be a gifted caricaturist as well as an artist with pencil and sketch pad. To his responsibilities as post surgeon he added those of teacher of the fort's chil\u00ad dren and librarian for a garrison library of over 400 volumes, newspapers , and peri\u00ad odicals. He was also, it would seem, a mu\u00ad sician; he once wrote his brother requesting that he be sent an accordian, \"for amuse\u00ad ment,\" which, Jarvis was confident , could be purchased for \"$3 or 4.\"43 Jarvis' letters to his family suggest that, despite the fort's isolation , life was not en\u00ad tirely unpleasant at Fort Snelling in the 1830s. One Christmas Eve, for example, a major entertained \"with a splendid supper consisting among other delicacies of the season of venison, roast pig sausages , mince & pumpkin pies ... and many other kickshaws too numerous to mention. \" On Christmas Day, after an \"excellent dejeu\u00ad ner [a]la fourchette [substantial breakfast with eggs, meat, etc.] at II o'clock,\" the company went in sleighs to the nearby wa\u00ad terfalls. Upon their return, Jarvis and his fellow officers had a supper \"which was su\u00ad perb,\" while \"Music & Songs c1os'd the amusement of the day.\" Also during the holiday season, Jarvis \"for the first time rode in a dog train. It was drawn by 4 dogs harnes'd ahead of each other the leader 4.lLtr, Jarvis to William Jarvis (2 Oct 1834), Papers of Nathan Jarvis, New York Academy of Medicine, New York, N.Y.

Broad sheets of light shot from the zenith directly overhead to the edge of the horizon in every direction like radii from a centre illuminating the heavens like noonday and affording one of the most beautiful displays I have ever witnessed. To increase the beauty of the spectacle the 44Ltr, Jarvis to William Jarvis (31 Dec 1834). in Jarvis Papers. light of the Aurora was ting'd of a most beautiful orange color.\" Jarvis' record of his expenses throws some light on the finances ofa post surgeon in this period. His pay may have been de\u00ad ficient in relation to his responsibilities, but at a time when a physician trying to establish a new civilian practice might con\u00ad tract with an entire family for a year's care for $10, Jarvis reported that his total in\u00ad come from the Army, which presumab ly included both pay and allowances , was a relatively munificent $82 a month. In ad\u00ad dition, he received $100 a year from the Indian agency for caring for Indian patients-his predecessor had also re\u00ad ceived 25 cents an Indian for vaccinating 500 against smallpox. Another medical of\u00ad ficer estimated that $100 a year came from his private practice, giving him an income of approximately $1,200 a year. Of this to\u00ad tal he paid out about $25 a month for food, his servant, laundry, the maintenance of a horse, and similar expenses. His income may appear modest, but when Purcell wrote his brother about his own assignment to Fort Snelling, he confessed that although \"You may think it strange that I have con\u00ad sented to go with the Regiment out of the world, as you may call it, the fact is that I go, not because I like it, but because of thinking that I can make money.\"\" At Fort Snelling, as at other early posts established in the winter, scurvy was the principal health threat, and the greening of the vegetable garden spelled an end to 4)Ltr, Jarvis to William Jarvis (30 Nov 1835), in Jarvis Papers. 4f>Quotc from Ltf.

The Medical Department quickly established a hospital at the new fort, but, like many other post hospitals, it left something to be desired, since it was badly arranged and its chim\u00ad neys smoked. A minimum of two surgeons was assigned to Fort Leavenwort h at all times, a step made doubly necessary by the repeated illness of the surgeons themselves. So severe were the health problems, how\u00ad ever, especially those caused by fevers, that the inspector general recommended the post's abandonment. Although its garrison was at times drastica lly reduced to protect the health of the men, Fort Leavenworth remained in use. In an attempt to minimize the onslaught of disease, an \"admirable po\u00ad lice [was] maintained, [and much] atten\u00ad tion paid to the health of the men,\" but heavy drinking complicated efforts to im\u00ad prove the command's health.\" \"7Quote from Surgeon's Quarterl esp. 30 30 SCI', and 31 Dec 1830. 30 Sep 1831. and 30 Scp 1833). and Ltrs, Edward Macomb to Lovell (I Dec 1835) and Gale to Lovell (\\ Oct 1828). all in RG 94. entry 634: Ltrs.

Although the men were spared scurvy despite their relative isolation (probably because of their successful gar\u00ad den), fevers of one kind or another so se\u00ad verely afflicted them that, in a bad season, one to five in each company might die. In August 1822, malaria sent half of one com\u00ad pany to the post hospital, and the year as a whole saw 47 of the 206-man garrison die. Many men, trusting neither the sur\u00ad geon, Thomas Lawson, nor the post hos\u00ad pital, attempted to treat themselves ; some of those who blamed the water for their problems undertook to purify it with rye whiskey. Colonel Matthew Arbuckle, com\u00ad mander of the post in the early 1820s, blamed the purifying agent for the health problem at Fort Smith. Calomel was used as a preventive during the sickly season, but medicine s disappeared rapidly because of disease's heavy onslaught and supply was a problem. In the period from 1831 to 1833 alone, eight privates and an assistant surgeon died at Fort Smith, and the sur\u00ad vivors were weakened by repeated bouts of fever and possibly by heavy dosing with calomel as well. As a consequence, in 1834 the fort was abandoned , only to be reoc\u00ad cupied four years later.\" Surgeon Lawson appeared to have added considerably to the troubles at Fort Smith, /783-/846 (New York: Macmillan Co., 1969), pp. 179. 224. 1963). p. 14; Ltrs, O.

Even before his arrival, he was involved in a wide-ranging feud with his colonel. Highlights of this feud in\u00ad cluded the trouncing of Lawson in a fist\u00ad fight by a lieutenant who supported Arbuckle, the bringing of charges against Arbuckle by Lawson and Lt. Col. Zachary Taylor, the placing of charges against Law\u00ad son by Arbuckle , and the filing of counter\u00ad charges against Arbuckle by Lawson. At least one modern authority on the subject believes that Lawson resented Arbuckle's popularity with the women at the post. In the final analysis, all parties concerned sur\u00ad vived the charges with their careers intact, including Taylor, who later became presi\u00ad dent, and Lawson, who succeeded Lovell as surgeon general.\" Men from Fort Smith were among those who established Fort Gibson, Oklahoma , in the 1820s. This post was yet another where health problems were frequent and severe, but it could not easily be aban\u00ad doned. It was a base from which important expeditions set out and to which came many refugees, including Indian women and children seeking shelter from tribal warfare engendered by the federal govern\u00ad ment's removal policy. From 1824 through 1835,561 enlisted men and 9 officers died at Fort Gibson, described by one surgeon as \"the charnel house of the Army.\" More than half of the deaths occurred in 1834 and 1835 alone, years when the more dan\u00ad gerous form of malaria, remittent fever, was more prevalent than usual, and tuber\u00ad culosis was also causing deaths. Although cholera did appear at the fort, it was prob- 49Bearss and Gibson, ForI Smith, pp. 55-56, to Aug RG 94, M565, roll 6, 6:374; Lawson to Lovell (31 Mar 1821) and to Edmund R.

The surgeons also cared for the victims of respiratory diseases, drun\u00ad kenness, and the harsh physical punish\u00ad ments meted out to enlisted men. So great was the rate of sickness and disability that in 1831 an addition was ordered for the log hospital that had been completed only four years earlier. The commandi ng officer, Colonel Arbuckle, apparently had little en\u00ad thusiasm for the hospital addition , and its completion was long delayed. '0 Disease and the remedies used to combat it also plagued the many expeditions that set out from Fort Gibson. Among the most unfortunat e of these undertakings was one led by Brig. Gen. Henry Leavenworth , who in the spring of 1834 joined dragoon units that had already arrived there from Jeffer\u00ad son Barracks. Assigned to the newly formed Regiment of Dragoons were a surgeon, Clement A. Finley, who later served briefly as surgeon general in the early months of the Civil War, and two assistant surgeons. The men under their care were already sickly, and at least one soldier blamed an unnamed medical attendant at the fort for their condition. It may have been this med\u00ad ical officer who had fallen into the habit of treating almost every complaint with cal\u00ad omel, his favorite mercurial remedy, with- ~OQuote from Leonard C.

His patients would gradually decline, their countenances merging from the rosy hue of healthfulness into the sallow and ghastly likeness of dis\u00ad ease, their firm step giving way to the totter of decrepitude; their strong arms shaking with a nervous tremour; their bright eyes become sunken and dilated, and, in fact, through a cause of either willful neglect or gross mal-practice, brought down within a short period of time from the health, and buoyancy, and joyousness of youth, to a premature grave,SI The dragoons were already six weeks be\u00ad hind schedule when they finally set out from Fort Gibson on 15 June to bring peace treaties ready for signing to the villages of the Pawnee and Comanche Indians near the headwaters of the Red River.

As an officer described it, Nature would seem to have conspired with an imbecile military administration for the destruction of the regiment. On, on they marched, over the parched plains whence all moisture had shrunk, as from the touch of fire; their martial pomp and show dwin\u00ad dled to a dusty speck in the midst of a boundless plain; disease and death struck them as they moved; with the false mirage ever in view, with glassy eyes, and parched tongues, they seemed upon a sea of fire. They marched on, leaving three-fourths of their number stretched by disease in many sick camps; then, not only destitute of every comfort, but exposed with burning $IJamcs Hildreth.

General Leavenworth him\u00ad self was fatally injured when his horse fell during a buffalo hunt. Fewer than 200 men actually reached their goal at the Indian villages and one of the assistant surgeons left behind with patients at a sick camp was extremely ill himself by the time the re\u00ad turning troops reached him\" In early August, as the dragoons began their return to Fort Gibson, the sick list continued to grow. One soldier wrote, \"The sickness is now becoming verry [sic] alarm\u00ad i ng as we have a great many deaths every day.\" Four or five died daily, and the mor\u00ad tality rate averaged 21 percent. The cause of their sufferings, according to artist George Catlin, who accompanied the ex\u00ad pedition, was fevers \"of a bilious nature, and contracted by exposure to the sun, and the impurity of the water,\" among which could have been hepatitis and typhoid fever as well as malaria') The dragoons were ordered out from Fort Gibson on another expedition shortly after their return, but from 140 to 150 men were still too sick to march; 3 to 4 died each day. It was hard to say which was worse, the fort or the road, since a high rate of disease characterized both. In the sum\u00ad mer of 1835, Fort Gibson was described as \"the worst and without doubt the hottest and most unhealthy in the U. States,\" where the families of the men were con\u00ad stantly sick and the quarters of the men themselves rotten, leaking, and crowded. nphilip St. George Cooke, Scenes, p. 225.

The surgeon had reportedly been overheard to state that there had been 600 cases of illness at the fort in the quarter ending 30 September 1835. By the early months of 1836, the commandin g general of the Army was strongly urging the aban\u00ad donment of the fort. In the summer of 1836, however, it was still in use, too sickly to occupy yet too strategic to desert.\" The Black Hawk War In 1832 men and surgeons from many Army posts joined the successful campaign to prevent the return of members of the Sac and Fox tribes led by Black Hawk to their former lands east of the Mississippi. To meet this threat, the secretary of war or\u00ad dered 200 men from Jefferson Barracks, near 51. Louis, Missouri, to move north, and 1,000 men stationed in the east to move west via the Great Lakes under Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott. Still more men came in from Fort Leavenworth and were joined by others from Forts Winneba go and Craw\u00ad ford in modern Wisconsin. Surgeon General Lovell ordered one of his surgeons, Josiah Everett, to leave his post at Fort Monroe, Virginia, to serve as medical director for General Scott's men and sent other Army physicians to join him from such posts as New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Forts Niagara and Gratiot. Others were called back from furloughs to meet the need. Surgeon Thomas Mower, handling medical supply in New York City, was warned to be ready to supply the needs of surgeons ordered to the front and to pre- S4Army and NallY Chronicle 1 (1835):279.357 ,397, quote from 279. pare, in addition, \"a full supply of medi\u00ad cines. Hospital Stores Dressings and Bed\u00ad ding for 1,000 men according to the supply table, with such addition to the essential medicines and to the dressings as you think advisable for active service.\" By 20 June sixteen Army surgeons had been ordered to the Northwest frontier, their specific as\u00ad signments being left in the hands of the commanders in the field.\" The real enemy these surgeons soon faced, however, was not Black Hawk and his warriors, but cholera. In the two battles fought with the Indians, regular troops suf\u00ad fered only minor losses, but cholera, mov\u00ad ing west, first with General Scott's men and then with those who came into contact with them, overwhelmed the surgeons and dec\u00ad imated the forces they served.\" The first man reported to have con\u00ad tracted cholera in the Army appears to have been a passenger on the transport /-Iellry Clay. After he became ill on 4 July when the ship was near Detroit, because of the disease on board, city authorities refused to permit the men on the Henry Clay to land. Two men from an eighty-man artil\u00ad lery unit that had landed a day earlier came brieny on board, however, and both men died three days later of cholera. By the eve\u00ad ning of the same day, five more cases had appeared among the artillerymen.

At last the men were put ashore near Fort Gratiot and tents and beds set up, and a large barn was taken over for use as a hos\u00ad pital. Some men ned the camp in total ter\u00ad ror not long after landing, only to die in the nearby woods, where wolves waited to devour their bodies. Thirty-nine perished in camp, Everett among them. Despite Kerr's unnagging efforts, by 10 July, be\u00ad tween disease and desertion , a detachment of 400 men had been reduced to 150. Al\u00ad though Scott's men had not been taken into Fort Gratiot itself, cholera began to appear among the men of the garrison, and by 14 July, despite the best efforts of assistant surgeon Henry Steinecke, 21 inhabitants of the fort had died.\" On board the She/doli ThompsolI , cholera did not appear until after a stop at Fort Gratiot, where some of her passengers were put ashore because of serious overcrowding on board. On 8 July she stopped at Fort Mackinac and left off four more who were sick. She then proceeded to Fort Dearborn , at Chicago, where three passengers died, their illness not immediately recognized as cholera. The day after the ship left Fort Mackinac, more passengers fell ill, and the diagnosis of cholera became unavoidable. By the time the ship reached Chicago on 10 July, seventy-seve n cases of cholera had been identified. Fort Dearborn was quickly !7Jamcs M.

While his men were being cared for by two assistant surgeons, General Scott warned all comers away from the fort in order to prevent the spread of the disease to troops actually engaged in fighting. At the fort, however, 200 men had been taken into the hospital in the space of a week, and 58 dieds, An increasing number of men from the artillery unit that arrived at Detroit early in July were becoming ill, and the city au\u00ad thorities finally insisted that they, too, leave the immediate area. On 9 July these men were moved to a site about thirteen miles from Fort Gratiot. The vessel that had brought them picked up the men Gen\u00ad eral Scott had left behind, all of whom still appeared healthy, and continued on toward Fort Mackinac. The artillerymen, mean\u00ad while, were moved once again to a spot three miles from Detroit. By 12 July, 17 or 18 of them were dead, and before the ep\u00ad iderr.ic abated, 21 had died and 4 deserted.

The wounded from the campaign were left at Fort Crawford while, in late July, the rest of the army moved on to Fort Armstrong , at Rock Island in present-day Michigan , with cholera following in their footsteps.

Among the dead was another Army doctor, but Surgeon Clement Finley and two assistant surgeons continued to care for those who fell ill.'\" The entire fort at Rock Island soon re\u00ad sembled a hospital; deaths occurred so rap\u00ad idly that no time was available to dig individual graves. Bodies were \"thrown confusedly-just as they died, with or without the usual dress-into trenches, where a working party was in constant at\u00ad tendance; and it is a fact that an officer in charge of it, making inquiry as to some de\u00ad lay on one occasion , was answered that there was a man who was moving, and they were waiting for him to die.\"61 Sometimes with the unwitting aid of the veterans of the Black Hawk War, cholera then spread to other forts across the nation in 1832 and 1833. Baton Rouge was spared until 1833, when 8 died from this disease. In the third quarter of 1833 there were 150 cholera cases at Fort Gibson, with 16 deaths. The toll taken in the Army in 1832 6OPhalen, \"Cholera Epidemic: :332. 61Cookc, Scenes. p. 193. alone, however, was 686 cases with 191 deaths; and there was a possibility that some cases had not been reported or were misdiagnosed. The impact of cholera was far greater than that of the Black Hawk War that had helped to spread it. The best efforts of both Lovell and the Army's surgeons were of no avail in the face of a devastating disease that the physicians of the period were pow\u00ad erless to prevent or cure and of the wide\u00ad spread panic it caused. Conclusion Nevertheless, Lovell's unceasing effort to improve the number and caliber of the sur\u00ad geons in his Departme nt, to regulate the Department 's expenditures, and to guard the health of the nation's soldiers had be\u00ad gun to show positive results. Although pre\u00ad vention and cure remained often impossible, better care brought a death rate among the nation's soldiers that compared favorably with that among young men in the civilian population . The consequences of Lovell's work became clearer when the Army was called upon to meet its first pro\u00ad longed challenge since the War of 1812, the Second Seminole War of 1835-1842. CHAPTER 3 Indian Removal in the Southeast: The Second Seminole War The growing determination of both state and federal governments to remove the Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Seminoles to new lands west of the Mississippi encountered varying degrees of resistance from the members of these Five Civilized Tribes. Even before 1818 the pressures brought to bear upon them had induced some groups to undertake the long journey to a land inhabited by unfamiliar and hostile Indians. Others had delayed, hoping that they would never actually have to leave, but by December 1835 represen\u00ad tatives of all five tribes had officially com\u00ad mitted their peoples to the move west, and the Choctaws had already completed their emigration to lands beyond the Missis\u00ad sippi. In the years that followed, except for many members of the Seminole tribe and, to a lesser degree, of the Creek, even the most reluctant of the forced migrants left the lands of their forefathers without vio\u00ad lent resistance to follow the long and wretched trail to the western territorie s.'

Its inroads placed a great strain on the Medical De\u00ad partment , but just as the magnitude of the problem was becoming obvious and when the conflict was less than a year old, Sur\u00ad geon General Lovell died. His successor, the Department's senior surgeon, Thomas Lawson, was neither as talented a physician nor as level-headed an administrator. Lawson was already familiar with the sit\u00ad uation in the southeast, however. \"More soldier than doctor,\" he had served as a lieutenant colonel with a Louisiana vol\u00ad unteer unit in the early months of the war, resuming his medical duties as the depart\u00ad ment's senior surgeon in March 1836. He had served as temporary head of the gen\u00ad eral hospital at Tampa Bay, Florida, in April, in May joining the troops at Fort Mitchell, Alabama , who would be sent to Florida when they were no longer needed to enforce Creek emigration. When Lovell died in the fall of 1836, Lawson was serving as medical director for the units fighting the Seminoles. Not eager to take up his du\u00ad ties as surgeon general, he remained in Florida for several months before traveling to Washington to escort retiring President Andrew Jackson to his home in Tennessee. He remained in Tennessee a short while before returning to Washington , but soon left once again for Florida, abandoning his 54 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 EUGENE ABADIE . (Collrtesy of National Li\u00ad brary of Medicine .) medical responsibilities in favor of the command of a volunteer unit late in 1837 or early in 1838.2 Lawson retained the overall organization of the Medical Department that Lovell had created, but his direction of the Depart\u00ad ment's work in Florida soon demonstrated that he was a different man from his pred- 2Quote from Percy Moreau Ashburn, If History of lite Department of the United Stales Army (Boston: Houghton Mimin Co., 1929). p. to Lawson (26 May and 23 Sep 1836) and Benjamin King to Lawson (3 Nov 1836) and to Thomas Lee (28 Feb 1837), all in RG 112, entry 2, 7:460 and 8:53. 89, and 243, respectively; Macomb to Lawson (20 Sep 1837) and Smith to Lawson (6 Mar 1838), both in Lawson Papers, LC; Lawson to King (28 Mar 1837). in Benjamin King Papers.

Throughout his years as surgeon general, Lawson's occasional tempera\u00ad mental outbursts suggested that time had neither thickened his skin nor lengthened his temper since his days on the frontier. Apparently convinced that the best defense was a strong offense and ever jealous of his own authority , he did not suffer criticism or frustration lightly. Removal oj lhe Creeks Lovell was still surgeon general, however, when President Jackson decided that it was necessary to move Army units into Geor\u00ad gia, Alabama, and Florida to force the re\u00ad moval of the Seminoles and Creeks, a step that had the added effect of intimidatin g the most reluctant members of the other three tribes. Although the Creeks put up less resistance to removal than the Semi\u00ad noles, the possibility of wholesale active re\u00ad sistance caused the Army to order sixteen companies of regular troops from artillery and infantry regiments, more than 1,000 men, south by mid-1836 to assist over 9,000 state troops in rounding up the re\u00ad luctant members of this tribe in prepara\u00ad tion for their removal. In the course of the following six months, over 14,000 Creeks left the area under Army escort.' The Medical Department provided med\u00ad ical supplies for some of those going west, including the Cherokees , Choctaws, and Chickasaws, for which it was reimbursed from a special fund by the \"Indian de\u00ad partment ,\" and medical officers also vac\u00ad cinated large groups from the various tribes for smallpox. At least one Army surgeon, Eugene Abadie, was sent with the Creeks and specifica lly designated \"Surgeon to Emigrating 115: Pru\u00ad cha, Sword, p. 260. INDIAN REMOVAL IN THE SOUTHEAST 55 surgeons assigned to Army escorts, physi\u00ad cians accompanying groups of migrating Indians were apparently usually civilians. Abadie reported that many Indians fell sick during their march, fevers, dysentery, and diarrhea being the most common ills, and that many died, especially the very old and the very young. Abadie appears to have left the Creeks shortly after their arrival in the West, for he was at Fort Brooke, Florida, in August 1837.' Some of those whose duty it was to assist in the removal of the members of these tribes were well aware of the tragedy in\u00ad volved. Although he was not assigned to accompany the Creeks as they moved west, Assistant Surgeon Jacob Rhett Motte, who was then attached to one of the artillery units in the territory of the Creeks, studied their language and learned to respect them as a people. He watched at least 500 Creeks being brought in chains to Fort Mitchell, Alabama, and deplored the melanchoiy spectacle as these proud mon\u00ad archs of the soil were marched off from their native land to a distant country, which to their anticipation s presented all the horrors of the infernal regions. There were several who committed suicide rather than endure the sorrow of leaving the spot 4QUotcs from Ltrs, Lawson to T. H.

The failure of his attempt to escape the round-up drove one warrior to self\u00ad destruction; the fact that the only weapon at his disposal was an extremely dull knife did not deter him. With it he made several ineffectual efforts to cut his throat, but it not proving sharp enough, he with both hands forced it into his chest over the breast bone, and his successive violent thrusts succeeded in dividing the main ar\u00ad tery, when he bled to death.' The troops based at Fort Mitchell during the Creek removal suffered primarily from dysentery and diarrhea , which Motte blamed on \"the rotten limestone water of the country.\" The sick were sheltered in two small buildings , each with a ten-foot\u00ad wide piazza shading it from the summer's sun. Both structures were in poor condi\u00ad tion, with split Ooor boards and rooms without ceilings. Neither had been in\u00ad tended to serve as a hospital, but the build\u00ad ing constructed for this purpose was on private land and had been taken over as a home, apparently by the family owning the land. The diseases endured by the men who came to the facility were, for the most part, fevers, probably malarial , and, in hot weather, diarrhea and dysentery. An epi\u00ad demic of measles broke out in the fall of 1836, and the surgeon was occasiona lly called upon to treat the victims of delirium tremens or even of poison ivy. By the sum\u00ad mer of 1836 the facility was serving as a general hospital, taking in both Regular Army patients from the garrison and men from the Alabama volunteers, recently sJacob Rhett Janus ida Press, 1953), pp. 4,19-20,27, quote from p. 20. 56 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 back from Florida and the war against the Seminoles.6 Character oj the Second Seminole War A brief show of strength served to elim\u00ad inate Creek resistance, but an increasing number of attacks on white families and ambushes of small Army units emphasized the determination of the Seminoles never to leave thei r homes. I n the last weeks of 1835, the contlict erupted into open war\u00ad fare. In the guerrilla struggle that followed, Army regulars and members of various state units sent to subdue the Seminoles fought in an unfamiliar and dangerous land, \"healthy in winter but sickly in sum\u00ad mer; ... a most hideous region,\" where in\u00ad sects and bacteria alike throve and multiplied.' The growing threat from the Seminoles caused the Army to establish two new posts in peninsular Florida, Fort King near to\u00ad day's Ocala and Fort Brooke on Tampa Bay. (Map 2) In 1834 both were reinforced. By late 1835 six companies of regulars were stationed at Fort King, three at Fort Brooke, one at SI. Augustine, and one at Key West, for a total of over 500 men and officers. No Regular Army surgeon was available for Key West, where a contract with a civilian doctor had already become 6Quote from Motte, Journey, p. 34; Surgeon's Quar\u00ad terly Rpts, Ft.

The open hostility of the Seminoles who resisted removal came to a head on 28 December 1835, when all but 3 of a 110- man detachment led by Bv!. Maj. Francis L. Dade were killed in an ambush not far from Fort King. Among the dead was the medical officer with the detach\u00ad ment, Assistant Surgeon John S. Gatlin, who thereby became the Medical Depart\u00ad ment's first casualty in the Seminole War, and the only surgeon lost to enemy action. The Army's response to the Dade Mas\u00ad sacre developed into a full-scale military campaign to force the Seminoles to cease their violence and agree once again to re\u00ad moval. For the first five years of a struggle described by one surgeon as an \"inglorious, unthankful and hopeless war,\" the high in\u00ad cidence of fevers and diarrhea-like diseases necessitated an end to active campaigning during the summer months. The Seminoles were thus able to devote the hottest months to planting and harvesting the crops that sustained them and their families through the balance of the year. Since each of the four generals who came and went as overall commanders in Florida adopted this policy in turn, Seminole resistance continued. In 1841, however, the Army placed Col. Wil\u00ad liam J. Worth in command of the troops in Florida. Refusing to be intimidated by the disease rate, Colonel Worth waged war throughout the summer against Seminole homes, crops, and warriors and in a year 'Ltrs, Lovell to Heiskell (25 Sep 1835) and to B.

The connict with the Seminole s was re\u00ad sponsible for almost 1,200 of the 1,500 deaths occurring in the Army between mid- 1835 and the summer of 1842. More than 75 percent of the military deaths in Flor\u00ad ida, an average of 15 each month, resulted from disease. From 1835 through 1839, an average of almost 19 percent were sick at anyone time. The disease rate increased when campaignin g was continued through- 9Quote from Llr, Nathan Jarvis to Benjamin Jarvis (6 Sep 1839), in Jarvis Papers; Thomas Sidney Jesup.

From I June 1841 to 28 February 1842, for example , 5,000 men suffered almost 16,000 cases of disease, nearly 2,200 in June alone. Army surgeons treated an additional 2,428 in July, over 2,000 in August, and more than 1,800 in September 1841. An average of 26 men died each month during the nine months beginning in June 1841, a rate almost twice that for the entire war. Ten of the medical officers who served in Florida lost their lives as a result or the war, but only Gatlin's death came at the hands orthe Seminoles.1O I\u00b0Ltrs. Hciskel to R.

Since it was, even so, a guerrilla war, the requirement for physi\u00ad cians was greater than it would have been had a similar number of men been engaged in conventional warfare. The many small units conducting operations in Florida could not easily share surgeons, isolated as they often were by distance, the primitive terrain, and the enemy's skill at attack from ambush. The high rate of disease made it difficult for a unit to go long without a phy\u00ad sician. Although the organization of the Medical Department was basically suited to this type of warfare, its size was not; the number of available surgeons was not sul~ ficient to permit one to accompany each separate detachment at all times. In the at\u00ad tempt to meet the need, some medical of\u00ad ficers were called upon not only to move about with one detachment but also to change from one unit or post to another at short intervals. To gain maximum advantage from the nexibility he had introduced into the de\u00ad partment 's structure in 1818, Surgeon Gen\u00ad eral Lovell decided that the senior surgeon assigned to Florida should serve as medical director. This officer could move the sur\u00ad geons under him from one position to an\u00ad other at the direction of the commanding general without prior consultation with the surgeon general and require the surgeon or assistant surgeon at a supply depot to serve as purveyor. As a result, the more routine requirements of the war could be managed quickly and efficiently. II \"Llr. Lawson to Edward Macomb (19 Oct 1840), RG 112. entry 2. 12:86. LYMAN FOOT. (Collrtesy of National Li\u00ad brary of Medicine .) Nevertheless the shortage of physicians was increasing ly irritating to Lawson when he became surgeon general. To the secre\u00ad tary of war in 1839 he bristled, \"Nowadays an officer cannot march eight miles with a Sergeants Guard without having a Surgeon attached to his Command, in other words without his own special staff.\" In 1840 he lashed out at Lyman Foot, then the medical director in Florida, apparen tly because Foot, in letting surgeons leave after only two years of service, was adding to Law\u00ad son's difficult ies in providing adequate medical support. Lawson brushed aside Foot's statement that he understood that two-year assignments were official policy, and accused Foot of being concerned only with popUlarity. When, a few months later, the general then commandin g in Florida 60 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 publicly and wholeheartedly praised Foot's work, Lawson raged at what he said was interference with his management of his department.\" Although well aware of the difficulti es he faced, Lawson, like Lovell, used every re\u00ad source at his command to bring adequate care to all who fell ill or were wounded. As early as April 1836, Lovell was able to state that \"every disposable officer of the De\u00ad partment\" had been assigned to duty in Florida, but more were almost continually being requested. When, early in 1837, Maj. Gen. Thomas S. Jesup, then commanding the effort against the Seminoles, added crewmen from a naval squadron to his force, he made a Navy surgeon his medical director, apparently because not enough Army medical officers in Florida had the rank of full surgeon. In this capacity, John A. Kearney was stationed at Fort Brooke much of the spring of 1837.\" Even with help from the U.S. Navy, the shortage of medical officers remained acute. In May 1837 a surgeon wrote Law\u00ad son that Jesup had ordered that the surgeon general be informed of the \"destitute con\u00ad dition of the Medical Department in this country,\" where half the nation's army was being cared for by only a sixth of the de\u00ad partment's surgeons, many of whom were IlQuote from Ur, Lawson to Sec War (9 Mar 1839), RG 112, entry 2, 10:197; Ltrs, Benjamin King to J.

According to Lawson, Kear\u00ad ney added his complaint that there was \"not a medical officer of the first grade in Florida.\" In December 1839, by which time disease had already killed three of his phy\u00ad sicians, Lawson confessed that he could not meet the demands for Regular Army sur\u00ad geons. By late 1839, although at least nine\u00ad teen surgeons were serving in Florida, some were responsible for two or more posts. From the outset, therefore, the Medical Department was forced to hire contract physicians to serve as acting assistant sur\u00ad geons in Florida. Some were assigned to militia units there and one was ordered by the War Department to accompany a small group of Seminoles emigrating to the West in 1836.\" Lawson's frustration at his impotence in the face of the lack of manpower caused him to turn imperiously upon any surgeon who so much as appeared to be avoiding duty in Florida, where little but \"Priva\u00ad tions, hardships, sickness and murder\" awaited. To a surgeon who complained that service in Florida was bad for his \"consti\u00ad tution,\" Lawson wrote, \"it will not do for officers to talk about conSlill/lions or cli\u00ad males ... you have received your orders and must obey.\" To another, who had left Florida maintaining that he was ill and did not hasten to return, Lawson stated, \"If you possess not the exalted sentiments of a sol\u00ad dier whose pride it is to perform his duty with alacrity and cheerfulness, then you may as well understand, once for all, that '~Quotes rrom Ltrs, Charles S.

King, whom he had accused-as he was later forced to admit, unjustly-of scheming to sneak out of Florida, Lawson's apology was principally a defense of his own conduct. The facts as they were known at the time, he main\u00ad tained, amply justified his conclusions.\" Lawson wanted his subordinat es to see the war against the Seminoles not as a pri\u00ad vation but as a golden opportunity since, if assignments were properly rotated, a sur\u00ad geon could gain valuable experience in the field. He wrote both the medical director and the commandi ng general there, urging rotation. The frequent illness of surgeons in Florida made systematic rotation im\u00ad possible, but Lawson became furious when they appeared to ignore his wishes. The medical director's suggestion that matters of assignment , as well as those of supply and the establishme nt of hospitals, were better managed by someone on the scene further irritated the surgeon general. The war was almost over, but the spring of 1842 found him once again raging, this time to the adjutant general, because Colonel Worth, then command ing in Florida, had ordered nine more medical officers out of Florida than Lawson believed wise, and had granted leaves of absence to other sur\u00ad geons, all without consulting Lawson.\" (lQuotes from Ltrs, Nathan Jarvis to Nathaniel Jar\u00ad vis (I Aug 1839), in Jarvis Papers, and Lawson to Stin\u00ad ncdc (12 Jun 1836) and to William W.

Lawson stated authoritatively that other \"tonics\" would serve quite as well; perhaps his failure to realize that this was not so may again be attributed to the fact that he was not on the scene, He informed the purveyor that \"the reckless use of that medicine to the exclusion almost of every other Tonic\" was prohibited, There is no indication that the problem was ever re\u00ad solved, Lawson was still complaining in 1841, when he commented to the medical director: \"Some years ago when the Army was as efficient, or had at least as high a character as now, the Soldiers could\", take Peruvian Bark, , , but nowadays they have become so refined and delicate of ''1Quotc from Ltr, Lawson to Taylor (18 Nov 1839), RG 1 [2, entry 2, 11:73; see also Smith, \"Quinine,\" pp. 361, 363, and Ltrs, Lawson to Sec War (18 lui 1837) and to R, C.

In these institutions, men with chronic illnesses and severe wounds, to\u00ad gether with the patient overOow from crowded post hospitals, could be cared for. Not long after the start of the war, this type of facility was established at Fort Brooke, on Tampa Bay, and in St. Augustine. At about the same time, a convalescent hos\u00ad pital was set up at Mullet Key, southwest of Tampa. The general hospital at Fort Brooke was located on a hill above the Hillsborough River and surrounded by a grove of live oak. It could easily shelter 100 patients, but it was occasionally called on to care for twice that number. Hospital attendants were chosen from the units represented among the patients: a unit with 12 to 24 patients at this facility would provide 2 at\u00ad tendants; one with over 24 would provide 3. Men who were only slightly dis\u00ad abled but not well enough to march were sometimes assigned to remain at the hos\u00ad pital to care for the more seriously ill. The Fort Brooke unit continued in operation until 1840, when it was closed in favor of general hospitals established at Picolata and Cedar Key.

The medical di\u00ad rector in Florida hoped Ihal, because of the good reputation of these sites, the opening of the two new general hospitals there would bring about a saving in expenses for the Medical Deparlment. The hospilal al Picolata on the St. Johns Ri ver was sel up, apparently in 1837, in the upper part of the former hOlel where troops used the base\u00ad ment as a barracks. The unit at Cedar Key opened in the summer of 1840 at a \"beal/\u00ad liji\" location,\" initially in a temporar y building and some hospital lents, while the construction of the permane nt building, 160 by 30 feet and shaded by a 10-foot pi\u00ad azza, was underway.

To this facility shortly after its opening came the sick from several posts in that section of Florida, particularly Fort Mellon and Volusia, both temporarily abandoned because of the high disease rate that amicted their garrisons. The sick from Micanopy, many originally from Fort Drane, were also moved to St. Augustine in the belief that their chances for recovery at Micanopy were poor. As many as 150 sick were gathered at the St. Augustine gen\u00ad eral hospital shortly after its opening, among them one of the survivors of the Dade Massacre, a man whose eventual death evidently resulted more from his heavy drinking than from wounds suffered in the massacre. By September 1836, 225 patients shared the hospital, and three Army physicians, assisted by a civilian act\u00ad ing as assistant surgeon, were busy caring for them. After 1836, however, the largest number there at anyone time apparently rarely exceeded 65. The facility evidently closed sometime during the second half of 1838, torn in its closing weeks by contro\u00ad versy between surgeons and line officers over the acceptab ility of removing experi\u00ad enced men from positions as hospital stew\u00ad ards in order to return them to their units.\" l.ISurgeon 's Quarterly Rpts (31\u00b7 Mar and 30 Jun 1841) and Consolidated Monthly Rpts, Army or Flor\u00ad ida (Apr and Jul 1841), all in RG 94, entry 634; sec also other Rpts, St. John's Hospital (1841-42), RG 94, entry 634. l4Ltrs, Lovell to Russell (20 Aug 1836), RG 112, entry 2, 8:18; H.

In the fall of 1840, patients whose recovery was supposedly being re\u00ad tarded by the effects of the Florida climate were also sent to Fort Columbus , a second New York Harbor post. There was a risk that some patients who were sent north might die along the way, but Medical Di\u00ad rector Foot believed that these were men who would have died even if they had been retained in Florida.\" Not all those who were evacuated were actively ill. The Florida climate was con\u00ad sidered to be so unhealthy that in 1841 an entire regiment was sent north because of its poor health and lack of vigor. The unit was dispersed among northern posts, where it was hoped that its overall health would improve. Although the chronically ill and the se\u00ad riously disabled were eventually sent on to general hospitals or even evacuated, those with lesser health problems often remained at post hospitals until they were ready to rejoin their units.

The hospital here would comfortably hold only twelve patients, but fortunately, diarrhea disappeared as a serious problem after the move. In November, however, the water was again causing comment, and the sur\u00ad geon observed that it was \"either saturated with rotten limestone or the brackish water of the river.\" Fever was the most common complaint, and he noted that \"an offensive and most deleterious malaria\" appeared to characterize the area.

Although from October through March in the years 1838 through 1841, their number tended to be less than six in a quarter, from April through September, when diarrhea and ma\u00ad laria were common, the quarterly average might approach fifty.\" Care of Ihe Sick and Wounded al a Temporary ForI The problems posed by the sick and wounded at the relatively short-lived war- the Civil (1837-41), in RG 94, entry 634.

It appears that when therc was a sur\u00ad geon at such posts, he often managed with\u00ad out the services of anything resembling a hospital. Even at the major temporary posts, facilities for the sick and wounded were likely to be makeshift and less than satisfactory. One temporary post, Fort Drane, was a base of operations for Regular Army efforts against the Seminoles until the summer of 1836, when the unhealthiness of the site, in an area of many small ponds, forced its abandonment by regular troops. A high rate of sickness characterized the garrison here from the beginning. On 28 December 1835, when 250 men left the fort for the battle of With lacoochee, the first major en\u00ad gagement of the war, 100 more men were too ill to accompa ny them. On 31 Decem\u00ad ber, six surgeons, two of them Regular Army physicians, accompanied the troops into action, leaving a hospital surgeon be\u00ad hind in camp with five more men, victims of malaria.H Since caring for the 100 casualties at or near the site of the battle would have been imprudent, as soon as their wounds had been dressed, the most seriously injured were placed on stretchers made of blankets fastened to pine saplings. These litters were then suspended between two horses for the return to the relative safety of Fort Drane. Men with lesser wounds who were unable to walk were moved in springless wagons and their \"shrieks told of the great an\u00ad guish\" their journey caused them. The con\u00ad voy spent several nights on the road, and each night the able-bodied had to cut brush llBcmrosc, Reminiscences, pp. 2, 4, 35-36. 40. 43. 48, 104n. INDIAN REMOVAL IN THE SOUTHEAST 67 for beds. One night six attendants went off without leave, increasing the burden on those who remained. Wounds began to stiffen as the journey progressed, so that before thc sufferers reached Fort Drane, their \"cries and shrieks\" had become al\u00ad most constanLJ-I The tents set up at Fort Drane to shelter the sick and wounded from the elements were scarcely better accommodations than if they had been set up in the forest. Pa\u00ad tients lay two to a bed. Two nurses plus one attendant cared for every ten wounded while twelve cooks prepared the diet be\u00ad lieved necessary for proper healing. As soon as the patients were settled, surgeons began to probe wounds. In recalling the five-hour ordeal, steward John Bemrose, an Englishman of some education who left a valuable account of his experiences, wrote later that \"The grinding of the knife through the sound nesh edged on\" his teeth. Since Indian rines had small bores, only one wound proved fatal. One patient, however, became obsessed with a desire for vengeance and begged to be shown an In\u00ad dian scalp. At last the desired treasure was brought to him, and he burst into \"antics of delight ... over this small portion of nesh belonging to a poor dead Indian.\"\" Although the number of physicians car\u00ad ing for the patients at Fort Drane in the spring of 1836 appears to have been ade\u00ad quate (Bern rose mentions four Regular Army surgeons by name and refers to a fifth as \"the pragmatical assistant surgeon\"), the accommodations still were not. Of the shel\u00ad ters available for the sick and wounded, one tent and a lean-to shed were actually out\u00ad side the protective pickets of the fort, at sites considered more healthful than those .I~lbid. , 58, 61-62, frolll pp. 61. available inside. During a Seminole attack, however, musket balls pierced the walls of the tent, and surgeons had to move it to a safer location, even though it was \"neither so pleasant nor so healthy.\" Patients in the shed, which was open along one side to both sun and rain, were \"in a deplorable condition.\"36 As spring progressed toward summer, the rate of disease increased. Half of the 274- man garrison was sick in June, and in time a total of seven buildings within the bounds of Fort Drane were filled with patients. Conditions became deplorable for every\u00ad one. \"All suffered from the malignancy of disease and the comfortless state in the fort,\" wrote Bemrose. \"Some were filthy in the extreme, others without the necessary clothing.\" Insects of all sorts and descrip\u00ad tions joined them, undeterred by either pickets or guards. \"Sand nies and mosqui\u00ad toes were innumerable .... Centipedes, cockroaches, scorpions, with immense spi\u00ad ders, were daily tenants of the place .... The sand of the fort was full of chigoes [chiggers], and a sort of black nea. This latter was the greatest [pest] to all of US.\"37 Some of the men stationed at Fort Drane (where, in Bemrose 's words, \"the misery of soldiering was certainly very great\") developed emotional problem s. The ever\u00ad present fear of Indians, who \"had a constant habit of prowling around our sen\u00ad tinels for the purpose of picking them off,\" the exhaustion brought on by guard duty under these circumstances, the equally con\u00ad stant danger of disease, the isolation, all added to the strain on the occupants of the fort in the spring and early summer of 1836.\" lttlbid\" pp. 94-96, 112, entry 12. J8Bcmrosc, Remilliscences, p. 103. 68 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 Among those for whom the pressures be\u00ad came intolerable was a West Point-trained officer who escaped what he could not en\u00ad dure by placing the muzzle of his pistol in his mouth and pulling the trigger. He \"thus blew out his brains, hurrying his soul into perdition.\" An enlisted man was led in from his post, shrieking \"Indians, Indi\u00ad ans,\" to die, raving mad, \"the dread of In\u00ad dians being so great upon him as to affect his brain.\" One of the fort's surgeons with\u00ad stood the strain with difficulty. He became increasingly irritable, erupting into threats of physical violence, including an offer to \"give the stupid mortals a drubbing ,\" whenever a patient gave him the smallest difficulty. Although he survi ved his tour at Fort Drane, by the time he left, his depres\u00ad sion had become so deep that \"A continual dark hour seemed to be upon him. He ... passed through his multifariou s cases with scarcely cognizance of his duty.\"\" The principal health problems at Fort Drane, however, were not mental but phys\u00ad ical. Surgeons used great quantities of qui\u00ad nine daily to combat the fever that afflicted many within the fort, often causing delir\u00ad ium and even death. Up to five might die from it in the space of twenty-four hours; some bled from the nose in the hours im\u00ad mediately before their deaths. The implied ineffectiveness of quinine suggests the problem may have been typhoid fever. Among those disease killed in May was the fort's commanding officer, Col. Julius F.

By the middle of that month, over 3,000 shared the protection of the post. The expansion of the fort in April and the repeated evacution of patients whose prompt recovery could not be expected al\u00ad leviated some of the crowding. But for those leaving the fort, danger waited. In June a convoy of the sick and wounded was twice attacked , ten to twelve were wounded and two killed. The surgeon accompanying the group was wounded. \" An Army Surgeon in the Field A majority of the Medical Department's surgeons in Florida during the Second Seminole War worked without the advan\u00ad tages offered by general and permanent post hospitals. Many moved about repeat\u00ad edly from temporary forts to even more temporary camps that rarely had facilities of any kind in which patients could be seg\u00ad regated from their healthy comrades and kept both comfortable and safe. In Florida the surgeon's post was always that of danger too; during winter, in the field sharing alike with all his brother officers their fatigues, privation s, and perils. In summer, while his fellow campaigners were resting from their past toils and dangers, in anticipation of new ones the coming winter, ... he was pressing the pulse oflanguid sickness, and breathing the pestiferous exhalations of crowded hos\u00ad pitals in some unhealthy \"Ultima Thule\" of the wilderness. He had but one conso\u00ad lation; the consciousness of dicated, all material concerning Motte's work in Flor\u00ad ida is based on this work. INDIAN REMOVAL IN THE SOUTHEAST 69 Assistant Surgeon Jacob Rhett Motte's experiences and peregrinations in the Southeast from 1836 to 1838 suggest the nature of the challenge faced by the Army surgeon assigned to that part of the country during the Second Seminole War. Motte was at Fort Mitchell, Alabama, in the early summer of 1836. In July he was sent to Tuskegee to care for the men of an artillery battalion. Scarcely had he arrived there, however, when he was ordered to a camp fifteen miles from Tuskegee to cover for Surgeon Elwes, who was once again ill. Here Motte treated the victims of what he called typhoid fever as well as sufferers from dysentery. In September he was or\u00ad dered to join an artillery unit on its way to Fort Mitchell where forces were gathering to join the fight against the Seminoles. Here he encountered Lawson, who as med\u00ad ical director for the Army in the South promptly ordered Motte to accompany units going to the southern counties of Georgia, \"a low, swampy part of the coun\u00ad try ... [with] the worst possible reputation for health.\"'.! On the way to his new assignment , Motte came down with fever. When he finally be\u00ad came too ill to ride his horse, he was placed in a wagon whose \"thick covering,\" he later recalled, \"afforded my burning brain no protection against the heat of the vertical sun in this latitude ... the constant jolting over rugged roads and roots of trees was fast driving me into a dreadful tempest of delirium.\" At last he could go no further. The convoy left him at a log house ten miles from the Florida border, to be cared for by its owner. By the end of October he had recovered sufficiently to rejoin his unit in Lowndes County, Georgia, and to camp 4Jlbid .. p. 34. with them in a pine barren, at Camp Town\u00ad shend, Georgia.44 Camp Townshend appears to have made a strong impression upon Motte; although he did not remain there long, he described it in lively detail in his memoirs. The sce\u00ad nery consisted of \"burned and decaying trees, pig-pens, log-huts.\" By he enjoyed watching \"the little tad\u00ad poles and polywogs as they frisked and frol\u00ad icked in the muddy pools.\" At night his \"attentive neighbours the screech-ow ls and whooping cranes would commence enter\u00ad taining us in the most delicate manner, at the expense of their melodious voices. These flattering attentions, however, were not properly appreciated by us, owing no doubt to our not possessing a correct taste for music.\" The nightly forays of the pigs of the area, however, particularly appealed to Motte's dry sense of humor. In their comings they displayed the wisdom of Solomon. Not a snout was visible before tatoo (tattoo) [sic]; but as soon as that sig\u00ad nal for an exit into retiracy was completed, on they came, grunting, snorting , and squeaking,-old boars, little pigs, and all; forming a concert of sweet sounds .... Their serenades were met on our part with base ingratitude; by the shade of Mozart! instead of listening to their dulcet tones with marked applause, and inviting them to partake of refreshments after such ex\u00ad ertions, as is usual among a refined and serenaded people, we impolitely and un\u00ad gratefully gave the sentinels peremptory or\u00ad ders to expel them at the point of the bayonet.\" For several months after his stay at Camp Townshend, Motte accompanied ex\u00ad peditions seeking out Creek troublemakers in southern Georgia and northern Florida. In May 1837 he briefly came to rest at the town of Newnansville, Florida. His enjoy- 44Jbid., p. 40. 4sIbid., p. 44. 70 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 ment of the fine airs affected by the pop\u00ad ulace of this town was not to last long, how\u00ad ever, for in June he was ordered to Fort Mellon, Florida, to replace yet another sick surgeon, but the health of the men at Fort Mellon was so bad that he could see no alternative to its abandonment, which took place a week after his arrival there. So Motte was once more on the move-but before he could reach his destination at St. Augustine, he was again sick. Leaving the boat that was taking the men from Fort Mellon north, down the St. Johns River, Motte recuperated for a week on shore be\u00ad fore resuming his journey. When he finally did arrive at St. Augustine, he was imme\u00ad diately given orders for Fort Harlee, where the surgeon had fallen ill. In August, when he left Fort Harlee, Motte was sent to Fort Peyton, near St. Augustine. In September , an expedition was formed to capture some of the Indians near Fort Peyton, and Motte was assigned to accom\u00ad pany the 170-man detachment, which in\u00ad cluded two dragoon companies, an artillery company, and two companies of Florida volunteers. No casualties resulted from this operation, but a second shortly thereafter resulted in the death of an officer. By the time a third such foray was undertaken, Motte was once again sick, and another as\u00ad sistant surgeon at the post took his place with the men. In November Motte accompanied a de\u00ad tachment going south on U.S. Navy vessels to New Smyrna, on the east coast. While on the journey, Motte served as fleet sur\u00ad geon for the crews of ten to twelve \"Mack\u00ad inac boats\" and a sloop-rigged flagship. In January 1838 he was again moving south, this time to Fort Pierce, located on the west bank of the Indian River, with a dense pal\u00ad metto forest at its back. When an expedi\u00ad tion was sent up the Indian River shortly after his arrival, Motte was left behind. He was not idle, however, for twenty-two wounded from a combined Army-Navy ex\u00ad pedition were brought in and he joined the dragoon surgeon at the post in caring for them.\" In late January, since the dragoon sur\u00ad geon was still exhausted from the long march from Missouri's Jefferson Barracks , Motte accompanied the cavalry into the field. He was present at a skirmish with the Seminoles on the shores of the Loxahatchee River in which Maj. Gen. Thomas S. Jesup, then in command of the army in Florida, was wounded in the face. Seven men were killed in this engagement and thirty wounded. The casualties were carried to the foot of a spreading oak, beneath whose widely-flung branches were strewn a score of dead and dying. There before us lay death in his most horrible forms; bodies pierced with ghastly wounds, and locks be\u00ad grimed with gore. In one direction, leaning against a tree, there reclined a soldier of the Artillery; his face pale, and o'erspread with an expression of anguish; one hand pressed to his side, from which the blood slowly oozed. In another direction lay stretched upon the ground, with face turned upwards, and glazed eyes wide open, one whose marble cheek too plainly told that the rifle ball which had entered his temple had truly done its mission; ... In one spot sat a party of wounded upon the ground, a surgeon binding up their bleeding wounds, with hasty but skilful hands; a little farther off, reclined one upon a cloak; his closed eyes, and calm smiling expression of features like that of a sleeping man, indicated an exemption from pain; true, his sufferings were over; he had gone to that place where physical pain is unknown.47 After the battle, Motte apparently re\u00ad turned to Fort Pierce with the wounded , but the rest of the force pushed southward ~6Ibid . p. 155. Hlbid., p. 197. INDIAN REMOVAL IN THE SOUTHEAST 71 to establish Fort Jupiter in \"a most hideous region, in which nothing but serpents and frogs can exist. The Indians themselves say they cannot live there after March.\" In Feb\u00ad ruary, however, Motte was also on his way to Fort Jupiter. He felt ill even before start\u00ad ing out but remained silent for fear that he would be left behind. Before long he again found himself suffering the tortures of travel in an Army ambulance wagon. When he reached the new post on II February 1838, he was forced to take to his bed, one that consisted of a single \"blanket beneath separating me from the bare ground, my saddle for a pillow to my aching head,\" with nothing \"but a thin and threadbare old tent, of the smallest dimension to pro\u00ad tect me from the maddening rays of the sun above,\"48 After two weeks of suffering, Motte was on the way to recovery and by the end of March was able to join a fifty-man dragoon detachment moving further so uth in an at\u00ad tempt to capture the Seminole chief known as Abiaka or Sam Jones. The men on this expedition reached Fort Lauderda le in April. Joined there by several companies from the artillery regiment, they proceeded by boat to Key Biscayne. For several weeks the search for Abiaka continued, both among the islands and on the mainland at its southern tip. At last, however, Motte had found a part of Florida that appealed to him. One camp was lo\u00ad cated, for example, in an area that could, in Motte's opinion, with very little trouble be converted into a perfect Eden. The cocoanut, the banana, 48First quote, Ltr, from an Army officer at Jupiter Inlet (Jan 1838), in Theodore Francis Rodenbough and William L.

Swarms of deer abounded in the forests close by; and most delicious spring water flowed from the rock under the bluff of the shore. This was indeed the land of flowers, and no wonder that the Seminoles desired to remain in a country where food was as plentiful, and as easily procured as manna by the Israelites.\" By the end of the month the food supply was running out, and the expedition's lead\u00ad ers were considering abandoning the search. One company of artillerymen was sent back to Tampa Bay while the dragoons and a regiment of artillerymen remained for one last search. Although this attempt to capture Abiaka also failed, the Army mistakenly believed the war to be drawing to an end at this time and several regiments were ordered north to Cherokee territory. Motte accompanied the I st Artillery regi\u00ad ment on its journey to St. Augustine and thence to Charleston, South Carolina. On 16 May 1838, ajoyous Motte arrived safely at Charleston, the town of his birth. Motte was, of course, but one of many surgeons the Medical Department sent to Florida in the period 1835 to 1842. By June 1842, however, Colonel Worth's relentless campaign was obviously bearing fruit, and by August the war would be officially over. Most of the twenty-six surgeons still in Florida in June were soon reassigned to other parts of the country, since only two regiments were required to watch over the less than 300 Seminoles who remained east of the Mississippi.'o 49lbid., p. 229. S{)Ltrs, Benj. King to Martin (14 Apr 1838) and Heiskell to Jones (25 Jun 1842), both MEDICAL 1818-1865 Conclusion The basic problems the Medical De\u00ad partment had encountered in the Southeast during the period from late 1835 to the summer of 1842 originated in factors be\u00ad yond its control. The nature of the conflict, which involved many small units fre\u00ad quently on the move and often isolated in primitive terrain, and the climate, which favored the development of both fevers and diseases of the digestive system, placed de\u00ad mands upon the small medical staff that it could not completely meet, especially when surgeons themselves were falling ill again and again.\" In spite of the stress that the Second Seminole War placed on the Medical De\u00ad partment , the confusion, the feuds, the shortages, and the serious inadequacies that had haunted both the Continental Ar\u00ad my's Hospital Department during the American Revolution and the short-lived U.S. Army Medical Departm ent during the War of 1812 did not reappear.

Department' s organization made it possi\u00ad ble to assign and quickly reassign all sur\u00ad geons and to establish without delay or difficulty a chain of command that elimi\u00ad nated serious conflicts of authority and permitted swift reactions to changing needs and circumstances. Although some sur\u00ad geons sought excuses to avoid service in Florida, most, as career military surgeons, accepted Lawson's insistence upon disci\u00ad pline. Their caliber was such that few, if any, major complaints arose about their professiona l abilities or their devotion to duty while in Florida. The requirement for a strict accounting of the use of supplies and medicines together with systematic planning for their future use prevented the developm ent of significant shortages, de\u00ad spite the fact that medicines and stores often had to be moved over long distances and the needs of individual posts could not always be precisely predicted. Even in the hands of others, the Medical Department created by Lovell functioned well. Medical science was still unable to deal effectively with the diseases that af\u00ad flicted armies in hot climates, but the de\u00ad partment's success as an organization during the course of the Second Seminole War justified the faith of those who had supported its establishment as a permanent staff department and had favored the ap\u00ad pointment of the young Lovell as its first surgeon general. CHAPTER 4 Lawson's First Years as Surgeon General, 1836-1845 Although the Second Seminole War in Florida was Lawson's greatest concern dur\u00ad ing most of his first decade as surgeon gen\u00ad eral, he could not ignore the needs of the men stationed at the posts scattered about the rest of the nation. As increasing num\u00ad bers of Indians from the Southeast as well as white settlers moved west of the Missis\u00ad sippi, the Army's responsibilities in that part of the country grew. The need to pro\u00ad tect white traders and settlers and Indians from one another and the newly arrived Indians from those indigenous to the area dictated the maintenance of distant posts, even in the most unhealthy areas of Ar\u00ad kansas and the Oklahoma Territory. Administration in Washington In the early years of Lawson's service as surgeon general, the need for surgeons was great west of the Mississippi, and until 1842 the demands of the Second Seminole War were even greater. Under these cir\u00ad cumstances, the Army Medical Depart\u00ad ment more than ever needed a strong central administration to assign its small staff as effectively as possible, to manage the purchase and distribution of medicines and other supplies to posts from the At\u00ad lantic to Oklahoma, and to anticipate fu\u00ad ture needs. Lawson, however, was not enthusiastic about office work. In 1839 he complained: I am continuously engaged in answering calls from Congress and the Secretary of War, and in disposing of references made to the department, by any body and every body and so incessantly annoyed with the trumped up accounts coming in upon the office from every section of the Country and every division of the Army that I can\u00ad not bestow that attention upon the general interests of the Medical department which I desire to do and ought to do. He had one or more surgeons assisting him in his office at various times, and on oc\u00ad casion, despite his usual resentment for those who might seem to be encroaching upon his prerogatives, he willingly dele\u00ad gated his authority in the central office to such men as Benjamin King, Richard Cool\u00ad idge, and Henry Heiskell in order to go out into the field or to free himself from the more tedious demands of his position.' In other ways, however, Lawson made the most of his Washington assignment. He did not let his eagerness for more active life blind him to the sedentary joys of ver\u00ad bal \"tilts\" or his scorn for \"finery and fur- from Ltf, Lawson to Mower (21 Mar 1839), RG 112. entry 2, 15:75.

Lawson gen\u00ad erally followed his predecessor's approach to these common problems , but his style of management was radically different from that of the quiet-spoken and unassuming Lovell. When Lawson became surgeon general, the Medical Department consisted of fif\u00ad teen surgeons and sixty assistant surgeons, in addition to a clerk who worked in the Washington office. In 1838 the demands of LAWSON'S FIRST YEARS AS SURGEON GENERAL , 1836-1845 75 the Second Seminole War led Congress to allow the appointment of seven more sur\u00ad geons. In 1841 a second clerk joined the Washington office, but in 1842, despite the fact that the Army then manned seventy\u00ad five posts, Congress ordered the dismissal of two surgeons and ten assistant surgeons, reducing the total number of Regular Army physicians to seventy. A wise provision of this law, however, required that each man who left the department be individually se\u00ad lected out on the basis of his value to the Army, regardless of his seniority] The shortage of surgeons forced Lawson to restrict the granting of leave, generally to medical officers who were ill. Even then, he granted leave only to those who had long been in the field on active duty. This policy did not condemn a surgeon to remain for\u00ad ever at one post, however. Lawson believed that medical officers should be moved about so as to become familiar with the climate and \"diseases of every section of the Country.'\" Under the circumstances, the low allri\u00ad tion in the Medical Department might ap\u00ad pear surprising. Many graduates of West Point, faced with low salaries, slow pro\u00ad motions. and assignments in primitive lo\u00ad cations that were scarcely suited to the raising of a family, resigned their commis\u00ad sions. Most surgeons, however, apparently found the limited opportunities available to them in civilian life, where the ratio of doctors was high, less lucrative than those available to West Point-trained engineers and stayed in the Army.

From 1843 through 1845, there were but six vacancies, two of them caused by deaths, in a department of seventy men' Ironically, at a time when the shortage of surgeons in the Army was acute, the in\u00ad dividual medical officer was not necessar\u00ad ily overworked, and Lawson permilled his subordinates to concern themselves with mailers that did not directly involve sick or injured soldiers. The variety of duties and professional opportunities that contin\u00ad ued to be available may, indeed, have been part of the allraction of the hard, isolated Army life for young physicians. During the 1836to 1845 period, when the Army made it clear that surgeons were not required to care for anyone but soldiers, it was custom\u00ad ary for medical officers to offer their ser\u00ad vices to wives, children, and other civilians at their posts.

The surgeon general expected his surgeons, however heavily burdened , to work without complaining and to exhibit great resource\u00ad fulness and unfailing energy under all cir\u00ad cumstances. He also insisted that they bear themselves proudly and not submit to in\u00ad dignities or encroachment s upon their rights and privileges. \"Although in the eye of the law and regulations,\" Lawson main\u00ad tained, surgeons were \"noncombatants ,\" they were obliged to \"prove themselves to possess the ambition and the feelings of the proudest officers & soldiers.'\" The surgeons' basic responsibilities to\u00ad ward the soldier had changed little. In war and in peace, they continued to care for the sick and wounded and attempted to pre\u00ad vent disease by ensuring that a soldier's water was good and that the food was both good and properly prepared. They also con\u00ad sulted with the commanding officer on the location of posts and camps, and when troops were to be moved by water, lll\u00ad spected the transports' The medical officer's preinduction ex\u00ad amination of the Army recruit, involving principa lly a visual inspection of the dis\u00ad robed candidate, might appear to have been one of his least demanding duties, but failure to take this responsibility seriously could bring the surgeon to grief. When it could be proved that an unfit man had been accepted as a recruit, those responsible for an injudicious acceptance were apparently required to reimburse the Army for the ex\u00ad pense of clothing and equipping him. In one such instance, an assistant surgeon and 7Quote from Ltr, Lawson to Foot (17 Dec 1840), RG entry 2, 15:295; Ltrs, Lawson to Wheaton (20Sep 1841) and to Clement Finley (18Sep 1844), both in RG 112, entry 2, 12:207 and 13: 103, i\" ,\\I.

The physician's fine, half the total, was $26.11, more than $23 of which was for clothing. The medical officer defended himself by saying that the supposedly preexisting con\u00ad ditions in all three men could be faked by someone anxious to get out of the Army, that it had not been proved that any of the problems existed at the time of the recruit\u00ad ment, that he had not had the opportunity of cross-examining the men in question, and that he was being deprived of his prop\u00ad erty without due process.

The observation s and re\u00ad ports on weather and similar matters that the surgeon general required of his subor\u00ad dinates was becoming even more complex with time. The physician responsib le for reports from Governors Island in New York Harbor, for example, was required to lise not only a barometer and thermometer but also a rain gauge, hygrometer, and wet bulb, and to record cloud formations and the direction and rorce of the winds. All surgeons became responsible for recording sudden changes in the wind and tempera\u00ad ture, the moment when the baromet er reached its lowest point during a storm, and even the passage of flocks of migrator y birds. Although these responsibilitie s were 78 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 no doubt an unwelcome burden to some medical officers, others apparently came to enjoy this particular aspect of their work.'o The enormous quantity of reports on meteorological observations that poured into the Washington office only added to Lawson's problems with paperwork. In 1841 he finally decided that he would no longer acknowledge the arrival of each re\u00ad port and that he would instead write a sur\u00ad geon in the field only when a report failed to arrive on time. Questions apparently also arose concerning these reports because in 1842 Lawson ordered the formation of a medical board to design accurate and uni\u00ad form instructions. L I The importance of the Medical Depart\u00ad ment's information gathering was appar\u00ad ently widely recognized by the 1840s. In 1842 the Army requested that colleges, sci\u00ad entific institutions, and private citizens co\u00ad operate in the collection of data. When an earthquake shook parts of the Southwest on 4 January 1843, inquiries came in to the department from private citizens inter\u00ad ested in learning the details of the event, asking that information on the quake be obtained from surgeons in the field. The surgeon general appears to have sent such a questionnaire to his surgeons only a few days after receiving the request.

Doctors with the education necessary to pass the Department's tests were presumably among those whose chances for establish\u00ad ing a lucrative practice appear to have been the best. An average of 50 percent or more of those examined failed, but the tests were never waived, even when administering them required the temporary removal of an assistant surgeon from duty in Florida dur\u00ad ing the Second Seminole War. The depart\u00ad ment was apparently unwilling to take chances in its search for doctors of good background who might find that the ex\u00ad citement and challenge of military life and the possible difficulties of private practice outweighed the danger and isolation that could face the Army surgeon. J3 The entrance examinations were appar\u00ad ently given without favor to anyone, and the age limit of twenty-one to twenty-eight for the examinees was never waived. Un\u00ad successful candidate s occasionally lashed out with accusations such as \"damned favoritism-because I did not have influ\u00ad ential friends to intercede for me.\" In this particular instance, the young applicant may have tried to conceal the fact that he was not yet of age, but Lawson was able to calm the troubled waters. Less than two months after he had accused Lawson of \"damned favoritism,\" the proud Dr. James L. Peacocke wrote Lawson to express his gratitude \"for the kind words and gentle\u00ad manly treatment\" he had received from the URichard H.

A civilian physician, writ\u00ad ing in 1848, pointed out that the Medical Department's entrance examinations had always been strict and that incompetents had never been known to pass them. The department's system, he stated, \"has saved thousands of brave men from the knives and nostrums [dubious remedies] of professional bunglers.\" Although they did not explain their reasoning, authoriti es maintained that the age limit was second only to the examinations themselve s as a promoter of the efficiency of the medical service,ls Men so rigorously selected descrved, in Lawson's opinion, more adequate salaries. Some of his surgeons had written in early 1838 to express their belief that their pay did not reflect the importance of their ser\u00ad vices. That same year, however, Congress finally raised their pay to equal that given those cavalry officers ranking from first lieutenant through major and also granted an extra ration for every five years of ser\u00ad vice.

Despite their pay, they did not have the rank of field officers and were not entitled to the salutes pre\u00ad scribed for such officers even though they received equivalent salaries. In addition, although the surgeon's right to serve on a court-mar tial was indisputable, some ques\u00ad tion existed about his eligibility to serve on such purely administrative bodies as the boards that decided on the disposal of ser\u00ad viceable property (boards of survey) or that managed the fiscal affairs of a post (coun\u00ad cils of administration). The commanding officer of a fort was not always happy to have the post surgeon on such a board, but by 1840 the adjutant general had made it plain that although Army physicians could not preside over such bodies, they were en\u00ad titled to serve on them.\" Lawson was concerned with appearances as well as with substance. The impression created by the surgeon's uniform had long concerned him and he became enraged over proposed modifications that sug\u00ad gested to him that the medical officer was considered in some way to be inferior to his brother of the line. The surgeon general indicated that he personally would rather wear civilian dress than a uniform una\u00ad dorned by epaulets. He claimed that their presence upon a medical officer's shoulders would cause him to esteem his commission more highly. As a result of Lawson's efforts, the new surgeon's uniform of 1840 was complete with \"Epaulettes-Go ld, with solid bright crescent\" and \"a spread eagle of solid silver metal to be worn by the Sur\u00ad geon General only ... to be placed upon the epaulette strap above the wreath.\" The IJLtrs, Lawson to See War (18 Jul 1838) and to Par\u00b7 ter (17 Mar 1840) and Heiskell to Sec War (4 Nov 1841) and to W.

As a rule, his deepest anger was di\u00ad rected at those who appeared to be shirking their duties in Florida or using illness as an excuse for avoiding responsibilities. Even a medical officer's unfortunate choice of words, however, might cause a marked ruffling of the Lawsonian feathers. Al\u00ad though Lawson had been an arrogant and belligerent subordinate of Lovell, he was very sensitive about the attitudes of his subordinates when he became surgeon gen\u00ad eral. To one surgeon whose language had unwittingly offended , he wrote, \"When it suits my purposes to prefer formal charges against you, I shall do it without your dic\u00ad tation; and should you wish to apply through me to a Court of Inquiry, your lan\u00ad guage must be more respectful to me and towards the Secretary of War.\"\" Among Lawson's more significant feuds with a subordinate was the one with Wil\u00ad liam Beaumont, a man whose pride ap\u00ad pears to have rivaled that of the surgeon general. Lawson began to resent the atten\u00ad tions and special considerations that Lovell showed Beaumont during the period of Beaumont's work with Alexis St. Martin. By the time Lawson succeeded Lovell as surgeon general, Beaumont had attained international respect and fame. The antag- 18Quote from Brown, Medical Depar(lIIe1ll, p. 164; Ltf, Lawson Lovell (5 Oct 1824), RG 112, entry 2. 19Quote from Ltr, Lawson to Woods (12 Oct 1840), RG 112, entry 2, 12:54; for Lawson's also Lctterbook, , entry 226. esp. Ltr, 16 Oct 1825. onism between the two men was great. Each appears to have believed himself en\u00ad titled to a degree of respect that the other was not willing to grant. Finally, in 1839 Beaumont requested a leave of absence with his replacement to be provided by the department at its expense. Since personal business was the stated reason for the re\u00ad quest, Lawson denied it. Beaumont , al\u00ad ready distressed by rumors that Lawson was planning to move him to a less desir\u00ad able post, responded to the refusal with a lengthy and condescending letter of the kind that invariably enraged Lawson. The surgeon general not only held his ground on the matter of leave but added fuel to the fire in September of 1839 by ordering Beaumont to Florida to serve on a medical examining board. Because Beaumont was no longer conducting research on St. Mar\u00ad tin's digestion , the assignment appears to have been reasonable , but Beaumont, in an attempt to force Lawson to rescind it, sub\u00ad mitted his resignation. To his astonish\u00ad ment, the surgeon general accepted it, commenting that \"if an example is not made of some one soon, the army will be\u00ad come more like a mob than a military Body.\" Beaumont then attempted to with\u00ad draw his resignation, but Lawson stood fast. Beaumont's long and distingui shed Army career, one that began in the War of 1812 when both Beaumont and Lawson had first committed themselves to the care of the Army's sick and wounded , was at an end.20 Lawson's concerns were not limited to the physicians in his department. He was also interested in the attendants who as- 20Quote from Uf, Lawson to Sec War (16 and Lawson to William Beaumont (27 Mar 1839), both in RG 112, entry 2, 4: 156 and 10:222. respectively. LAWSON 'S FIRST YEARS AS SURGEON GENERAL , 1836-1845 81 sisted post surgeons in their hospitals, The problem of obtaining good men to serve as hospital stewards remained from Lovell's period of administration, A steward was usually selected from the line by a surgeon, with the consent of the post's commanding officer. The Medical Department appar\u00ad ently continued to operate on the assump\u00ad tion that when it was impossible to find in this wayan enlisted man capable of per\u00ad forming in a sober, reliable, and reasonably intelligent manner, the post surgeon could enlist a man specifically to serve in this capacity or even hire a civilian.21 A law enacted in 1838 officially autho\u00ad rized thc enlistment of young men as stew\u00ad ards and increased their pay, At posts with more than four companies, stewards were paid as sergeants of ordnance; at smaller posts, they were paid as infantry sergeants, Nevertheless, many surgeons continued to have questions about signing on stewards, Thomas Mower, a surgeon on recruiting duty in 1839, made an arrangement with a young man anxious to serve as a hospital steward, specifying that he was not to serve in any other capacity, Since the enlistee had \"rec, a collegiate education \" and was both \"a student of theology\" and \"of good char\u00ad acter,\" Mower was eager to have him in the Army but was unsure how to interpret the regulations.22 In 1842 Congress forbade the enlistment or reenlistment of men to serve specifically as stewards, but surgeons continued to be confused, \"Is it intended that the assign\u00ad ment of Hospital Stewards be permanent, or only temporary\"? a surgeon wrote Law\u00ad son in 1844, adding, \"Can a citizen who has enlisted solely with a view to perform 21Ltr, Thomas Mower.

Wishing to upgrade their position, in early 1840 he established a training school for stewards at one of the New York Harbor posts, apparentl y Fort Columbus, By mid-1840 twenty young men of upright moral character had been trained by an assistant surgeon, had gone through a four-to five-month probationary period, and had been sent out to assist sur\u00ad geons requesting their aid, In 1844 the ad\u00ad jutant general ruled that new orders issued by the command ing general of the Army, Lt. Gen, Winfield Scott, required that stewards be taken from the line and that they remain attached to their companies, Lawson's attempts to improve the stan\u00ad dards for hospital stewards were thereby negated, and the records of the period never again refer to the schooL\" !JQuotc from LIT, Adam M.

At least one surgeon suggested re\u00ad placing matrons with men.

In 1839 Con\u00ad gress voted almost $70,000 for the building of new hospitals, but most of this sum was spent injust two years. In 1843 the surgeon general pointed out that the coastal forts still lacked no appropriate hospital facili\u00ad ties. He blamed this situation upon those who believed that structures erected out\u00ad side the walls of a fort would interfere with its defense. He pointed out that a building located outside the fortification s could be burned down if hostilities ever made it ad\u00ad visable, but that keeping patients in the damp, poorly ventilated Quarters within fortifications endangered their recovery and, indeed, threatened the health of all those who lived in them. 2SQuotes from Ltr.

LAWSON'S FIRST YEARS AS SURGEON GENERAL, 1836-1845 83 Despite his open dislike for \"too much convenience, \" Lawson also appears to have been receptive to ideas for improvin g hos\u00ad pital equipment. When the secretary of war expressed an interest in having iron bed\u00ad steads used throughout the Army, for ex\u00ad ample, Lawson moved quickly to look into the matter. In the fall of 1837 he had one single and one double metal bedstead made up and sent to the War Department, con\u00ad fident that if these frames could be ob\u00ad tained at a reasonab le price, the secretary would order them for hospitals as well as for barracks. The price of $15 each proved acceptable. Congress appropriat ed funds for the purpose, and Lawson began to buy bedsteads and to send them out to many post hospitals. By 1843 the money voted for this purpose had all been spent. Lawson noted that the new frames held up well, were free of insects, had a neater appear\u00ad ance than their wooden counterparts, and took up less space. He placed a second or\u00ad der for metal frames in 1845, using a slightly different, improved, and less ex\u00ad pensive design, one for which \"the parts will be made with such nicety and precision as to fit each other promiscuously.\"\" Lawson was also interested in having some sort of ambulance developed for use in Florida during the Second Seminole War. He envisioned a plain, light, two\u00ad horse wagon \"on Boston or Cradle springs.\" In this vehicle the wounded would lie upon canvas slings, ten to twelve !7First quote, ibid.; second quote, Ur, Mower to Lawson (23 Oct 1844), RG 112, entry 12; Ltrs, Lawson to Thomas Mower (I Sep 1837), RG 112, entry 2, 8:476; Lawson to Leonard, to Simpson, and to Russell (all 29 lui 1840), all in RG 112, entry 2, 11:432-33; Heiskell to M.

An ambu\u00ad lance and a set of panniers made of tin and slung across a saddle by means of a leather case should be provided for each battalion, A prototype of the desired wagon appears to have actually been built, but there is no record of its having been put into regular service at this time.28 As far as posts in the West were con\u00ad cerned, transportation presented a greater problem than purchasing, Ships came to grief from time to time and floods could delay the deli very of much-needed goods. Some forts appear to have been particular ly unfortunat e. In March 1845, for example, a packet ship loaded with supplies for Forts Snelling and Crawford, as well as for Forts Leavenworth , Atkinson , Des Moines, and Scott, was wrecked, and only three months later, when another ship, bound for New Orleans, met misfortune on the coast of Florida, the mishap deprived Fort Craw\u00ad ford of sixteen iron bedsteads and Fort Snelling of another twelve.\" Lawson was concerned about the care and disposal of old Medical Department property as well as with the purchase and transportation of the new. He was, for ex\u00ad ample, interested in the use of old bedding and linens. Great care should be taken, he believed, to ensure that boards of survey were not called upon to condemn property that could still be made to fulfill its original purpose, but only a board of survey could condemn items that could no longer be used for their original purpose. The actual disposal then became the responsibility of the surgeon involved. Worn-out linens 2~Quo te rrom Ltr, Lawson to Sec War (26 Jul 1837), RG 112, entry 2, 8:423-24 ; Ltr, Lawson to A.

The difficulty stemmed from the fact that the food of hospitalized soldiers was pro\u00ad vided by both the Subsistence and the Medical Departments. Should the Subsis\u00ad tence Department be unable to supply the specialized type of diet that a patient might require, the expense for his food became the responsibility of the Medical Depart\u00ad ment. The issue, therefore, was whether the monetary value of the ration normally sup\u00ad plied by the Subsistence Department but not used for a hospitalized patient should be paid out to acting medical purveyors for the Medical Department's use as needed without restriction. The alternatives in\u00ad volved either using the ration allowance solely and specifically for the benefit of the individual soldier or crediting the sum to his unit. The surgeon general decided that it was illogical for a soldier to receive both hospital rations and the benefit of the gov\u00ad ernment allowance at the same time and ruled that such money should go into a common fund for use by the Medical Department.

Alcoholism continued to cause diffi\u00ad culties, despite Lovell's campaign against hard liquor and reports that intemperance was undermining the health of untold num\u00ad bers of men. The Army itself provided each soldier with a daily gill of rum, whiskey, or brandy until 1838, when it substituted six pounds of coffee and twelve pounds of sugar per 100 men for the liquor ration. In the early 1840s, the average soldier serving in the northern states was reported sick once every 4'1> months, whereas in the middle and southern states he was ill once every 4 months. Serious epidemics rarely challenged surgeons assigned to long\u00ad established forts along the Canadian bor\u00ad der and the northern Atlantic coast, and they found it difficult even as late as the mid-1840s to raise official enthusiasm for long overdue improvements to hospitals or living quarters. Those caring for soldiers on the western frontiers, on the other hand, were often engaged in the struggle against disease. The combination of diarrhea and dysentery, the traditional camp disease, and malaria continued to scourge the Army. The number of forts in the rapidly ex\u00ad panding nation grew as both white and red men moved west of the Mississippi, but the consequences of the Indian removal policy, and particularly of the Second Seminole War, added to the burden of some post sur\u00ad geons in all parts of the country. A few post hospitals far from either Florida or the frontier cared for ill recruits or sheltered invalids returned from the southern fight\u00ad ing. One post representative of collection points for recruits was Madison Barracks at Sackett's Harbor, New York, where the E G G MADISON BARRA CKS HOSPITAL, 22 April 1842. Thomas Henderson, Ass'! SlIrg.

Housing there was dilapidated , and the post surgeon blamed the water for the high number of diarrhea cases. Among other problems afflicting both recruits and veterans were boils, skin infections, and scabies, as well as malaria, respiratory problems , and rheumatism.\" When no recruits were assigned to Mad\u00ad ison Barracks for a brief time in 1840, the total number of men at the post fell well below 100, but by the fall of 1840, recruits were coming in again and the population was rising. By 1842, veterans of the Florida war were appearing there as well, bringing with them the fevers that plagued soldiers JI$urgeon's Quarterly Rpts.

Within a few months of the end of the Second Seminole War, however, life at Madison Barracks was settling back into a pattern of few and generally mild illnesses, punctuated by occasiona l out\u00ad breaks of scarlet fever, which in some cases was severe.32 The facilities available for the patients of the Madison Barracks' surgeon were, like so many in the North, old and inadequate. They consisted of three rooms located at the far end of the enlisted men's barracks. One room was used as a dispensary, the other two were used as wards. One ward was approximately 400 square feet and the second almost twice that, but chimneys took up much of the space in both. As a JlSurgeon's Quarterly Rpts, Madison Barracks (30 Jun 1840-30 Sep 1845), all in RG 94, enlry 634. 86 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTM ENT, 1818-1865 result, the facility could hold only eighteen beds, two or three of which were regularly used by hospital attendants. On the base\u00ad ment level of this wing were two \"matron's rooms,\" a \"bathing room,\" and a \"kitchen and eating room.\"33 The post surgeon at Madison Barracks in 1838 emphasized that the rooms occu\u00ad pied by the sick there were never intended to be used as a hospital and so \"of course [were] extremely defective in arrangements as well as in other important particulars.\" Among the defecti ve arrangeme nts were those for ventilation. Furthermore, in the surgeon's opinion, hospitals should also be entirely separate from barracks. By 1839, however, the construc tion of a new and separate hospital, built of limestone and designed by the Surgeon General's Office with modifications by the post surgeon, was underway. The main body of the build\u00ad ing contained the ward for the sick, while a bathing room occupied one wing and a morgue a second. Only the site itself ap\u00ad pears to have been criticized: it was judged too near a freshwater stream and too ex\u00ad posed to the wind during long winters. Fur\u00ad thermore, a steep ravine that lay between the hospital and the barracks made the hos\u00ad pital inaccessible during the heavy snows characteristic of that part of the country.\" The Quarterma ster's Department turned the new facility over to the surgeon in No\u00ad vember, but some of the problems involved in housing the sick remained. Experience showed the new hospital at the Madison Barracks to be a mixed blessing. The planks used for the flooring were kiln-dried and poorly seasoned and, as a result, shrank rapidly. Because the building's fireplace l3Quotes from Ltr, Heiskell to RG Ltr. Heiskell to Lawson RG 112, entry 12. J4Quote from Llr, Heiskell entry SWlislical Report. 1839-55, p.39. proved inadequate for heating, stoves had to be used; their installation appeared to aggravate the problem with the floors. The excessive ly dry floorboards rapidly ab\u00ad sorbed any stains, so the post surgeon urged that they be painted, which he be\u00ad lieved would solve all the qifficulties he had been experiencing with them. The rec\u00ad ords, unfortunat ely, do not reveal whether this step was actually takenH At many of the northern posts along the Atlantic coast, damp casemates , the ma\u00ad sonry rooms designed to contain cannon, continued to be the only shelter available for all those in the garrison, sick or well. As a result, the surgeon in the field might be preoccupied with the effects of such ac\u00ad commodations upon himself and his fam\u00ad ily as well as with their effects upon the soldiers. At Fort Hamilton in New York Harbor, for example, the post surgeon re\u00ad ported that he had spent $4,000 of his own money to have his personal quarters mod\u00ad ified so as \"to protect my own health and make myself and family comfortable and respectable.\" The hospital accommoda\u00ad tions at this post were so poor that for sev\u00ad eral years patients were periodically taken to the new Fort COlumbus facility nearby, but in the summer of 1845 the Army au\u00ad thorized the improvement of the hospital casemates. Nevertheless, and despite the surgeon general's dislike for casemate fa\u00ad cilities, the long-standing suggestion of the surgeon at Fort Hamilton that a separate hospital building be constructed appears to have been ignored.

LAWSON'S FIRST YEARS AS SURGEON GENERAL, 1836-1845 87 At Fort Columbus, on Governors Island, the post surgeon, Joseph P. Russell, faced problems both with his quarters and with an influx of invalids from Florida. While Russell was serving in Florida early in the Second Seminole War, a major from the Corps of Engineers took over the quarters usually assigned to the fort's post surgeon, rooms that had been modified for Russell's use on the orders of the Medical Depart\u00ad ment. On returning north in November 1838, instead of being assigned to his usual quarters or even to those in which the post clerk was living, which were only slightly inferior to those of the surgeon, Russell was offered space he found entirely unaccept\u00ad able. After Lawson appealed in his behalf to the secretary of war, urging that Russell be allowed to displace the clerk, the re\u00ad turning surgeon appears to have made no further complaints.\u00b7\\7 A year later, Russell wrote to the surgeon general of his pleasure with the new post hospital nearing completion at Fort Co\u00ad lumbus, adding that he hoped to furnish it with the new iron bedsteads. To this fine new hospital the Army shipped fifty-seven invalids from Tampa, Florida, in June 1839 and either thirty-nine or forty-seven more-the sources are contradictory on this figure-from the Cedar Key hospital in 1840, by which time the hospital was presumably being used to train hospital stewards. The Ceder Key transferees ar\u00ad ri ved in such poor condition that Russell immediately wrote Lawson, complaining bitterly of the decision to send these men to his facility. Removing invalids from a warm climate to a cold one during the win\u00ad ter was \"extremely injudicious, and ill ad\u00ad vised.\" Furthermore, the vessel that carried .I1Ltrs, Russell to MacKay (10 Dec 1838) and to Lawson (10 Dec 1838) and Lawson to Sec War(23 Dec 1838), all in RG 112, entry 12; Surgeon's Quarterly Rpt, Ft. Columbus (31 Dec 1838), RG 94, entry 634. them had been very uncomfortable, the weather during the voyage \"boisterous,\" and the men at times drenched by bilge water. By the time they reached Fort Co\u00ad lumbus, \"they presented a most pitiable spectacle, were generally in a very filthy and lousy condition, two of them had in\u00ad voluntary and unconscious discharges, and were literally wallowing in their excrement.\"38 Russell protested further that his hos\u00ad pital could take only fifty patients without crowding and that the poor condition of the men arriving from Florida would be very bad for morale at a base where recruits were to be trained for duty in the Seminole wars, and would generally discourage en\u00ad listments. Any future victims of the Sem\u00ad inole wars, he asserted, should be sent to Fort Monroe in Virginia or to Fort Moul\u00ad trie in South Carolina, where the climate was better and where there would be no new recruits to be horrified by the spectacle of what service in Florida could do to a man's health. But the Florida invalids con\u00ad tinued to pour in, seventy-three more from Cedar Key in late June 1841 and fifty-six from Pilatka in early July.\" A continuing health problem that grew to surprising proportions at Fort Columbus after the first invalids arrived from Florida was venereal disease. In December 1836 the post surgeon reported that 10 of the 120 men newly entered on his sick list in the past quarter were suffering from gonorrhea and 10 from syphilis (the records do not make it possible to guess how many of these patients might actually be suffering from JSQuotes from Ltr, Russell to Lawson (29 Nov 1840), RG 112, entry 12; Ur, RG Surgeon's Quarterly Rpts, Ft.

Two years later, the surgeon reported only 10 cases of venereal disease, but in the following June, nine days after the arrival of the 57 invalids from Tampa, the venereal disease case load figure stood at 14, this from a sick list totaling 433 for the quarter. Three months later, however, despite the fact that the total number of new cases of all kinds of diseases and wounds at that post had decreased by 67, 59 were newly recorded victims of gonor\u00ad rhea and syphilis. Russell did not suggest how many of these might have been Florida veterans who had acquired a new problem in the course of celebrating their return to ci vilization. The venereal disease rate slowly dropped from this high point and reached its more customary level several months later.\" To the south of the New York forts, the health problems that had plagued such posts as Fort McHenry in Maryland and Baton Rouge during Lovell's term as sur\u00ad geon general appear to have been relieved before Lawson had long served in that po\u00ad sition. Conditions at the Maryland post reached a nadir in the months immediately following Lovell's death in the fall of 1836, and the post was subsequently abandoned briefly in 1837. When troops reoccupied it in 1838, the poor location and dilapidated condition of the old hospital inspired a quick start on a new one, a structure that greatly pleased the civilian surgeon as\u00ad signed there. The retreat of malaria from the country's more northern areas may have been responsible for an improvement in health at the Fort McHenry garrison. Al\u00ad though, during the winter months, soldiers on guard duty who went from the over\u00ad heated guard room at Fort McHenry out 40Surgeon's Quarterly Rpts, Ft. Columbus (31 Dec 1836,31 Dec 1838, and 30 Jun and 30 Sep 1839), all in RG 94, entry 634. into the cold air suffered considerably from head colds (or catarrh as it was then called), by 1844 the men at this post apparently considered it one of the most desirable assignments.41 At Baton Rouge, the new hospital was also finished in 1839, complete with brick walls, a much-admired system of ventila\u00ad tion, and a ten-foot-wide gallery around the entire structure. The fevers and digestive problems characteristic of southern posts continued to plague Baton Rouge, however, with the third quarter of the year being par\u00ad ticularly unhealthy. In 1843, the weeks of the late summer and early fall were unu\u00ad sually difficult; yellow fever struck the post in September when the surgeon was already struggling to care for men transferred from Florida who were \"worn out ... by Climate and Severe service-particularly Intemperance.\"42 Except for the influenza epidemic of 1843, the health of the garrisons at such northwestern posts as Forts Snelling and Mackinac , the latter in Michigan, remained good once the stresses and shortages re\u00ad lated to their establishment were past. The surgeon at Fort Mackinac , however, like his colleague at Fort Hamilton , felt compelled to use his own money for improvements more appropriately made at the Army's ex\u00ad pense.

Its garden was ad\u00ad mired for its unfailing supply of vegetables, and scurvy was no longer a threat. In the opinion of an Army inspector in 1838, \"No soldier ought to desire to live better than they have always done at this post.\" The post surgeon could not afford to relax his vigilance, however. Smallpox occasionally afnicted the Sioux Indians who lived near the fort, threatening any in the garrison who were not immune. After 1839, when alcohol became available for the first time in the vicinity of the post, the surgeon re\u00ad corded that \"The increase to our sick list is owing in my opinion to the introduction of Ardent Spirits amongst us.\" Many of the ills that came to the attention of the post surgeon at Fort Snelling, however, were of a type usually associated with long, cold winters. Colds and rheumatism were com\u00ad mon, and some soldiers suffered from chronic bronchiti s or chilblains, a painful engorgement of the fingers, toes, and ear\u00ad lobes caused by cold, damp weather. Army surgeons did not often encounter malaria in such a chill climate except when units already afnicted with this disease came to Fort Snelling.\" Unlike the reports of many post sur- 4lSurgcon's Quarterly Rpt, Ft.

Turner usually hos\u00ad pitalized up to a third of his patients, or as many as eighty-six per quarter. Given the size of most post hospitals in relation to the length of their post sick lists, it is prob\u00ad able that most of those treated by post sur\u00ad geons were outpatients.\" The forts located in or near the lands assigned to the tribes moving west from Florida, Alabama, and Georgia were not as healthy as Forts Snelling and Mackinac. The health record of Fort Gibson (located in Cherokee lands on the banks of the Grand River along the main emigrant route from St. Louis to Texas) was partic\u00ad ularly miserable. In the sickly season every man on post might be ill more than once in a quarter. The Army did not abandon Fort Gibson, however, because the secre\u00ad tary of war believed that its existence was crucial to the Cherokees' security in their new lands. The infantrymen who shared the post with a detachment of dragoons were still sheltered in rotting, badly ven\u00ad tilated barracks when Lawson became sur\u00ad geon general; perhaps because of the hope that the fort would soon be closed, au\u00ad thorities were loath to invest more money in its buildings. The occupants of the in\u00ad fantry barracks fell ill at a particularly high rate when the wind shifted to the south\u00ad west, from the direction of the bottomland s between the Grand and Verdigris rivers. Although the dragoon quarters were shel\u00ad tered from the southwesterly winds by a ridge, they were exposed to the prevailing winds of summer, which also brought dis\u00ad ease. During the last nine months of the year at Fort Gibson, malaria was the most 4SSurgcon's Quarterly Rpts. Ft.

In addi\u00ad tion, diarrhea increased the garrison's miseries in the summer, while in the win\u00ad ter, respiratory diseases posed an addi\u00ad tional problem. \" Because the post's surgeons themselves also suffered from repeated attacks of dis\u00ad ease, providin g adequate medical care for the garrison, normally about 500 strong, was difficult. The Surgeon General's Office tried briefly to insist that four surgeons could handle all the fort's health problems , but in 1837 authorities realized that five would be better. Despite the recognized need for at least four to five surgeons, by June 1838 only three medical officers were present at Fort Gibson. In the winter of 1839, when there were approximately 540 men at Fort Gibson and 236 cases of dis\u00ad ease reported for the quarter, only two sur\u00ad geons were serving at the post, with the health of one \"fast declining\" and that of the other scarcely better.\" In the fall of 1839, when over 600 cases of disease were reported during the quarter, the medical staff once again con\u00ad sisted of only three men.

Struggling to provide an adequate medical staff for the troops fighting the Seminoles, Lawson refused to understand why a gar\u00ad rison of 483 officers and men should need so many doctors, noting that the 258 men at Fort Wayne, just sixty miles away, made do with the services of only one physician. To the secretary of war Lawson protested that in only eight months the commander s of the troops in Arkansas had spent over $3,000 for private physicians, in spite of the services of the five Regular Army sur\u00ad geons sent west to care for the 1,196 men at their four posts.\" By 1840 Lawson was willing to admit that, because of its poor location, Fort Gib\u00ad son had proved for ten years to be \"the most sickly military Post in the United States\" and that the diseases there were often serious enough to cause death or the permanent destruction of health. His sym\u00ad pathy for the surgeons serving there, how\u00ad ever, was limited. Typically, he looked for fault in their conduct. He admitted that assistant surgeon Joseph H. Bailey was of good character, but he deplored Bailey's custom of spending much of his time and energy on his private practice, principall y in caring for Indians, thereby neglecting both his duties at the fort and his own health.\" The surgeons at Fort Gibson were man\u00ad ning two hospitals, one for the infantry and the other for the dragoons, both of which \"BUrs, Lawson to Sec War (11 Nov 1839).

LAWSON 'S FIRST YEARS AS SURGEON GENERA L, 1836-1845 91 were inadequate. Because Lawson antici\u00ad pated the abandonment of the post, he initially withheld his support from the campaign of these physicians to override the post commander's unexplained oppo\u00ad sition to the addition of two wards to the existing facilities. By May 1838, however, Lawson had agreed to the expansion. The commanding officer's consent was then ob\u00ad tained, and before another year passed, one of the two new wards was completed and the old buildings were improved'\u00b7 One of the dragoon officers complained, however, that the custom of having the post's physicians rotate between the two hospitals was not an ideal arrangement for the sick because the physicians never had the opportunity to know their patients as individuals. Presumably in answer to his complaint, sometime before the beginning of 1839, one surgeon at Fort Gibson was assigned to work exclusively at the dragoon hospital. When only two medical officers were at the post, however, the sickness of either rendered this arrangement less than ideal, because the patients of the sick phy\u00ad sician were then cared for by a doctor who was completely unfamiliar with their prob\u00ad lems. Although by 1840 Lawson had ap\u00ad parently capitulated on the matter of hiring a civilian surgeon, he believed that the most efficient approach to providing care for the post's sick would be to combine the two hospitals in one building. His sugges\u00ad tion to this effect was ignored until later in 1840, when many of the dragoons appear to have left the post. The commanding of\u00ad ficer then declared that the infantry hos- wLtrs.

Charles McCormick , who had developed his approach to the treatment of malaria while he was in Flor\u00ad ida, introduced to Fort Gibson the practice of treating malaria with large doses of qui\u00ad nine administered during the fever's pa\u00ad roxysm as well as during its remission. The intermittent fevers affecting the men at Fort Gibson tended to return regularly at seven-day intervals, making it possible to administer quinine in anticipation of the attacks. Physicians discovered that by giv\u00ad ing 10 grains of quinine twelve hours be\u00ad fore the expected paroxysm and another 10 grains six hours later, they could prevent the fever's return. They also learned that, for a febrile patient, 15 to 20 grains of qui\u00ad nine given as a single dose was effective, and its effectiveness was enhanced when it was repeated at four-to six-hour intervals thereafter, for a total of two to three days. Although physicians might also prescribe bleeding or even emetics and cathartics, fortunately for the patients, they found that usually no preparation was necessary for the administration of quinine.s2 Although the demand for quinine at Fort Gibson was great, a hospital steward sta\u00ad tioned there in the 1840s stated that \"to protect the men from malaria, the govern\u00ad ment served a gill of whiskey daily to each man.\" His comment may have referred to 51Ltrs, Wharton 10 Lawson (12 May 1837 and 13 Feb 1839).

Shortly after a new shipment of quinine arrived at the post, the patient population was back to normal.\" In the 1830s fevers were also a common affliction at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas, a base that grew in importance as increasing numbers of settlers moved west and greater numbers of Indians from east of the Mis\u00ad sissippi arrived in the Oklahoma Territory and in Arkansas to the south of this post and in what later became Iowa to the north. The size of the garrison fluctuated as ex\u00ad peditions to establish peaceful relations with and among the Indians or to escort settlers or traders farther west came and went.

Many men also suffered from wounds and so-called contusions. One Fort Leav\u00ad enworth surgeon, however, believed that most of the patients under his care could thank alcohol for their health problems, no matter what their symptoms might be. He added to his quarterly report of 31 Decem\u00ad ber 1843 the assertion that \"Nearly all the cases arise primarily from liquor.\" The sur\u00ad geons' reports from Fort Leavenworth also hint at other vices in addition to alcohol\u00ad ism. In recording the discharge of a dra\u00ad goon because of his \"general debility,\" for example, another surgeon later noted, \"This man destroyed himself with vicious secret practices.\" \" In the late 1830s, and especially in the third and fourth quarters of those years, the recorded number of cases of disease treated at Fort Leavenworth could exceed by as much as 80 percent the number of men in the garrison. Fortunately , not long after Lawson became surgeon general, a new hospital began to rise there; when com\u00ad plete, it was a \"very capacious brick hos\u00ad pital, two stories high with every necessary appurtenance.\" \" Because it was not always possible to as\u00ad sign two or more surgeons to Fort Leav\u00ad enworth, on at least one occasion a hospital steward provided the medical care for an expedition leaving that post.

Two years later, shortly after a sec\u00ad ond physician finally arrived at Fort Leavenworth, the newly assigned surgeon left with a detachment ordered to establish a new post. Since his replacement had al\u00ad ready been diverted to Florida, Fort Leav\u00ad enworth was once again down to a single Army surgeon.\" By 1843 a second surgeon was once again on duty at Fort Leavenworth , but in June he, too, left the post, accompanying three companies of dragoons escorting traders to Santa Fe. The physician remaining at the post was temporarily handicapped in his work by a broken bone in his right hand. The bone apparently healed in time, but since the surgeon also suffered each winter from a \"thoracic disease,\" in 1844 he was sent to Fort Jesup, Louisiana, after he had requested reassignment to protect his health\" Another Fort Leavenworth expedition departed not long after the ailing surgeon left for Louisiana.

He en\u00ad couraged his surgeons fighting to have the importance of their contributions to the Army recognized. He worked to lighten their loads where he could by attemptin g to improve the facilities where they worked and by initiating a training program to en\u00ad able stewards to assist the medical officers more effectively. When all else failed, Law\u00ad son hired contract surgeons. His supply system, inherited from his predecessor , functioned well; few surgeons complained of significant shortages. Although, unlike Lovell, Lawson leapt at the chance to go into the field, the men whom he appointed to act for him in his office were competen t, and the medical service did not suffer from his occasiona l absences from the surgeon general's desk. Up until 1846, however, the Army Med\u00ad ical Department as organized in 1818 had been tested only in hostilities against In\u00ad dians, fought between small units. The challenge presented in 1846 by the Mexi\u00ad can War would draw Lawson once again away from his office and into the field, where he would for the first time be in a position to direct personally the medical care of U.S Army units during a conven\u00ad tional war. CHAPTER 5 The War With Mexico: The Taylor and Kearny Campaigns In the second quarter of the nineteenth century, the ultimate goal of many of the migrants streaming west was territory then belonging to Mexico. In 1836 the new set\u00ad tlers in Texas proclaimed their independ\u00ad ence. Enthusiasm for the addition of the new Loan Star Republic to the Union was strong, and the annexation of Texas in Feb\u00ad ruary 1845 made war almost inevitable. In May of the following year Congress offi\u00ad cially declared war, and the Army found itself facing the challenge of a major con\u00ad nict at the far end of long supply lines in a disease-ridden land.' Although the Army appears to have de\u00ad voted surprisingly little effort in advance of the actual campaign to gathering infor\u00ad mation about the geography, water sup\u00ad plies, and other pertinent characteristics of Mexico, it adjusted to the demands of war with much greater ease than it had in the IUnlcss otherwise indicated , material in the two chapters on the war with Mexico is based on Louis C.

Congress modified the struc\u00ad ture of the Army by placing brigade and division organizations above the regimen\u00ad tal level, and it undertook a controlled ex\u00ad pansion both by adding men to existing regiments and by creating new ones. Dur\u00ad ing the course of the war, another 64,000 men serving under varying terms of enlist\u00ad ment in volunteer units joined the 30,000 wartime regulars. Disease wrought its usual havoc among these soldiers. Volunteers , many of them farm boys who had never before been ex\u00ad posed to communicable diseases and who were unimpressed with the demands of camp sanitation, fell ill at twice the rate of the regulars. Some apparent ly had not been immunized against smallpox; as a result, this dreaded disease occasionally struck down small numbers of volunteers , al\u00ad though no epidemic on the scale of those of the American Revolution resulted, and the regulars, who had been vaccinated, were spared. Many physician s fell ill, but disease killed relatively few of them, es\u00ad pecially in compariso n to the mortality among surgeons during the struggle with the Seminoles in Florida. Five Regular Army surgeons and two of those who joined the Medical Department only for the duration of the war apparently died as a result of illness contracted during or ex\u00ad acerbated by their service south of the Rio 96 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 Grande, while one died of wounds. 2 Administration of the Medical Department The fall of 1845 found Surgeon General Lawson eagerly anticipating war. In a letter to Brig. Gen. William Worth he com\u00ad plained, \"It is much to be feared that the Mexicans intend to content themselves with waging a war of threats and denun\u00ad ciations, and that, after all their blustering, they will not afford our gallant officers and men recently ordered to Texas suffi\u00ad cient pastime to keep their blood in circulation,\" 3 [n spite of Lawson's enthusiasm, the like\u00ad lihood of war, and the growing need for surgeons for new posts being established in the West, no increases in the size of the Medical Department were made until after war was actually declared. Although three doctors were traditionally allowed for each regiment , in June 1846 Congress ordered the call-up of only two physicians per vol\u00ad unteer regiment , if there were not enough Regular Army physicians available to care for these men. The department , however, already too small to provide each Army post with a physician, was scarcely in a po- lThomas R.

Congress did not increase the size of the department staff until February 1847. In the process of creating nine new regular in\u00ad fantry regiments and a dragoon regiment , to be called up for the duration of the war, the legislature gave the president the power to appoint one surgeon and two assistant surgeons for each newly authorized regular regiment and to name an additional two surgeons and twelve assistants directly to the regular department staff, which now to\u00ad taled 115. The lawmakers apparently waived the age limitation, but since they made no exception to the requirement that prospecti ve regular surgeons pass a rigo\u00ad rous examination and since the number who passed these tests continued to be low, months elapsed before all the new slots were filled. Even with the increase, the hir\u00ad ing of private physicians both to care for soldiers in Mexico and to serve as post sur\u00ad geons within the United States continued to be necessary.' An almost casual provision of the legis\u00ad lation of February 1847 marked a mile\u00ad stone in the history of the U.S. Army Medical Department: the new legislation granted surgeons and assistant surgeons the rank they had so long sought. Although in practice, under exceptional circumstances and on an informal basis, medical officers might briefly command small numbers of troops, this law also specifically stated that doctors were not to exercise command out\u00ad side the Medical Department.

THE WAR WITH MEXICO: THE TAYLOR AND KEARNY CAMPAIGNS 97 unteer surgeons the same status as their regular counterparts, they, too, received rank. The surgeon general became a colo\u00ad nel, 'surgeons became majors, and assistant surgeons, captains. The significance of the new law, however, did not become apparent until after the war' The responsibilities assigned to the members of the Medical Department who served in Mexico included those of medical director and director of a general hospital, both positions given to senior surgeons, and that of purveyor. The purveyor usually functioned as physician as well as supply officer. Doctors accompanied units in the field and the department attempted to place a physican aboard any troop trans\u00ad port destined for a long voyage, to inspect the vessel before departure, and to care for the troops in transit. No attempt was made, however, to establish guidelines for deter\u00ad mining in advance who should serve in general hospitals and who should remain with the regiment. The caliber of the volunteer doctors sent to Mexico was on the whole low. Most were unaccustomed to military discipline and unfamiliar with the requirements of mili\u00ad tary medicine, particularly the requirement for sanitation. Since they, like contract sur\u00ad geons, were not required to pass qualifying examinations, their skills were question\u00ad able. Their personal health was often poor; some apparently joined the Army with the thought of restoring their health by a change of climate. They were profligate in their use of supplies and casual about the required monthly reports, to the despair of the medical director under whom they served.' SRobinson, All Account 1 :42.

Williams The fundamental problem continued to be the failure of Congress to recognize that any army whose duties included the gar\u00ad risoning of small posts scattered over a wide area required more surgeons than an army operating exclusively in units of reg\u00ad imental size or larger. Attempts to obtain and keep competent hospital attendants to ease the burdens of Army surgeons re\u00ad mained futile. The weak, the convalescent, the alcoholic, and the incompetent were left behind as attendants to care for hos\u00ad pital patients while their healthier and abler comrades marched off with their units. The fact that the medical staffs of disease-ridden volunteer regiments were too small to gi ve adequate care to their sick and often lacking in skill and dedication complicated the shortage of regular phy\u00ad sicians. In addition, Lawson did not make the most of the surgeons he had when he failed to plan in advance for the simulta\u00ad neous staffing of both regimental and gen\u00ad eral hospitals. Most departmental physicians were overworked, and the strain upon them when battle or epidemic sent large numbers of men to hospitals was great. 7 As experienced military surgeons could have predicted on the basis of their expe\u00ad riences in the West and in the Second Sem\u00ad inole War, frequent delays occurred in the arrival of needed items in Mexico.

Such a shipment might take as long as six weeks to reach a Mexican port from New York City and another eight weeks to arrive at its final destination inland.' Although the distances involved were great, Lawson urged that, whenever possi\u00ad ble, medical purveyors send their requisi\u00ad tions to New York City, where the needed items could be bought in better quality and at lower prices than elsewher e. He sug\u00ad gested that medicines be packed for ship\u00ad ment in small quantities, to eliminate any need to open large containers when only a fraction of their contents was needed. He stockpiled medical supplies for both regu\u00ad lar and volunteer units at New Orleans.

In the summer of 1845, anticipating a hostile response from Mexico to the annexation of Texas, Presi\u00ad dent Polk ordered General Taylor to move from his station in Louisiana to a position nearer the border. By the end of August, Taylor's army was camped in the vicinity of Corpus Christi, Texas. Surgeons consid\u00ad ered the climate there to be \"perfectly de\u00ad licious and healthy [with] no possibility of sickness.\" In a short time, however, bad water (probably resulting from the pres\u00ad ence of the troops, who polluted it), ex\u00ad treme variations in temperature , and what was regarded as bad air began to take their toll. \"The Northers ... blow with great force and produce an instantaneous change in the temperature, the thermometer fail\u00ad ing 30 degrees in as many seconds,\" a sur\u00ad geon wrote. He added that insects and snakes also proved to be a threat, \"espe\u00ad cially rattlesnakes which are as plenty [sic] as blackberries.\" Between respiratory and digestive ills, by October \"the whole army [could] be considered a vast hospital.\" An average of 90 officers and 118 men out of every 1,000 were sick, and the situation worsened in November before starting to improve. A disgusted Nathan Jarvis, who had had few complaints about Minnesota winters at Fort Snelling, commented: \"Texas, its climate, ... and people [are] all a humbug & not worth the cost oftaking. \"10 To care for the many sick in General Tay\u00ad lor's command , surgeons set up eight reg- IOFirst Jerome cd., To l'dexico o/Capraill E.

THE WAR WITH MEXICO: THE TAYLOR AND KEARNY CAMPAIGNS 99 imental hospitals, each sheltered in two or three large hospital tents, and a general hospital, housed in a large frame building in Corpus Christi. In the latter facility, those whose illness was likely to be pro\u00ad longed joined the overflow of patients from the regimental hospitals. The medical staff manning these hospitals included the med\u00ad ical director for Taylor's force, Presley H. Craig, Jarvis as director of the general hos\u00ad pital, a purveyor, and thirteen more de\u00ad partment physicians. Three civilian doctors were hired until more Regular Army surgeons could be assigned to Tay\u00ad lor's command. Almost immediately after Taylor's departure from Corpus Christi, the general hospital there was moved to a new location on St. Joseph Island, Texas, and on 7 November 1846, it was disbanded.\" Although negotiations between the United States and Mexico failed in January 1846, actual hostilities did not break out while Taylor was at Corpus Christi. In March President Polk ordered Taylor to move further south. Leaving 800 to 900 of the very weak and seriously ill at the gen\u00ad eral hospital under the care of two Medical Department physicians, Taylor established his men at Point Isabel on the coast of Texas, and inland at Fort Texas (soon to be renamed Fort Brown), facing the Mexican town of Matamoros across the Rio Grande. (Map 3) Although the men at Fort Texas were healthy when they arrived and the weather was good, many soon fell ill, most with diarrhea and dysentery. Apparently no hospital existed at this base in the early \"Surgeo n's Quarterly Rpt, $1.

This facility remained open throughout the war, and surviving records indicate that more substantial housing was eventually found for it.\" The surgeons with Taylor received their first wounded from the Mexican hostilities early in May 1846, following the enemy bombardment of Fort Texas and the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. Al\u00ad though exact figures vary, it appears that U.S. forces lost a total of almost 50 killed and over 130 wounded in these battles. Shortly after the second battle, the Mexi\u00ad cans abandoned Matamoro s.\" For each of these two engagements, the twelve surgeons accompanying the troops initially set up field hospitals near the bat\u00ad tlefield. When the wounded could be moved, Craig had 48 taken to the Corpus Christi facility and the remaining 1,123 to Point Isabel, where they were placed in tents and warehouses cleared out for the purpose. The facilities at Point Isabel were overcrowded and badly policed, but, by the standards of the day, the men cared for there did well. One of the surgeons attrib\u00ad uted this fact to the proximit y of the town to the sea and its breezes, the absence of malaria, and the basic good health of the men, the weak and sick having been left behind when the march began. Neverthe\u00ad less, twenty died later from their injuries.\" General Taylor's concern for the welfare of the casualties from the two battles of 12Ltrs, Heiskell to Wood (Apr 1846), RG 112, entry 2, 17:409; Hawkins to Lawson (28 Apr 1848) and Thomas C.

He ordered Mexican wounded who had been taken prisoner turned over to Mexi\u00ad can surgeons, some of whom were, in Jar\u00ad vis' opinion, \"very skillful surgeons and very agreeable men.\" On Taylor's orders Jarvis visited four or five of the hospitals that had been captured when the enemy retreated and concluded that \"nothing could exceed the filth & stench of their hos\u00ad pitals from so many wounded crowded to\u00ad gether and I felt happy when I had ended my visits.\" Most of the 300 to 400 patients he saw were suffering from the effects of grapeshot and round shot. \"Many had both legs and arms completely torn off. I saw THE WAR WITH MEXICO: THE TAYLOR AND KEARNY CAMPAIGNS 101 one fellow keeping the flies off by means of a palmetto leaf in his mouth both arms having been torn offat the shoulder joints.\" He learned that Mexican surgeons had per\u00ad formed many amputations in the field and that some of the amputees had died of tetanus. '5 For Taylor's medical staff, the difficulties were just beginning. New volunteer units started to arrive in May 1846, when U.S. troops were occupying the abandoned Ma\u00ad tamoros. The rains were heavy and lasted into September, low-lying ground was flooded, \"and the whole country saturated with water, [while] the exhalations from it were quickened by the heat of summer into persistent malaria.\" Mosquitoes were not the only creatures to pose a problem; a ta\u00ad rantula bit a volunteer surgeon and \"the effect of the poison was immediate and alarming. So violent were his spasms, that the united strength of several men was re\u00ad quired to confine him to his tent.\"\" Alcoholism was a problem in Mexico as in the United States. One patient at Ma\u00ad tamoros had been thrown into the guard\u00ad house while suffering from delirium tremens. While so disturbed, he borrowed a \"thick, one-bladed pocket knife,\" and \"completely excised the whole of gen\u00ad ital apparatus , close to the body.

The delirium tremens did not return, and the patient survived, sadder and perhaps even wiser. 11 The diseases in northern Mexico tended to be mild, but the rate of sickness, rela\u00ad tively low in June, increased as the summer progressed , especially among the volun\u00ad teers. Since almost 8,000 men were serving under Taylor by early June, it became nec\u00ad essary to erect another hospital building at Point Isabel and to open yet another facil\u00ad ity at Fort Brown.\" The problems that Taylor's surgeons en\u00ad countered as his force moved further into Mexico differed little in general outline. Volunteer s appear to have invariably fallen ill in greater numbers than regulars, and disease was invariably a more dangerous foe than the enemy. Malaria caused much illness, scurvy appeared from time to time, and measles and mumps amicted volunteer units, but dysentery and diarrhea caused more difficulties than any other ailment. General hospitals were established at var\u00ad ious points through which the army passed: at Mier and Camargo, near the Rio Grande; then at Cerralvo, where at least one surgeon attempted with little success to treat the many sick Mexican children; and finally at Monterrey.

Even in tents, where ventilation was not a problem, the death rate was sometimes high; one author esti\u00ad mated, for example, that 1,500 men died at Camargo. Many of these general hospi\u00ad tals appear to have remained open until the late spring of 1848, when U.S. troops fi\u00ad nally began to leave Mexico.'o Taylor and his army reached Monterrey on 19 September 1846. After a five-day struggle, during which U.S. forces suffered 120 killed and 368 wounded , the defenders evacuated the city. For U.S. surgeons car\u00ad ing for troops on the field of battle, it was \"all blood-blood-blood!\" and \"a dread\u00ad ful sight. ... Particularly where death [was) produced by artillery and the bursting of shells.\" Initially, only small tents or blan\u00ad kets on the ground were available for the wounded. Jarvis, and apparentl y some of his colleagues as well, were working in quarry pits, no more than five feet deep and wide, in which Jarvis had to stoop to avoid being injured himself. Once, when he had just completed one amputation and was preparing to do another, some soldiers fleeing a Mexican sally fell into the pit, on top of the wounded . Fortunately, the en\u00ad emy did not spot Jarvis himself, and the surgeon was able to continue his labor.\" As soon as the city of Monterre y surren\u00ad dered, wagons and litters began carrying the wounded into the city, where surgeons established general hospitals for each of three divisions. The 1st Division facility lay in the former home of a Mexican gen\u00ad eral, which was, unlike so many hospital sites, \"a beautiful place, with delightful gardens, [and) plenty of water.\" The house itself was \"Soldiers,\" pp. 288-89. uQuotes from Ltc, E.

In many cases, a condition then diagnosed as erysipelas (but which may have been hos\u00ad pital gangrene, another form of streptococ\u00ad cal infection) developed two to three days after surgery, causing sloughing of the in\u00ad volved tissue and either killing its victims or necessitating further amputation s. Ma\u00ad laria appeared among the hospitalized wounded , contributing to deaths and de\u00ad laying convalescence, striking soldiers in camp and the civilian population of the town as well. Supplies of quinine gave out, and surgeons were forced to rely on useless substitutes. Blankets , bedding, and lint were in short supply. \"Nostalgia \" (home\u00ad sickness) had \"a powerful depressing influ\u00ad ence\" on many of the new troops and volunteers, prolonging their recovery.\" The shortage of physicians seemed par\u00ad ticularly severe after the battle for Mon\u00ad terrey, when the wounded were added to the large number of sick already hospital\u00ad ized.

A soldier familiar with the work of the Medical Departm ent staff commented, \"Nothing can exceed the de\u00ad votion of our medical officers; they are lit\u00ad erally fatigued to death.\" Under the stress, one physician suffered a mental breakdown from which he never completely recovered.24 After 27 September, as the surgeons ac\u00ad quired the buildings necessary for division hospitals at Monterrey, more patients from regimental facilities began arriving, al\u00ad though it was not until I October that Jar\u00ad vis believed the large hospitals were ready to accommodate them. When President Polk disapproved the armistice that Taylor had arranged after taking Monterre y, and the war resumed, Taylor sent his 2d Divi\u00ad sion south to take Saltillo, an important Mexican road junction. The 2d Division Hospital at Monterrey was broken up, and patients unable to march were sent to one of the other two division hospitals, which had been reorganized so that all volunteers would be in one, all regulars in the other.\" Supplies were scarce at Saltillo, which Taylor's men took without opposition. Sur\u00ad geons set up another general hospital, but the senior surgeon was forced to buy some medicines locally, until the arrival of the 2,800 volunteers and 600 regulars of Brig. Gen. John E. Wool, who brought an ample supply of medicines with them from San Antonio, Texas. Wool and his men camped ~4QlIOIC from Henry.

Caring for the sick were four department physicians and volunteer surgeons at\u00ad tached to individual units. Although Con\u00ad gress had provided for two physicians to accompany each volunteer regiment, even this ratio was not always achieved in prac\u00ad tice; as a rule, for example, only one med\u00ad ical officer marched with the I st Illinois Volunteer Regimen!.\" The disease rate among Wool's men dropped after an early peak, and, since those unable to march were left behind in Texas at the San Antonio hospital, the de\u00ad parting force that started south in the fall of 1846 was, for the most part, healthy. One group of volunteers who had recently joined the force suffered greatly, however; a measles epidemic had left many weak; and the change in diet was causing much digestive distress among the men. The march, \"under scorching sun, and over plai ns covered, in many places, to the depth of two or three feet with water,\" had \"di\u00ad sastrous effects\" upon them, including res\u00ad piratory and relapses from measles. For the remainder of Wool's forces, however, the simple diet and vig\u00ad orous activity contributed to an improve\u00ad ment in health, despite such dangers as the 26Ltr.

Since Mexican War-era physicians could diagnose pneumonia. it is unlikely that the deaths blamed as measles actually resulted from this complication of the disease. It is probable that the virus then prevalent was more virulent than the present-day strain. 104 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 PAGE OF LETTER FROM NATHAN JARVIS To \"BEN,\" 16 June 1847.

By December the mortality rate was high; one of Wool's men recorded \"It was very seldom a man recovered after he had fallen into an aggravated state of the disease, and we knew cases where men have lain down in the evening and in the morning have been found choked to death, from the measels [sic).\"\" Fortunately , Wool's men had time to re\u00ad cover from the measles epidemic. The ar\u00ad mistice had ended, but General Taylor's unit did not see action again until late Feb\u00ad ruary 1847. By this time Maj. Gen. Win\u00ad field Scott had arrived in Mexico to take command of the effort there, siphoning off most of Taylor's regulars and leaving him with a force that was largely volunteer. Scott ordered Taylor to evacuate Saltillo, where health problems were severe, and to take up a defensive posture at Monterrey , which was regarded as among the healthiest cities in Mexico. Taylor, acting as if he had been merely advised to abandon his offen\u00ad sive, instead advanced south of Saltillo. Fi\u00ad nally, on 23 February, his forces met a much larger army under the Mexican gen\u00ad eral Santa Ana at Buena Vista. The U.S. victory there cost Taylor's troops 267 killed and 456 wounded, casualties that num\u00ad bered about half those of the enemy's.'\u00b7 Some members of Taylor's medical staff had been left behind to manage the hos\u00ad pitals behind the lines, but four Regular Army physicians in addition to those who had marched south with Wool were present at Buena Vista.

Wagons quickly removed the 400 to 500 U ,S. and Mexican wounded originally sent to the ca\u00ad thedral to Saltillo, often with the aid of \"a most gallant old gentleman,\" a civilian who, surprisingly, was \"always found dur\u00ad ing the battle, where he could be of service.\"J2 Although during the night after the battle all the wounded appear to have suffered greatly from cold, thirst, and hunger, those sent to the ranchea were particularly un\u00ad fortunate. A volunteer surgeon working there noted that \"those of the wounded still living, the dying and the dead [were] crowded together indescriminately [sic], ... presenting a melancholy picture of suf\u00ad fering and distress, not easily described, and never to be forgotten.\" A former pa\u00ad tient there remarked that \"the whole floor was covered with wounded ....

The surviving patients from the ranchea were moved to the cathedral as soon as pos\u00ad sible and then, several days later, were di\u00ad vided up among less crowded facilities, each of which could hold 50 to 100 men. Doctors attempted to have wounded vol\u00ad unteers from the same regiment housed to\u00ad gether. Officers apparently had pri vate quarters, but large numbers of enlisted men shared a common room. Mexican surgeons worked on their own wounded; at least half of their patients died, a fact a U.S. surgeon attributed to their \"diet composed of sac\u00ad charine, fatty, and other carbonaceous , and life of idleness and dissipation.\"14 The battle of Buena Vista marked the end of active campaigning for the army un\u00ad der Zachary Taylor, although many of the men who had come to Mexico with him participated in operations conducted fur\u00ad ther south and directed at Mexico City. While Taylor and Wool were undertaking the conquest of northeastern Mexico, how\u00ad ever, the Army of the West, under the com\u00ad mand of Brig. Gen. Stephen Kearny, launched a second campaign, one aimed at the northwestern region that included the present-day states of New Mexico and Cal\u00ad ifornia. In Kearny's force assembling at Fort Leavenworth in the spring of 1846 were a company of dragoons , as well as ar\u00ad tillery and infantry units, and an 860-man regiment of mounted volunteers led by Col. Alexander Doniphan. \" J-IHerrick, \"Surgery in the Hospitals\" 4:414-15, quote from 418. l)Georgc Rutledge Gibson, Journal 0/ a Soldier VI/\u00ad der Kearny and Doniphan. 1846-47. ed. Ralph P.

By early July, \"many were sick, lame, and exhausted,\" often too exhausted to con\u00ad tinue under their own power. Although the Mexicans presented no opposition to their progress , disease, privation , and stress soon incapacitated many and filled the wagons being used as ambulances. Inade\u00ad quate diet led in some instances to scurvy, good water was often hard to find, and \"the mosquitoes came out in clouds in the in\u00ad tense heat of the midday sun.\"\" Although it is difficult to be precise about the number of physicians with Kearny on the Fort Leavenworth-Santa Fe portion of his march, at least six accom\u00ad panied him. The medical director and two assistant surgeons were Regular Army phy\u00ad sicians. One of these doctors was John S. Griffin, who, having been replaced as post surgeon at Fort Leavenworth by a volun\u00ad teer surgeon, accompanied Kearny the en\u00ad tire way to California. A doctor left at Bent's Fort, in what is now Colorado, with three invalids was apparently a volunteer. Two more surgeons may also have been vol\u00ad unteers; one of them early acquired a rep\u00ad utation as \"both lazy and too ignorant to attend to the duties of his office.\"\" l6Abraharn Robinson Johnston, Marcellus Ball Ed\u00ad wards, and Philip Gooch Ferguson, Marching With lite Army of the West. cd.

At Santa Fe, Kearny divided his force. Although he and 300 dragoons, a 14-man topographical team, and a few scouts con\u00ad tinued westward, Colonel Doniphan and his Missouri volunteers initially remained in what would become New Mexico. They attempted to work at pacifying the Navajo Indians, but their ultimate goal was Chi\u00ad huahua, about 200 miles into Mexico, where they were to join Wool. Although Doniphan 's men were suffering from fevers and measles, after signing a treaty with the Navajo on 22 November and learning that the Mexicans were planning to defend EI Paso, on the route to Chihuahua, the colo\u00ad nel decided to march south. Moving so rap\u00ad idly that there was no time for him to receive additiona l supplies or reinforce\u00ad ments, Doniphan took EI Paso at the end of December and then continued south. Word that Wool's plans had changed and that he would not be at Chihuahua did not deter Doniphan. Covering as many as 50 miles in one day through unfriendly ter\u00ad rain, enduring the effects of short rations and inadequate supplies of water, and threatened by snakes, scorpions, and grass fires, by February 1847 Doniphan and his men were approaching their goal. After de\u00ad feating the Mexicans near Chihuahua, they camped at that town, awaiting further or\u00ad ders. On 21 May, only ten days before their terms of enlistment were up, orders arrived for them to join Wool at Saltillo.\" J8lrey, \"Soldiers,\" pp. 292-93: R.

One was an American civilian hired in Chihuahua, where the Mexicans had imprisoned him when war was declared. Although these doctors were probably unfamiliar with the demands of military medicine, they were called upon to care for a command with a sick rate that approached 33 percent and a high death rate as well. Their patients in\u00ad cluded many with measles, fevers, and diarrhea. After the engagement near Chi\u00ad huahua, in which Doniphan lost five wounded and one killed, they cared not only for their own wounded, but for Mex\u00ad ican casualties as well. They performed a large number of amputation s; a veteran of the battle noted that it was \"a sight to see the pile of legs and arms that have been amputated, \"J9 Both the men who remained at Sante Fe and the volunteers who came in after Kearny and Doniphan left were often sick, some from malaria acquired earlier, others from such diseases as tonsillitis, colds, measles, dysentery, typhus, and \"a disease affecting the men something like mumps.\" The death rate could be five to eight in one day. Houses were converted into hospitals, but by the end of October 1846, when there were at least 2,700 men at Sante Fe with more still arriving, the hospitals were full. Supplies were running short because of the difficulties involved in predicting how many volunteers would come in, and there was confusion as to where these supplies should come from. The Regular Army phy- Under file United Srafes (Norman: University of Ok la\u00ad homa Press. 1949), Horn, Uf, James Shields to Lawson (28 Jan 1949), RG 112. entry 12. sic ian who was in charge of the general hos\u00ad pital at Sante Fe, Samuel De Camp, fell ill himself. He recovered quickly, but even with the aid of three medical officers work\u00ad ing directly under him, two of whom were Regular Army surgeons, and the physicians with the volunteers, De Camp was unable to stem the tide of illness among the vol\u00ad unteers. On 10 November, six men died, and the next day five more, several from measles. As the weather turned colder and the wind rose, not all the volunteers could find adequate shelter. One noted, \"A great mortality prevails among the troops who are dying from exposure and disease.\"'o Through the winter until early February 1847, the men remaining at Santa Fe were occupied principa lly with subduing Indian and Mexican rebels. The health of the com\u00ad mand remained poor; even in mid-April , pneumonia and other respiratory ailments as well as severe cases of fever confronted medical officers there. The supply of med\u00ad icines was limited through much of the spring, and attempts to improve the health of the command were often frustrated. Many of the men preferred bread and meat to vegetables and fruits, and De Camp maintained that a \"vegetable diet [was] al\u00ad most unknown in New Mexico.\" By the time scurvy appeared among the men, many of the Missouri volunteers were al\u00ad ready sick, having been in poor health when they started their journey to New Mexico, where they hoped to improve or even regain their health through the change in climate. As a result, by the time they reached Santa Fe, some men were in no condition to work. According to De Camp, \"Many of them have not done one day's 4\u00b0GibsOIl, Journal. pp. 271, 271n, first quote, p. 244; , JOl/mal. p. 13, second quote, p. 37; Ltf, De Camp 10 Lawson (21 Oct 1846), RG 112, entry 12; Surgeon's Quarterly Rpt, Army or the West (31 Dec 1846), RG 94, entry 634. 108 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 SAMUEL DE CAMP.

Noting, however, that the men from Missouri , unlike many of the other soldiers at Santa Fe, were accus\u00ad tomed to a vegetable diet, he urged that seeds be sent to him so he could plant a garden for their benefit. Whether he ever received his seeds is not known, but, if planted, the garden could not have been very successful ; in March 1848, 79 men in a command of fewer than 250 volunteers were reported to have suffered from scurvy in the preceding quarter. 41 41Quotes from Ltr, Dc Camp to Lawson (14 Apr 1847), RG 112, entry 12; Ltr, Heiskell to Lawson 1847), RG J 12, entry 2, 17:266; Surgeon's One further venture into Mexico took place from Santa Fe in the spring of 1848, when the officer commanding in New Mex\u00ad ico led approximately I, I 00 regulars and volunteers accompanied by two surgeons toward Chihuahua. In mid-March and after the actual signing of the peace treaty, they encountered a Mexican force at Santa Cruz. The U.S. triumph left three of the victors dead and nineteen wounded. Chi\u00ad huahua was reoccupied, but disease proved to be a devastating enemy; few were spared at least one episode of diarrhea, dysentery , respiratory infection, scurvy, or a venereal disease in the first quarter of 1848, before returning to Santa Fe.\" Kearny himself left Santa Fe for San Diego late in September 1846 with a force of mounted troops. Learning two weeks later that the U.S. Navy's Pacific squadron had already secured the principal Califor\u00ad nia ports, he sent 200 dragoons and a sur\u00ad geon back to Santa Fe, and with the two remaining companies of dragoons contin\u00ad ued his westward journey. The two Regular Army surgeons who were with him appar\u00ad ently drew straws to determine who would return to Santa Fe, and Griffin won the right to continue on with Kearny.\" On 6 December , when Kearny's men were but thirty-nine miles from San Diego and both mules and riders were exhausted, a force of Californians attacked them at San Pasqual. Although he was now the only surgeon with the unit, Griffin was eager to share in the action. Aware that Kearny would not permit him to do so, he at\u00ad tempted to sneak forward unseen by his commander.

He was forced to flee to gain the protection of the dragoons. Although Griffin escaped injury, the battle of San Pasqual left eigh\u00ad teen U.S. dragoons dead and nineteen wounded. Among the injured was Kearny himself, who suffered two painful wounds.44 After the battle, Griffin worked late into the night caring for the wounded. The de\u00ad vices dubbed ambulances that soldiers pre\u00ad pared for his patients appear actually to have been merely buffalo-hide travois fas\u00ad tened between willow poles, each dragged behind a mule. When the expedition took to the road the next day, the wounded in the middle of the group for protection, \"the ambulan ces grated on the ground, and the sufferings of the wounded were very dis\u00ad tressing.\" Kearny himself was able to ride and was thus spared this agony. On the sec\u00ad ond day after the battie, one of the wounded died, and the rest were in no con\u00ad dition to progress farther. Kearny sent three men ahead to San Diego for help. He ordered that the dead man, \"a gallant fel\u00ad low, who had,just before leaving Fort Leav\u00ad enworth, married a pretty wife,\" be buried deep in the ground and his grave covered with heavy stones so that wolves would not dig up the body. The survivors of Kearny's force then settled down to wait until the wounded were well enough to ride; Kearny believed that slow-movin g wagons required a heavier guard than he could provide. On 10 December, shortly after Griffin had concluded that all but two of the injured were able to ride, a rescue party of 100 sailors and 80 marines rode in from 44Warren, \"Griffin\" 33; 102; Emory, Reporrs. California Histor\u00b7 ical Society QlIllnerly 1 (1923):240. San Diego to escort them to safety. The wounded entered a Navy hospital; while they were there, someone stole their blan\u00ad kets, presumably the first of the many thefts of this type to plague the Army's sick in California.\" Kearny's supply train came west to Cal\u00ad ifornia from Santa Fe by a more southern route than the general had taken. Guarded by a volunteer battalion of Mormons com\u00ad manded by Lt. Col. Philip St. George Cooke, the wagon train and the surgeon assigned to the entire force, a volunteer gi ven to overdosing his patients with cal\u00ad omel, arrived in San Diego at the end of January 1847. The battalion remained a short time for recuperation and drill at the California mission at San Luis Rey, just north of San Diego, before being broken up into companies and sent to San Diego and Los Angeles, which had been peace\u00ad fully surrendered on 10 January. The sur\u00ad geon with Cooke's force appears to have remained with them at San Luis Rey and then been reassigned to Los Angeles, while Griffin remained for several months at San Diego.\" Surgeon General Lawson announced early in December 1846 that the medical needs of the units newly arrived in Cali\u00ad fornia could be supplied better from St. Louis than New York. The Medical De\u00ad partment also shipped some supplies with transport s taking troops to California by 4~Emory, Reports. pp. 168, Shop, p. 2; Arthur Woodward , Lances at Sail Pascllal A. B.

Griffin, the first Regular Army surgeon to arrive in California, served as a medical purveyor, receiving the supplies and then distributing them to both volunteer and Regular Army physicians. He does not ap\u00ad pear, however, to have been as methodic al as Lawson would have wished; Lawson was repeated ly irritated by Griffin's failure to file his reports on time. Moreover, when the surgeon received orders late in the spring of 1847 to report for duty to Los Angeles, he forgot to bring his medical rec\u00ad ords with him. He also appears to have for\u00ad gotten to lock up the supplies he left behind for his successor, and, as a result, they were stolen. Unlucky when it came to theft, in November 1847 Griffin reported that a volunteer hospital steward had been steal-ing his more expensive medicines, includ\u00ad ing morphine :n By the time Griffin was ordered to Los Angeles, significant resistance had come to an end in California, and Army surgeons were able to settle down into a peacetime routine. Ships brought volunteers around Cape Horn to the newly acquired territory; on one such vessel was assistant surgeon Robert Murray, who would become sur\u00ad geon general in 1883. Like the other sur\u00ad geons in California, he was soon involved in treating the victims of accidents and In\u00ad dians, diarrhea and typhoid. He may, like Griffin, have even treated soldiers newly landed from the six-month voyage around Cape Horn who were suffering from scurvy.48 Conclusion Surgeons who, like Griffin, served in the northern province s of Mexico, faced fa\u00ad miliar diseases of a kind to be found at many of the forts in the West. Nevertheless, because there were so few doctors in pro\u00ad portion to the number of sick and wounded, the strain upon these medical of\u00ad ficers was great. Their principal difficulties involved caring for relatively large num\u00ad bers of troops on the move and in finding adequate shelter for those of the sick and wounded who were unable to march with their comrades. The setting for the Medical Department 's greatest challenge, however, lay to the south. 41Warren, \"Griffin\" 33: 118,120-21,258; Ltrs, Law\u00ad son to AG 1846) and Heiskell to King (2 Aug 1847), both in RG 112, entry 2, 17:95 and 591, re\u00ad spectively; George Sanderson to Grimn (8 Apr 1847) and Griffin to Lawson (I JUIl 1847), both in Warren, \"Griffin\" 33: 112,118, respectively ; Griffin to Lawson (22 RG 112, entry 12. 4SWarren, \"Griffin\" 33:252-53, 258-59, 267. Chapter 6 The War With Mexico: Scott's Campaign The campaign s in Mexico's northern provinces, though successful, failed to bring that nation to her knees. As a result, in the autumn of 1846, Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott began planning a campaign to take Mexico City itself. Among his most im\u00ad portant considerations at this time was the danger of yellow fever which, he was con\u00ad vinced, would make serious inroads into his force if April 1847 and the following months were to find him still in the mos\u00ad quito-ridden coastal areas. Joining General Scott in New Orleans at the end of 1846 was his good friend Sur\u00ad geon General Thomas Lawson, who, after several months of sniping from the side\u00ad lines at the way Taylor and his medical di\u00ad rector were handling the assignment of surgeons, had arranged to visit that city. The purpose of Lawson's trip was osten\u00ad sibly to supervise the establishment of a medical supply depot, but he quickly ac\u00ad cepted Scott's invitation to accompany him on his march to Mexico. The surgeon general remained with the invading force from December 1846 through early 1848, but he insisted that he was present 111 an advisory capacity only.' ILtrs, Lawson to Walker (29 Aug 1846) and to Alex~ andcr Suter (11 Nov 1846), RG 112, entry 2, 16:473 and 17:53, respectively; sec also the collection The question of why Lawson did not of\u00ad ficially take over the duties of the medical director for Scott's army has no obvious answer. He rarely usurped the prerogatives of his subordinat e, who was obviously in no position to protest encroachment. Law\u00ad son had, of course, found the management of medical officers and their work from Washington during wartime a frustrating business at best. His refusal to assume overall responsibility for the medical care of Scott's army while in the field suggests that he would have been happiest merely serving as a senior surgeon on the battle\u00ad field, where the excitement was great and the responsibilities relatively uncompli\u00ad cated. Available evidence indicates that Lawson's somewhat ambiguous position in Mexico, far from being helpful to his sur\u00ad geons, actually caused confusion. His ab\u00ad sence from his desk in Washington, moreover, meant that, at this crucial time, one of his subordinat es, surgeon Henry Heiskell, was acting surgeon general, mak\u00ad ing the important decisions about supply and the apportionm ent of the Medical De\u00ad partment's limited number of surgeons.

(Map 4) On the island, Surgeon Richard S. Satterlee was running short of quinine in December 1846, and an outbreak of small\u00ad pox detained three companies of Pennsyl\u00ad vania volunteers when their comrades departed for the assault on Vera Cruz. Mis\u00ad sissippi volunteers, the \"most lawless set of men\" the surgeon general had ever seen, ran up bills with private physicians without authorization. J When two divisions from Taylor's force arrived to join Scott's command at Tam\u00ad pico in the summer of 1847, surgeons found it necessary to establish a general hospital to care for the sick. Like so many of the general hospitals established in Mex\u00ad ico, the Tampico facility apparently re\u00ad mained in operation at least through the spring of 1848, at which time more than a thousand volunteers and a tenth as many regulars were stationed in that town.

Establish ing a Base: Vera Cruz Despite his best efforts, Scott was a month behind his timetable when his 6,000 regulars and 8,000 volunteers left Tampico and Lobos Island and landed near Vera Cruz in early March 1847.

PORTER. (Collrlesy of Nalional Li\u00ad brary of Medicine.) twenty physician s with Scott could care for their patients during the siege of that town. When the Mexican s there surrendered, Army doctors set to work to locate more permanent quarters for both sick and healthy. They also began to deal with the various forms of filth that littered the city's streets, which they found to be broad and easily cleaned. Surgeon John Porter took over an old Franciscan convent facing the sea to serve as a general hospital, attracted by its excellent ventilation and good water supply. (Church and monastery buildings would prove to be popular choices as Army hospitals in Mexico.) Porter was not able, however, to obtain competent hospital at\u00ad tendants, and moving the wounded to the new facility, often by means of a blanket carried by four men, irritated wounds and may have caused one death. To add to Por-ter's troubles, many of his patients were afflicted with diarrhea, but the new hos\u00ad pital contained neither privies nor \"cham\u00ad ber utensils.'\" Because of its location, Vera Cruz be\u00ad came the site both of an important general hospital and of the principal medical sup\u00ad ply depot for General Scott's campaign. The medical purveyor there, Charles H. Laub, was apparently responsible for dis\u00ad tributing supplies that arrived at his post to the purveyors at other bases in central Mexico, but the presence of the surgeon general in Mexico caused him some con\u00ad fusion. In the early summer of 1847, Laub was still submittin g his reports on the re\u00ad ceipt of shipments to Lawson, and since Lawson did not bother to forward these documents to Washington, the New York City supply officer assumed that supplies were going astray and continued to ship more. Laub, on the other hand, concluded that the arrival of goods he had not ordered meant that requisition s were no longer nec\u00ad essary. Not until August, when the true na\u00ad ture of the problem began to emerge, did Laub realize that he should be reporting directly to Washington both on the arrival of shipments and on his future needs.6 The supply situation in 1847 was also complicated by the fact that more men were being called up than the Medical De\u00ad partment had prepared for.

THE WAR WITH MEXICO: SCOTT'S CAMPAIGN 115 acting surgeon general Henry Heiskell de\u00ad plored in particular the extravagance of volunteer surgeons; another member of the department's staff directed the same com\u00ad ment at volunteer nurses and hospital at\u00ad tendants as well. Occasional orders to supply medicines to teamsters and other employees of the Quartermaster's Depart\u00ad ment made the attempts of the Surgeon General's Office to predict need accurately all the more difficult. Unexpected calls for supplies apparently were not unusual at lower levels in the chain. Purveyor Laub, for example, was distressed to learn in the fall of 1847 that he would be responsible for supplying the units coming south from the Rio Grande area, where they had been serving under General Taylor, since they were apparently bringing little in the way of supplies with them.' Two items that would in the future be considered vital were not among regular shipments through Vera Cruz. A visiting civilian physician brought ether and the ap\u00ad paratus to administer it to the hospitals and demonstrated its use, but it inspired no enthusiasm. Lawson himself deter\u00ad mined that the volatility of ether and the fragility of the necessary equipment made anesthesia impractical in Mexico. Porter concluded that its continued use would only add to the toll at that hospital. He blamed ether for slow healing as well as for the excessive bleeding that had character\u00ad ized a thigh amputation that he saw per\u00ad formed with its aid. It poisoned the blood, he maintained, and damaged muscle \"con\u00ad tractility.\" He speculated also about the re\u00ad lationship between ether and an increase in hospital gangrene (which was probably a streptococcal infection) and stated (in- lLtrs, Heiskell to Craig (6 Sep 1847), RG 112, entry 2, 18:51; Glen to Lawson (I Dec 1846) and Laub to Lawson (29 Oct 1847), both in RG 112, entry 12. CHARLES H. LAUS.

One authority maintains that the department did not use this type ~Quot e from J. B.

A soldier who was in Mexico in December 1847, however, wrote of his trip in an \"am\u00ad bulance,\" which he described as a closed and very uncomfortable wagon with springs. It seems unlikely that the vehicles referred to as ambulances in such contem\u00ad porary documents were built to serve ex\u00ad clusively as such. Lawson's order for fifty wagons specifically designed to carry the wounded, apparently placed after the start of the war, was lost in the Quartermaster 's Department until too late for them to be used in Mexico and was thus apparently never filled' Like the supply depot, the general hos\u00ad pital established at Vera Cruz was vital to the campaign. It remained open for the re\u00ad mainder of the war, caring for an average offrom 300 to 800 patients at a time, many of whom were probably destined for evac\u00ad uation to New Orleans. Patients from units stationed nearby were sent to Vera Cruz when their camp had no attending surgeon or no accommodation s for the sick. Not all of the hospital's occupants were soldiers; a few were civilian laborers, often \"Irishmen, and very dissipated.\" When Scott's army prepared to advance beyond the coastal areas, the sick and wounded in regimental hospitals who were unable to march swelled the population of the general hos\u00ad pital; a total of more than 1,000 soldiers remained behind.

By July the disease rate was so high that some patients had to lie on blankets on the hospital floor. The number of at\u00ad tendants fluctuated from month to month, but at the end of April, II stewards , 2 cooks, 4 male nurses, I ward master, and 4 Mexican matrons were on duty at Vera Cruz. There, as elsewhere , the shortage of physicians also made itself felt, but supply problems , at least, were minor. 1O Many diseases brought patients to the Vera Cruz hospital, but yellow fever was most feared. The physician in charge con\u00ad cluded that yellow fever was most danger\u00ad ous in summer, although it was present throughout the year and posed a greater threat to newcomer s than to the native population , most of whom were already immune. Malarial fevers were also com\u00ad mon, and dysentery-like illnesses were a constant threat to soldiers in such a cli\u00ad mate. Nevertheless, General Scott believed that it would be safe for troops to stay in Vera Cruz as long as they did not associate with the natives and remained in the water\u00ad front area with its breezes from the sea. He was confident that men assigned to the cas\u00ad tle of San Juan de Ulloa, on an island in the harbor, would escape yellow fever en\u00ad tirely. In this notion he was sadly mistaken .

Both vol\u00ad unteer and regular surgeons contracted yel\u00ad low fever, and at least two died of it.\" Physicians at Vera Cruz treated yellow fever with 15 to 25 grains of quinine to reduce the fever and baths and mustard plasters to equalize \"temperature and evacuation of the bowels; ... five or six passages in as short a time as practicable\" being considered desirable to alleviate stomach irritation and nausea. Cupping was favored over bleeding by means of either venesection or leeches.\" Despite the efforts of surgeons at Vera Cruz, legends grew up about disease and death there. At least one veteran of the Mexican War believed that \"a great many deaths occurred, chiefly among that class of people who neither have the means nor care to take pains about health-such as Qr. Mr.s men & soldiers-they have died by the hundreds of yellow fever, dysentery and bad wounds. Occasionall y an officer is stricken down, but altho' all nearly have been sick, few have died, because they had had good attendance & good treatmen t.\"13 Part of the reason for the high death rate at the Vera Cruz hospital lay in the fact \"Ltrs, Scott to Marcy (5 Apr 1847), in War De\u00ad partment, Correspondence , p. 100; Porter to Heiskell (19 Sep and 8 Oct 1847), both in RG entry 12; Porter, Quarterly Cruz 1847), San Juan de Ulloa (30 Sep 1847 and 31 Mar and 30 Jun 1848), and Surgeon's Monthly Rpt, San Juan de Ulloa (31 Aug 1847), all in RG 94, entry from Gorgas to his mother (6 Aug 1847), in Frank E.

The death rate at this facility from all causes among Army and nonmilitary pa\u00ad tients from I April 1847 to 21 March 1848 was 12 percent (775 of6,466 patients died). Appalling though it may appear, this rate compared favorably with the 15 to 20 per\u00ad cent mortality experienced by British forces during the Crimean War and the 25 to 30 percent of the French in the same conflict, as estimated by Louis Duncan, and the 15 percent at the New Orleans Charity Hospital at this time.\" Compared to other causes of death at Vera Cruz, yellow fever did not prove to be as dangerous as had been feared. From April through September 1847, the yellow\u00ad fever season, 3,874 patients, both military and civilian, entered the Vera Cruz hos\u00ad pital, but only 402 of them had yellow fe\u00ad ver, of whom 109 died. In contrast, almost a third of all those hospitalized were pa\u00ad tients with diarrhea or dysentery, of whom 199 died. In August, a frightening 67 per\u00ad cent of the victims of yellow fever died, but the average overall death rate from that dis\u00ad ease during the spring and summer of 1847 did not exceed 28 percent.\" 14Portcr, \"Notes\" 26:301, 332-33; Ltrs, Scott to (13 Feb 1847), in timates concerning Crimean casualty and mortality rates vary widely.

He was still so weak in April that one observer believed he was \"breaking down\" and predicted that his departure from Mexico was imminent.

Although the men who marched inland from Vera Cruz in April 1847 left yellow fever behind them, intestinal dis\u00ad orders followed.

L7 The battIe for the control of the Cerro Gordo pass left sixty-four U.S. soldiers dead. Surgeons worked twenty-four hours and more in the open air, caring for the 353 wounded on a great plateau of table land with giant precipices here and towering ledges of rock there, standing askew as if nature, when the earth was cooling from a molten mass, had wrenched the earth asunder, grasping and tearing out a huge proportion and carrying it away to leave a shelf where man might get a foothold and build his habitation. Scott ordered that as soon as the U.S. vic\u00ad tory seemed assured, one wagon per regi\u00ad ment .and another for the cavalry gather up the wounded and take them to the appro\u00ad priate hospitals. The decision as to which facility should be used for each case was made not by the medical director, but by the surgeon general himself. The wagon al\u00ad lotment must have been inadequate, for some patients were moved. by litter, but when darkness fell, none of the wounded remained on the field.\" Because the Mexicans had used old mus\u00ad kets firing round balls, wounds were not serious except for injuries caused by artil\u00ad lery fire. As a result, only 10 percent of the wounded from Cerro Gordo died. Supply wagons returning to Vera Cruz carried the less seriously hurt back with them. Al\u00ad though the temporary hospital at Plan del Rio lacked both hospital furniture and bed\u00ad ding, and the supply of drugs, instruments, and dressings was small, most patients re\u00ad mained at this facility for at least a short time.

Since medical officers were attached to units rather than hospitals, these men took their doctors with them, leaving only one physician , a Regular Army surgeon, to care for 200 wounded. Scott's force occupied Jalapa after the Cerro Gordo victory, and wagons moved many of the wounded there from Plan del Rio at the end of April. As they neared the town, these sufferers were enveloped by \"air ... filled with sweet fragrance of or\u00ad ange trees, making the entry of Jalapa more like the Garden of Eden.\" The approach appears to have been so dramatic that de\u00ad spite the jostling of the wagons and the ag\u00ad ony of their wounds, the injured men could still be \"amazed by the hills of the city.\" The discomfort caused the patient by being moved by litter is not known, but carrying one was apparently a depressing duty; a sol\u00ad dier who had been required to bear a litter finally vowed he would kill himself before he spent another day at such a task. He then leaned on the muzzle of his gun, pulled the trigger with his big toe, and brought his earthly sufferings to an end.\" The Jalapa hospital was apparently lo\u00ad cated in a church or buildings attached to a church. It evidently lacked even the most essential equipment , and its attendants, like those at Vera Cruz, were men unfit for anything but hospital duty. As many as 1,000 men went through this facility, and although one patient believed that \"men are dying in this hospital almost con\u00ad stantly,\" the mortality was actually only 20 percent. In a castle at Perote, a short dis\u00ad tance beyond Jalapa, was a second hospital, 19Qswandel, NOles, p. 383, first Quote, p. 140; second quote. Thomas D.

The Perote unit remained open through the summer, but by August the deaths among the 300 patients sheltered there were mounting. The average death rate was about four a day but could be as high as twelve. A majority of the deaths were blamed on diseases contracted on the march, most often diarrhea and dysentery .'o When Scott ordered his men forward once more in May, he hesitated to leave the sick and wounded at Jalapa, where they would be unguarded should the enemy at\u00ad tempt to harrass them. Moving them, how\u00ad ever, would also expose them to enemy attack and, in addition, would further un\u00ad dermine the health of many. Scott appears to have finally decided to leave at Jalapa those too ill to withstand two days on the road, trusting the Mexicans to follow the tradition that \"military hospitals are uni\u00ad versally regarded, by civilized enemies, as sacred.\" The patients left at Jalapa re\u00ad mained safe until their evacuation at the end of June, and the facility appears to have reopened in the fall of 1847. Although \"infernal fleas and other creeping things\" were infesting the hospital, diarrhea-like ailments rather than insect-borne diseases caused the highest percentage of deaths, at least among the volunteers.

In one regiment men were soon dying at the rate of two a day. Over 1,000 there were on sick report as of 4 June 1847. Surgeons blamed the disease rate on bad food, the change in diet, poor cooking, the weather, and the weakened condition of the men. When the army left Puebla during the second week in August, 2,000 men who were sick or convalescent stayed behind. Still others fell ill along the way, requiring surgeons to establish hos\u00ad pitals at other sites through which Scott's force passed on its way to Mexico City, while supply trains returning to Vera Cruz through these towns picked up invalids to carry them on the first leg of their trip home. Many who remained with the army were also suffering from diarrhea , and some carried their own supply of opium to treat themselves .\" On 18 August, Scott's surgeons set up another general hospital at San Augustin, ten miles south of Mexico City. During the following two days, Mexican forces killed 137 U.S. soldiers and wounded another 877. Despite rain and cold, at least thirty\u00ad two surgeons, including Lawson, worked night and day to care for the injured.

A facility was also opened at San Antonio, principally to care for the Mexican wounded, who apparently pre\u00ad ferred treatment from U.S. Army physicians.23 As he approached Mexico City, Scott or\u00ad dered a general hospital established at Mix\u00ad coac, where he placed the surgeon serving as the medical purveyor for his army in charge, aided by ten assistants. This facility remained in operation until after the sur\u00ad render of Mexico City. A second hospital was established in the archbishop 's pal\u00ad ace west of Tacubaya, near Scott's headquarters. On 8 September, U.S. troops met the Mexicans at Molino del Rey. Present were Lawson and eleven other Medical Depart\u00ad ment surgeons, two of whom were wounded. Litters and wagons took the casualties from the battle to Tacubaya. One of the injured physicians , who had been shot in the head while leading troops after their officers had fallen, died there of a brain abscess. A few days later, while view\u00ad ing his men as they attacked the castle of Chapultepec, Scott realized that the Ta\u00ad cubaya hospital was within the range of en\u00ad emy guns and ordered its occupants evacuated to Mixcoac.

Just as Scott's troops were completing their victory at the na\u00ad tion's capital, Mexican guerrillas were launching an attack on PuebIa, with its gar\u00ad rison of 800. Santa Ana and several thou\u00ad sand men quickly reinforced the attackers. Although a typhoid epidemic reportedly struck during the siege and killed hundreds of the defenders in a short time, as many as 600 of the 1,800 patients at Puebla were well enough to aid in the city's defense. On the evening of 28 September, \"the Mexi\u00ad cans (cowardly dogs) attacked our hospital, and succeeded in setting fire to the main gate.\" Even though the siege was not lifted for two weeks, the hospital was able to con\u00ad tinue in operation much as before, appar\u00ad ently closing only in the summer of 1848'\" Ajier the Victory Despite the action at Puebla, the active phase of the war was essentially over when U.S. forces took Mexico City. Scott's med\u00ad ical director, wishing to close the facilities outside the city, quickly searched out buildings suitable for use as division hos\u00ad pitals within Mexico City. He often chose convents or official palaces, but even the best of these were still cold, damp, dark, badly ventilated and, in the opinion of U.S. surgeons, conducive to digestive problems and fevers. Floors were often brick or tile. Since there were no chimneys, presumably there was no artificial heat. Windows opened into a central courtyard, thereby limiting the ventilation. The real cause of health problems, however, lay in the char\u00ad acter of Mexico City itself. The city in gen\u00ad eral was \"exceedingly from Rpt, Puebla (16 Jun 1848), RG 94, 634; Moore, SCOII'S Campaign ill Mexico, pp. 212-14, 217-18. in which one hospital was located was poorly drained, so that sewage remained near the surface. \"The poor [had] no pri v\u00ad ies, and their excrement [was] at once de\u00ad posited in the open street, [while] the lower order of people [was] almost universa lly af\u00ad fected with lice, and fleas [were] the in\u00ad mates of the palace as well as the hovel.\" Not surprisingly, typhoid could appear year round, and many U.S. soldiers con\u00ad tracted it while in the city.\" In Mexico City the division hospitals were merely collections of regimental hos\u00ad pitals, functioni ng under the overall super\u00ad vision of a surgeon at the division level. Although some of the funds of each regi\u00ad ment intended for its sick were sent to help finance the division hospital, Scott also lev\u00ad ied a tax on the city, $20,000 of which went to meet hospital expenses. By December 1847 the number of patients in Mexico City hospitals had declined, permitting all to be moved into one general hospital, which was sheltered in several large build\u00ad ings under the control of a single surgeon and four assistant surgeons.27 Nevertheless, disease continued to be a major problem for troops in Mexico. The volunteers who continued to come into Mexico even after the end of significant military action often fell ill, frequently with diarrhea. A Kentucky unit was devastated by one ailment after another, beginning with measles that afflicted the men even before they started out. Some had not en\u00ad tirely recovered from the measles when they boarded ship and subsequently be\u00ad came seasick. \"The Sight was laugh\u00ad able ....

The hold was full of sick men & the whole boat presented the most sickening scene.\" The seasickness eased in a day or two, but then, not long after the unit landed on 16 November 1847, diar\u00ad rhea took over. Soldiers too ill to march were left behind at the ship or at the nearest hospital. The sick tried many remedies to cure their diarrhea, including bathing their feet in warm water and drinking \"some cayenne pepper tea,\" evidently placing lit\u00ad tle faith in professional medical advice un\u00ad til amateur remedies had failed. By early December one man was so ill with diarrh ea that he had to be hospitalized at Jalapa. As the unit continued to move inland, wagons picked up those too sick to march, and more were hospitalized, twenty being left at the Puebla facility. 28 Incoming volunteer units were not the only ones afflicted with diarrhea. Three companies out often ordered to leave Mex\u00ad ico City for Vera Cruz and, presumably, to return to the United States in March 1848, for example, were detained because of what was called \"the diarrhea blues.\" Further\u00ad more, measles and mumps apparentl y oc\u00ad casiona lly appeared among volunteers already in Mexico, and erysipelas, in ad\u00ad dition to malaria, was reported to be \"com\u00ad mon among all the corps.\" In January, almost 4,000 of the 15,000 men in Mexico were sick. Thus, even though hostilities were over, as long as U.S. soldiers remained in Mexico, hospitals would be needed to shelter their sick, not only at Mexico City but also at Vera Cruz, Jalapa, and other sites where troops were stationed or through which any great number of them might pass.\" \"Hinds, \"Cox\" 41,46,47,49,213, pp. 39 and 214, respectively. 29First quote.

As a result, to their sufferings were added the torture of sixteen or more days in a wagon, tossed about from Mexico City and Puebla to Vera Cruz, where they boarded ships bound for New Orleans. Physicians accompanied them on each leg of this trip, but the stress of the journey upon men already in a weakened state in\u00ad creased their chances of falling ill. Many, having survived their wounds, died of dis\u00ad ease. Once on board ship, they too often lay upon the deck without cover, present\u00ad ing, according to Assistant Surgeon Charles McCormick, \"a spectacle of the most heart rending distress, & extreme suffering,\" their situation made yet more depressing by the fact that the sick were scattered among the dead and dying and surrounded by dirt and filth.'o The sufferings of the invalids returning to the United States did not end with their arrival at New Orleans. In one instance, a volunteer surgeon accompanying 128 pa\u00ad tients neglected them on board ship and abandoned them entirely as soon as they got to shore. His failure to turn them over to anyone else allowed them to scatter throughout the city, so that eight were never found.

THE WAR WITH MEXICO: SCOTT'S CAMPAIGN 123 invalids developed delirium tremens when the ship arrived at New Orleans. Moreover, the hospital in that city was becoming over\u00ad crowded. A nearby barracks and the build\u00ad ings ofa private institution were taken over to shelter the casualties, but an outbreak of yellow fever in the summer of 1847 further congested the New Orleans facilities, which until the spring of 1848 could shelter an absolute maximum of 300 men.\" In 1847 the acting surgeon general in Washington urged that some patients at New Orleans be moved upriver to Baton Rouge, where the barracks hospital was empty; if the barracks itself was also used, 100 or more patients could be accommo\u00ad dated. Medical and hospital supplies were plentiful, and a good private physician was available nearby. This hospital, however, was not ready for patients until September 1847, when the preparation of 30 spaces was complete, and 100 more were almost ready for occupancy. This number, how\u00ad ever, was insufficient to give the New Or\u00ad leans facilities much relief, and when Lawson himself returned from Mexico to New Orleans, he found the situation there as bad as ever. 32 Such a large number of invalids contin\u00ad ued to come in to New Orleans that by 1848 the situation was critical.

Lawson urged that Congress take greater heed of the problem Mexican War invalids posed; a new hos\u00ad pital should be built in New Orleans and specially equipped hospital ships sent to return men from Vera Cruz to New Orle\u00ad ans. Lawson's suggestions about hospital ships were evidently ignored, but by June 1848 the Army had taken over new facili\u00ad ties under construction at New Orleans that had originally been planned as a hos\u00ad pital for merchant seamen. While this proj\u00ad ect remained incomplete, a general hospital apparently capable of taking at least 300 patients was opened on Greenwood Island, near Pascagou la, Mississippi, to care for the sick from Mexico. Unfortunately, the four buildings used there were \"mere 124 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 shells, leaking in rainy weather,\" according to Porter, who was in charge of this facility. Proper food for the sick was hard to find, and the men were in very poor condition, suffering from diseases such as chronic dys\u00ad entery, diarrhea, and even scurvy. When the Greenwood hospital closed in Novem\u00ad ber 1848, Porter accompanied those still needing hospitali zation back to New Or\u00ad leans, despite the fact that the new hospital there was not actually completed until a month later. 33 For some troops, New Orleans was but a way station. Many eventually went on to other posts along the coast, and especially to Fort Monroe, or returned to their homes. Some arrived at the Virginia post in fine health, but of the 250 on one ship, 100 came down with yellow fever after leaving New Orleans. A company of artillerymen that had been at Vera Cruz also arrived at Fort Monroe with many still sick. The post surgeon reported that 25 of these men had fevers during the trip and that 9 died, \"one with black vomit\" (i.e., yellow fever). He hospitali zed 7 with diarrhea and placed 14 convalescing from fevers in hospital tents set up about a mile from the post at a healthy site. As he went home by steamer, one veteran wrote, \"my mou th is so sore that the least effort to masticate my food is very painful, and I cannot eat, ... and even if I could, it would be improper for me to do so, on account of a long continued diarrhea and pain in my breast and side.\"\" llQuote from Ltr, Porter to Bliss (1 entry 12; Porter, \"Notes\" 35:247-48; Ltrs, Law\u00ad son to Sec War (13 Mar 1848) and to Taylor (18 Aug 1848), both in RG 112, entry 2,18:485 and 19:172, respectively; Chase to Lawson (23 Jun 1848) and Por\u00ad ter to Lawson (20 Jul, 29 Nov, and 3 Dec 1848), all in RG 112, entry 12; McCormick to Lawson (10 Mar 1848), copy in RG 112, entry 12. j~First quote, Ltf, Thomas Henderson to Heiskell (13 Jul 1848), RG 112, entry 12; second quote, Rich\u00ad ardson, Journal, p. 86; see also Ltr, Henderson to Heis-Conclusio n Of the more than 100,000 soldiers who had left the United States to fight in Mex\u00ad ico, over 1,500 had been killed in action, but more than 10,000 had died of disease. The proportion of sick to killed was better than that of the Revolution; in the Civil War, however, only two would die of dis\u00ad ease for everyone killed in battle or dead from wounds. These figures include neither those who died at home as a result of dis\u00ad ease contracted in Mexico nor those family members of returned soldiers who con\u00ad tracted dysentery or typhoid from them. Many a man undoubtedly suffered from impaired health long after the end of the war, starting the campaign \"full of health,\" and returning home \"a sick soldier-a mere skeleton of a man, worn down by the prolonged fatigue of travelling, watching and toil.\"\" As it was in so many wars, disease was the great enemy in the Mexican War-the rate of death from disease among the U.S. soldiers in Mexico was ten times that of civilians at home. The surgeons of the Medical Department , too few to meet the demands made upon them, working with inexperienced volunteer and contract sur\u00ad geons and assisted by attendants who were, for the most part, the dregs of the Army, were helpless before the inroads of dysen\u00ad tery and other digestive ills. They were not as helpless as they had been, however. By means of vaccination they were able to stop outbreaks of smallpox before they became epidemic, and with large doses of quinine kell (24 July 1848), RG 112, Mexicall War (1849. Reprint.

THE WAR WITH MEXICO: SCOTT'S CAMPAIGN 125 they were able to cut short the paroxysms of malarial fevers. Unfortunately, for prac\u00ad tical reasons as well as because of prejudice and fear of the unfamiliar, they failed to use anesthesia on a large scale, and thus passed up their only real chance during the Mexican War to make a significant contri\u00ad bution to the progress of medical science.36 Although Army surgeons would continue to be helpless against many scourges until progress in the state of the art of medicine gave them better weapons against disease, the war with Mexico emphasized the need for many changes that were within the realm of possibility. As a result, although Lawson's suggestion about hospital ships 36Edward Jarvis, \"The the Army,\" Ailamic lvlollllt!y 10 (1862):472 -73. appears to have been dropped, efforts to develop an ambulance and to make the po\u00ad sition of hospital steward permanent con\u00ad tinued. The Mexican War did not, however, lead Lawson to conclude that the Medical Department should anticipate in peacetime the complex demands of war. As a result of his lack of insight, a lack many others shared, he failed to develop plans that might minimize the adverse effects of the necessary wartime influx of large num\u00ad bers of inexperienced surgeons, allow for the need to staff both general and regi\u00ad mental hospitals, and meet in other ways the requirements of an army at war. A stub\u00ad born and unimaginative surgeon general had overlooked the most important and perhaps even the most obvious lesson of the Mexican War. CHAPTER 7 Lawson's Last Years, 1846-1861 Settlers and prospectors began moving west in large numbers after the United States acquired the Oregon Territory in 1846 and the northern provinces of Mexico in 1848, a movement that grew still larger after the discovery of gold in California in January of that year. The federal govern\u00ad ment called upon the Army to explore boundaries and possible railroad routes in the new lands and to confront Indian and Mormon challenges to its authority. New posts also needed garrisons and the grow\u00ad ing numbers of travelers needed the Army's protection. The character of the new lands aroused great interest in the scientific com\u00ad munity. Surgeons assigned to Army units in the West were encouraged not to limit themselves to purely medical duties but to study the fauna, flora, and geology in their district and to record the customs of the inhabitants . During the period from 1846 to 1861, tensions were building over the question of the extension of slavery into newly ac\u00ad quired lands, and secession was an omi\u00ad nously frequent topic of discussion . But contingency planning was still a thing of the future and neither Surgeon General Lawson nor any of the Army's other leaders seriously considered how they might meet the demands of a large-scale conflict. Law\u00ad son's official letters betrayed no concern with the problems inherent in such a war. Medical Department efforts continued to be directed almost exclusively toward meeting the challenges of the peacetime Army, and in directions essentially no dif\u00ad ferent, except in magnitude , from those of earlier years. Administration Once the war with Mexico was won, the Army was again broken down into small, scattered units. That conflict had brought about few basic changes in the Medical De\u00ad partment. It was still not large enough to provide medical attendance for each gar\u00ad rison and detachment, despite Lawson's ef\u00ad fort to obtain an adequate staff. Although he himself was brevetted brigadier general in May 1848, the surgeon general's cam\u00ad paign for increased stature for his surgeons was also thwarted . Congress did, however, finally allow the retention in the position of hospital steward of any man qualified to handle that role. The law of 1847 that had allowed the addition of fourteen new surgeons ordered their dismissal at the end of hostilities. In July 1848, when the legislature repealed that requirement, it added a provision for\u00ad bidding the hiring of replacements for those who did leave. By then, some of the fourteen had already departed. Only in March 1848 did Congress make the four\u00ad teen slots permanent, thus officially per\u00ad mitting the signing on of ten doctors to replace those who had already resigned. Considering the need, this increase was in-128 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 significant. With ninety-four surgeons, some of whom would always be sick or in\u00ad capacitated by age, the department was ex\u00ad pected to care not only for men scattered among eighty-nine posts, some of which needed more than one surgeon, but also for soldiers involved in multitudin ous expe\u00ad ditions, both large and small, that took them from their regular assignments. The threat of Indian ambush isolated some posts, making it essentially impossible to send a surgeon in time of emergency to a post otherwise without medical attendance.' In 1851, Congress made the Army Med\u00ad ical Department indirectly responsible for the medical care of the residents of the new Army Asylum or, as it later became known, the Soldiers' Home. The surgeon general served as a member of the Board of Com\u00ad missioners. A department medical officer served as attending surgeon, his duties at the Soldiers' Home being above and be\u00ad yond those of his regular Army assignment and recompensed as the Board of Com\u00ad missioners might decide. For many years, Assistant Surgeon Benjamin King served as secretary-treasurer of the board as well as attending physician, and both Surgeon General Lawson and, after the Civil War, Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes were very much concerned about the operations of this institution.' Lawson's campaign for a larger Medical I Ltrs, Heiskell to William J.

Department was, therefore, a continuing one. In his report of November 1855 he emphasized to the secretary of war that the number of surgeons the Army needed did not \"depend upon the numerical force of the army, but upon the manner in which it is employed; that is upon the di visions and subdivisions it has to undergo, and the par\u00ad ticular service in which it is engaged.\" In 1856 Congress did vote the department 4 more surgeons and 8 more assistant sur\u00ad geons, but at least one general believed that no fewer than 12 more surgeons and 40 more assistants were required at this time. In the summer of 1860, with the nation at the brink of civil war, Congress granted the department slots for only 4 more surgeons and 4 more assistant surgeons. The Army was forced to face the oncoming holocaust with only 30 surgeons and 83 assistants, not all of whom would remain loyal to the Union] Because of the Medical Department's relatively small size, its expenses for con\u00ad tract surgeons remained high, averaging $24,000 a year in the mid-1850s. A civilian doctor hired to care for 100 or more men was paid $50 a month, for 50 to 100, $40, and for fewer than 50, $30, with an allow\u00ad ance added for any physician providing his own supplies and medicines. If he had to abandon his practice to accompany troops on the march, a civilian might receive as much as $100 a month. In some areas, how\u00ad ever, nonmilitary physicians were impos\u00ad sible to obtain, and many soldiers did not trust contract surgeons. Some of these doc\u00ad tors, however, were young men who had recently passed the department's still de\u00ad manding examinations and were awaiting JQuotc from Brown, Medical Departmen t, p.207; Ltrs, McCormick to Lawson (29 Nov 1857) and Twiggs to Lawson (27 Aug 1859), both in RG 112, entry 12. LAWSON'S LAST YEARS, 1846-1861 openings on the staff. The quality of their work, therefore, was generally good.' Because Lawson had few officers, he was unable to grant them leave except in in\u00ad stances of great need. This fact distressed him, all the more so when department fi\u00ad nances dictated that, except for the most deserving cases, surgeons who succeeded in obtaining leave must hire and pay for their own replacements. Since the increases al\u00ad lowed in the Department's size were always inadequat e, the problem was chronic, and some good men left the Army as a result' The officers of the Medical Department had official rank after February 1847, but the new law's significance for the surgeon's status within the Army was not clear. Al\u00ad though medical officers received housing and allowances on the same basis as line officers, those who assumed that they no longer had to obey commands from junior officers of the line or to take a back seat to them when serving on administrative boards were in for a rude awakening . Not long after the passage of the law, the ad\u00ad jutant general stated that since its impli\u00ad cations were confusing, the old laws would continue to apply. Some high-rankin g of\u00ad ficers who had bitterly opposed the law were urging its repeal.

The question of the role surgeons could play on Courts of Inquiry and similar bod\u00ad ies apparently also remained unresolved. The secretary of war ruled that a medical officer could preside over such a court if he was the senior officer, but this ruling was evidently not always applied to boards of inspection and survey. Congress had little to say on the matter, and medical officers unhappily concluded that, despite the 1847 law, their status in the Army was essentia lly unchanged.7 At the time of the Mexican War, the po\u00ad sition of hospital stewards within the Army also remained to be clarified. The level of aid that properly trained stewards rendered surgeons-so me could perform an apoth\u00ad ecary's duties and even conduct minor sur\u00ad gery-made it all the more important that such men be given permanent positions with the department. The demand for com\u00ad petent stewards was great.

Few civilians who were qual\u00ad ified to perform at the highest level would enlist, however, if they knew that they might be taken from Medical Department assignme nts and forced to serve as ordinary soldiers. Moreover , surgeons found it frus\u00ad trating to train a steward from the line only to see him march off with his unit. On the other hand, having a good man taken per\u00ad manently from his unit was frustrating to his commandin g officer.' Finally, in 1856 and only after much urg\u00ad ing by Lawson, Congress granted the sec\u00ad retary of war the authority both to appoint stewards from among men already in the Army and to hire competent men from the outside to be permanently attached to the Medical Department for a salary of $30 a month. This law also granted men who served as cooks and nurses extra duty pay in recognition of the hazardous and un\u00ad pleasant nature of much of their work, a move the department had been unsuccess\u00ad fully urging for years. After the passage of the 1856 law, the Medical Department moved cautiously to create what one of Lawson's assistants de\u00ad scribed as an \"efficient corps of stewards.\" Although there was no longer any need to keep a steward at one specific post or with a particular unit, the department still feared that moving these men about too much might cause Congress to have second thoughts. Whether the reason was caution or ineptness, by 1861 the department had not taken full advantage of the opportunity afforded by the law of 1856 to build 8Crimmins, \"Freeman's Report,\" Mower to Heiskell (16 Mar 1847), Randall to Lawson (6 Mar 1849), H.

The rapid changes that took place as the Army assumed expanding respon\u00ad sibilities made supply operations increas\u00ad ingly complex. Attempts to anticipate need were at times frustrated by the short life of some posts, the long distances involved, and the hazards that threatened shipments as they moved west. The surgeon general continued to believe that whenever possi\u00ad ble, purchasing should be handled in New York City, where prices were generally lower than elsewhere. However, a year might be required for goods to reach a west\u00ad ern fort from the East, and on the West Coast the telegraph was not available for placing supplemental orders. In conse\u00ad quence, the department was forced to permit some buying at New Orleans and to allow surgeons, when absolutely necessary , to meet specific needs on their own or through the Quartermaster's Department.

The need for a major depot there was tem\u00ad porary, and this facility was soon reduced in size and required to supply only units passing through. By 1855 there were also medical supply depots at Albuquerque and Santa Fe and at Benecia, in present-day California, but the surgeon general re\u00ad mained adamant in his determination to have permanent forts order on a yearly ba\u00ad sis from New York City, requisitioning from depots only in emergencies.\" The safety of goods shipped long dis\u00ad tances remained very uncertain; rough han\u00ad dling often damaged even carefully packed items, and shipwrecks were a fact of life. In 1856 the failure of his annual shipment to arrive actually forced the surgeon at Fort Chadbourne , Texas, \"to resort to the horse and mille medicine in the Quarter Master's Depot.\" Included in the supplies lost in wrecks were two consecutive shipments in 1860 to forts in the Arkansas-Oklahoma area. Judging from the size of the depart\u00ad ment's orders, the concept of anesthesia was being accepted , but ether continued to be difficult to ship. One order evaporated during the long trip from New York to Al\u00ad buquerque because of ill-fitting glass stop\u00ad pers.

One physician maintained that the items he needed could be bought locally for less than the total cost, including ship\u00ad ment, of the same items bought in New York. The department 's decision in Janu\u00ad ary 1861 to buy the tea for California posts in San Francisco was a gesture in this di\u00ad rection. In addition, theft or evaporation might cause bottles of wine to arrive in Cal\u00ad ifornia empty. The Surgeon General's Of\u00ad fice finally ordered the medical director in San Francisco to buy twenty-four dozen bottles of Los Angeles wine for the use of West Coast posts to supplement sixty dozen bottles to be sent from New York City. The New York purveyor initially con\u00ad cluded that Los Angeles wines were ac\u00ad ceptable \"for medicinal use,\" but by April 1861 it had become obvious that California wines did not please eastern palates; they were all, the San Francisco purveyor re\u00ad ported, either too sweet or too acid, and none were fit for the sick.\" Supply problems also resulted from the relative haste with which troops were moved about. In the spring of 1851, for example, companies of the 5th Infantry be\u00ad gan arriving at Fort Gibson from Fort Leavenworth on their way to Texas, but \"entirely destitute of medical Supplies.\" The Surgeon General's Office asked the Murray to Lawson (17 Feb 1854), Porter to Lawson (1 Sep 1858), Swirt to Lawson (30 May 1852), Satter\u00ad lee to Lawson (16 Apr and 14 Nov 1860), and Wells to Montgomery (2 Mar 1852), all in RG 112, entry 12.

The general command\u00ad ing the Military Department of the West had apparently not been consulted in this situation. When he heard of it, he an\u00ad nounced that the Medical Department' s handling of the matter was \"entirely irreg\u00ad ular,\" since only he could give such orders. He also questioned the authority of the sur\u00ad geon acting as medical director for his area to function as other than a post surgeon; apparentl y Lawson's custom of requiring the senior surgeon in a military department to serve as medical director was not always recognized. In any event, the general or\u00ad dered that all requests for medical supplies from other posts come from or through his headquarters. Amidst the furor, the Texas\u00ad bound troops were supplied from Forts Gibson, Towson, and Washita.\" Supply was but one of the difficulties faced by Medical Department surgeons in the West. The shortage of adequate hos\u00ad pital facilities at new posts also presented problems. In 1858 at Walla Walla, Wash\u00ad ington, for example, the hospital was \"a temporary thatched hovel, twelve by four\u00ad teen, with only four bunks (one above the other), less than three feet wide.\" Although the wounded resulting from individual skirmishes with the Indians in the West were usually few, expeditions against the Indians could on occasion result in more wounded than there were bunks.

The problems of the medical officer in San Francisco at this time were even greater. His hospital building was too small for the growing command and in poor condition, and the surgeon general made matters worse by re\u00ad fusing to grant an adequate fuel supply for the summer months. Summers in northern California were almost as cool as the win\u00ad ters, but Lawson insisted upon allowing only two cords of wood for the summer even though eight were needed for the winter.1.5 Surgeons also experienced problems get\u00ad ting their patients to whatever facilities they had succeeded in establishing. As late as 1859, the Medical Department had made little progress against the difficulties involved in moving the disabled. In the fall of that year, a board of five department surgeons met in Washington to examine models for ambulances. They recom\u00ad mended trials of two types, a two-wheeled version and a four-wheeled one that could carry ten men. The larger model was ap\u00ad parently in use at Fort Leavenwort h by 1861. An attempt to have a horse litter de\u00ad signed for use in areas inaccessib le to wheeled vehicles failed. Additional diffi\u00ad culties arose from the fact that Army of\u00ad ficers tended to use ambulances as if they were ordinary wagons. In 1860 the depart\u00ad ment was forced to emphasize that the ve\u00ad hicles distributed to the Army to serve as ambulances were not to be used for any other purpose.\" I~SGO.

Hammond to Law-LAWSON'S LAST YEARS, 1846-1861 The principal difficulties faced by the Medical Department as a whole in the fif\u00ad teen years before the Civil War resulted from the refusal of Congress to grant ad\u00ad equate increases for the medical staff and, above all, from the rapidity of the nation's expansion. In the Far West, where the greatest change was taking place, the tele\u00ad graph and the railroad were not available, and the problems faced by surgeons there were exaggerated by the resultant inability of the department to adjust the shipment of supplies quickly enough to meet the changing demand. The Work of the Army Surgeon as a Physician Ultimately the problems generated by slow communications and transportation, by an understaffed department, and by the shortage of trained and reliable stewards fell upon surgeons in the field, and partic\u00ad ularly upon those in the West. In the East the Army doctor's duties tended to be mun\u00ad dane and included such chores as admin\u00ad istering physical examinations to men wanting to join the Army. After the Mex\u00ad ican War, the department decided to look more closely at the health records it had been accumulating on would-be recruits. Published in the second volume of the department's Statistical Report, this study of men examined from 1849 through 1855 recorded that 3,516 of 5,000 consecutive applicants in 1850 and 1851 were foreign\u00ad born, and 2,113 were from Ireland alone. A total of 2,675 were \"from Great Britain and dependencies,\" while almost 700 came son (24 Feb 1855), Tripier to Wood (22 May 1860), and Wright to Lawson (8 Mar 1861), all in RG 112, entry 12; Otis, A Report to the Surgeon General, pp. 2n, 5,9. 133 from Germany . These figures no doubt re\u00ad flected the upheavals of 1848 in Europe and the Irish potato famine. The text noted, however, that in wartime, \"The rel\u00ad ative proportion of native and foreign re\u00ad cruits reversed.\"\" The department's study also revealed that at midcentury the average would-be soldier weighed just under 150 pounds and stood between 5 feet 6'/' inches and 5 feet 7'/' inches-regulations required a mini\u00ad mum height of 5 feet 5 inches. Among 1,800 native-born applicants examined for one part of the study, only 241 were at least 6 feet tall, and the tallest hailed from Geor\u00ad gia. A large proportion of rejected recruits suffered from \"varicose veins and varico\u00ad cele.\" Many native-born men were rejected as \"not robust, although phy\u00ad sicians concluded that the \"excess rejec\u00ad tions\" of these men resulted merely from their being \"young men who had not ar\u00ad rived at the full development of their phys\u00ad ical strength.\" The rejections of foreign recruits, on the other hand, often resulted from generally poor physical condition. A large number of \"Europeans\" (apparently an all-others type of category) was also re\u00ad jected because of \"Unsound and broken\u00ad down constitutions,\" while many English and Irish proved to be unacceptable be\u00ad cause of \"Intemperance and bad habits.\"\" The department also classified its re\u00ad jected recruits by occupation . Presumably most of the men who left their trades dur\u00ad ing peacetime to join the Army were not completely successful in civilian life. In some instances, poor health may have been to blame for their failures and therefore the Statistical Report figures may not be an ac- 11Quote from Statistical Report. /839-55, p.627.

The lowest proportion of rejections was found in the category \"Carpenters and workers in wood,\" the highest among laborers and farmers. Var\u00ad icose veins caused rejections in all groups, but these tables also suggested that laborers suffered more than others from \"lax ab\u00ad dominal rings,\" presumably a precursor of hernia, while farmers who had deserted their fields were often the victims of \"im\u00ad becility\" and venereal diseases, the latter acquired , perhaps, in the city where they signed up. The greatest incidence of intem\u00ad perance was found among those who pre\u00ad ferred the Army to tailoring, but \"clerks, students, and teachers\" were most often af\u00ad flicted with hemorrhoi ds.\" The fact that such detailed statistics were gathered about those rejected by Army physical examinations may give the mis\u00ad leading impression that by this period only the fit were accepted for military service. Since no \"exact, full, and uniform instruc\u00ad tions\" on how to conduct pre-induction physicals were distributed within the Army, overly eager recruiters had consid\u00ad erable leeway in filling their quotas. On at least one occasion, a line officer, angered by a rejection of a would-be recruit, tried but failed to have it reversed. Alcoholism , epilepsy, and psychological problems , fur\u00ad thermore, were undoubtedly difficult to spot, and accurate tests for such diseases as syphilis did not exist. Since physicians evidently believed that they could cure gon\u00ad orrhea, men with this disease might be ac\u00ad cepted if they had suffered no permanen t physical damage. In the belief that soldiers \"would not tolerate the mixed breed as comrades ,\" surgeons continued to reject I'Quotes from Statistical Repoft, /839-55, p. 630. those whose racial background was unclear.20 Regardless of their health when they signed up, recruits were exposed to many diseases by Army life. Furthermore, except for smallpox, the Medical Department could do little to keep the soldier from con\u00ad tracting diseases to which he was exposed. All recruits were eventually vaccinated, but cases of smallpox did occasionally occur. Some victims had not yet been immunized, or had not been properly immunized , while others may have lost their immunity over time. In 1849, when smallpox was partic\u00ad ularly prevalent , 66 soldiers fell ill with the disease. Of these, 23 had been vaccinated , but of the 8 who died, none had ever under\u00ad gone the procedure.\" Army surgeons had by this time appar\u00ad ently realized that although it was often dif\u00ad ficult to obtain a potent vaccine , revaccination was advisable whenever sol\u00ad diers were likely to be exposed to smallpox . The surgeon at Fort McKavett , Texas, for example, reimmunized most of the men at his post in 1857 after hearing ofa smallpox epidemic in San Antonio. Because of the difficulty of obtaining vaccine, he started by immunizing only infants and children who had never undergone the procedure . Using material taken from their lesions, he then vaccinated the 22-man post band. The 20Quotes from Richard H.

The de\u00ad partment encouraged other surgeons to propagate their vaccine similarly and also tried to develop an exchange system among its physicians. The New York purveyor ex\u00ad perimented at this time with shipping the inoculum in small sealed glass tubes, but since these containers were quite fragile, the departm ent generally continued to use vaccine crusts to ship the virus, although this method of shipment carried the risk that the material might be ineffective when it reached its destination .\" Although immunization was not possible for diseases other than smallpox, the use of quinine could reduce malaria to the level of a Hvexatious\" disease, even in those areas where mosquitoes thrived. In Flor\u00ad ida, for example, where fevers had caused such havoc during the Second Seminole War, a surgeon reported in 1856 that \"ague and fever seldom affords [sic] cause for alarm, or even seriously excites the anxi\u00ad eties of the patient.\"\" 2lSlalisticai Report. /855-60, pp. 189-90.

As late as 1859, physician s still listed such fac\u00ad tors as poor ventilation, lack of exercise, exposure , a hot, dry climate, and boredom as contributing factors. Having treated five cases in August and September 1857, dur\u00ad ing which time the men in his care had been offered dried vegetables as well as \"apples, peaches, rice, and molasses,\" a surgeon in the West concluded that this experience had demonstrated that \"abstinence from vegetable food is not, as some suppose the sole cause of scurvy.\" He maintained that a man's physical condition and habits, es\u00ad pecially \"evil habits\" involving the use of the \"filthy narcotic, tobacco,\" contributed to the appearance of the disease.\" When it was not deliberatel y supple\u00ad mented with antiscorbutics, the normal Army diet provided little that could have prevented or cured scurvy. A surgeon in Florida reported that men sent out on an exploratory expedition on 31 March 1857 were showing signs of scurvy before their return to base on 21 May-and that while in the field they had eaten only pork, hard bread, and coffee. In 1854 the standard menu at Fort Columbus in New York Har\u00ad bor was little better, except for the addi\u00ad tion, \"at rare intervals,\" of \"one or two boiled potatoes.\" A soldier serving in the West in 1856 recorded a diet of a pound of pork or a pound and a half of beef each Long, \"The Decline of Chronic Infectious Disease and Its Social Implication s,\" Bulletill oJlhe History (24 Mar 1852), RG 112, entry 2, 22:309; Wood to E.

By contrast, yellow fever and cholera were so erratic in their appearance and so dangerous as to be capable of inspiring actual panic. Yellow fever continued to appear sporadically and without warning at cities all along the coast, and more regularly in the Deep South. Fort Brown, Texas, where it at\u00ad tacked 74 of the 89-man garrison and 18 of the women and children, was but one of the posts where this mosquito-borne dis\u00ad ease spread terror. At that post fear caused even normally sober men to drink heavily, and the surgeon reported that the bodies of many of the forty-one who died showed \"well-marked symptoms of delirium tremens. \"27 Among the forts often visited by yellow fever was Fort Moultrie, in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. Diarrhea and dysentery were common there, as were var\u00ad ious kinds of fevers, including malaria and dengue. Diagnosis, therefore, could be dif\u00ad ficult. Although yellow fever appeared in Charleston in 1849 after an absence of sev\u00ad eral years, it did not reach Fort Moultrie until August 1850. Doctors disagreed about the nature of the disease at the fort, how\u00ad ever.

This time no questions arose as to the nature of the epidemic, but at least Porter's luck had in some respects turned-his new steward was \"always ... steady and temperate,\" and his hospital attendants were so con\u00ad scientious during that desperate time that he was moved to urge the surgeon general to continue his attempt to get extra pay for those performing this type of work.29 Yellow fever returned to Fort Moultrie in epidemic form once again in 1858, but by that time Bernard M. Byrne had re\u00ad placed Porter as post surgeon. Byrne may have been made of less stern stuff than Por\u00ad ter. The epidemic apparently unnerved him, although accusations against him were never proved. Less than a month after he diagnosed the first case of yellow fever, and after three of the sick had died, Byrne reported himself ill. He remained on sick 28Llrs, Porter to Lawson (11 and 26 Aug 1849, 16 Oct 1849,2 Oct 1850, and 9 Feb 1852), all in RG 112, entry 12; Surgeon's Quarterly Rpl, Ft.

In the nine days after Byrne first became ill, eighteen more cases appeared and ten more victims died. A civilian physician from Charleston was asked to care for these men. Rumors began circulating that Byrne was not really ill, that he was avoiding pa\u00ad tients for fear of contracting yellow fever himself. Even after the arrival of William J. L'Engle, a Regular Army surgeon, Byrne's services were still needed-the ep\u00ad idemic ended only after striking forty-nine men and killing twenty-eight.'\u00b7 Although at the u rgi ng of one of the other officers at Fort Moultrie , Bvt. Col. J. L. Gardner, the post commander, took action against Byrne, Gardner apparently never doubted that Byrne was genuinely sick and unable to perform his duties. The Charles\u00ad ton physician said that, in Byrne's place, he too, would have treated himself, but that he could not substantiate Byrne's claim of ill health without having examined him. The ailing surgeon's steward praised his su\u00ad perior's devotion to duty and testified that Byrne looked ill during the time he was on sick report. A private reported that when the surgeon returned to duty, \"He seemed ... to be a very delicate man, and very much reduced.\" L'Engle maintained that Byrne was obviously well enough to have cared for the sick since he had been caring for Mrs. Byrne, and an officer who had visited Byrne during his illness main\u00ad tained that the surgeon showed no sign of JOUnlcss otherwise indicated, all information on Byrne's experiences al Ft.

The secretary of war approved the court's verdict of not guilty, but pointed out that the acquittal came on the ground of rea\u00ad sonable doubt and that the illness of Byrne's wife had not absolved him of his responsibilitie s to the command. Yellow fever was, despite the erratic tim\u00ad ing of its appearance, more familiar to many men in the Army than cholera, which had disappeared from the United States after the epidemic of 1832 had run its course. In 1848, however, cholera reap\u00ad peared on the North American continent, striking some posts repeatedly while spar\u00ad ing others. New York Harbor was among areas where this fearful disease spread ter\u00ad ror, and 29 of the 79 who contracted it there died. At Kentucky 's Newport Bar\u00ad racks, 16 of231 perished, and at Missouri's Jefferson Barracks and the nearby Sl. Louis Arsenal, 130 of 368 victims did not sur\u00ad vive. Texas was also hard hit during this time, but Florida, New Mexico, and posts in southern California were spared.\" Cholera was soon a seasoned traveler in the United States. It accompa nied troops on their way to Texas from New Orleans in 1848, when that city was in turmoil as the result of simultaneous epidemics ofyel\u00ad low fever and cholera. When two steam\u00ad ships carrying 450 soldiers set out for Port Lavacca, Texas, from a barracks four miles from the \"doomed city\" of New Orleans l'Quote from Byrne, COlirl IHarlial, 87. l2Ltr.

Several days later, the men, still in \"perfect health,\" debarked , with cholera still in hid\u00ad ing. The vibrio accompan ied both those who remained in the town and those who went out to Placido Creek to camp. On 21 December, the disease came out into the open at last, striking the men at both sites, appearing at Placido Creek after a severe storm had soaked the ground on which the men had to lie. By dawn of the 22d, 8 or 9 men at Placido Creek and 40 at Port La\u00ad vacca were dead. By the time the epidemic had run its course a week later, 350 men and camp followers had felt its effects and 150 lay dead.\" In February cholera appeared at Browns\u00ad ville, Texas. In March it struck at Brazos Santiago and Matamoros. At Camargo and nearby Camp Ringgold , the dread disease appeared ea rly in March. Dragoons leaving the camp for San Antonio by way of Laredo on II March took the vibrio with them. The appearance of cholera at San Antonio puzzled Nathan Jarvis, for the disease struck the town harder than it did other communities even though the always\u00ad present breeze prevented miasmas and the town was considered one of the healthiest in Texas. Estimates of the number of deaths in San Antonio from mid-April to the first week in June varied from 400 to 700; among them was that of a major general, William Worth. All told, 44 soldiers died of cholera in southern Texas and 173 in the western part of that state during the period of 1848 to 1854, after which the disease disappeared from the area.\" HFirst quote, Ltr, Jarvis to Benjamin Jarvis (23 Dec 1848), in Jarvis Papers; Jarvis, \"Notes,\" pp. 438, 440-41, second E.

In the summer of 1855, more than six years after cholera reappeared in the New World, the panic it inspired precipitated what was apparently a mental breakdown for the surgeon at Fort Riley, Kansas. Hysterical with fear for him\u00ad self and his family, he deserted his post at the height of the epidemic, leaving sick and dying men, women, and children without medical attendance. Although he was con\u00ad victed by court-martial and dismissed from the Army in January 1856, he was rein\u00ad stated less than a year later and served creditably in the Union Army during the Civil War, eventua lly becoming Grant's medical director in the West. 35 Cholera paid repeated visits to posts like Fort Leavenworth , through which soldiers and civilians, explorers and prospectors passed on their way along the Santa Fe and Oregon Trails to or from the newly ac\u00ad quired territories in the West.

Medical attendance remained inadequate for the need and the hospital was crowded. A larger barracks was taken over to supplement facilities for the sick, but some of the 115 who fell ill during the course of the epidemic ended up on the noor of an old stable that was \"so infested with rats that they ran over the helpless sick in the day time.\" It was very hot, but the only drinking water available had to be brought in barrels from the Missouri River. Each man who wanted a drink dipped his cup into the common container. Some of the patients were soon \"unconscious of their surroundin gs; their features had turned to a bluish black color. Flies in great numbers swarmed around them, and set\u00ad tled on their open lips and staring eyes .... The doors and windows were all open, but the heat and stench were terrible.\" Some of the coffins of the twenty-four who died were loaded with bodies in plain view of the sufferers. One corpse was too large for its container; \"when his head and feet were in, his chest bulged up, which made it nec\u00ad essary for one of the attendants to sit on the cover while it was being nailed down.\"\" Sanitation at Fort Leavenwor th was de\u00ad scribed as good, and the post surgeon in 1857 reported only two problems: the dif\u00ad ficulty of finding sufficient water for ba\u00ad thing in the winter, when streams were frozen, and the need to find a way to drain laundry water away from living quarters.

In 1855, for example, a ci\u00ad vilian working at the post, perhaps h elping to construct the new barracks, discovered something odd on his dinner plate. A wit\u00ad ness reported that \"a closer examination disclosed a full grown rodent, minus its hair.\" Whether the rodent was bald because of advanced age, disease, an abnorma l sup\u00ad ply of hormones, or long boiling was not disclosed, but the quartermaste r reacted by hiring a new set of cooks.\" Among the expeditions leaving Fort Leavenworth for other parts of the West were those sent to deal with recently settled Mormons in Utah, who were resisting the authority of the U.S. government. Planning for a 2,500-man expedition into Utah be\u00ad gan in the spring of 1857. The recruits who joined this force just outside Fort Leav\u00ad enworth were in poor condition, some were either too young or too old. \"Many were broken down by habits of dissipation -by intemperan ce, by syphilis, by the practice of masturbation, & c.\" Health problems ap\u00ad parently multiplied as they waited. Diar\u00ad rhea was soon a common amiction and was blamed on diet and the climate. One sur\u00ad geon specifically mentioned \"a dietetic cause more potent\" than any other, \"that ancient military institution, bean soup. A vile concoction, prepared under this name,\" was served at Fort Leavenworth. Poison oak, \"a plant which nourished in great luxuriance\" in that area, also led to misery for some soldiers. \"The local pain, heat, redness, and swelling,\" stated a phy\u00ad sician, \"were often considerable, from Carr, \"Reminis\u00b7 1846-1861 especia lly when the scrotum was involved.\"40 The start of the march was not initially accompanied by any improvement in the health of the men bound for Mormon ter\u00ad ritory. In the first three days, problems caused by drunkenness, heat, and the gen\u00ad eral unfitness of the men limited progress to sixteen miles. When their water con\u00ad tainers were empty, soldiers drank from pools of \"water exceedingly filthy and nau\u00ad seous from animal and vegetable decom\u00ad position\" and were paid for their trouble with vomiting and more diarrhea. Some were overcome by heat and exhaustion, but the wagons in which they were placed were too high for easy loading and offered a jolt\u00ad ing ride.4L In the course of their march the men en\u00ad countered Pawnee Indians, among whom smallpox was raging, and efforts to avoid contact with them proved vain. Some of the quartermaster 's men could not resist \"the charms of filthy squaws,\" but their weakness was repaid with syphilis rather than smallpox. As the expedition neared the Platte River, problems caused by diar\u00ad rhea diminished, but the incidence of ma\u00ad laria increased, and in August the first case of scurvy appeared. By the end of the month, the men had marched 419 miles, during the course of which one of the sur\u00ad geons had, in addition to his other chores, delivered two babies, both to wives of soldiers.42 The weather was growing colder as the men approached the end of their 1,100- mile march from Fort Leavenworth-on 8 November the mercury reported ly fell to _440 F. and a strong northwest wind chilled 40Quotes from Statistical Report, 1855-60 , pp. 281-83; Jun 12. 4!Quole from Statistical Report, 1855-60, p. 283. 41Quote from ibid., p. 285. 141 the marrow of their bones. By December they had set up camp for the winter at Fort Bridger, in today's state of Wyoming, near the Utah border. While awaiting the out\u00ad come of negotiations with Brigham Young, surgeons established hospitals for their units in tents floored with hides, a design that proved quite comfortabl e. Scurvy was apparently no longer a problem, possibly because dried vegetables had been added to the diet, although the drying process probably destroyed much of the vitamin C. Many suffered from frostbite, however, and one man lost the last joints of four toes to the cold.\" The knowledge that reinforcement s for the Utah Expedition would soon be arriv\u00ad ing from Fort Leavenworth determined the Mormons to seek peace in the spring of 1858, and the men assembled to subdue them were, therefore, gradually dispersed. Before this could happen, however, a sur\u00ad geon at Fort Bridger encountered a new and mysterious form of fever that first struck men who had been camped in a grassy valley. Within four days fifty-five of them were sick. Within three weeks 110 of\u00ad ficers and men as well as a large number of teamster s and herders had fallen ill. The initial symptoms included an hour or two of chills followed by a high fever, flushing of the skin, severe pain in the lower back, pain and cramps in the legs, a quickened pulse, nausea, and constipation. The eyes were bloodshot , and a \"white, cheesy fur\" covered the tongue, whose papillae were red and prominent. All symptoms disap- 4l1csse A.

Only one death occurred at this time; the victim was a man who had been sick a week and paralyzed for two days. Mormons called the disease mountain fever, but it may have been what is today known as Colorado tick fever. 44 Although mountain fever was apparentl y a disease Army surgeons had not encoun\u00ad tered before, the old familiar ones like scurvy, alcoholism, and typhoid fever were also present in the area where the Mormons lived. In the period from 1857 to 1859, only 4 men died from wounds and injuries in the Utah and Wyoming territories, but 34 died of disease, 8 of these from typhoid. 44Quote from Statistical Report, 1855-60, p. 305. Of eleven cases of scurvy, however, only one man died. The liquor sold by traders despite regulations to the contrary occa\u00ad sionally had particularly unfortunate ef\u00ad fects. In at least one instance this beverage was compounded of alcohol, tobacco, \"and various narcotics,\" and packed a kick that killed one man in short order and made many more ill.\" The Mormons as a people apparently fascinated non-Mormons who came to know them, including an Army surgeon, Roberts Bartholow , who stated in the third volume of the Statistical Report that \"The Mormon , of all the human animals now walking this globe, is the most curious in every relation.\" It was, he said, a curious fact, that Mormonism makes its impress upon the countenance ... an expression compounded of sensuality, cunning, suspicion , and a smirking self\u00ad conceit. The yellow, yellowish hair; the angular per\u00ad son, constitute an appearance so charac\u00ad teristic of the new race, the production of polygamy , as to distinguish them a glance. He added that, even among the wealthiest Mormons , the infant death rate was high-these people believed in curing dis\u00ad ease by \"miraculous interposition\" rather than by physicians. \" Examples of the failure of physicians to cure were not unusual in the middle of the nineteenth century, but the death of the Medical Department's most illustrious pa\u00ad tient emphasized the helplessness of doc\u00ad tors when confronted with many of the diseases of that period.

Taylor became ill after spending hours in the sun on 4 July and then returning to the White House to drink quantities of cold beverages and eat raw fruits and vegetables. His doctors, summoned only after many hours had passed, diagnosed cholera mor\u00ad bus (acute gastroenteritis, not the dreaded Asiatic cholera), complicated in its later stages by remittent fever. They dosed him with calomel, opium, and quinine. The up\u00ad and-down path of the disease led them at times to believe that their treatment was successful, but after five days of intermit\u00ad tent nausea, cramps, and diarrhea, and eventually fever as well, on the evening of 9 July, Taylor died.\" Taylor's death may well have resulted from some form of food poisoning, a com\u00ad mon enough affiiction at the time, though not one that ordinarily led to death. A fever had kept Taylor in bed for almost two weeks during the Second Seminole War, at\u00ad tacking him again during the war with Mexico. He may have been susceptible to flare-ups of malaria, especially when some other problem sapped his strength. Taylor's history of gastrointestinal problems, how\u00ad ever, also suggests that a recurrence of ame\u00ad bic dysentery may have contributed to his demise. Like many another old soldier, he may have harbored not one but two para\u00ad sites capable of killing him when the resil\u00ad ience of youth had deserted him and stress had rendered him especially vulnerable.\" 47Holman Hamilton , Zachary Tay/or: Soldier New 143 BERNARD J.

In Irwin's account of the events of the winter of 1860 to 1861, he noted that under the leadership of Cochise, Chiricahuas often ambushed small groups on their way to Mexico or California, killing the men and enslaving the women and children, with \"ill treatment much worse than the most cruel death.\" He pointed out that \"the highway leading to and from Apache Pass was dot\u00ad ted with the graves or stone tumuli that cover the remains of the victims of [cochise's] Apaches, Irwin and cowardly.\"'\u00b7 The events that brought Irwin the Medal of Honor began with the departure of Lt.

After having been persuaded by a ci vilian he knew to come to camp to discuss these mat\u00ad ters, the Indian leader managed to escape an attempt to detain him there by force. Others of his party were kept as hostages, but the chief, undeterred, attacked the Overland Mail the night after his escape. Having sent a request for help through to Fort Buchanan, Bascom arranged a second parley, one that barely missed being a com\u00ad plete disaster. Three civilians with Bascom mingled with the Indians attending the gathering and were never seen alive again, but an attempt to ambush this parley failed. The Indians then surrounded the camp.SI After Bascom's messenger arrived at Fort Buchanan, a message was sent to the cavalry units at Fort Breckinridge, 100 miles away, requesting their support in helping Bascom. Desirous of bringing at least some aid to the lieutenant as quickly as possible, Irwin obtained permission, de\u00ad spite his supposed noncombatant status, to lead a small detachment directly from Fort Buchanan, where there were no cavalry units, to Bascom's camp. In spite of the severe blizzard that was raging, Irwin and fourteen infantrymen set out on muleback toward Apache Pass. When they entered the pass, they encountered five wagons, all \"plundered and burned,\" with eight naked bodies fastened to the wagon wheels. The victims had slowly burned to death as the flames consumed their vehicles. Shortly thereafter, Irwin and his men took prisoner three Indians found herding stolen cattle. Intending to use the cattle to distract the besiegers as well as to supply Bascom and his men with beef, Irwin had the beasts driven ahead of him. With the three In- )IStarr, \"'rwin,\" p. 81.

As in so many en\u00ad gagements with the western Indians, few men had been wounded. Although only two of Bascom's command had been hurt, sol\u00ad diers who located Cochise's camp found that others had not been so fortunate\u00ad vultures were tearing the flesh from the bodies of six white men, among them those of the civilians taken by the Chiricahuas at the time of the second meeting with Bas\u00ad com. With the eight tormented bodies from the plundered wagon train a vivid memory, Irwin urged Bascom to execute six Indian hostages in retaliation . \"The punishment ,\" he admitted, \"was an extreme mode of re\u00ad prisal but was demanded and justified by the persistent acts of treachery and the atrocious cruelties perpetrat ed by the most cowardly and intractable tribes of savages infesting the territory.\" Irwin's insistence finally overcame Bascom's initial reluc\u00ad tance to resort to such measures, and, ten days later, the six Indians were hung \"to the boughs of two stately oaks\" that stood over the graves of their white victims. Be\u00ad cause Irwin and Bascom \"were desirous of making a lasting example to our treacher\u00ad ous foes, the bodies were allowed to remain suspended permanently.\"\" S2Quotes from Irwin, \"Apache Pass,\" p. 202; Starr, \"Irwin,\" p.84.

Most engagements with the Indians in the West in the decades before the Civil War were like this one-sma ll, involving rew men, and resulting in 145 Irwin's courage in action won him ac\u00ad claim, and his medical duties must have occupied much of his time, since malaria posed a severe problem at Fort Buchanan because the post was small. But he also had time to pursue his interest in natural his\u00ad tory and to keep the detailed meteorolog\u00ad ical records that the department required of all surgeons. Little hope may have re\u00ad mained that the data about climate and weather that he dutifully recorded and sent back to the surgeon general would be of great significance to the medical world, but there were valuable nonmedical uses for this kind of material, of which the Medical Department had accumulated sixty-four volumes by 1860. A researcher at the Navy Departm ent used data from the Medical Department in preparing a study of storms, for example, and his work would serve as an aid to navigation. The topographical en\u00ad gineers responsible for assessing routes for the construction of railroads to the Pacific were also among those who made use of Medical Department data.

Hammond. By the time the Civil War was over, some of these surgeons were on their way to achieving enviable reputations as naturalists. With their aid, even before 1861, the surgeon general was able to cooperate with scien\u00ad tists and institutions interested in obtain\u00ad ing specimens of animals, plants, and minerals. When Army physicians could not be spared to accompany exploring expe\u00ad ditions, the department hired contract sur\u00ad geons, making skill as a naturalist one of the important qualifications for this posi\u00ad tion. Through the efforts of Assistant Sec\u00ad retary Spencer F. Baird, the Smithsonian Institution worked closely with the Army. It supplied surgeons with containers for their specimens , materials and instructions for preserving them, books relating to nat\u00ad ural history, and in at least one instance, actually trained the naturalist-physician for his work\" One of the Army's young 011 the Several Pacific raliolls(Washington: A.

George Suckley cared for the sick and injured among the men and also served as a naturalist , under Baird's guid\u00ad ance. The Smithsonian provided the nec\u00ad essary supplies and required that Suck ley collect and study zoological and botanical specimens , familiarize himself with the In\u00ad dians and their history, and make notes on rivers and their currents and falls. He ini\u00ad tially had much time for this work because the men in the party were generally quite healthy, but his efforts to send his speci\u00ad mens safely back to Washington did not always meet with success. On at least one occasion, Baird was confronted by a con\u00ad tainer in which \"unfortunat ely nearly all the fish were spoiled.\"\" When an opening became available in December 1853, while Suckley was with the exploring expedition in the West, he joined the Medical Department and was sent to Fort Steilacoom in the Washington territory. Here he established a \"good pri\u00ad vate practice\" and began to invest in real estate. The opportunities for a naturalist were rich in the area and Suckley was con\u00ad tent, but in the summer of 1854, to his dis\u00ad may, the Army ordered him to Fort Dalles in the Oregon Territory, \"a most barren spot.\" He had little time for natural history, for he was soon ordered to accompa ny a detachment sent \"to chastise some Indians about 400 miles\" from the fort.

His first love was natural his\u00ad tory, and his duties as a military surgeon made it impossible for him to work and move about with the freedom he desired. His assignment in the West was delaying his work on the final version of the Pacific Railroad survey report. Baird used his in\u00ad fluence in Washington to obtain leave for Suckley to travel east for a few months, but the surgeon was soon ordered west again. Suck ley spent Christmas of 1855 in Pan\u00ad ama with troops being sent to the West Coast and by the end of January was at Fort Steilacoom accompanying expeditions against the Indians in which he faced con\u00ad siderable personal danger as he cared for the sick and wounded. By the summer of that year Suckley was determined to leave the Army. He wished, however, to avoid having to pay his own expenses to return, and hoped to obtain leave to travel east and to resign shortly after his arrival. Again Baird did his best in Suckley's behalf through his acquaintances in the govern\u00ad ment, but to no avail.

He then scarified the area around the wound and, as soon as he could obtain ammonia water, applied it to the bite. Following the rec\u00ad ommendat ion of a civilian he encountered on his way back to camp, he also began drinking whiskey in large Quantities. De\u00ad spite his precaution s by evening the glands in his armpits were sore. He then dosed himself with an opiate and, substituting 148 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTM ENT, 1818-1865 SAMUEL WOODHOUSE. (Courtesy of Na\u00ad lional Library of Medicine.) brandy for the whiskey, managed to remain drunk for four or five hours. Throughout the night he continued dosing himself with various remedies, including a cathartic. After sobering up, he removed the tour\u00ad niquet from his finger and app lied a flaxseed meal poultice. Even with all this care, it was months before he regained the use of his hand. Whether because of the bite itself or because of the length of time he left the tourniqu et in place, he eventu\u00ad ally lost the nail and part of the finger. Although many surgeons worked as nat\u00ad uralists when not occupied with their pa\u00ad tients, one young physician retained his unusual youthful interest in communica\u00ad tions and worked while he was an Army surgeon to perfect a system of signaling with flags during daylight and torches at night. Assistant Surgeon Albert J. Myer first brought his ideas to the attention of military authorities late in 1856, when he expounded the virtues of his system in a letter to Secretary of War Jefferson Davis. In 1859 the approval of an Army board led to field tests, and in 1860 Myer was ap\u00ad pointed signal officer, at which time he for\u00ad mally resigned from the Medical Departm ent. In 1863 Myer became the first head of the new Signal Corps.\" Conclusion Some of the younger members of the Medical Department showed varied talents as naturalists and inventors, as surgeons, and as brave and sometimes harsh soldiers. The department itself, however, was typical of Army bureaus of the time, its leaders aging and set in their ways. During peace\u00ad time, the experience of the older men was a valuable asset, since the problems chal\u00ad lenging the Medical Department in the years immediately preceding the Civil War were those it had always faced. Distances were greater and posts more numerous, but neither the diseases nor the needs of the individual post or detachment had signif\u00ad icantly changed. Furthermore, the art of medicine had yet to become a science, and experience was no worse a guide than any other in the treatment of the familiar dis\u00ad eases. But the Medical Department had no plans for meeting the supply and evacu\u00ad ation problems of a major conflict, or for systematically providing the physicians and hospitals needed to care for masses of casualties. And even if contingency plan- SqEdgar Erskine Humc. \"The Foundation of States Army Medical Department,\" oj the Hisrory J.

Unprepared even for a minor war, 149 the Army Medical Department would inev\u00ad itably be overwhelmed in the earliest months of the Civil War. CHAPTER 8 The Civil War, 1861: Many Problems, Few Solutions When Confederate guns began pounding Fort Sumter, South Carolina, on 12 April 1861, undoubtedly one of the least appre\u00ad hensive men behind its walls was Assistant Surgeon Samuel W. Crawford. Taken from the same mold that produced Surgeon Gen\u00ad eral Thomas Lawson, Crawford was more soldier than physician and eager for com\u00ad bat in which he could take an active part. He had led the rear guard of the unit aban\u00ad doning Charleston's Fort Moultrie in De\u00ad cember 1860. Upon Fort Sumter, across the harbor from Fort Moul\u00ad trie, he had volunteered to take his turn as officer of the day. Quickly familiarizing himself with the problems involved in de\u00ad fending Fort Sumter, he undertook the command of a battery during the bom\u00ad bardment. (Map 5) In spite of the fact that he was by then responsible for the care of the first four Union soldiers to be wounded by Confederate guns, Crawford also met Confederate representatives arriving at the fort on 14 April to discuss its surrender and conducted them to the fort's commanding officer.' 'Primary sources, including Crawford's own report and documents in the War Department's War of Re\u00ad bellion volumes, indicate that, contrary to statements in many secondary volumes, the Confederate bom\u00ad bardment of Fl. Sumter did produce Union casualties. Rpt, Crawford (12-14 Apr 1861), RG 94, entry 634, hereafter cited as Crawford Report; War Department, The time was approaching when the professional demands on medical officers in wartime would be too great to permit them to play part-time active military roles as well. The care of thousands of patients, both sick and wounded, and the manage\u00ad ment of the various stages of their evacu\u00ad ation from battlefield to the hospital that completed their care would soon no longer allow a surgeon general to ride at his gen\u00ad eral's side, as Lawson had done in the war with Mexico, or permit a medical officer the challenge of commanding a unit in bat\u00ad tle. At Fort Sumter, however, where the casualties from the bombardment were few and their wounds slight, Crawford was still able to function successfully as both med\u00ad ical and line officer.

These men were quickly evacuated, one to a Charleston hos\u00ad pital and the others to the North with the rest of the garrison. The summer after the surrender, Crawford announced his inten\u00ad tion to resign from the Medical Depart\u00ad ment to become an infantry officer. In this capacity he rose to the rank of brigadier general during the war. Even after hostili\u00ad ties ended, he never returned to the prac\u00ad tice of medicine.' Administrative Problems of the Medical Department Crawford was but one of many physi\u00ad cians to leave the Medical Department in the early months of 1861. Of 114 doctors serving at the time Fort Moultrie was aban\u00ad doned, 24 resigned to join Confederate forces and 3 more were dismissed for dis\u00ad loyalty. Their departure left the Medical Department with a relatively small nucleus of experienced military surgeons around which it had to build a huge wartime organization. Even veterans of the Mexican War, how\u00ad ever, had no concept of the difficulties that would be involved in dealing with casual\u00ad ties on the scale of those of the Civil War. Accustomed to handling the health prob\u00ad lems of small and relati vely isolated posts, old-time Army surgeons had never been called upon to develop plans for evacuat\u00ad ing, hospitalizing, and caring for vast num\u00ad bers of wounded and sick or for preventing disease in camps with populations of thou\u00ad sands.

Unfortunatel y his aging successor, Clement A. Finley, was, as a con\u00ad temporary put it, \"utterly ossified and use\u00ad less.\" Already in his sixties, Finley apparently had little to recommend him for so high a post except his forty years in the Army.' In the spring and early summer of 1861, a large group of younger surgeons with no military experience was rapidly gathering to join veteran Regular Army surgeons. 4Quote from Strong, Diary. p. \\81; Ltrs, Edward to w.

Although Congress doubled the num\u00ad ber of medical officers assigned to each of the forty volunteer regiments called up by President Lincoln in May, Surgeon General Finley considered one surgeon and one as\u00ad sistant surgeon per regiment still to be in\u00ad adequate. Since state authorities often ignored the examination required for ac\u00ad ceptance into the new volunteer force and a medical degree was not a prerequisite to service, the quality of the new physicians was as open to question as the quantity, and even homeopath s might be considered for positions as regimental surgeons .' In July, in the process of approving the President's call for troops, Congress added a requirement that brigades of three or four regiments each be organized and that the secretary of war assign each brigade a sur\u00ad geon, who must have passed an exam \"of practical character\" administered by the Medical Department. The specific respon\u00ad sibilities of the brigade surgeon were not outlined at this time, leaving the medical director of each army or area to use his brigade surgeons as he wished. In practice the duties assigned these individuals were considerable , especially in view of the fact that many were young volunteers and at best familiar with Army routine only to the extent made possible by a few months of service as regimenta l surgeons.

Whenever possible the positions of medical director and medical purveyor were assigned to them. Regulars with years of experience who were serving in the West were called east in the summer of 1861, their places to be taken by civilians. New regulars, both those replacing resigning physicians and the additional thirty for whom Congress called in August, were, however, as inexperienced as their volun\u00ad teer counterparts, although their profes\u00ad sional skills continued to be guaranteed by the examinations the department invari\u00ad ably administered to regulars.7 Contract surgeons, or acting assistant surgeons, and medical cadets were, for the most part, as lacking in military experience as volunteer and new regular surgeons. Contract physicians might have neither skill nor military background and were in some instances considered to be \"charla\u00ad tans and imposters\" by their contempo\u00ad raries. The creation of the position of medical cadet in the summer of 1861 rep\u00ad resented a major innovation, since it made it possible for medical students eighteen to twenty-three years old to serve as dressers or ambulance attendants.

Like the Departm ent's new physicians , many at\u00ad tendants were unfamiliar with the routine of military hospitals. Those detailed from the ranks might also be among the least fit of their units. Convalescents, who were fa\u00ad miliar to some degree with hospitals, were sometimes found to be both physically weak and \"inhuman in their treatment of patients. \"9 Many women were eager to serve as nurses, but it was an unusual candidate who had been given even the briefest of training, since nursing schools were few. Surgeon General Finley reportedl y op\u00ad posed the use of civilians and particularly the use of women. To bring order out of potential chaos as far as female nurses were concerned , the Army asked the formidable Dorothea Dix, already well-known for her work with institutions for the insane, to serve as superintendent of female nurses for the Army and to screen applicants for nursing positions. In August, however, Congress effectively undermined her po\u00ad sition by ruling that surgeons in charge of hospitals could hire nurses without going through Superintendent Dix. Those women whom Dix found acceptable were plain of face and dress and over thirty years 'Quote from Brinton, lv/emoirs, pp. 65-66; Ltrs, Wood to Finley (27 Apr 1861) and to McCormick (6 May 1861), both in RG 112, entry 2, 28:14 and 38, respectively; William Quentin Maxwell, UIU.:o/u's Fifth Wheel: (New Longmans , Green, & Co., 1956), p. 62. 9Quote from Mary Ashton Rice Livermore, My Story o/the Wor\u00ad thington & Co., 1889), p. 127. 156 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 of age.

A medical journal of the day stated that female nurses were often \"a useless annoyance,\" lacking the physical strength needed to help wounded men. The article also suggested that its readers try to \"imagine a delicate refined woman assisting a rough soldier to the close-stool , or supplying him with a bedpan ... \" Some admitted, however, that when aided by orderlies or convalescents, female nurses could serve a useful purpose, since they were more attuned to the emo\u00ad tional needs of the sick and more skilled at Hsanitary domestic economy.\" I I In the Regular Army, the hospital stew\u00ad ard, who before the war often added the role of nurse to his other duties, had by 1861 gained a position commanding con\u00ad siderable respect. Only men who could es\u00ad tablish their competency as apothecaries were accepted for the required five-year en\u00ad listment. These men also served as wound dressers and were paid almost twice as much as female nurses, whose role, like that of all nurses, was seen as menial.

In volunteer units, regimental surgeons followed the old cus\u00ad tom of choosing their stewards from their own units, one being allowed for each battalion. \" Expansion and organizational changes affected the Department's facilities as well as its personnel. The widespread network of post and regimental hospitals that sup\u00ad ported the peacetime Army could never have been adequate to handle the vast numbers of sick and wounded that would result from the Civil War. To handle the overflow of patients from regimenta l hos\u00ad pitals, the Medical Department reinsti\u00ad tuted the general hospital on a much larger scale than ever before. The first need for this institution developed in Washington , D.C., when more than 600 artillerymen and engineers were ordered to that city in January and early February 1861. By the end of January, Lawson had ordered the establishment of the first general hospital to care for the sick of units then in the capital and for any that might be sent through in the following weeks. With the advent of hostilities, the Medical Depart\u00ad ment started setting up more such facilities in Washington. Medical directors in other areas also began to establish general hos\u00ad pitals to shelter those who had to be left behind when their units were on the move. Realizing that they should act ahead of ac\u00ad tual need, directors attempted to prepare these facilities before patients were actually waiting to enter them.\" 12Ltrs, W. I. H. White to E.

Having sent back to a general hospital men unable to march at the time the unit broke camp, the regimental sur\u00ad geon cared for the wounded during and after battle wherever he could, sometimes in a ravine or under a tree. He often es\u00ad tablished his hospital in a house near the battlefield and pitched his tents nearby to take in those the building could not accom\u00ad modate. During a battIe that produced more casualties than regimental facilities could handle functioning as isolated units, the medical director might call for the cre\u00ad ation of a temporary field hospital, manned by regimental surgeons. In certain instances this officer also permitted the creation of a brigade hospital, operated un\u00ad der the immediate supervision of the bri\u00ad gade surgeon. Regarded as a consolidation of regimental hospitals, they were in ac\u00ad tuality something of a hybrid between the regiment al and general hospital, more per\u00ad manent than the former but less so than the latter. Men assigned to hospital duties in regi\u00ad mental facilities were also expected to man\u00ad age the evacuation of the wounded, a task they shared for a time with members of the regimental band. Only twenty-five men were available in both categories in each regiment since the regulations permitted the assignment of no more than ten men per regiment to work as hospital atten\u00ad dants.

As late as 27 April 1861, the Medical De\u00ad partment had apparently not anticipated a need to order more of these vehicles despite complaints of shortage. Surgeons in the West were familiar with the four-wheeled variety and reported on it, but a two\u00ad wheeled form, relatively untested but ap\u00ad parently designed by Finley, became the basis of the evacuation system once the war began. The purchase of five of the lighter model for everyone of the heavier type was unfortunat e, since in use the two-wheeler proved fragile.\" Although evacuation and care of the wounded during and after battle was the most conspicuous responsibility of the de\u00ad partment , the sick continued to outnumber the wounded and prevention of disease was an important consideration. The fact that in the early months of the war, almost any\u00ad one who wished to join the Army was per\u00ad mitted to do so frustrated attempts to maintain the Army's health. Physical ex\u00ad aminations varied from state to state and in some were very lax.

Depart\u00ad ment doctors, who complained that their own ambiguous rank and the resultant lack of prestige crippled their efforts to have line officers enforce strict rules, blamed this lack of hygiene and sanitation for much disease. Veteran soldiers, who maintained higher standards , also suffered from such diseases associated with faulty sanitation as typhoid, diarrhea, and dysentery. The sick rate of the entire army in the last six months of 1861 exceeded 30 percent, with digestive complaints the greatest source of illness and typhoid the principal cause of death. \" In their effort to prevent the spread of disease, medical officers emphasized the dangers of overcrowding.

Wet camp sites, overwork and exposure, and even poor blankets were also blamed for much illness. A civilian familiar with Army life maintained , however, that sending a soldier's pay directly to his wife or to a savings account would significantl y im\u00ad prove the Army's health by making it im\u00ad possible for him to buy \"bad pies and rotgut whiskey.\"\" A potential cause of disease that received little attention early in the war was the Ar\u00ad my's defective diet. In the summer, when fresh fruits and vegetables were easy to find, the soldier usually had an adequate diet if he was stationed near a good source of supply or permitted to live off the land. Those in authority considered the basic Army ration to be \"all sufficient for the men,\" but the potato was its only source of vitamin C. In the summer of 1861, Con\u00ad gress passed a bill adding fresh vegetables or their equivalent to the diet, but the equivalent was apparently dried vegeta\u00ad bles, which required long cooking to be pal\u00ad atable. Furthermore, transportation for an adequate supply of any form of vegetable was hard to find and commanding officers sometimes failed to take the need for veg\u00ad etables seriously . Soups were favored as a way of serving meats, but the recom\u00ad mended recipes called for hours of cooking, which undoubt edly destroyed the last traces of this perishable vitamin in pota\u00ad toes and any other vegetable that might find its way into the pot. Scurvy was al\u00ad ready appearin g by the end of 1861, even 18Quote from Strong, Diary, p. 85; I, app.: I. though it takes some weeks or months to make its appearance in men whose sup\u00ad ply of vitamin C has previously been adequate.\" To care for the large numbers of both sick and wounded that characterized the Civil War, a far more complex system than that existing in peacetime was necessary to pro\u00ad vide medicines and hospital supplies, es\u00ad pecially since the troops were often on the move. New York City remained the prin\u00ad cipal supply center, but medical purveyors opened additional depots at appropriate sites over the nation, including Baltimore and Cairo, Illinois. Minor depots were set up near large camps, preferably near rail\u00ad roads or water transportation and, if pos\u00ad sible, near a market. Field purveyors accompanied armies on the march, obtain\u00ad ing supplies at the nearest depot and is\u00ad suing them as needed.'o The amount of supplies actually on hand when the war began was small, and the size of the Army was growing rapidly. The man\u00ad ufacture of the various items that were needed was time consuming. Buyers turned to contractors who might be interested only in a profit without regard to the dictates of patriotism. As reports came in about hos\u00ad pitals without either clothing or bedding for their patients, buyers became desper\u00ad ate, profiteers began to thrive, and fraud became common.

Surgeons sometimes lacked even a complete supply of instruments , and a physician who wanted those of the most modern design might have to furnish them himself.\" Medicine s were not always a problem in the early months of the war. Many new reg\u00ad iments were initially supplied by the state from which they came, but others had to draw upon the Medical Department's pur\u00ad veyor. When he could not contact a pur\u00ad chasing officer of his own department , the medical officer had to obtain medicines through the Subsistence or the Quarter\u00ad master's Department. Many volunteer doc\u00ad tors further complicated the problem of supplying medicines by their failure to ap\u00ad preciate the advantages of limiting the va\u00ad riety bought. Some had favorite potions that were not to be found on the depart\u00ad ment's supply table , a document to which few additions were made when it was re\u00ad vised in the summer of 1861. Surgeon Gen\u00ad eral Finley insisted that no unlisted items could be distributed without his personal approval. 22 Slow transportation, complex ordering procedures, and the efforts of well\u00ad intentioned civilians also complicated medical supply. Delays forced medical of\u00ad ficers to buy locally, and citizens added to the confusion by donating items that were not necessarily needed. Ambulances and many items involved in the building and equipping of military hospitals had to be obtained through the quarterma ster, which added further complexities to the Medical Department's operations. \" 21Ltr.

The Medical Department received credit on Subsistence Department books for unused rations. At those hospitals where the produce of gardens or fish caught by convalescents could be added to the fa\u00ad cility's larder, the amount in this so-called hospital fund could be significant. The sum was used to add special items to the diet, and at one hospital it also paid the salary of a professional cook whose skills resulted in considerab le savings to the hospital by eliminating waste\" While the varied demands of the early months of the war almost overwhelmed the Medical Department , many patriotic groups attempted to help in the care and feeding of Union soldiers. Their aid at first tended to be haphazard and inefficient, but not long after the war began and with Med\u00ad ical Department encouragement , a group of private citizens, one of whose leaders was a former Department surgeon, created an organization designed to coordinate ef\u00ad forts to aid the sick and wounded and to prevent disease.

THE CIVIL WAR, 1861: MANY PROBLEMS, FEW SOLUTIONS 161 by President Lincoln and his first secretary of war, Simon Cameron.25 Within the War Department , opinions of the Sanitary Commission varied. Although he wished its power to be less than that of the British Sanitary Commission in the Crimea, Acting Surgeon General Robert C. Wood had encouraged its formation in the spring of 1861. Surgeon General Finley ac\u00ad cepted its help, although apparently with reluctance, but Lincoln's second secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, opposed it. Some Medical Department members believed that the need for supplies as perceived by the commission was only apparent and that it resulted almost entirely from the igno\u00ad rance of volunteer surgeons, who asked for more than they really needed. As late as December 1861, departmental opposition to the commission was so strong that a commission official was moved to com\u00ad ment that it was a \"pity that [the] Bureau will neither do its official duty nor permit volunteers to help it without throwing filth at them.\" Whether welcomed or not, the Sanitary Commission attempted to help the Medi\u00ad cal Department with both advice and ma\u00ad terial aid. Its advice in the early months of the war was wide ranging. It urged more exacting physical exams for recruits, the creation of a nurse corps, an increase in the rank of members of the Medical Depart\u00ad ment, and greater attention to sanitation and disease prevention. It outlined a sys\u00ad tem to be used to determine the order in which patients were treated during and after battle and recommended the specific U WOR, ser. 3, 1:225, 258-59, 308; Churchill p. 198; \"The San\u00ad itary Commission,\" North American Review 98 (1864): 163, 168. instruments and supplies a surgeon should take into the field\" The more tangible assistance that the Sanitary Commission offered the sick and wounded , including prisoners of war, was as varied as the topics on which it offered advice. It provided papers, pens, and vol\u00ad unteer scriveners to write letters for those unable to do so, and supplied dressing gowns, slippers, and reading material. It appealed to the public for donations of wine, spirits, mosquito netting, flannel, sheets, and ice. Its surgeons followed the army into the field and brought with them ambulances, wagons loaded with stores, anesthetics, and surgical instruments . Its inspector kept watch over camp and hos\u00ad pital conditions. In time the Sanitary Com\u00ad mission even established a hospital directory by means of which relatives could determine the location of any individual patient. It supplied quinine when Finley delayed his decision to order it for pro\u00ad phylactic use in northern Virginia. Offi\u00ad cials of the U.S. Sanitary Commission might provide lint for wound dressings, food, and even a hospital on short notice.\" The U.S. Sanitary Commission was not the only civilian organization of its kind that attempted to assist the Union Army with its wounded. Both the Western Sani\u00ad tary Commission and the Christian Com\u00ad mission also operated along similar lines. The former was established in the summer of 1861, in large measure at the instigation of Maj. Gen. John C.

(St. Louis, 1862), p. 4; Jacob Gilbert Forman, 7'lle Western Sanitary Commission A Sketch Both the U.S. Sanitary Commission and the Medical Department broke new ground on a large scale in the first months of the Civil War. East and west of the Appala\u00ad chians, medical directors were often forced to experiment and improvise. In each area of the country where there was military ac\u00ad tivity in 1861, the medical director was forced to solve the problems he encoun\u00ad tered with little, if any, assistance from the surgeon general. Despite the lack of central direction , the senior surgeon of the Medi\u00ad cal Department for each army or area found it necessary to establish general fa\u00ad cilities to shelter those whose wounds or diseases were likely to keep them hospi\u00ad talized more than a few days, to attempt to systematize evacuation when his supply of ambulances was inadequate and his at\u00ad tendants untrained, and to supervise sub\u00ad ordinates who were often inexperienced in military medicine . Care of the Sick and Wounded in the EaSl Medical directors of units serving east of the Appalachians found, long before year's end, that their relative proximit y to the sur\u00ad geon general gave them few, if any, advan\u00ad tages. Surgeon General Finley was jealous of his own powers and prerogatives , but his support of members of his department was ineffective. Perhaps the first medical director to dis\u00ad cover how little he could rely on Finley was John M. Cuyler, a 27-year veteran of the of Its Origil/, NisfOry, Labors ... (51.

Cuyler was in a very difficult situation in the summer of 1861, caught between an in\u00ad adequate surgeon general and an overbear\u00ad ing command ing general, the arbitrary Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler. When Butler sent some of his units on an ill-conceived and ill-executed operation intended to eliminate a Confederate battery at Big Bethel, Virginia, physicians with his com\u00ad mand were already struggling with a mea\u00ad sles epidemic, and a general hospital had been opened to ease the strain on existing facilities. Furthermore , Cuyler had no am\u00ad bulances. After the Big Bethel effort ended in fiasco, Butler apparently assumed that Cuyler's organization could not provide care for his fifty-three wounded. He took over a hotel in the area, including its supply of bedding, and called in his family phy\u00ad sician, Gilman Kimball, at that time a con\u00ad tract physician at the Army hospital in Annapolis, Maryland, to head the com\u00ad mand's general hospital. In so doing, Butler caused the surgeon general considerable dismay. The Annapolis hospital was left without a physician when Kimball joined Butler, which he did against Finley's ex\u00ad pressed orders. Kimball' S arrival, accom\u00ad panied by several assistants , was not explained to Cuyler, who acquiesced in Kimball's takeover of the hospital because he had no alternative.'o lORG 94, entry 544, Register of Hospitals; Ltrs, Ed\u00ad wards to Cuyler (19 Jun 1861) and Finley to G.

Kimball's care of his patients may have been adequate-no complaint on this score has been found-but his departure in Au\u00ad gust 186 I revealed further evidence of his lack of appreciation for the way in which the Medical Department operated. While in office he had attempted to charge the Departm ent for items it did not normally supply. After he left, Cuyler discovered that Kimball had also neither kept a record of expenditures and receipts nor collected a hospital fund. Despite his exaspera tion over the entire affair, Finley apparently later permitted Kimball to attain the po\u00ad sition of brigade surgeon and to be reas\u00ad signed from a position in the Western Department in order once again to join the politically powerful Butler.31 Unlike Cuyler, William S. King, Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell's medical director in northern Virginia, experienced no conflicts with his commanding officer, but the sup\u00ad port he received from the surgeon general was as weak as that given his colleague at Fort Monroe. King, a 24-year veteran of the Medical Department , was handicapped by the fact that he had arrived in Wash\u00ad ington from New Mexico and been as\u00ad signed to McDowell's force only a few days before it started south toward Manassas and the first battle of Bull Run. A high dis\u00ad ease rate was already predictable, for camps were generally filthy. Latrines were inadequate , and the men were too unfa\u00ad miliar with military life to see the need to use them. Seemingly undaunted, King set to work at once to do what he could to prepare for the coming operation. On 16 July, the day that McDowell' s army started south, King set up a general hospital in a former boarding school in Alexandria and JI Ltrs, Finley to Butler (17 lui 1861) and to Thomas (4 and 23 Oct 1861), all in RG 112, cntry 2, 28:245 and 485 and 29:29, respectively; Cuyler to Finley (18 and 21 Aug 1861), both in RG 112, entry 12. 164 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 requisitioned twenty more ambulances. Finley approved the order, but his initials upon it did not guarantee the delivery of the vehicles. One of the assistant surgeons working in his office apparently concluded that, since the order did not bear Mc\u00ad Dowell's signature and since some ambu\u00ad lances had recently been delivered to the general's headquarters, the new vehicles were not needed.\" When McDowell's 34,OOO-man army be\u00ad gan its march, King had had no time to train ambulance attendants or to devise plans for evacuation and hospitalization. Apparently unaware of the serious nature of these omissions , King decided to stay at McDowell's side as much as possible in the belief that he could thus coordinate am\u00ad bulances and \"give a comprehensive su\u00ad pervision of officers connected with the medical department of the army, and see that the wounded were being attended to by the regimental officers.\" This approach had not worked particularly well for Sur\u00ad geon General Lawson in the war with Mex\u00ad ico, and it was not likely to prove a good one when applied to an army more than three times the size of General Scott's and to a group of physicians, most of whom lacked military experience of any kind. McDowe ll preferred to be at the head of his troops, and thus King was in a poor position, given the state of communica\u00ad tions of the period, to advise his surgeons or coordinate their efforts. Moreover, there was no one below him in the medical hi\u00ad erarchy whose responsibilit y it was to su\u00ad pervise the work of the volunteer surgeons, J2RG 94, entry 544, Alexandria, Va.; 50s, Assl AG (no. 178, 5 lui 1861), RG 112, entry 57; Ltrs, King to Finley (13 and 16 Jul 1861), both in RG 112, entry 12; Wood to McCormick (6 May 1861), 112, entry 2,28:38; USSC, Documents oJlhe U.s. mission (New York, 1866), vol.

Regimental surgeons gathered their pa\u00ad tients for treatment wherever they could; at least one spot chosen proved too hot, and patients had to be moved. Troops Oeeing in panic and blocking the roads hindered evacuation from the field. King made no attempt to establish a hospital himself until he saw ambulances coming in from the field with the wounded and the victims of heat exhaustion and realized that regimen\u00ad tal surgeons could not handle the situation unaided. Troops coming through earlier, however, had drawn the wells dry in the Centreville area and the water supply at the hospital King's aide had hastily set up there, two miles from the battlefie ld, proved inadequate. Physicians who were sometimes confused about their responsi\u00ad bilities also caused problems; one doctor refused until ordered to care for patients from units other than his own. McDowell failed to establish a guard for the hospital and mobs of soldiers wandered through the buildings, searching for friends and food. King finally succeeded in restoring order, once he left McDowell's side, but only after \"a great amount of exertion.\" After two days he was able to procure ambulances to evacuate those who could be moved east to Alexandria but the seriously injured were left behind to be captured by the enemy.\" J3QUOIC from WOR, ser. 1,2:309; I'vtSH entry 12.

Twenty wagons with Medical Department supplies had been left behind in order not to impede the march, but King had requested that more supplies be sent by rail from Alexandria to the Fairfax station. Finley granted the re\u00ad quest, but never made the shipment. Pos\u00ad sibly because of King's harrassed state of mind, he did not anticipate a full scale bat\u00ad tel on the 20th, and, as a result, the scenes enacted after the skirmish at Blackburn's ford were repeated on a larger scale, with supplies low and ambulances still too few.\" Although McDowell himself heeded King's advice that the men no longer be rushed because of the heat, his officers con\u00ad tinued to push their soldiers, and doctors once again found themselves caring for the victims of heat exhaustion. Just before the two armies actually clashed, King realized that a facility to supplement regimental hospitals would once more be necessary. He placed the new hospital in the church at Sudley, where water supplies were ade\u00ad quate. Some by ambulance and many ap\u00ad parently on foot, patients soon came pouring into the various facilities, includ\u00ad ing those set up at King's orders at Sudley and Centreville, as well as the regimental hospitals. Apparently neither King nor anyone else made any attempt to relate the number of physicians at anyone hospital to the number of patients, who came in at random. Two hundred or more wounded eventually received treatment at Centre\u00ad ville and 300 of the remaining 900 were cared for in the Sud ley church and other buildings nearby. Many of the less seriously wounded managed to reach Washington on their own, while many others lay on the Vnioll Army (Hartford: W. S. Williams & Co., 1865), PP. 34-35. )$Ltrs, King to Finley (16 and 20 both in RG 112, entry 12; MSH I, app.:2. field or in the shade of trees and bushes. Surgeons generally worked where they pleased-those who wished to work on the battlefield took their saddlebags with them to care for those who had not been moved to shelter. 36 After the battle, fleeing soldiers and their equipment once again blocked the path of ambulances that were attempting to evac\u00ad uate the wounded north to safety. When the Union flight was halted at the Potomac River, King returned south with ambu\u00ad lances, hoping that the victorious Confed\u00ad erates would allow him to retrieve his wounded still lying on the battlefield , but they would not. All the casualties that McDowell's army left behind, either on the field or in hospitals, were taken captive. With them were captured a number of Union surgeons, five of whom had volun\u00ad teered to remain with their patients at Sud\u00ad ley. The enemy permitted two Union physicians to take over a farmhouse and its outbuildings to use as a hospital although they had few supplies and the rebels could not provide them. At least one captured surgeon helped load Union wounded on trains for the long and agonizing trip to Richmond . Trains with wounded had low priority on the tracks and thus might not reach the Confederate capital for days, dur\u00ad ing which time those in the boxcars suf\u00ad fered for lack of food and care.\" l6Ltr, King to Thomas W.

The lack of a coordinated system of evacuation had also forced many who could walk to drag themselve s back to Washington un\u00ad aided. The Surgeon General's Office main\u00ad tained that the number of physicians in attendance in the District of Columbia was more than adequate, but beds must have been in short supply, since the wounded and their ambulances were forced to wan\u00ad der the streets of the city, trying to find one of the four general hospitals there that would take them in. The new hospital at Alexandria was not yet entirely ready to receive patients; on 21 July it held but 26 of the 175 it was hoped it would eventually be able to accommodate. In the closing months of 1861, however, the Medical De\u00ad partment was at least aware of what it was facing and was preparin g to meet future 18MSH I, app.:7-9; Duncan, Medica!

Large numbers of sick as well as wounded were a distinct possibilit y since typhoid deaths were increasing in Wash\u00ad ington general hospitals. Fortunately, the Medical Department , realizing also that the poor sanitation of many barracks in the city was threatening not only their occupants but also the entire community with disease, began urging increased sanitation.39 When Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan was brought in to replace McDowe ll, Sur\u00ad geon Charles Tripier, apparently a favorite of old General Scott, came in to serve as McClellan's medical director in August 1861. Reported to be an \"energetic, spas\u00ad modic, crochety, genial\" soul, Tripier had been serving in the Medical Department since 1830. Since he had been giving a course of lectures on military medicine at the Cincinnati Medical College, the prob\u00ad lems involved in caring for sick and wounded soldiers up to 1861 were fresh in his mind.'o Tripier was apparently not afraid of the task that lay ahead of him. At a time when sweeping changes were necessary, however, he was not so much an innovator as an ad\u00ad ministrator. He saw many inadequacies in the operations of the department in the area defended by the Army of the Potomac, among them deficiencies in sanitation, hy- J9MSH I, pt. 1 pp. 20, 88; Ltrs, Thomas R.

Many of the problems were departmental and more appropriately the province of the surgeon general, but Finley apparently made no effective attempt to deal with them.'\" Tripier recognized that some of the dif\u00ad ficulties experienced by the Medical De\u00ad partment resulted from the incompetence of a few volunteer surgeons and the inex\u00ad perience of many more. He called a board to examine physicians of questionable skills and ordered that from then on such a board examine any medical officer whose competence had been questioned. Tripier also decided to place his brigade surgeons in authority over regimental surgeons of their brigades. Then, by instructing the bri\u00ad gade surgeons about the measures he be\u00ad lieved necessary to preserve the Army's health and requiring them to be responsible for the medical officers under them, he was able to spread his doctrines downward de\u00ad spite the large number of surgeons involved. Tripier hoped to inculcate in his subor\u00ad dinates the principle of avoiding general hospitals whenever possible. Tripier was aware that the general hospital was neces\u00ad sary to receive patients from an army on the move, but, like so many of the old-time surgeons, including King, he retained his dislike for an institution that took a patient far from his unit and appeared to delay his return to it. He also maintained, however, that \"there was no authority for any hos- 4lLtrs, Edwards to Byrne (15 and 18 Jul 1861) and Finley to AG (18 Jul 1861), all in RG 112, entry 2, 28:240-41, 249, and 250-51, respectively; S05, Thomas (no. 1861), RG entry 57; \"Army Hospitals,\" American Medical Times 3 (1861):125.

Tripier moderated his negati ve stance on such facilities only enough to allow brigade hospitals to exist as \"aggrega tions of regimental hospitals.\" Tripier recognized that general hospitals were a necessary evil. He believed that the capital's supply of 2,000 hospital beds would have to be expanded. In a report ap\u00ad parently written a year later he maintained that he had specifically urged 20,000 beds as a minimum goal and that the U.S. San\u00ad itary Commission had been willing to settle for a smaller number, but a commission spokesman, in recalling the same debate, 4lQUotc from MSI\u00b7( 1, app.:48, 49; Ltf, King to Fin\u00ad ley (7 Aug 1861), RG 112, entry 12. 168 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 reversed the figures and maintained that it was Tripier who was willing to settle for less than 20,000. Although Tripier was ap\u00ad parently successful in systematizing ad\u00ad mission to these institutions, in his attempt to increase the number of beds available he encountered frustration, much of which came, directly or indirectly , from Surgeon General Finley. TripleI' was concerned with the quality as well as the quantity of the new hospitals being opened to serve the Army of the Po\u00ad tomac. He favored creating new hospitals from the ground up rather than taking over old buildings , but designs suggested to him by the Sanitary Commission were so ex\u00ad pensive that eventually he had to settle for only two such structures. The buildings that were available for his use as hospitals were often outstand ing examples of inap\u00ad propriate design: halls were narrow, pro\u00ad visions for toilet and bathing facilities woefully inadequate , cellars damp and un\u00ad drained. In some instances , dirt-retaining carpets still lay on the floor. Ventilation was invariably inadequate and bad odors often filled the rooms. Windows were both too small and too few, wards were too small to provide the desired amount of air per patient, and even beds were often of poor quality. Not surprising ly, erysipelas ap\u00ad peared in some of the Washington and nearby Georgetown hospitals at this time.\" Finally forced to accept the fact that even with strong Sanitary Commission support he would not be able to establish a network of completely new military hospitals in the capital area, Tripier continued his search for buildings suitable for hospital use in locations both in and around the capital. Not long after the end of the year, his ef- 4l\"Army Hospitals\" and (1861): 127-28 and 153, respective ly. forts finally brought the total number of beds available for military patients in the Washington area to 6,000. He planned to move patients from Washington to such cities as Annapolis , Baltimore, and Phila\u00ad delphia as promptly as possible so as to keep beds in Washington free for new patients.\" Tripier's efforts to open hospitals in nearby cities to relieve the pressure on those in the capital area brought him into open conflict with the surgeon general, not because of any substantive issue but rather because Finley apparently resented his sub\u00ad ordinate's success and influence. The sec\u00ad retary of war had initially informed Finley that the surgeon general was directly in charge of general hospitals in the area of the Army of the Potomac , but Tripier, with McClellan's backing and little considera\u00ad tion for Finley's sensibilities, went blithely about his own schemes. The secretary of war eventually granted McClellan the right to proceed as he saw fit with the establish\u00ad ment of new hospitals , and such was Trip\u00ad Ier's position as McClellan' s medical director that McClellan's victory was Trip\u00ad Ier's victory. TripleI' and Finley remained at odds'\" Finley apparently kept a jealous eye on Tripier's work in the fall of 1861, and when TripleI' attempted to report to him about his search for suitable buildings in Phila\u00ad delphia to serve as general hospitals for pa\u00ad tients moved from Washington , the surgeon general flew into a rage. Cutting his subordinate off short, Finley charged that Tripier had not paid his superior the courtesy of notifying him of what he was doing in Philadelphia , that he was putting McClellan up to giving orders that humil- HStrong, Diary. p. 186; RG 94, entry 544; Ltc, Wood to Kennedy RG 28:429. 183-84. THE CIVIL WAR, 1861: MANY PROBLEMS, FEW SOLUTIONS 169 iated the surgeon general, and that he was trying to upstage the surgeon general by locating more space for hospitals outside the District of Columbia than was needed, in view of Finley's own efforts in this re\u00ad gard. Allowing Tripier no chance to explain himself, Finley berated him in the presence ofa third party and then ordered him from the room. Tripier lost little time in placing charges against Finley, and on 6 December, a court-martial was called to consider the case. On 10 December, the surgeon general was charged officially with \"Conduct un\u00ad becoming an officer and a gentleman\" and \"Conduct to the prejudice of good order and Military Discipline .\" The case was never tried, however, because Finley suc\u00ad cessfully raised the Question of whether the general in chief, McClellan, was empow\u00ad ered to dismiss a bureau chief. Finley re\u00ad tracted such of his language as had offended Tripier, and the matter rested. Since the Sanitary Commission was by this point in full cry after Finley and since the Question of the surgeon general's compe\u00ad tence was being debated in the public press, the charges placed against Finley and dis\u00ad missed on a technicalit y probably contrib\u00ad uted to the erosion of his position.\" Finley was not the only frustration in hu\u00ad man form that Tripier had to endure. Vol\u00ad unteer help flocked to the hospitals, and not all of it was welcome. From Tripier's point of view, his hospitals were full of ci\u00ad vilians who considered themselves better able than he to manage them. \"Sensational preachers , village doctors, and strong\u00ad minded women\" all \"obtruded their crude suggestions .\" Competent nurses were too 4(>Quotes from Court Martial Charges (10 Dec 1861), Records of the Judge Advocate General, Pro\u00ad ceedings of Courts Martial and Courts of Inquiry.

Triple wished to have one nurse for every ten patients, but at the Kalorama facility, where contagious cases were isolated, for example, at one time only two nurses were responsible for 106 patients. Such attendants were gener\u00ad ally either well-trained lay nurses, male and female, or members of one or another re\u00ad ligous order.\" Not the least of the problems that Tripier faced when he became medical director of the Army of the Potomac was that of evac\u00ad uation. Since he was not responsible for the choice of the fragile two-whee led ambu\u00ad lance and was scarcely likely to be able to wean Finley away from his own design, one that he apparently attempted to patent, Tripier's complaints were largely useless. He pointed out that 110 of the 228 two\u00ad wheelers issued by the Quartermaster of the Army of the Potomac in the three\u00ad month period that began July 1861 had \"disappeared,\" statistics that to him indi\u00ad cated \"reckless use.\" Tripier obtained an order ending the practice of using ambu\u00ad lances as taxis. This order may have been obeyed, since as of 31 December 1861, 314 of the Finley design ambulances and 71 four-wheel ers were functioning in Wash\u00ad ington and one two-wheeler was function\u00ad ing with each regiment in the field.\" Convinced of the need for another method of evacuation to manage the re\u00ad moval of men lying in areas inaccessible to ambulances and apparently assuming that Finley would do nothing about the prob\u00ad lem, Tripier began experimen ting with a lit\u00ad ter that could be attached to the back of a horse or mule. The initial model he tried was, at 140 pounds, too heavy, but Tripier 47Quote from Irwin, from MSH 1, app.:49; Maxwell, Sanitary Commission. p. 75; Hamilton, Treatise, p. 166. 170 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 continued to try different models in his search for one that could be used to replace the two-wheeled ambulance. Although the problem of the proper vehicle in which to transport the wounded remained , attempts to train attendants led to some improve\u00ad ment. Surgeons serving in the Poolesville, Maryland, area drilled their attendants in evacuation techniques and organized them by brigades to achieve greater efficiency. In October, McClellan ordered that all am\u00ad bulance attendants take part in hour-long drills six times a week under the direction of regimental surgeons.\" Disease prevention was also one of Trip\u00ad Ier's major concerns . Some of the diseases that were beginning to plague the Army of the Potomac were preventable by medical means, others by improved sanitation and hygiene. TripIer learned that many soldiers serving under McClellan had not been vac\u00ad cinated against smallpox. He ordered the situation remedied and attempted to re\u00ad quire that thereafter all recruits be vacci\u00ad nated before they left their assembly points. Finding the results of this campaign not entirely satisfactory, he ordered bri\u00ad gade surgeons to inspect all men and to immunize those in need of it. His efforts must have been successfu l, for in the first seven months he was in office there were but 168 cases, most of which had already been contracted before the victims entered the Army. Since malaria was a major threat to the Army's health, TripIer was intrigued by a report of one of his surgeons that it could be prevented by the ingestion of quinine in whiskey. The regulations did not recognize this remedy, and so TripIer turned to the Sanitary Commiss ion to obtain elll, pI. 3, p. 6; \"Duties of Brigade Medical Times 3 (1861):282-83; MSH I, app.:ID-11. essary ingredients. When the potion seemed successful, he managed to persuade Surgeon General Finley to issue it to those regiments most threatened by malaria. TripIer continued to receive favorable re\u00ad ports of the concoction and eventually or\u00ad dered that supplies be kept on hand at all times. In yet another effort to prevent disease, TripIer moved to improve living condi\u00ad tions, both for hospitalized soldiers and for those in the field. He assigned three med\u00ad ical officers to serve as field hospital in\u00ad spectors and urged an end to the practice of using tents over submerged foundations to shelter soldiers in the field. He was also concerned with the design and heating of tents. Above all he urged upon surgeons and commanding officers alike \"the para\u00ad mount importance of hygienic morality.\"'\u00b7 A certain amount of disease was, of course, inevitable . Measles, the scourge of new units, did not pass the Army of the Potomac by, and both malaria and typhoid appeared despite precautions. In October and November, among approximately 130,000 men, almost 8,000 cases of fevers of all kinds developed, with 1,000 de\u00ad scribed as typhoid. Although TripIer re\u00ad garded typhoid as endemic in the United States, he also believed that many diag\u00ad noses of typhoid were in error. In Decem\u00ad ber, alarmed at the high disease rate, General McClellan appointed three medi\u00ad cal officers to serve on a committee to in\u00ad vestigate the nature of the prevailing diseases. Their conclusion was that malaria was taking the highest toll but that typhoid was definitely present. Neverthe less, al- 'OQuote from MSH I, app.:47.

THE CIVIL WAR, 1861: MANY PROBLEMS , FEW SOLUTIONS 171 though the number of cases of disease in the Army of the Potomac rose from 8,000 in July of 1861 to greater than 35,000 in December, the disease rate was falling, from 45 percent in July to 30 percent in September and then to slightly more than 23 percent in December.\" TripIer and the surgeons under him were struggling to find ways in which the Med\u00ad ical Department could meet the sudden and overwhelming demands that the new conflict placed on the medical service of the Army of the Potomac without altering the department's basic structure. Though their efforts showed some success, they were handicapped in their attempts by fac\u00ad tors beyond their immediate control. Both volunteer soldier and volunteer physician knew little as yet of the requirements of military life, stockpiles of supplies grew slowly, and, above all else, the great num\u00ad bers of men joining the armed forces cre\u00ad ated overwhelming medical problems. Much time would be required to resolve these shortcomings, not only for the Army of the Potomac, but for all Union armies. Care of the Sick and Wounded in the West Military engagements to the west of the Appalachians took place on a smaller scale than the battle of Bull Run and thus, al\u00ad though disease took a growing and appall\u00ad ing toll, the number of wounded to be cared for after any single battle was relatively small. Even the battle of Wilson's Creek, Missouri , caused only two-thirds as many wounded as Bull Run. Distances were great, however, and the campaigns lacked the sharp focus of those in the East. Action tended to take place far from any large and S'MSH 1, pI. 1:30-35 and pI. 3:364-72; Ltr, Finley to AG (4 Dec 1861), RG 112, entry 2, 29:167. JOSEPH J. B. WRIGHT.

Transportation became critically important and medical directors tended to set up general hospitals in cities convenient to major railroads or rivers. The patient load of general hospitals in the West was great even though some surgeons refrained from sending patients from regimental hospitals to these facilities until they were dying, a custom that tended to revive the old fear of general hospitals\" In western Virginia and along the Ohio River, Union forces under McClellan and his successor, Brig.

In the spring of 1861, the medical director for McClellan was Joseph J. B. Wright, to whom fell the responsibility for organizing the medical care of the troops in the De\u00ad partment of the Ohio. The regiments in the area were so newly called up that one of Wright's first duties was to provide hos\u00ad pital supplies for them, a task he was able to complete quickly with the aid of the New York City purveyor. Because so many of these men were in poor condition when they joined the Army, Wright anticipated a need for general hospitals to serve the sick among them and hoped to locate these fa\u00ad cilities at several different sites, from West Virginia westward. 53 Wright questioned whether the hospitals that sheltered disabled merchant seamen in Cincinnati and Pittsburgh would be worth using for casualties. The hospital in Cin\u00ad cinnati was already available to volunteer patients, but despite its 100 to 150 bed ca\u00ad pacity, it held only 15 to 30 men. He finally decided that the rising disease rates of late summer and fall made reliance on regi\u00ad mental hospitals and the homes of patients who lived in the Cincinnati area unrealis\u00ad tic. The arrival of wounded from various engagements that fall made Wright's need all the more imperativ e. By October pa\u00ad tients were pouring into Cincinnati by the hundreds, some from engagements in west\u00ad ern Virginia whence they traveled much of the way by boat.

The way in which the area west of the Appalachians was departmentalized changed as the war progressed. The Departm ent of Western Virginia, for example. was removed from the Department of the Ohio in September 1861 and added to another department in 1862, while the Departm ent of the Cumberland lasted only from August to No~ vember 1861: MSH I, pI. 1:74. to be near their homes. Wright's staff in Cincinnati was too small to handle the heavy case load, and malingerers were turn\u00ad ing up in significant numbers. His prob\u00ad lems, like Tripier's, were only made worse by \"scores, if not hundreds. of officious & meddle-some women, & equally officious men, all of whom claim to have the direc\u00ad tion of the Hospital.\" Some of these busy\u00ad bodies were undoubtedly drawn to the hos\u00ad pital by vivid newspaper stories about the sufferings of the wounded in poorly ad\u00ad ministered hospitals. Nevertheless, Wright also wrote the surgeon general of his in\u00ad debtedness to the citizens of Cincinnati, whose charitable donations helped meet hospital expenses, and to that city's phy\u00ad sicians, who donated their time to help the Medical Department staff. 54 Before his reassignment to St. Louis in the fall of 1861, Wright was also called upon to establish general hospitals near the battlefield in West Virginia. At Rich Mountain in July, for example, he set up a temporary field hospital in a three-story house and in tents pitched nearby. He also set up a general hospital in the town of Beverly, seven miles from Rich Mountain , both for the wounded from Rich Mountain and for those that came in a few days later from the engagement at Carrick's ford. In this facility, five assistant surgeons cared for both Union and Confederate soldiers, on an equal but usually separate basis.\" Wright believed that, on the whole, his patients in the Department of the Ohio had been well cared for, despite what he ap\u00ad parently deemed the hopeless military in\u00ad eptitude of his volunteer surgeons and j~Quote from Ltf, Wright to Finley (15 Oct 1861), RG 112, entry 12); see also Wright to Finley (2, 9, and 21 Aug, 22 Sep, and 14 Oct 1861), all in RG 112, entry 12; MSH I, app.:t4; SO, Thomas (no.

Although the men for whom he was responsible were fighting in a primitive country far from supply centers, and sup\u00ad plies were limited, no serious shortage de\u00ad veloped, even of such difficult-to-transport items as anesthetics. Surgeons were appar\u00ad ently able to use freely either chloroform or chloroform mixed with ether and did so with complete success, without anesthesia\u00ad related deaths. Wright recalled later that he had had \"improvised ... ambulances in sufficient number\" from \"light two horse spring wagons\" bought at McClellan's or\u00ad der. The evacuation of patients from Rich Mountain to the Beverly general hospital three days after the battle went well, al\u00ad though Wright admitted that part of the credit had to go to smooth roads and good weather.\" In the fall of 1861, the Surgeon General's Office ordered the opening of yet another general hospital in the Department of the Ohio at Louisville, Kentucky, a unit that was to be staffed by contract physicians. By this time the Medical Department had assigned Robert Murray (who would serve as surgeon general from 1883 to 1886) to replace Wright. Murray set up his head\u00ad quarters in Louisville and asked the sur\u00ad geon general to appoint one of the assistant surgeons working in Cincinnati as medical director of that area so that he could focus his own efforts upon Louisville. By the end of November, a measles epidemic had struck in that part of Kentucky and the two general hospitals Murray had established in Louisville were both crowded. Two more hospitals were being prepared for opening, and plans were underway to set up still more, but meanwhile 100 men were in tem- ~6MSH J, app.:13, quotes from Ltrs, Horace R. Wirtz to Finley (19 Dec 1861) and Wright to Finley (\\ Jun 1861), both in RG 112, entry 12. porary rooms in the town and 400 more sick in camp. With 50,000 men in the field and more coming in, the situation was not likely to improve. Moreove r, Murray was having difficulty hiring contract surgeons at $100 a month, the maximum he was per\u00ad mitted to offer. 51 To the west of the Department of the Ohio were 23,000 men who would on 25 July come under the command of Maj. Gen. John Charles Fremont. Until August there was little action in Missouri and most of the sick of Fremont's new command were cared for in regimental and post hos\u00ad pitals near St. Louis. Medical Director Samuel De Camp hastily set up the first general hospital in that city, located on a major railroad, the first week in August. After first accepting and then rejecting the smaller and \"miserable, filthy Marine [merchant marine] Hospital,\" De Camp fi\u00ad nally chose for his general hospital a new building with a capacity of more than 500. Only a few days later, Brig. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon and his 5,000 men left their camp near Springfield, Missouri, to attack the en\u00ad emy near Wilson's Creek, and their disas\u00ad trous defeat brought the first significant number of wounded to the hospitals of General Fremont's command\" Lyon's medical system was loosely or\u00ad ganized in the summer of 1861, with no medical director to coordinate the work of the sixteen physicians who served within the command. The men who served as am\u00ad bulance drivers and attendants had re\u00ad ceived no training. Ambulances and tents were in short supply.

The doc\u00ad tor selected an unfinished building origi\u00ad nally intended to serve as a courthouse and chose at least one other medical officer, a Regular Army assistant surgeon, to serve with him there.\" On 9 August, Lyon ordered his command to leave camp near Springfield and to pre\u00ad pare to attack the enemy along Wilson's Creek. The battle the next day was fierce, lasting six to seven hours. In the disastrous defeat that ensued, Lyon himself was killed, and the loss in dead and wounded was second in 1861 only to the casualties at Bull Run. But two vehicles, both \"large spring wagons drawn by six mules,\" were available to remove the more than 700 wounded. Those who could walk were cared for in a ravine, and many of those who could not remained on the battlefield overnight. Most of the casualties were eventually brought to Springfie ld, and about 200 joined the rest of Lyon's battered force in their 110-mile retreat from Spring\u00ad field to Rolla, Missouri, whence they went by train to hospitals at St. Louis. One med\u00ad ical officer present at the battle of Wilson's Creek believed that had Lyon appointed a medical di rector, 90 percent of the wounded could have been cared for and evacuated before the retreat began.60 The wounded who could not join the re\u00ad treat were sheltered in the general hospital S9Quote from MSH I, app.:15. 6fJMSH I, Shiloh: Baules and Leaders 0/ the CiI'iI War, new ed.

When Confederates took possession of Springfield the following day, they quickly made off with the hospital supplies and medicines that Union forces had left behind for their own wounded. The enemy preempted all available transportation , and a week was needed to retrieve all Union wounded from the battlefield. Although $5,000 had been left with Union surgeons for the purchase of supplies and food for their patients, no medical supplies were available. Surgeons did somehow manage to perform many operations, which was fortunate since conditions had not been fa\u00ad vorable for surgery at the battlefield. \" The defeat at Wilson's Creek placed an added burden on a hospital system already strained by increasing numbers of patients with typhoid, measles, pneumonia , and diarrhea, diseases that spread all the more rapidly because of the poor sanitation that characterized many of the camps in Fre\u00ad mont's command. Those of Lyon's casual\u00ad ties who had joined the retreat from Springfie ld to Rolla eventually arrived in St. Louis, where they were joined in time by the wounded who had been taken cap\u00ad tive. A month after the defeat, the con\u00ad tending armies began a gradual exchange of wounded prisoners that was not com\u00ad pleted until November. Taking advantage of the nearby railroad, surgeons sent most of these patients in boxcars 110 miles on new, unsettled, and bumpy track back to St. Louis, where hospitals were generally not highly regarded.

THE CIVIL WAR, 1861: MANY PROBLEMS, FEW SOLUTIONS 175 Louis charity hospitals, took in military pa\u00ad tients, and even the charity hospitals were soon full to overflowing. To make matters worse, patients were coming in from crowded hospitals in other parts of Mis\u00ad souri and even from Cairo, Illinois, where the sick were too numerous for local hos\u00ad pitals to handle. De Camp opened a hos\u00ad pital for smallpox victims on an island in the Mississippi River and another for mea\u00ad sles victims. He had smaller hospitals opened at intervals along the rail line in Missouri from Sedalia and Rolla to SI. Louis and took over a steamboat to use as a hospital ship. He freed beds in the city by sending convalescents to camps outside the city. The Western Sanitary Commis\u00ad sion began outfitting railroad cars for the sick and provided equipment for many of the hospitals, supplemented Medical De\u00ad partment supplies, and even opened its own hospital in a rented five-story build\u00ad ing, where patients were cared for by an Army staff.62 By December of 1861 the condition of the 2,000 patients in SI. Louis hospitals was outraging civilian observers, who re\u00ad ported the deaths of fifty-six patients in one week. A gentleman familiar with the SI. Louis situation wrote the secretary of war that the Army's hospitals there were \"in a miserable, dirty, filthy and disgrace/ul condition\" and that entry into them meant \"certain dealh.\" The mortality varied, of course-from 26 October to 2 November , 62Gcorge Edgar Turner.

Horrible as the rate may have seemed, it was perhaps to have been expected, since only the sick\u00ad est patients were likely to be sent to general hospitals. The mortality was not signifi\u00ad cantly worse than that in the general hos\u00ad pitals of the East, where 151 of the little more than 2,000 patients died in Decem\u00ad ber. This rate was actually lower than that in general hospitals of the entire central region, where 8 percent of the patients died during the last month of 1861.63 The story at many other hospitals in the West was much the same as that in Cin\u00ad cinnati and SI. Louis. Crowding was fre\u00ad quent and inadequate housing common, as could be seen at the facility set up in Jef\u00ad ferson City, Missouri , to care for 500 men who broke down as Fremont drove his men hard to make up for a string of defeats. This hospital was housed in an old seminary, two taverns, and a private home. Many windows were broken in these buildings , and some patients had to lie on the floor. A Sanitary Commission inspector noted that spittoons and chamberpots were not promptly emptied and that lazy and un\u00ad disciplined soldiers had turned the hospital grounds into one large latrine. Hospitals in and near Cairo, Illinois, were apparently in better shape than many others, partially be\u00ad cause overcrowding had been relieved by sending patients downriver to SI. Louis. The rate of malaria among the patients in these units was high, although, like most physicians before the twentieth century, the medical officers there did not remark upon any possible relationship between the 63Quote from H.

As usual, in\u00ad experience joined ignoran ce and undiscipline as a major source of trouble. The young brigade surgeon, John Brinton, who set up a new hospital in Illinois at nearby Mound City to relieve overcrowd\u00ad ing at the Cairo facility, commented sadly that, if he had had some experience before being called upon to establish that facility, he \"could have accomplished in a few hours the work that cost me so many weary days of labor and nights of thought.\" '(Brinton, Memoirs, pp. 43-44, 50, Quotes rrom pp. 42 and 52, respectively. Conclusion In the West as in the East, the Medical Department's inability to provide prompt and unfailin g care for the sick and wounded of the Union army stemmed principa lly from two factors, bot~ beyond the Departm ent's control. The frequency with which Union forces were defeated in 1861 greatly complicated the managem ent of medical care and evacuation, and the newness of warfare on the scale of the Civil War made it impossible for anyone to have adequately anticipated the scope and mag\u00ad nitude of the problems that would arise. Neverthe less, the Department did not ad\u00ad just as rapidly as it might have to the new demands placed upon it. Surgeon General Finley was apparently totally unable to grasp the significance of the situation that faced him and seemed more concerned with maintaining his image as head of the Department than with designing new ap\u00ad proaches to new problems. Medical Direc\u00ad tor King, too, found the Lawsonian tradition hard to forget. Although King's successor, TripIer, was capable of a certain amount of innovation, he was not daring by nature, and abandoned the old ways only with reluctance. To the West, such men as young Brinton and the veteran Wright struggled to adapt to the new sit\u00ad uation, but youthful vigor could not make up for inexperience, nor mature judgment compensate for inadequate numbers of hospital beds. The first eight months of the war were long enough for serious problems to develop, but not long enough for ade\u00ad quate solutions to be devised and carried out. CHAPTER 9 The Civil War in 1862: Learning on the Job The horrors experienced by the sick and wounded during the first months of the Civil War made the need for change in leadership, organization , and operations of the Medical Departm ent in 1862 undeni\u00ad able. No truly applicable model existed to guide these changes, however. The Medical Department would have to learn through trial and error what was required. The learning process had begun in 1861, but fast and imaginative learners as well as en\u00ad ergetic leaders were still wanted. The first developm ents to influence the Medical Department significantly, how\u00ad ever, took place at a higher level. [n January 1862 the relentless Edwin M. Stanton re\u00ad placed Cameron as secretary of war. [n April, Congress voted to allow promotion on the basis of competence rather than se\u00ad niority. The new bill had barely passed when Stanton, using Surgeon General Fin\u00ad ley's alleged mishandling of a complaint as a pretext, removed the aging physician from office and exiled him to Boston, thereby triggering his resignation. At the urging of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, but against his own inclinations , Stanton then ~ppointed a 33-year-old assistant sur\u00ad geon with barely more than eleven years of Army experience to be the new surgeon general.' IStrong, Diary, p. xxxix; Maxwell, Sanitary Com ~ Two days after appointing William Alex\u00ad ander Hammond surgeon general, the sec\u00ad retary of war called the new head of the Medical Department into his office. Stan\u00ad ton asked a casual question about the ac\u00ad tivities of the U.S. Sanitary Commission in a \"tone and manner\" Hammond recalled as being \"offensive in the extreme,\" and then assured his subordinate that \"if you have the enterprise, the knowledge, the in\u00ad telligence, and the brains to run the Med\u00ad ical Department, [ will assist you.\" Determined not to \"quietly submit to the insolence which [Stanton) constantly ex\u00ad hibited toward his subordinates,\" Ham\u00ad mond, later remembered it, replied: Mr. Secretary , ... [ am not accustomed to be spoken to in that manner by any person, and [ beg you will address me in more re\u00ad spectful terms ... during my service in the army, [ have been thrown with gentlemen , who, no matter what our relative rank was, treated me with respect.

His medical research and his work as a naturalist while serving as an assistant surgeon in the West brought him to the fa\u00ad vorable attention of prominent scientists, but he was unable to tolerate a life char\u00ad acterized by, in his words, \"restraint and uncertaint y.\" He resigned from the Army lQuotes from William A. Hammond , A Stalemellf of the Causes Which Led to the Dismissal of Surgeofl\u00ad General William A. Hammond From the Army (New York, 1864), p. 16. in 1860, using as a pretext what now ap\u00ad pears to have been a psychosomatic illness. When war broke ou t, however, he was de\u00ad termined to take part, even though to reen\u00ad ter the Medical Department he had to take the entrance examination again and enter at the very bottom of the list, losing credit for the years he had served earlier. He man\u00ad aged to counter Surgeon General Finley's skepticism by signing a pledge stating that he had not suffered from his heart problem for three years and that if it returned, he would resign.' Hammond's work in the earliest months of the war demonstrated his administrative talents. With great energy he set up new hospitals and improved those already es\u00ad tablished in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia, experimenting with a new system of ventilation. While doing so, he served under two men, Charles TripIer and Jonathan Lettermen , who were sufficiently impressed with his abilities to serve later as his subordinates without apparent ob\u00ad jection, and under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, who become convinced that Hammond would make a good successor to Finley. Hammond's success also brought him the enthusiastic support of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, but during this same period he managed to earn the enmity of Secretaries of War Cameron and Stanton and of Finley and Robert C. Wood, who several times served as acting surgeon general.' lQuote from Ltf, Hammond to Baird (19 Apr 1860), RU 305, Smithsonian; Ltf, Hammond to Baird (18 Oct 1860), RU 305, Smithsonian; Strong, Diary. pp. 185, 1850; Bonnie Ellen Blustein, \"A New York Hammond (Pledge, 1861), RG I 12, entry 2, 28:84; USSC, Doclimelll s \"Hammond ,\" pp. 75-82; Llr, Finley to AG (4 Mar 1862), RG 112, entry 2, 29:669; Strong, THE CIVIL WAR IN 1862: LEARNING ON THE JOB 179 From the outset, the key factors in Ham\u00ad mond's military career were his consider\u00ad able ability as a scientist, his energy and drive, and his unfortunate temperament. Even more than his administrati ve and sci\u00ad entific talents, his hot temper, his impul\u00ad siveness, and his \"great self-confidence \" that, in the words of friend and colleague S. Weir Mitchell, \"led him to inconsiderate action,\" determined his fate in the Army. Many who knew Hammond as surgeon general were less charitable in their opin\u00ad ions than Mitchell; one remembered that, as head of the Medical Department , Ham\u00ad mond was \"rarely anything but captious, irritable, and pompous.'\" Just at the time Hammond came to of\u00ad fice, Congress was acting to make major modifications in the structure of the Med\u00ad ical Department. In April 1862, it created the positions of medical inspector general and eight medical inspectors. It also re\u00ad vived the position of assistant surgeon gen\u00ad eral, a post to which Stanton , with Hammond 's approval, quickly named Rob\u00ad ert Wood. Hammond later noted that Stan\u00ad ton had promised the position to Wood, subject to the surgeon general's approval, anticipating, Hammond believed, that he would react vindictive ly. The inspectors were to be chosen from among both vol\u00ad unteer surgeons and regulars. They were to be responsible for the overall management of military hospitals and for the inspection of sanitary conditions in camps where crowding was leading to epidemics of such diseases as typhoid fever and dysentery. Congress added to the prestige of the Med- Diary, p. 187; second quotes, S.

Under pressure from the San\u00ad itary Commission it added ten surgeons, ten assistant surgeons, and twenty medical cadets to the roster in April and granted Hammond at the same time permission to appoint as many hospital stewards as he needed. Regimental surgeons and assistant surgeons were continuing to join the Army as part of each new regiment of volunteers and were serving the same terms as those signing up with them. But in July the leg\u00ad islators voted to increase the number of volunteer physicians serving outside the regimental framework as well. After chang\u00ad ing the title of the Corps of Brigade Sur\u00ad geons to Corps of Staff Surgeons, Congress added 40 surgeons and 120 assistant sur\u00ad geons to the group, designating them sur\u00ad geons and assistant surgeons of the volunteers. These men were to be \"liable for detail for any professional duty the good of the services requires.\" Congress also gave each volunteer infantry regiment a second assistant surgeon and each cavalry regiment one surgeon and one assistant surgeon. It ruled that militia regiments, when called up, should be organized just as the volunteer units were.7 Amid these signs of progress, a new con\u00ad flict began to take shape within the De- 139; Blustcin, \"Hammond,\" p. 78. Medical directors occasionally appointed their own inspectors on an informal basis, but such an ap\u00ad pointment did not bring with it a change in rank. lQuote from Ltr, SGO to David L.

The ill will between Stanton on the one hand and Hammond and his allies on the Sanitary Commission on the other initially lay beneath the surface, but it emerged to interfere with the Medical De\u00ad partment's operation s shortly after Ham\u00ad mond's appointment as surgeon general. For two months after Congress created the position of inspector , the secretary of war delayed giving his official approval to the surgeon general's nominees . Even then, Stanton accepted only four of the eight, substituting for the others men who were apparently not highly regarded by the med\u00ad ical profession. When Congress, recalling what appeared to be the unnecessary ago\u00ad nies of the sick and wounded in Mc\u00ad Clellan'S campaign of May and June, rejected Charles TripIer, McClellan's med\u00ad ical director, for the position of inspector general, Stanton named in his place former Brigade Surgeon Thomas Perley, a man who was \"quite unknown to the public ser\u00ad vice and to the profession ,\" as the editor of the American Medical Times put it. De\u00ad spite the low caliber of the men named to the new positions, the lawmaker s saw the position as important and in December created another eight openings for inspec\u00ad tors in the department. Congress also re\u00ad quired that the inspectors assume, in addition to their other duties, the respon\u00ad sibility for examining patients in general hospitals and convalescent camps to de\u00ad termine who among them should be dis\u00ad charged from the Army' Congress also created another new po\u00ad sition within the Medical Department, that of medical storekeeper. Although hospital 8QUotc from \"The Week,\" American Medical Times 5 (1862): 11; see also \"Sanitary Inspector in the Army,\" American Medical Times 5 (1862):94-95; Saul Jarcho, \"Edwin Stanton and American Medicine ,\" 176-77. stewards compoundin g medicine s under a surgeon's direction, Congress now authorized the secretary of war to hire as many as six medical store\u00ad keepers, who were to be well-qualified apothecaries or druggists and to work at a more responsible level than hospital stew\u00ad ards. They were required to be between twenty-five and forty years of age and to pass an examination administered by a board of at least three medical officers. The position of the medical storekeeper was temporary, to be eliminated at the end of the war, and apparently carried no rank. Like the medical purveyor , the storekeeper was expected to post bond. He apparently served as a captain and often acted as a substitute for medical purveyor' Despite these newly created positions, physicians remained the backbone of the Medical Department. Alone among them, volunteer regimental surgeons continued to be examined only by state authorities . They were joining the Army in great num\u00ad bers, as many as 1,200 in the eight months preceding May 1862. In July, in authoriz\u00ad ing the increase in the number of volunteer staff surgeons, Congress ordered that med\u00ad ical officers serving at this level continue to be examined by a board of medical of\u00ad ficers. The very strict examinations that Hammond designed for them, however, caused many to fail, and Stanton threat\u00ad ened to eliminate the examining board if more did not pass. Since the correlation between test scores and performance in the field was apparently open to question, this 9Hcnry N. Rittenhouse . \"U.S. W. S. King (5 lui 1862), RG 112, entry 2, 31 :367.

Hammond was determined, how\u00ad ever, to improve by this means the quality of the care that the Union soldier received. By the end of the year he had concluded that physicians taken into the regular med\u00ad ical service should have studied hygiene and military surgery. He wrote the heads of medical schools to urge the introduction of sllch courses into their curricula. Al\u00ad though he relaxed his standards somewhat for the examinations given volunteer sur\u00ad geons, he began to work with eminent phy\u00ad sicians in several large cities to improve the caliber of doctors made available to serve under contracL'\u00b7 The quality of the Army's contract phy\u00ad sicians was important, since during the course of the war more than 5,500 civilian doctors assisted the Medical Department. Many routinely staffed general hospitals while others provided help only in emer\u00ad gencies when it was necessary to locate more physicians quickly. In the last group were some of the nation's most prominent doctors. When a battle resulted in over\u00ad whelming numbers of casualties, those who flocked to the scene might include quacks, cultists, and practitione rs of questionabl e ethics, men who were not under military discipline and who could, therefore, come and go as they liked, taking assignments that pleased them and rejecting all others. They often performed unnecessary opera\u00ad tions or wrought havoc as they dug about for bullets. As a result of the problems ex\u00ad perienced with doctors so casually assem\u00ad bled, the Medical Department decided to call only upon members of a reserve sur- IOLtrs, Hammond to G. W.

They served under Medical De\u00ad partment orders and were required to re\u00ad main at their assigned posts at least fifteen days, unless officially released sooner.\" Although, like his attempts to require strict examination s, Hammond's efforts to gain for his medical directors a rank more suited to their responsibilities failed, med\u00ad ical officers did, in theory, attain one priv\u00ad ilege in 1862. When the war was more than a year old, both sides agreed that they would not in the future hold noncombat \u00ad ants, including physicians, as prisoners of war. Unfortunate ly, many months would pass before this understanding, never for\u00ad malized, was routinely heeded.\" The need for civilian hospital workers was more constant than that for civilian physicians and some system was required to guide their activities. In June 1862, the secretary of war issued more detailed reg\u00ad ulations concerning civilian hospital work\u00ad ers than had been previousl y in force. Attendants were to serve under military discipline with a squad of eleven nurses as\u00ad signed to serve every 100 patients. The chief of the squad was to report to the hos\u00ad pital steward. Regulations called for two male nurses for everyone female in general hospitals, but many facilities had yet to hire their first woman.\" \"GO (no. 65, 12 Jun 1863), in William both in American Medical Times 5 (1862): 135 and ISO, respectively; Hall, \"Lessons,\" Medical Times 5 (1862): II; GO (no. 60, 6 Jun 1862), in Grace, Manual, p. 44.

Hammond shared the U.S. Sanitary Com\u00ad mission's enthusiasm for the pavilion con\u00ad cept, having experimented with hospital design as a medical officer in West Virginia before he was appointed surgeon general. He had become c onvinced that more than 3,000 patients could be cared for in one hospital if the ventilation was good. As the building program progressed , the Medical Department was able to abandon some of the old facilities, but the location of the new institutions became a political issue, both because communitie s usually wanted their wounded cared for nearby and be\u00ad cause businessmen were aware of the profit such an institution could engender. Hos\u00ad pitals had also been established by states for their own wounded to supplement the Army's facilities, and the Medical Depart\u00ad ment was having so much difficulty in find\u00ad ing enough beds that it had no choice but to cooperate with the states. In June 1862, at the urging of state authoritie s who found them very costly to support, the Medical Department assumed responsibility for many of the state institutions. Because for all practical purposes these facilities re\u00ad mained largely under state control, many patients who should have rejoined their units were instead discharged to civilian life.\" The enormous numbers of sick and wounded flooding hospitals with the start of the new campaign season made it nec\u00ad essary to find ways to limit the size of the hospital population . Surgeons attempted to '4Blustcin, \"Hammond,\" p. 83; Joseph R. Smith, \"Hammond, The Surgeon-General,\" 15 Emory Upton, 402-05. weed out malingerers, but in the confusion that followed a battle, this was a difficult task. Medical officers also urged that more efficient procedures for discharging the chronically ill from the service be devised. The concept of the convalescent camp be\u00ad gan to gain popularity because such a camp made it possible for soldiers almost ready to resume their duties to remain relatively near the units to which they would be returning,lS Hammond often visited proposed hos\u00ad pital sites to make sure that those chosen were healthy, but by the end of 1862 the Union Army's 150 general hospitals, scat\u00ad tered about the North and West and in some areas of the South and staffed largely by contract surgeons, were not achieving the record for healthfulness that had been hoped for. Although 400 stewards, 300 ward masters, 6,051 male and female nurses, 3,025 laundresses, and 2,017 cooks served in general hospitals , many of these institutions were still filthy. Dirt, soiled dressings, and old clothing might be under the beds in wards that seemed clean. Bath\u00ad rooms and tubs sometimes served as tem\u00ad porary repositories for \"every uncleansed or unemptied chamber vessel, of soiled and offensive linen, and of every slop that a lazy nurse does not care to move.\" Laundries, kitchens, and mess rooms might be in a similar state, and hospital grounds could be littered with refuse and privies. Venti\u00ad lation was likely to be deficient despite Hammond 's efforts, principally because ar\u00ad chitects valued warmth above fresh air.\" I}Ltr, William J.

The death rate from disease had increased even more markedly, from 2.4 percent a year in the earlier period to 5.0 percent from July 1861 through June 1862. Among the more common diseases was diarrhea, with over 200,000 cases re\u00ad corded for the year starting July 1861. Phy\u00ad sicians found it difficult to estimate the number of deaths from this source, how\u00ad ever, since diarrhea often coexisted with other illnesses. Measles affiicted almost 22,000 in that period, causing 511 deaths. Figures for such problems as typhus, ty\u00ad phoid fever, malaria, and other fevers as well as for scurvy were unreliable, not only because one victim might have mUltiple diseases but also because physicians could not always distinguish one fever from an\u00ad other. Almost 24,000 cases of venereal dis\u00ad ease appeared, although the author of one journal article noted that very few patients came from commands where lieutenants were \"vigilant and sober.\" The U.S. Sani\u00ad tary Commission blamed the Army diet for scurvy. One authorit y suggested that scurvy had become a major Army problem when he maintained that the Commission could best promote the Army's health \"by resorting to measures that shall insure a sufficient supply of antiscorbutic vegeta\u00ad bles and antiscorbutic care.\"17 Because of the sick rate and the growing Appointments of OUf Military Hospitals,\" American l'vledical Times 5 (1862):24; SlIrgical JOllrnal Harris, The Sallilary Commission (Boston: Crosby & Nichols, 1864), Hunter, Tlte Vniled Stales Sanitary Commission, p. 30. numbers of wounded, the strain on the Medical Department's supply system in\u00ad creased too rapidly for Hammond to hope to function without the aid of the U.S. San\u00ad itary Commission and similar agencies. Congress eased his work by removing some of the red tape that restricted the ability of the purveyors to keep up with demand. Hammond revised the supply table so that it continued to reflect current usage and established large depots at Baltimore, Maryland; Fort Monroe, Virginia; Wash\u00ad ington, Missouri; and Nashville, Tennessee. Dis\u00ad tribution in the field was handled from field depots, but buying was still handled principally from New York City and Phil\u00ad adelphia. Although urgent need still led to the occasional purchase of items that proved to be poor, the difficulties he was experiencing in keeping up with demand did not keep Hammond from obtaining Stanton's approval ofa plan to supply med\u00ad icines to any families of volunteers that were totally indigent. In July Congress voted $15,000 for the purchase of artificial arms and legs for both soldiers and seamen, and made the Army Medical Department responsible for determining the models to be used. Hammond was interested in qual\u00ad ity as well as quantity, and his efforts to improve the equipment used by physicians in the field also led to the development of two new designs for medical knapsacks.\" Among Hammond's other successes were two of long-range rather than imme\u00ad diate significance, the establishment of the ISLtr, Hammond to Baird (29 Nov (857), RU SGO to (28 Apr 1862), RG 112, entry 2, 30:30 I; John E.

Early in his tenure as head of the depart\u00ad ment he urged that his subordinates send in specimens both of human tissue and of the foreign bodies, such as shell fragments or bullets, found in wounds. He appointed two men to assist in collecting information and specimens for the history and for the medical museum. Although Stanton suc\u00ad ceeded in thwarting Hammond 's desire to create a formal medical library in associ\u00ad ation with the museum, the Surgeon Gen\u00ad eral's Office continued to add to this collection of books on an informal basis until 1867 when the first librarian was appointed. \" As the new chief of the Medical Depart\u00ad ment, Hammond was full of energy and confidence in 1862. Before he had been in office a month, he was going out of his way to express to the medical directors of major armies his confidence in them. He wished them to feel assured of his support in tak\u00ad ing the initiative in solving the problems they encountered . He was obviously more willing to delegate authority than his two immediate predecessors had been and de\u00ad sired that his medical directors exercise considerab le independence in determining their own needs without directions from him. Rather than control the Washington complex of hospitals personall y, as Finley twice attempted to do, Hammond made I'>Srnith, \"Hammond,\" pp. 18,29. Surgeon Jonathan Letterman medical di\u00ad rector for the capital area. Realizing that the control of both field and general hos\u00ad pitals in an area or for an army might be too much for one man, he began to divide these responsibilities , having one director, for example, for each of the major cities in the East where large numbers of ArmY pa\u00ad tients were cared for and yet another for each army in the East.20 Care of the Sick and Wounded in the East In early 1862, a visitor inspecting Gen\u00ad eral McClellan's Army of the Potomac, the principal army in the East, was pleased with what he saw. Physicians appeared to be both competent and hard working, camps were neat and orderly, drainage was good, and tents were warm, although their poor ventilation caused him some distress. The general hospitals serving the Army of the Potomac, of which there were ten in mid-March , needed little in the way of im\u00ad provement, in his view, and he found the competence of the nurses, both male and female, to be particularly worthy of notice. In view of such reports, Medical Director Charles Tripier believed with some justi\u00ad fication that his attempt to bring order into the medical support of the Army of the Po\u00ad tomac was at least partially successful. \" In March Tripier was apparently confi\u00ad dent of his own ability to deal with the de\u00ad mands of the upcoming campaign. He sent all the sick except for convalescents to gen\u00ad eral hospitals , a necessary move that placed a considerab le burden upon the facilities l\u00b0Ltrs, Hammond to TripIer (2 May 1862) and SGO to McDouga ll (12 May 1862). both in RG 112, entry 12,30:335 and 408, respectively. l'L., \"Sanitary Condition of the Army of the Po\u00ad tomac,\" and \"Corresponde nce,\" both in American Medical Times 4 (1862):45-46 and 214, respectively.

To relieve the strain, he took over the bar\u00ad racks left vacant as McClellan's army moved south. Unfortunately, much modi\u00ad fication was necessary to make these build\u00ad ings suitable for this use: they were poorly arranged, their ventilation was haphazard, their ceilings low. Their Ooors often showed wide cracks; they lacked appropri\u00ad ate space for laundry and kitchen; and their sites were frequently filthy. The two newly built hospitals in Washington were com\u00ad pleted in time to assume some of the bur\u00ad den, but the number of patients was soon so large that tents had to be erected on the grounds of the new institutions to care for the overflow\" The continued establishment of facilities \"MSH I, app.:52 and pI. 3:908-09, 920. 186 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 more removed from the battlefield, includ\u00ad ing those at Philadelphia and New York, relieved the situation in hospitals in the Washington area to some degree, as did the creation of temporary general hospitals near the battlefield. The more permanent facilities were often quite large; New York institutions, according to the surgeon gen\u00ad eral's annual report of November 1862, held almost 5,000 patients and those of Philadelphia , 5,500.23 TripIer began laying plans for the care of sick and wounded in the field before McClellan opened his campaign against Richmond. He prepared instructions for his surgeons about the establishment of what he called \"field depots,\" the organi\u00ad zation of the medical officers to serve in them, the proper method of dealing with the wounded , and the way in which am\u00ad bulances were to be divided up and used. A shortage of ambulances , however, inter\u00ad fered with the operation of TripIer's mod\u00ad est ambulance corps. Although he repeatedly attempted to acquire more ve\u00ad hicles, the Quartermaster 's Departm ent sent him only a few, and many of these were two-wheeler s, which TripIer regarded as \"good for nothing.\" He also attempted to obtain all the supplies that he anticipated needing. Unfortunate ly, just when Mc\u00ad Clellan's forces were beginning their move by water toward the peninsula between the York and James rivers, Surgeon General Finley announced that, as ordered by the secretary of war on 7 April, he was resum\u00ad ing personal control over all general hos\u00ad pitals. TripIer was to leave behind his purveyor and some of his supplies, thus lJ\"Army Medical [ntelligence\" and \"Medical Af\u00ad fairs,\" both 2-4; MSH I, pI. 3:908, 932-33, 935, 989. starting the new campaign season with only part of what he needed and the hope that the rest would be forwarded to him from New York City by the time he needed it. 24 The tendency of many regimental sur\u00ad geons early in the campaign to abandon supplies rather than to move them exac\u00ad erbated TripIer's supply problem, since the officers then turned to the purveyor for re\u00ad placements. The tents belonging to some units, furthermore, were inexplicably left behind in Alexandria, making more diffi\u00ad cult the establishment offield hospitals, es\u00ad pecially since on the peninsula buildings suitable for hospital use were few. (Map 6) Pilfering and carelessness during shipment reduced the amount of supplies actually re\u00ad ceived, and late shipments resulting from the low priority given Medical Departm ent supplies by the quartermaster only made matters worse. TripIer's request in April 1862 that \"an experienced quartermaster and assistant commissary of subsistence be attached to the command of the Chief Medical Officer of an army in the field\" came to naught, and TripIer began pro\u00ad testing \"beforehand against the Medical Department being held responsible for evils they have no possible means of obviating .\"\" During the Peninsular campaign , an ex\u00ad tremely high rate of disease, sometimes called Chickahominy fever, probably either a combination of typhoid and malaria or typhoid alone, made the supply shortages even more critical. TripIer determined, therefore, to reduce the number of patients for whom he was responsib le at anyone time by evacuating them as quickly as pos\u00ad sible. He made every effort to send both 24Quote from MSH I, app.:63.

Because the facilities at Fort Monroe were limited, many wounded were sent north to Washington, Baltimore , and Annapolis, Maryland, or even further. It was expensive , however, to ship those with slight wounds or self-limiting diseases north only to have to return them south again when they were ready to rejoin their units, and despite the efforts of both the Quartermaster's Department and the U.S. Sanitary Commission , few adequately equipped river or ocean steamers were available for the final leg of the journey. On occasion, furthermore, the water was so shallow that the transport s could not come close to shore, and Tripier was forced to act on his own to line up whatever shal\u00ad low draft vessels he could find to take his patients out to the steamers .'6 The lack of discipline that characterized so many Union soldiers contributed to Tripier's problems. On one occasion at White House, on the Pamunkey River in Virginia, the 150 men assigned to pitch hospital tents worked so slowly that two days were required to erect thirty-four. On a number of occasions, furthermore , able\u00ad bodied soldiers eager to escape the horrors of the campaign swarmed aboard trains and steamers taking the sick and wounded north, displacing those entitled to evacu\u00ad ation. Once when Tripier insisted upon checking candidates for evacuation care\u00ad fully, a gang of stragglers rushed aboard a vessel that was only half-load ed and re\u00ad fused to get off. Regimental officers who, Tripier believed, could have prevented this disorder did not do so. He finally decioed to reduce the effects of this particular prob- 26Ltrs, SGO to Cuyler (II Apr 1862), Wood to M. C.

He ordered more hospital space at Yorktown and Williams\u00ad burg to house the ill from White House and asked for more medical officers. By mid\u00ad June, only half the tents he had requested a month earlier had arri ved; and many of these could not be sent to Yorktown be\u00ad cause they were needed for field hospitals nearer the battlefield. Tripier was thus forced to use some vessels as floating hos\u00ad pitals and to continue the evacuation of the sick as well as the wounded, and with them, inevitably, stragglers, north by steamer. 27 Even moving the sick and wounded as far as the riverbank was no easy task. Am\u00ad bulances were scarce. Hospital attendants were increasin gly busy working in hospi\u00ad tals. Band members were often too fright\u00ad ened to venture near the battlefield. Tripier had no control over trains that brought some of the wounded to the waterfront, and the enemy often cut the lines. As a result of these difficulties, severely injured men sometimes lay for twenty-four or even forty-eight hours on muddy, hot battle\u00ad fields before they were collected, and then were left waiting in the rain for hours at a railroad depot without shelter, food, or water. Since the army was often in retreat, the wounded who could not walk also faced the possibility of capture. As the situation on the peninsula dete\u00ad riorated, Hammond became increasingly uneasy about Tripier's ability to deal with the demands placed upon the Medical De\u00ad partment there. In encouraging Tripier to act decisively on his own, the new surgeon general had reassured him early in May that all the department's resources were be\u00ad hind him and that he had only to let the department know his needs. By mid-May, however, Tripier was approaching frenzy. \"Ltr, Triplerto SG (30 Apr 1862), RG 112, entry 12. THE CIVIL WAR IN 1862: LEARNING ON THE JOB 189 He was trying frantica lly to acquire the nec\u00ad essary transportation for his patients on both land and water and to arrange for the necessary hospital facilities and for sub\u00ad sistence. He pointed out to Hammond that the problems that took all his time and en\u00ad ergy lay properly within the purview of the Quartermaster 's and Subsistence Depart\u00ad ments. He repeatedly begged Hammond for aid and predicted dire consequences if he did not receive it at once. Delays in the delivery of supplies were \"producing frightful results,\" he telegraphed Ham\u00ad mond on 18 May, while he added in an\u00ad other telegram the same day that the medical staff was \"all nearly exhausted. \"\" Hammond obviously sympathized with Tripier's predicament and pushed to obtain ambulances and steamers from the Quar\u00ad termaster's Department and to fill other re\u00ad quests as rapidly as possible. His answer to Tripier's complaints , however, implied that Tripier was not doing all he could to help himself. He had already been granted, for example, the authority to do on his own many of the things he was now requesting permission to do. In addition, he had not worked as closely with General McClellan as Hammond believed he should. The sur\u00ad geon general also pointed out that Tripier must accept the fact that the Medical De\u00ad partment could not always meet all his needs. Hammond obtained control over steamers from the quarterma ster in June and at last, presumably concluding that Tripier could no longer cope with the sit\u00ad uation alone, sent two surgeons to the pen\u00ad insula with orders to organize the evacuation of the sick and the management 28QUotcs from Tclg, Tripier to Hammond (18 May (862), RG 112, entry 12; Ltrs, Hammond to Tripier (2 and 8 May 1862), both in RG 112, entry 2, 30:335 and 382, respectively ; Telg, Tripier to Hammond (9 May 1862), RG 112, entry 12. of transports. He then gave Tripier specific instructions concerning the abandonment of several unhealthy hospitals and the es\u00ad tablishment of others to replace them.\" Nevertheless, as the end of June ap\u00ad proached, confusion ruled at White House. The wounded continued to arrive in great numbers , communications were poor and then finally nonexistent, few tents were available, and no more could be obtained . Patients filled the shelters and spilled out onto the lawn. On 28 June when the evac\u00ad uation south to Harrison's Landing on the James River began, Tripier had to order more than 600 wounded abandoned to the enemy because he had so few ambulances, although he left behind surgeons who vol\u00ad unteered to stay with them, supplies, sub\u00ad sistence, and nurses. At Harrison's Landing in the first days of July patients lay in the open, without tents or shelter of any kind. Dysentery , diarrhea, malaria, scurvy, and typhoid fever raged unabated. On I July the rain was once again deluging the sick and wounded when Jonathan Letterman arrived from Washington to relieve the de\u00ad feated Tripler.'o Although Tripier may well have done all he could in the situation, George Temple\u00ad ton Strong of the U.S. Sanitary Commis\u00ad sion believed that he had been proved totally incompet ent. Strong held that Trip\u00ad Ier and his staff were entirely responsible for the sufferings of Union soldiers in Vir\u00ad ginia, and Congress apparently agreed with Strong.

Ham\u00ad mond, however, did not openly blame Trip\u00ad Ier. Indeed, he showed considerable compassion when he learned of the Sen\u00ad ate's action and received Tripier's request to be relieved. He asked his former superior to name the position he wanted north of the Potomac or along the Ohio River, and when Tripier asked for the post at Detroit, it was his.31 A most difficult situation had crushed a man of modest talent. When circumstances permitted him to exercise his administra\u00ad tive talents to their fullest, Tripier func\u00ad tioned well. His toleration for frustration, however, was low, and he had little ability to make the best of bad conditions. In the Peninsular campaign he knew that if the requirement s for ambulances, tents, trans\u00ad ports, and supplies were not met, the con\u00ad sequences might be horrible. Having been frustrated by Finley when he attempted to prepare adequatel y for the upcoming cam\u00ad paign, Tripier was unable to accept the fact that Hammond could not at once make everything right. Preoccupied by his in\u00ad ability to prevent the disaster he knew was coming, Tripier failed to seize the available opportunities to prevent a further deteri\u00ad oration. Although Letterman bore no re\u00ad sponsibilit y for the management of the sick and wounded in the peninsula, after he be\u00ad came familiar with the situation at Harri\u00ad son's Landing, he too concluded that the Medical Department should not be blamed. Tripier was not responsib le for the disaster; the worst that could be said, per- l'Strong, Diary, pp. 222, 230. 2300; Tclg, Hammond to Tripier (20 Jun 1862) and Ltrs, Hammond to Trip\u00ad Ier and to L.

Time, however, was on his side. The new medical director had to face all the frustrations resulting from his limited control over the steamers that evacuated his patients; although he could direct their activities when they were evacuating patients, he could not prevent their diversion, even at critical moments , to other uses. Thus he could only watch while vessels he needed were taken over to move Confederate prisoners. But with the arrival of more transports, outfitted at Hammond's order to carry the sick and wounded , and of some of the 100 tents and 200 ambulances that the beleaguered Trip\u00ad Ier had vainly urged Hammond to send, the situation on the James River eased. Pa\u00ad tients could now be shipped to hospitals in the North and in the Fort Monroe area, and those who remained could be put under shelter. Letterman was then able to look beyond the immediate situation and to im\u00ad plement his plans for the future.\" Lettermen had apparently already for\u00ad mulated plans to improve the efficiency of the Medical Department, and in this he had the support of both Hammond and McClellan. McClellan had discussed the possibility of devising such a scheme per\u00ad sonally with Stanton and had received the permission of the secretary of war to for\u00ad malize it. On 2 August, the general issued an order putting Letterman 's formula into )~Te lg, Letterman to Hammond (29 Jul 1862), RG I [2, entry 12.

On 21 August, McClellan forwarded Letterman's plan to Stanton for approval to put it into effect throughout the Union Army, but eight days later Stanton rejected it, noting it would only \"increase the expenses and immobil\u00ad ity of our army ... without any corre\u00ad sponding advantages,\" an opinion Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck echoed less than three weeks later. As a result, just at the time that Letterman was beginning to move ahead with his plan within the Army of the Potomac, he learned that both the secretary of war and the general in chief of the Union Army thorough ly disapproved of it.\" Letterman's plan specified that two men and a driver, plus two stretchers, be on board each ambulance. Each regiment would be supplied with two light two-horse ambulances , and each corps another two, to provide evacuation from field to depot. Four-horse vehicles carried patients back to field hospitals and beyond. Letterman called for the organization of ambulances and their attendants by Army corps, with a captain in charge at the corps level, a first lieutenant at the division level, and so on down the line, with a sergeant directing the ambulances at the regimenta l level. The ambulance corps captain, though a line of\u00ad ficer, reported to the medical director, an innovation that caused less comment than might have been expected, in view of the long history of controversy concerning the command relationship of medical and line officers. Those named to man the ambu\u00ad lances were neither teamsters nor band members , nor even hospital attendants HQuote from MSH 2, pI. 3:934. who might be called away just when they were most needed. They were soldiers per\u00ad manently detailed from the ranks for am\u00ad bulance work. Commanders were required to order only \"active and efficient\" men to serve with the ambulan ce corps, and all the men of the new organization were to be regularly and carefully drilled in their new duties. Although medical officers from each division accompanied every ambu\u00ad lance train, ambulance corps officers han\u00ad dled all administrative matters. By creating a permanent, disciplined, and professiona l ambulance corps, Letterman guaranteed more efficient evacuation and because sur\u00ad geons and attendants were no longer re\u00ad sponsible for transporting patients, better hospital care for the sick and wounded.\" While Letterman worked out his plans for the ambulance corps, the medical staff of the Army of Virginia under Maj. Gen. John Pope faced difficulties similar to those that Letterman and Tripier had en\u00ad countered in McClellan 's Army of the Po\u00ad tomac. Although disease was not as great a problem in Pope's command as it had been on the peninsula and the weather re\u00ad mained good, problems involving evacu\u00ad ation overwhe lmed the Medical Department during and after the Second Battle of Bull Run in late August. Ambu\u00ad lances were scarce and attendants and driv\u00ad ers, except for those sent from McClellan's army to reinforce Pope in August, un\u00ad trained and undisciplined . Rail lines that were to have been used to evacuate the wounded from the battlefield were cut, and the patient load became too great for the field hospitals of the area. Those unable to walk lay by the thousands on the ground for twenty-four and more hours unat\u00ad tended. While surgeons worked out the truce that would permit their removal, HMSN 2, pt. 3:933-34, quote from p.936. 192 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 stragglers and the slightly wounded man\u00ad aged to be evacuated before their less for\u00ad tunate comrades. \" Once again, the entire system was not prepared for the more than 8,000 casualties that flooded in upon it. Pope's medical staff was too small, and the general hos\u00ad pitals at Alexandria were thrown into con\u00ad fusion in early September as casualties began to come in. Realizing , perhaps, from TripIer's experiences that it was extremely difficult for one man to manage medical care and all stages of evacuation as well, Hammond appointed John Brinton to the new position of medical director of trans\u00ad portation , to supervise the movement of the wounded to Alexandria and between hospitals in that city. During and after Second Manassas , Pope's medical director, Thomas Mc\u00ad Parlin, tried two new approaches to the old, familiar problems. In his desire to achieve greater efficiency in the managemen t of field hospitals, McPariin attempted to take centralization to its ultimate conclusion by locating all field operations in one area. But because a single facility could not be con\u00ad venient for medical officers scattered about a large area, surgeons tended to render more care on the battlefield, and the amount of time they spent away from the central hospital left it undermanned. McParlin's attempt to improve the effi\u00ad ciency of medical supply by leaving the items he needed on the railroad cars that brought them and by keeping those cars on conveniently located sidings was thwarted. The cars were so overcrowded that it was impossible to allow any to be left standing for storage and the enemy could cut rail lines so that trains could not get through. l6Unless otherwise indicated , all information about the medical care given the Army of Virginia is based on Brinton, Memoirs, pp. 196-201; Duncan, Medical Depanmenr. pt. 3; and MSN 1, app.:I08-29. Triggered by Lee's invasion of Maryland in September , the renewal of the conflict brought together the men who had fought in the previously separate forces of the Armies of the Potomac and of Virginia. Letterman was the medical director of the newly enlarged Army of the Potomac. Al\u00ad though by this point his ambulance corps was a month old, ambulances and medical supplies had to be left behind because of the speed with which McClellan wished to move. The presence of units from Pope's force that had not been introduced to the new system also kept the battles in Mary\u00ad land from providing Letterman 's concept with a true test. The medical director or\u00ad dered that ambulances and supplies be sent on to Frederick, Maryland, as soon as they became available , but delivery proved to be exceedingly difficult because the Confed\u00ad erates had destroyed the railroad bridge over the Monocacy River near Frederick. All supplies sent by rail had to be unloaded at that point, with much confusion and de\u00ad lay resulting. Fortunately, ambulances be\u00ad gan to arrive just before the Army of the Potomac reached Frederick , and the U.S. Sanitary Commissio n, which had its own means of transportation , provided inval\u00ad uable help with supply.\" Discipline remained poor throughout the army, however, and despite Letter\u00ad man's efforts, critics charged that the am\u00ad bulance service at Antietam was characterized by \"gross mismanagement and inefficiency, ... lack of system and control\" during the battle.

How many of the dif\u00ad ficulties related to the presence of the still untrained attendants and drivers from the units that formed Pope's army cannot be ascertained. The wounded were, in any event, finally evacuated to Frederick , and in many cases, beyond to Washington, Bal\u00ad timore, and the north.38 His experiences with the problems of supply, and perhaps those of the unfortu\u00ad nate Tripier as well, led Letterma n to con\u00ad clude that 'a change in the pattern of distribution would reduce losses when troops were on the move. As a result, he decided in October that, from that time on, supplies would be issued by brigade and doled out to the individual regiments as needed. It would thus be 'almost impossible for large amounts of medicines, bandages , and hospital stores to be casually aban\u00ad doned every time a regiment moved. His experience in Maryland also led Letterman to issue general instructions to govern the management of a field hospital system, which he preferred to have organized by division, guaranteeing that each physician would know precisely what his assignment was.

(Courtesy oj Na\u00ad lional Library oj Medicine.) The value of Letterman's system and the competence of his work under very unfa\u00ad vorable circumstances were most clearly demonstrated in the disastrous battle of Fredericksburg , Virginia, in mid\u00ad December 1862. Despite all difficulti es, the management of the wounded during this engagement was one of the first Medical Department successes in the Civil War. The attempt by McClellan's successor, Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, to defeat and confusing. What Tripier referred to as a field de\u00ad pot was directed by a surgeon. The function that had been performed by the regimental hospital was after 1861 usually handled at the brigade, the division, or occasionally the corps level. These field hospitals re\u00ad sembled the old general hospitals because they took in patients from more than one regiment, but, unlike general hospitals, they were moved with the units they served. Some of the less permanent general hospitals might now be called evacuation hospitals. 194 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 the Confederates was a bloody and spec\u00ad tacular failure, but Letterman had ready near the scene of the battle the tents, am\u00ad bulances, and other equipment and sup\u00ad plies that would be needed. He had trained the men who were responsible for the care of the wounded and for their evacuation from the battlefield. Three ambulances , each with two stretchers, two attendants , and a driver as well as two hospital tents, were available for each regiment. Stretcher\u00ad bearers were instructed exactly where to bring the wounded to meet the ambulances that would take them to the field hospitals. Despite the difficulties involved in mov\u00ad ing casualties under fire, evacuation from the battlefield to field hospitals went well, but Letterman's management of supply and of the final stage of evacuation left him vulnerable to criticism . He did not easily delegate authority, and without a commis\u00ad sary to manage the depot, supply problems engendered by the unexpectedly high cas\u00ad ualty rate grew. The Sanitary Commission filled the gap once more with food, blan\u00ad kets, warm underwear , and other items, and evaluated the work of the Medical De\u00ad partment at Fredericksburg as \"admira\u00ad ble.\" Both Walt Whitman , who worked as a nurse with the wounded from Freder\u00ad icksburg, and the new inspector general, Thomas Perley, were highly critical of the last stage of the evacuation , but neither was in a position to understand the problems Letterman faced. In addition, Perley was a man of dubious reputation and indebted for his position to Stanton, so that his crit\u00ad icism of the Medical Department might have been motivated by self interest.'o Letterman could not have anticipated that Burnside would order all of his 9,000 4OQuote from Edmund Andress, Complete Record of the Surgery Brinton, Memoirs, pp 215, 220. wounded, regardless of their condition , moved from the Fredericksburg area; as medical director he had planned to keep the most seriously hurt where they were. Thus he cannot be held responsible for the horrors that were said to have resulted from journeys made on open railroad cars and long waits for steamers that were also de\u00ad void of accommodations for the wounded . Although he did anticipate problems with stragglers and malingerers , he was appar\u00ad ently unable to find guards competent enough to keep them from climbing aboard trains for a free ride to Aquia. It was these men, Letterman maintained , who, finding no shelter at Aquia, began to send up loud complaints about the inhumanity of the Medical Department. Although surgeons did not have to man\u00ad age the evacuation of large numbers of cas\u00ad ualties, those in charge of hospitals serving small units in the East faced some of the same problems that confronted McParlin, Tripier, and Letterman. The men holding coastal areas of the south often suffered from the high disease rates characteristic of these areas, and the surgeons with them could not always locate buildings easily adapted for use as hospitals . In western Maryland and Virginia, some problems ex\u00ad perienced by the troops serving under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks resulted from the fact that they apparently received little at\u00ad tention from the Medical Department in the early months of the year. Although much illness occurred among the men serv\u00ad ing near Cumberland, Maryland , for ex\u00ad ample, Tripier was apparently unaware of their existence for some time, and supplies there and in the Winchester area were inadequate. \" \"MSH I, app.:228-29, 234-36, 243-44, 246; Ltr, SGO to William Apr 1862), RG 112, entry 2, 30:145; Steiner Report, Ms C19, NLM; \"Army Medical Intelligence,\" American Medical Times 4 THE CIVIL WAR IN 1862: LEARNING ON THE JOB 195 Care of the Sick and Wounded in the West West of the Appalachians the Medical Department experienced many of the same problems that it encountered in the East. For the Medical Department , the principal difference between the East and the West lay in the character of the chain of evacu\u00ad ation from field hospitals to general hos\u00ad pitals. In the East, where the navigable portions of the rivers ran east and west, patients were most often moved to the north or northeast from the battlefield , as water transportation was not always feas\u00ad ible. In the West, however, the existence of a widespread network of rivers running both east and west and north and south made it possible to rely on large-scale evac\u00ad uation by water, and fluctuating loyalties and battle lines made rail lines especially vulnerable. Many of the hospital steamers that plied the principal rivers of the mid\u00ad west could carry 200 to 600 patients or more. They were equipped, manned, and even chartered by one of the sanitary com\u00ad missions or by a state organization, but Surgeon General Hammond controlled their use. Because of the extensive system of rivers, major hospitals could be located at sites as widely separated as St. Louis, Missouri, and Cincinnati , Ohio, and could shelter patients from battlefields hundreds of miles away.\" Although in Louisville and Cincinnati combined, the patient load was almost 3,500 in late 1862, the largest number cared for in the river cities of the midwest (1862): 129; Walker DeBlois Briggs, Civil War Surgeon ill a Colored Regime1ll (Berkeley: University of Cali\u00ad fornia Press, 1860), p. , Hammond to McDougall (22 May 1862), RG 112, entry 2, 30:496; Sanitary Commission, pp. 42-46; Maxwell, Sanitary Commis\u00ad SiOl/, p. 121. could still be found in St. Louis. Hospitals in the city itself in the autumn of 1862 held over 2,700 patients, while another 1,000 were sheltered at the nearby Jefferson Bar\u00ad racks. This building, unlike those upon which Tripier had to rely on in Washington in the spring of the year, was considered excellent for the purpose. It had piazzas and shaded walks for the patients, and its rooms were large and well ventilated. In time new buildings were erected at the Jef\u00ad ferson Barracks , increasing its capacity by 2,500. Benton Barracks and the marine hospital within the city were also taken over in the spring of 1862, but demand con\u00ad tinued to exceed capacity. The Western Sanitary Commission deplored what it re\u00ad garded as the crowding of the city's general hospitals , which it blamed for high death rates from typhoid fever and erysipelas'\" Most of the patients in the general hos\u00ad pitals of the midwest came from the armies of Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans , and Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell. Unlike McClellan in Virginia, Buell, headquartered in Louisville, Ken\u00ad tucky, appeared indifferent to the welfare of his sick and wounded. His regimental surgeons were few, averaging about three for every two regiments , many physicians having either fallen ill or resigned. Twelve percent of Buell's men remained in Ken\u00ad tucky because they were ill when his army moved. His medical director, Robert Mur\u00ad ray, was forced to establish hospitals along the army's line of march to care for the large numbers who fell ill along the way. Ambulances were so few that the sick could not be carried far, and the two-wheeled type disintegrated on the rough roads of the West. Bedding and medicines were scarce ~lForman . Weslem Sanirary ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 and Buell begrudged the assignment of healthy soldiers to serve as nurses for their ailing comrades , so that little for the care and comfort of these unfortunates could be left behind.\" Despite Buell's lack of concern for his sick, Murray was able to gain his consent for the establishment of a convalescent camp for 1,000 near Elizabethtown, Ken\u00ad tucky, a town located along the railroad that connected Nashville with Louisville, enabling these men easily to rejoin their units. Murray also set up a hospital at Eliz\u00ad abethtown , although whether the convales\u00ad cents were used to nurse the sick there, an arrangement Buell favored, is not known.\" The medical director for Grant's Army of the Tennessee was fortunate in having a commander more sympatheti c to the prob\u00ad lems of the Medical Departm ent than Buell, but he, too, faced high disease rates. Supplies were short and, because of \"irreg\u00ad ularities in the quartermaster 's depart\u00ad ment ... in the District of Cairo,\" ambulances and hospital tents for Grant's army were even harder to obtain than they were for other armies. No buildings suit\u00ad able for large hospitals were found along the line of march, and the army was soon far from its supply bases. The two-wheeled ambulances that composed half of the force's allotment once again proved too fragile for the uses to which they were put, and although each regiment apparently had its full quota of medical officers, even this number was not enough to care for men in malaria-ridden country under the pro\u00ad longed stress that characterized Grant's 44MSH I, app.:23; Ltr, Murray to Finley (22 112, entry 12; usse, Sanitary Memoirs , p. 55; U.S. Army, Surgeon General's Office, Medical History of the Army of the Ohio and the Cumberland, 1862, Ms C125, p. 5, campaign against Fort Henry and Fort Donelson.\" In the West, as in the East, the respon\u00ad sibility for general hospitals and that for field hospitals were often assigned to dif\u00ad ferent men. As a result, Grant's senior sur\u00ad geon, James Simons, as well as the medical officer who sometimes acted in Simons' stead, John Brinton, often remained in the north at Cairo, Illinois, while Henry Hewit, a volunteer surgeon, accompanied Grant and served as his medical director in the field. Hewit sent one surgeon with each reg\u00ad iment into battle, ready to render whatever immediate care might prove necessary. The regimental medical officer then sent the wounded back to a depot where ambu\u00ad lances could meet them. From these de\u00ad pots, the wounded were taken to large hospitals established out of the line of fire in whatever buildings were available and if necessary in tents, Hewit's main problem being the lack of suitable shelter. Hewit also formed ambulance trains, each man\u00ad aged by a noncommissioned officer. Al\u00ad though his arrogance and rough manners alienated U.S. Sanitary Commission offi\u00ad cers, his system, an unsophisticated ver\u00ad sion of that later devised by Letterman in the East, apparently worked well, even when snow and sleet fell upon the battle\u00ad field. Within several days of the struggle for Fort Donelson in February, and appar\u00ad ently after a period of neglect, the wounded were shipped by steamer to the Cumber\u00ad land River and thence to general hospitals at Mound City, Illinois, and Paducah, Ken\u00ad tucky, as well as at Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Louisville . The troops remaining in the field soon began to succumb to stress and disease, and those stricken with dysentery, 46Unless otherwise indicated , all material on Fts.

The men were packed closely together, and many apparently remained on board for some time after their arrival at their des\u00ad tination. As a result of the long confine\u00ad ment in close quarters, a typhoid fever epidemic struck, and many died. Supplies of medicine s and hospital space ran short, and hospital tents could not be found.

Grant ordered Brinton to travel to St. Louis to see whether he could obtain more vessels. \"After some delays,\" Brinton reported, he \"succeeded in procuring other steamers, the first of the noble hospital fleet of the western waters.\"\" By the time the Confederate forces at\u00ad tacked Grant's army at Shiloh on 6 April, a \"prolific diarrhea that resisted obsti\u00ad nately the ordinary therapeutic means\" had added to the amictions of his men. In combination with malaria, this ailment, which was blamed on the water of the Ten\u00ad nessee River, greatly weakened many of Grant's soldiers. The nature of the battle, <4'Quote from MSfI I, app.:29; sec also MSH 2, pI. 3:971. 198 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 furthermore, made prompt and proper care of the sick and wounded extremely diffi\u00ad cult, for in overrunning the Union camp, the enemy made off with the medical sup\u00ad plies, stretchers, and ambulances they found there. No shelter was available to protect the wounded from a heavy rain, bedding was nonexistent , and food supplies were low. Neverthe less, medical officers made the best use of what they could find, while sending a \"pitiful telegram\" to the newly installed Surgeon General Ham\u00ad mond asking for help. The reply they re\u00ad ceived the next morning promised 10,000 mattresses which, unlike the items re\u00ad quested by TripIer Peninsular campaign, \"came with wonderfu l quick\u00ad ness.\" Grant ordered that all tents in his army be taken over for the use of the wounded, and at least one surgeon made wholesale use of captured tents for his pa\u00ad tients. Hewit, as Letterman would do sev\u00ad eral months later, appointed his most skilled surgeons to conduct all operations . Steamers, including the tleet provided by the U.S. Sanitary Commission, aided in evacuation , and Hewit ordered a medical officer to board each vessel and to perform en route further surgery as needed.\" When Buell's army arrived to aid Grant at Shiloh, his surgeons could offer little in the way of medical supplies to ease the ef\u00ad fects of the shortage. They had few of the needed items with them because they had moved so quickly. A few days after the bat\u00ad tle, however, the supply train arrived, along with \"constant stream of civilian surgeons , and sanitary commission agents, men and women,\" and a constant stream of the sick as well. Steamers took them off by the thou\u00ad sands, while three doctors at a nearby con- 49First quote, MSfl J, app.:29; second and third quotes, Brinton, Memoirs, p. 171; see also Maxwell, Sanitary Commission , p. 132, and Duncan, Medical Deparimelll , pt. 3, p. 4. valescent hospital screened those who appeared chronically ill before discharging them from the service. The work load of the medical officers at Shiloh began to di\u00ad minish only many days after battle.50 The spectacle of unnecessary suffering brought about by the lack of tents and med\u00ad ical supplies at Shiloh apparently did not impress General Buell with the need to give his medical director more support. Before the battle of Perryville, Kentucky , on 8 Oc\u00ad tober, for example, after Murray had care\u00ad fully acquired all the supplies needed for each regiment, Buell ordered that every\u00ad thing that could not be carried in one wagon per brigade be left behind. Since his men were not allowed to bring tents with them, none were available for use by sur\u00ad geons. The strain of the long march that preceded the battle was great, and illness took a heavy toll above and beyond that of the battle itself. After the contlict, Buell abandoned the sick, without tents, often without shelter of any kind, without blan\u00ad kets, without bedding. Supplies that had been ordered were inexplicably held up by the quartermaster and did not arri ve for two weeks. Thousands were ill wi th ty\u00ad phoid fever, erysipelas, measles, diarrhea, and dysentery , and only the prompt aid of the U.S. Sanitary Commission prevented an even greater disaster. When the sick and wounded could be moved, they were evac\u00ad uated, usually in empty wagon trains used by the commissary to carry stores.\" Major General William Rosecrans , who led the Army of the Misissipp i before suc\u00ad ceeding Buell in command of the Army of 50Quote from Sherman, Memoirs 1:246; Llrs, McDouga ll to Hammond (4 and 8 May 1862), both in RG 112, entry 12.

THE CIVIL WAR IN 1862: LEARNING ON THE JOB 199 the Cumberland in October, was a man more in Grant's mold than in Buell's. In Mississippi, at both the battie of Iuka on 19 September and that of Corinth in early October, the surgeons with his army were well supplied with all they needed, from tents to ambulances. The establishment of hospitals was easily managed and, accord\u00ad ing to his medical director, surgeon Eben Swift, the wounded received prompt and excellent care. Oddly enough, however, Swift also noted, without explanation but almost proudly, that patients wounded at Iuka received no anesthetic and that \"not a groan or sign of pain was heard.\" Even after the battie of Murfreesboro in Ten\u00ad nessee in late December, when the hospi\u00ad tals of the right wing, their wounded, and their supplies were captured , when the killed and wounded eventually numbered about 4,000, and when several surgeons de\u00ad serted, the ambulance corps \"worked ad\u00ad mirably\" under the system originally set up by Murray, and Swift was able to provide \"comfortabl e shelter for all.\"\" Although the engagements west of the Mississippi in 1862 did not become as fa\u00ad mous as the battles of Shiloh, Antietam, and Fredericksburg, two batties each re\u00ad sulted in at least 800 wounded. In March the battle of Pea Ridge in northwestern Ar\u00ad kansas left almost 1,000 injured, while in December about 800 were hurt in the strug\u00ad gle at nearby Prairie Grove. The surgeons involved faced the same problems as their counterparts east of the Mississippi, Sup\u00ad ply was particularly difficult. The end of the Pacific Railroad was in Rolla, Missouri, 240 miles from the battlefields in Arkan\u00ad sas, and Confederate raiders easily cut off supply wagons before they reached their destination. Buildings of a size adequate for hospital use were also hard to find, but SlQuotcs from MS/-/ I, app.:256. EBEN SWIFT. (Collrtesy of National Library of Medicine.) the lack of a network of deep rivers made evacuation to distant general hospitals dif\u00ad ficult. Because ambulances and wagons had to use rough roads, medical officers preferred not to move their patients far. The number of casualties forced surgeons to rely heavily on the Western Sanitary Commission for hospital supplies, bed\u00ad ding, and clothing after both battles, but by late December medicines , hospital stores, and ambulances were plentiful.\" Most of the casualties from the Arkansas battles remained west of the Mississippi, and at least one general hospital, near Las Vegas, New Mexico , was established to care for the wounded from military action in the Far West. This facility, established at a hot SJForman, Westerll Sanitary Commission, pp, 27-30, ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 spring a few miles from the town, served more as a shelter for convalescents than as a hospital because the seriously ill or wounded could not tolerate the long over\u00ad land trip necessary to reach it. When a few casualties from beyond the Mississippi ended up in general hospitals of the Mid\u00ad west, however, complaints arose because nurses were not always sent with the sick and wounded , and officers commanding units near the hospitals were thus forced to detail their own men to care for patients from other commands \" Conclusion The problems of the Medical Depart\u00ad ment were much the same in both the East and the West, and the solutions devised to deal with them were generally similar. The immediate care and evacuation of the wounded from the battlefield was every\u00ad where largely dependent upon the tide of battle. Patients could never be guaranteed speedy and efficient care, but medical di\u00ad rectors learned much in 1862 that helped HSherman, Memoirs 1:274; MS/-/l. app.:346-47. them devise a more effective chain of evac\u00ad uation from battlefield to general hospital. As line officers began to understand both the importance of speedy evacuation and efficient medical care and the nature of the problems facing the Medical Department , the significant progress already made in dealing with the administrative problems involved in evacuation would continue. Nevertheless, as the year came to a close, medical problems in the form of disease and infection were becoming increasingly insistent. The sick rate was three to five times that found in young civilian men be\u00ad cause as the Army expanded, ever larger numbers of men were being thrown to\u00ad gether under conditions of stress, inade\u00ad quate sanitation , and poor diet. Efficiency required centralization, and the sick and wounded would be crowded into hospitals that were increasing in size. As a result, the growing threat of typhoid, erysipelas, scurvy, and other forms of disease and in\u00ad fection cast ahead of it an ominous shadow as 1862 drew to a close\" 5'Jarvis, \"Sanitary Condition,\" p. 473. CHAPTER 10 The Civil War in 1863: Hammond's Last Year The appointment in 1862 of a vigorous, ambitious young medical officer as surgeon general and his encouragement of new ap\u00ad proaches to Medical Department problems held out great promise for 1863. Under the guidance of William Hammond the De\u00ad partment was already rapidly recovering from the initial shock inflicted by the Civil War's unprecedented demands and taking the steps necessary to evacuate and care for thousands of sick and wounded soldiers. Failing to appreciate the serious danger posed by his strained relationship with Sec\u00ad retary of War Stanton, Hammond appar\u00ad ently assumed that 1863 would be but the first full year of a long and successful career as surgeon general. Administration a/the Medical Department In spite of Hammond 's confidence, the surgeon general's position was already be\u00ad ginning to deteriorate in the spring of 1863. Stanton was quite willing to manipulate events to effect the surgeon general's de\u00ad parture from office, and Hammond played into Stanton's hands by his tactless man\u00ad agement of the explosive matter of the Ar\u00ad my's use of calomel and tartar emetic as medicines. Hammond considered these drugs too dangerous for everyday use, but his removal of both from the supply table in May caused a great furor, despite the fact that he did permit special requests for either drug when a need could be estab\u00ad lished. At least one surgeon maintained that he continued to use both items as be\u00ad fore. The clamor that Hammond's order caused thus seems out of proportion to the step taken, but the discussion of the matter ranged far and wide. Some agreed with the surgeon general and called his order \"ju\u00ad dicious, and even necessary,\" but many physicians were furious that Hammond would presume to tell other doctors what they could or could not prescribe. The po\u00ad tential for misuse was no excuse, they said, for barring tartar emetic and calomel from the supply table.' Hammond 's elimination of calomel and tartar emetic from the supply table prob\u00ad ably cost him supporters at a crucial time. His position was rapidly deteriorating as IQuote, \"Removal of Calomel and Tartar smith, \"How to Get Supplies for the Sick and Wounded of OUf Army,\" Sanitary Reporter I (1863):33; \"Calomel and Tartar (1863):299; H.

In the spring of the year, Stanton apparently refused to allow Ham\u00ad mond to travel west to investigate com\u00ad plaints about the work of the Medical Department there. In the summer, after ap\u00ad pointing a commission headed by one of Hammond 's personal enemies to investi\u00ad gate the department, the secretary of war relieved Hammond of his duties as surgeon general and sent him on an inspection tour to the South and West, appointing Joseph K. Barnes, who would be the next surgeon general, to act as head of the Med\u00ad ical Department. Barnes formed a close friendship with Stanton shortly after re\u00ad porting for duty in Washington in mid- 1862 and had already received two pro\u00ad motions in 1863.' When Hammond set out on his journey in September, Stanton was almost omi\u00ad nously cordial. In early December, the Sec\u00ad retary of War found grounds for reprimanding Hammond , who responded not by resigning under fire, as his prede\u00ad cessor had done, but by asking for either a court-martial or a board of inquiry. He also asked for permission to return to Wash\u00ad ington, where Stanton had, in Hammond's absence, been working to end his tenure as surgeon general. Stanton denied the re\u00ad quest, but Hammond's health produced a solution to his problem, as it had in 1860.

J Under the circumstances, it is not sur\u00ad prising that Hammond's relationship with Stanton continued to affect adversely some of the surgeon general's favorite projects. Even though, early in 1863, Hammond was completely prepared to open his postgrad\u00ad uate Army Medical School, for example, and had determined which surgeon would teach each course, in the early fall and after the briefest of inspections, Stanton refused to approve the start of classes. On the other hand, when Hammond established suc\u00ad cessful laboratories for the Medical De\u00ad partment as part of its purveyance operations, and even Barnes, who was not given to praising either Hammond or Ham\u00ad mond's accomplishments, praised them, Stanton did not close them down. Although no attempt was made at these facilities to compound all the medicines the depart\u00ad ment used, by the end of 1863, after less than a year in operation, the laboratory in Astoria, New York, was making eighty\u00ad three of the items on the supply table. With the aid of the laboratories , Hammond could stockpile drugs, thus sparing the Army the effects of shortages and the re\u00ad sultant fluctuations in prices. Surprisingly, Army laboratories never manufactur ed quinine, despite the fact that the process of making it was relatively simple and the variations in its price quite marked. They tested quinine, however, and any other item susceptible to adulteration. The op\u00ad erations of the three facilities at Astoria, .lStrong, Diary, pp. 359, 394; Louis C.

The laboratory at Philadelphia alone was cred\u00ad ited with saving more than $75,000 Stanton's distrust for Hammond's did extend to the Army Medical Mu\u00ad seum, which he apparently convinced the president was merely \"a monument to General Hammond.\" But Barnes again found himself agreeing with the belea\u00ad guered surgeon general. Upon assuming the responsibilities of the head of the Med\u00ad ical Department in the fall of 1863, Barnes encouraged medical officers to continue sending in interesting specimens. More than 1,300 items had already arrived in Washington by 1 January 1863, and the Medical Department employed one man to serve as a water colorist and another as a \"bone artist\" to further the work of the museum.5 The best proof that Hammond's diffi\u00ad culties stemmed more from his personality and conflict with Stanton than from his management of the Medical Department was Barnes' continuance of Hammond's policies and, with the exception of the ill\u00ad fated medical school, Barnes' support of Hammond's favorite projects. The Medical Department worked without Hammond's hand at the helm as it had when he was 'MSH I, pI. 3:965; Ltrs, A. K.

Regardless of who was at the helm, the major concern of the Medical Department was always the day-to-day care of sick and wounded. With soldiers joining the Army by the thousands, the number of sick for whom the Medical Department was re\u00ad sponsible grew rapidly. This increase was not unexpected, since new troops were al\u00ad ways vulnerable, and epidemics tradition\u00ad ally followed their entry into military service. Malaria was so common, however, that its occurrence was taken for granted. \\( was generally treated in the field unless the patient was also ill with some other dis\u00ad ease. Possibly because those who had con\u00ad tracted such diseases as typhoid fever in earlier years had become immune, but per\u00ad haps also because of improved sanitation, the disease rate in the category of contin-204 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 ued fevers was actually dropping . A break\u00ad down of fevers into specific disease categories recognizable today was rendered particularl y difficult by the invention of a new entity, typho-malarial fever, which may have been typhoid, malaria, both, or neither. Yearly statistics for diarrhea and dysentery, still the most common afflic\u00ad tions, could be misleading for, unlike ty\u00ad phoid, they could be both chronic and recurrent. For this reason cumulative fig\u00ad ures tended to exaggerate the number of men who were actually ill with these prob\u00ad lems over a twelve-month period. The fig\u00ad ures for 1862 and 1863, however, do suggest a marked increase in the total num\u00ad ber of typhoid sufferers and a significant upward trend in the acute form of this so\u00ad called malady. Scurvy cases were also on the increase, and given the nature of the soldiers' diet, it is entirely possible that many more than the figures suggest were suffering from subclinical scurvy, or in other words, the more subtle effects of a vitamin C deficiency. ' To care for those who were seriously ill as well as for those who had been severely injured, the number of general hospitals serving the Army increased from 151 shel\u00ad tering fewer than 59,000 patients as re\u00ad ported in the annual report of 1862 to 182 the following year, with 84,472 beds. Not all of the beds by any means were in use at all times, since many had to be available to accommodat e thousands of new patients after major battles. Many of the institu\u00ad tions of 1862 failed to survive through 1863; ten were closed in 1863 in Philadel\u00ad phia alone as new facilities replaced the old. Hammond continued to place patients as near their homes as possible. While 'MSH I, pI. 1:147,297,452, and pI. I, .. pp. 182,220, 287-321. many hospitals were located in such major eastern cities as Philadelphia , New York, Boston, Baltimor e, and Washington, others could be found throughout the Midwest, often along the Mississippi and its tribu\u00ad taries, where they could easily be reached by steamer. Still more were located at least temporarily near major battlefields, from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to Vicksburg, Mississippi. ' Moving ever larger numbers of patients to hospitals made necessary a more so\u00ad phisticated approach to evacuation. Much attention was devoted in 1863 to new de\u00ad signs for hospital cars, ambulan ces, and lit\u00ad ters. Boards of medical officers met to consider these new designs, and the quar\u00ad termaster general himself was invited to in\u00ad spect a new railroad car. Enthusiasm for a prototype led to the building of more cars on the basis of various designs inspired by civilian organizations, and to their even\u00ad tual use on runs to such cities as Philadel\u00ad phia, Baltimore , and New York, as well as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania , and Louisvill e, Kentucky . A new type of ambulance, a four-whee ler named for Tripier that could carry ten men, was also developed, but its usefulness was limited by the fact that it was so heavy that four horses were required to pull it.' Keeping track of the patients who went in and out of this network of hospitals was difficult. Letterman had developed de\u00ad tailed forms to facilitate the submission of detailed reports. In practice, however, it 1War Departm ent, SGO, Anllllal Report, 1862, p. p.3; WOR, ser. 3,2:389, 3:964-65 ; Ltrs, Hammond (Ind, 14 Mar 1863).

Overworked Army surgeons could not guarantee that detailed records would be ready to accompany the wounded when they were moved on short notice. A board that met late in 1863 to consider the prob\u00ad lem devised a system calling for registers to be kept at each facility and turned in to the Surgeon General's Office, where the files from various institutions would be compared to eliminate duplications' The word evacuation is associated pn- 9Brinton, Memoirs , pp. 249-52. but the sick con\u00ad tinued to form the major part of the Medical Departm ent's burden. Efforts to keep the unhealth y from entering the Army in the first place were intensified in 1863, and penalties were set for surgeons who were less than strict in this regard. Other approaches to the prevention of disease in\u00ad volved improved sanitation and hygiene and closer attention to the soldier's diet. The medical officer was handicapped, how\u00ad ever, by the fact that he could only advise concerning the prevention of disease.\" The conviction that improper cooking, which usually meant frying, caused much 'O\"Responsibility of the Army Surgeon,\" Sanitary Reponer I (\\863):28; U.S. Provost Marshal General, The Medical ParI oj fhe Filial Report Made fa fhe 3-4, II.

More worthwhile were efforts to guarantee that the soldier was offered an adequate amount of fruits and vegetables. Many line officers, however, failed to rec\u00ad ognize the symptoms of scurvy or te realize how, even in its early stages, it could un\u00ad dermine the strength of their men. Because of their failure to understand the impor\u00ad tance of potatoes to the health of their com\u00ad mands, officers sometimes casually helped themselves to supplies intended for the troops. Staff officers might thus appropri\u00ad ate 25 barrels out of every 100 for their personal use and that of their families and servants. Since another 25 might be si\u00ad phoned off at the corps level and still more disappear as the shipment descended through the di vision and brigade levels, the men might receive none, even when au-thorities at the highest levels believed thai the troops were adequately supplied. Hos\u00ad pitalized soldiers were not completely de\u00ad pendent upon the Commissary Department, which was responsible for supplying food to the troops in the field, because the Medical Department's purvey\u00ad ors supplied medicines as well as delicacies , which they continued to obtain from such organizations as the U.S. Sanitary Commission,ll Although otherwise few complaints IIH.

THE CIVIL WAR IN 1863: HAMMOND 'S LAST YEAR 207 about supplies developed during 1863, problems relating to the caliber of the sur\u00ad geons who worked in the Army continued. States still administered the exams for sur\u00ad geons attached to volunteer regiments, and medical boards that convened to look into questions of competence might weed out two-third s or more from among them. The dismissal from the service of doctors who were deemed unqualifi ed contributed , however, to a shortage of physicians at a time when volunteer regiments still might report for duty without their full comple\u00ad ment of medical officers. Surgeons were also needed to serve the new black regi\u00ad ments being formed, but they were re\u00ad cruited specificall y for this duty rather than chosen from among those already re\u00ad cruited, and few were enthusiastic about the assignment. They were required both to be graduates of orthodox medical schools and to submit to the scrutiny of a medical board, but since few came forward, the hospital care of blacks often devolved upon stewards appointed to act as assistant surgeons. Black army surgeons were few and not always well received.\" Nurses, like doctors, were often over\u00ad worked, especially in the West, and con\u00ad fusion over who would pay contract nurses left many without wages for weeks early in the year. The hardships they might have to endure were apparently unappreciat ed, for their pay was reduced from $20.50 a month to $13, plus a $3-a-month allowance for clothing. An order issued in the fall of 1863 permitted the surgeon general to appoint '2\"Responsibility of the Army Surgeon,\" Sanitary Reporter 1 (1863):28 ; Ltf, Hart to his wife (I Feb 1863), in Correspondence and Diary, Ms CI46, NLM; Cir (2 1863), RG 112, entry 2, 36:155; Llrs, Let\u00ad terman to SG (8 and 13 Jan, [I Mar, and 21 Sep J863) and Israel Moses to SG (I May 1863), all in RG I t 2, entry 12; Briggs, Civil War Surgeon, p. 117, Benjamin Quarles, Tile Negro in 'he 0'1'1\" War (Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1953), pp. 203-04. female attendants without consulting Do\u00ad rothea Oix. Although this power, which could be delegated to hospital directors, was designed for use when acute shortages made it desirable that appointments be made as rapidly as possible, it also enabled the department to bypass Dix at any time that the surgeon general desired to do so. The order, which also required that no more than one nurse be assigned to every thirty beds, emphasized that women nurses were under the exclusive control of the se\u00ad nior medical officer of the hospital in which they served and that he could assign them their duties as he wished and dismiss them for incompetence or disobedience.\" The establishment of an official organi\u00ad zation in 1863 to manage Negro units would lead before the war's end to the en\u00ad listment of more than 186,000 blacks and required planning for the medical care of their sick and wounded . Since authorities apparently believed that public opinion would not permit the sharing of the same facilities by both blacks and whites, special hospitals had to be set aside for the use of this new class of recruits, and black male and female nurses were hired under con\u00ad tract for a maximum of $10 a month to work in them.\" The shortage of nurses had already led to use of convalescents in hospitals, but in 1863 the Army took steps to assign those who were chronicall y ill or permanently crippled to work in these facilities.

Many of the men so as\u00ad signed were apparently the victims of chronic diarrhea or general weakness re\u00ad sUlting from wounds or disease, but occa\u00ad sional nurse-invalids were men who had deliberately injured themselves, cutting off their own thumbs, for example, in what would, with the creation of the Invalid Corps, prove a futile attempt to avoid fur\u00ad ther military duty.\" Care of the Sick and Wounded in the East In early January 1863, the Army of the Potomac was still reeling from the disaster at Fredericksburg just a few weeks earlier. Anticipating renewed hostilities , General Burnside established a medical facility nearby at Aquia, hoping thereby to avoid sending his sick back to general hospitals when his army advanced . When heavy rains and flooding forced him to abandon his campaign, he broke up the establish\u00ad ment at Aquia, sent the seriously ill back to Washington , and set up regimental hos\u00ad pitals to care for those with minor ills. For patients who could not be cared for in these small facilities, Jonathan Letterman as Burnside's medical director formed divi\u00ad sion hospitals wherever needed within each corps, thus providing his medical officers with experience in running such organizations . 16 \"MSH 3, pt. 1 :28; Paul Fatcut, ed., Letters oj a Civil WarSllrgeon (West Lafayette, Ind.: Purdue University Studies, 1961), pp. 57-58; Roberts Bartholow , A Man\u00ad all material on the medical care given the Army of the Potomac is based on Letterman, Recollections. As they settled down near Falmouth , just north of Fredericksburg , in late January, the 120,000 men of Burnside's command were considered to be on active field duty rather than in winter camp. Since the Army provided them with no structures for shel\u00ad ter except inadequate tents, the men often dug shallow pits in the \"wide-spreading sea of mud and mire,\" erecting log huts over these foundations and covering the logs with either tents or brush and mud. The Medical Department deplored this custom, but many regiment al commanders ap\u00ad peared to be little concerned about the health and welfare of their men. Neverthe\u00ad less, the sick rate among veterans initially held at 5 percent, and the rate for the Army of the Potomac as a whole, including fifty\u00ad six new regiment s, was 8 percent. Letter\u00ad man considered this record good under the circumstances , although he added that new recruits seemed to be suffering with unu\u00ad sual frequency from venereal diseases and hernia.17 At the end of January, when he relieved Burnside , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker was much concerned with the health of his new command , since diarrhea, scurvy, and a fe\u00ad ver that was probably typhoid afflicted many. Enlisted men were receiving very lit\u00ad tle of what Letterman considered to be the ample amounts of vegetables shipped to them. In early February, however, after Hooker himself expressed his determina \u00ad tion to have the troops receive an appro\u00ad priate diet, fresh bread and vegetables were issued. Letterman believed that the im\u00ad proved diet, together with better sanitation and greater care with cooking, was respon\u00ad sible for an improvem ent in health-by April the overall sick rate stood at 7 per- I7Quote from Letterman , Recollections, SG (15 Jan 1863), RG 112, entry J 2. THE CIVIL WAR IN 1863: HAMMOND'S LAST YEAR 209 cent. The rate of diarrhea-like ills had dropped from 5.4 percent in February to 3.4 percent, fevers were being encountered less frequently, and even the able-bodied were stronger and more vigorous.\" Improving the physical condition of the troops was but part of the preparations Let\u00ad terman made for the campaign to come. Although an Army-wide reorganization had removed the District of COlumbia from the control of the commanding gen\u00ad eral of the Army of the Potomac and thus the general hospitals of Washington from the control of its medical director, Letter\u00ad man's hands were still full. He soon found it necessary to appoint first one and then a second medical officer to assist him by acting as inspectors for the Army of the Potomac. In addition, he issued orders to each corps medical director to appoint a surgeon to serve as medical inspector for his unit. Letterman also used the winter to establish medical boards to examine med\u00ad ical officers charged with incompetence. Many new regiments had joined the Army of the Potomac since the preceding autumn, and in early April Letterman out\u00ad lined once again how he wished the Med\u00ad ical Department under him to operate during battle. He also issued a call for a private from each company to report for ambulance duty wearing a green badge to identify him as a member of the ambulance corps and pointed out that all attendants below the rank of sergeant must turn in their arms before the start of battle. Let\u00ad terman's desire to keep as many patients as possible in field hospitals intensified the need for a \"regularly trained Corps of Hos- 18$trong, Diary. p. 321; Huston, Sinews, p. 224; Rpt. (filed with Ltf, Letterman to S. Williams , 4 Apr 1863), RG 112, entry 12. pital Attendants,\" but he never succeeded in establishing such an organization.\" Before Hooker's army started out for what would be known as the battle of Chan\u00ad cellorsville, his medical director set up tent hospitals along the railroad from Freder\u00ad icksburg to the depot at Aquia. Here the wounded could remain with their com\u00ad rades, at the same time providing experi\u00ad ence in postoperative care for Hooker's surgeons. Organized by division , but grouped by corps, these facilities were, in his opinion, \"abundantly supplied with of\u00ad ficers, nurses, cooks, medicines , etc.,\" so abundantly, in fact, that he reportedly told Hammond that he did not want to have any civilian physicians and nurses sent to the field. An assistant surgeon in the Army of the Potomac, however, later complained about the lack of \"trained & disciplined nurses.\" The tent hospitals were located near one another, so that one line officer, appointed at Letterman's request, could serve as both quartermaster and commis\u00ad sary for all. Since he strongly believed that \"life in a General Hospital tends to destroy the good qualities of a soldier,\" when the army marched, Letterman left 8,000 sick behind in the tent hospital, still under the care of their own surgeons, rather than sending them back to general hospitals.'o Two factors, both beyond the control of the Medical Department, complicated the care of the wounded at Chancellorsville. 19Quote from Ltr, Goodman to McNulty, 13,5 1863) and Ltr, Letterman (12 both in Ms ffi50, NLM; Dun\u00ad can, \"The in American in Medical Depar/mem , pI. 5, p. 37; Bennett A.

Moreover, the rapid pull\u00ad back of troops forced Letterman to evac\u00ad uate the wounded over the long, rough twenty-five miles to the corps hospitals , rather than use facilities closer at hand. In addition, evacuation was made more dif\u00ad ficult by Hooker's orders, which prevented many wagons, including those with medi\u00ad cal supplies, and all but two ambulances per division from crossing the Rappahan\u00ad nock River with the units moving on Chan\u00ad cellorsville. No stretchers or stretcher bearers were permitted over the river until late on 30 April, by which time shelling had forced medical officers to abandon at least one hospital, and patients had, of necessity , been carried on litters improvised from blankets. Ironicall y, in a battle where many hospitals with their patients often had to be moved, the Medical Department was not as well prepared as it usually was for evacuation, but Letterman believed that the moves of the hospitals were, under the circumstances, well managed. After the battle was lost, it was only with difficulty that he was able to move enough ambu\u00ad lances across the river to return casualties to the north bank and to the corps hospi\u00ad tals. The approximately 9,500 wounded from Chancellorsvi lle then traveled by train along the single track to Aquia, whence about 2,000 went by boat to Washington .2I The care of his patients who had been captured by the enemy also concerned Let\u00ad terman. Nineteen physicians had been taken prisoner with them. Encouraged by General Robert E. Lee, Letterman sent twenty-six more medical officers and five l'Fatout, Letters, pp. 59-60; MSH I, app.:124-26, 128-30, 135, 137-38. wagon loads of medicines, blankets, and hospital stores through the lines. A week after the battle, Lee gave his permission for Union ambulances to come through the lines to pick up Union wounded , in so doing sparing these men the discomforts and dangers of a transfer from Confedera te to Union vehicles at some halfway point. All captured Union wounded were back within Union lines by 15 May.\" Letterman believed that his surgeons had, on the whole, acquitted themselves well at Chancellors ville and pointed out that three had been wounded in action, two severely. A volunteer surgeon, however, maintained in a letter that \"many of the Medical men behaved badly-ran off over the river in the first day's fight and never came back at all.\" Only a few lines later, however, he admitted that some of those who ran off did indeed come back, but added that they had consumed \"the Stim\u00ad ulants sent over the River by the Medical Director for our sick.\" This medical officer may have been inclined to embroider his story a bit, but he was not the only one to raise questions about Letterman's estimate of the situation at Chancellor sville. Hooker reportedly ordered that the number of casualties not be revealed, and, lacking in\u00ad formation, Stanton had Hammond send John Brinton to the Chancellorsville area with the secret mission of gathering infor\u00ad mation on the number of wounded , while ostensibly obtaining specimens for the Army Medical Museum.\" In his memoirs, Letterman reported that 9,518 men were wounded at Chancellors\u00ad ville. Given the difficulty of obtaining ac\u00ad curate figures under the circumstances , his data compares well with that reported in 22WOR. ser. 1,25, pI. 2:432,465-66. HFirst and HAMMO ND'S LAST YEAR 211 the War of the Rebellion collection, which states that 9,759 officers and men were wounded and 1,606 killed. Brinton, how\u00ad ever, after noting that one could safely as\u00ad sume four to five men wounded for every one killed, estimated that the total number of casualties was about 23,000, a figure far higher than that given by his contempo\u00ad raries, although his memoirs do not reveal how he arrived at this figure.\" By mid-June , when Army of the Potomac patients were on their way to facilities in Aquia and Washington, the able-bodied were marching north under Hooker, fol\u00ad lowing Lee, who was invading Maryland. Fortunate ly, the health of the Army of the Potomac was still generally good, for the weather was hot and the troops were pushed to cover twenty-five to thirty miles at a time, even when this meant marching at night. Water was scarce, and men col\u00ad lapsed and died from heat and stress. By the time they reached Pennsylvania, they were \"much exhausted and but illy pre\u00ad pared to bear up under the shock of wounds.\" Hooker, however, had decreased the number of wagons allowed to supply the Medical Department's needs. During the last part of this ordeal, rain turned the dust to mud, and supplies were often aban\u00ad doned along the roadside. It was fortunate that following the troops were Sanitary Commission wagons, and that their sup\u00ad plies were frequently replenished along the way.25 NBrinton, lv/email's, pp. 234-35; Duincll), Medical Gellysburg , Ms C129 (hereafter Medical Report), NLM; Frederick Law Olmstead, \"Preliminary Report of the Operations of the Sanitary Commission With the Army of the Potomac, During the Campaign of June and July. 1863,\" Salliwry Reporler I (1863):49. Unless otherwise indicated, in addition to Letterman's Rec\u00b7 ollef/iolls, all material of the Gettysburg campaign is based on Duncan's \"The Battle of Fredericksburg \" Although battle was expected almost mo\u00ad mentarily , Hooker resigned as command\u00ad ing officer of the Army of the Potomac on 28 June, to be replaced by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. In his determination to keep open roads to his rear, Meade further complicated supply problems for his med\u00ad ical officers by issuing orders that resulted in hospital supply wagons being kept well back from the battlefield. A medical officer returning from Washington with supplies was also ordered away from the battlefield on 2 July. As a result of these difficulties , although the fighting at Gettysburg finally ended on 3 July, tents were not generally available until two days later. Most medical officers had to rely entirely on the small medicine wagons that routinely accom\u00ad panied ambulances in the field. One corps had in some unexplained way escaped the restrictions placed on the rest of Meade's army, however, and its experiences suggest what could have been done had the rest of the army not been handicapped. Its normal complement of hospital supply wagons was allowed to accompany it from Virginia and none had been held back from the battle\u00ad field. Thus equipped, XII Corps medical officers were able to evacuate their wounded from the field, bathe, dress, and feed them, all within six hours of the end of the battle. 26 Meade's restrictions complicated supply at Gettysburg , but ambulances worked freely. According to Letterman, of the more than 14,000 wounded , none who were within Union lines were left on the field, even though the 650 officers and 3,000 and \"High Tide of the Confederacy-Gettysburg,\" both in Medical Deparlmeflf , pts. 6 and 7, respectively, and on MSH I, app.:141-47. !6Clements, Memoir, p. 12; William Warren Potter, of Sen';ce With the Army a/the Polomac (Buffalo: JourI/al, October and 1889), pp. 15-16. 212 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 GENERAL SICKLES ' LEG.

In bringing out the 12,000 whom the ambulances could reach, eight vehicles were damaged and a number of horses either killed or wounded. Nevertheless , since this battle lasted three days, the work of the ambulance corps was not as intense as it had been at Antietam and no serious difficulties developed .\" Although the placement of supply wag\u00ad ons far to the rear did not affect evacu\u00ad ation, it added to the difficulties of medical 17Duinell Medical Report, Ms C129, NLM; Richard H.

For a time after the fight\u00ad ing stopped they lacked an adequate supply of tents and were forced to use any build\u00ad ings they could find. They even had to leave some patients out in the open, where heavy rains added to their sufferings. Hospitals were often moved; one gro.uP was nooded out from a low-lying area that was other\u00ad wise both safe and convenient , and others had to be abandoned because of enemy fire. Some of these facilities apparently served only as clearing stations, and ambulances might have to move patients twice, even when the original hospital was not abandoned .28 The burden on Union surgeons at Get\u00ad tysburg was great. Although Sanitary Com\u00ad mission supplies met their most basic needs until Medical Department wagons could arrive, medical officers were not al\u00ad ways able to keep up with their case loads. Some had to work through the night and well into the next day. As a result of the strain, many fell ill at one time or another. Those who were captured with their pa\u00ad tients were forced to work with few med\u00ad icines or instruments after their Southern counterparts helped themselves to Union supplies. In addition, thirteen Union sur\u00ad geons were wounded at Gettysburg , and one died as a result of his injuries. One severely wounded patient who did not lack for attention from Union surgeons was Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles, who man\u00ad aged to separate himself from his cigar long enough to have his right leg amputated at the thigh in a field hospital at Gettysburg . Immediatel y after the surgery, the medical director of the III Corps and forty soldiers accompan ied the general while he was car\u00ad ried on a litter to a distant railroad depot. The surgeon remained with him for the rest 21Duinell Medical Report, Ms C 129. NLM. THE CIVIL WAR IN 1863: HAMMOND'S LAST YEAR 213 of his trip to Washington, where Sickles recovered from his wound and his leg joined the growing collection at the new Army Medical Museum.\" In spite of the large numbers of both Union and Confederate wounded remain\u00ad ing in the Gettysburg area, Meade found it necessary to take most of his 650 medical officers with him as he started his pursuit of Lee on 6 July. Only 106 Union surgeons remained behind, an average of I for every 150 patients. Since some of the Confed\u00ad erate physicians left behind with their wounded had apparently deserted their charges, Letterman was forced to ask Ham\u00ad mond to send 20 more surgeons to Penn\u00ad sylvania. The strain on Union physicians was great. Young John Shaw Billings wrote his wife on 9 July that he was \"covered with blood\" and \"tired out almost completely,\" able \"only [to] say that I wish I was with you tonight and could lie down and sleep for 16 hours without stopping.\" He added that he had been \"operating all day long and have got the chief part of the butch\u00ad ering done in a satisfactory manner.\"30 By mid-July the surgeons Letterman had requested arrived. Some private physicians from neighborin g states came to help, but most were of little use, preferring to op\u00ad erate rather than to help wherever they were needed. Letterman , who accom\u00ad panied Meade, also asked Hammond to send surgeons to join the Army of the Po\u00ad tomac on its march, to make up for those left behind at Gettysburg . An additiona l forty-seven medical officers reported to Letterman on 9 July. 31 29W. A.

As rapidly as possible, the Medical De\u00ad partment shipped its patients from Get\u00ad tysburg to general hospitals in the north. Hammond ordered that a medical officer \"of experience\" be found to coordinate the evacuation. Those remaining at Gettysburg were from both Union and Confederate armies, usually amputees or those with se\u00ad rious wounds, As the number of patients dwindled , surgeons attempted to consoli\u00ad date them and near the end of July opened a new 1,200-bed tent hospital, dubbed Let\u00ad terman Hospital or Camp Letterman, for their use, The new facility was near the rail\u00ad road so that patients being sent north could be moved to their trains by litter. Although the presence of individual citizens anxious to help the wounded added a note of con\u00ad fusion to the facilities at Gettysburg, the Sanitary Commission and other volunteer agencies helped staff and supply Gettys\u00ad burg hospitals, including Camp Letterman, which remained open until 20 November. 32 Evacuation from Gettysburg hospitals was initially slower than expected, since few ambulances remained after Meade's departure . Before Camp Letterman opened near the station and until the Sanitary Commission opened a ISO-bed depot, many patients were left lying in the open, exposed to the weather as they waited for a train. The train trip from Gettysburg was also an ordeal. The rail line was in poor condition, with its bridges in particularly bad shape. Although the departm ent 32Quote from Ltf, Hammond to R.

The department eventually evacuated an average of 800 men a day from the Gettysbu rg area northward. \" Because of factors beyond the control of either Letterman or the Medical Depart\u00ad ment, the death rate among the wounded after Gettysburg was unusually high and the wounds were unusually severe, The men had been exhausted even before the battle by their long, fast march in the heat.

Craven, the volunteer surgeon serving as medical director for the expedition, loaded ambulances and tents on the ferry that left Folly Island, where a hospital had been established, for Morris Island, where Union forces were besieging Battery Wagner, and where Clara Barton helped care for the hospitalized. The first field hospital that he established on Morris Island had to be moved once to avoid fire from Fort Sumter. His patients were evac\u00ad uated by ambulance across the hard sand to the hospital and later by ferry to the fa\u00ad cility on Folly Island. When more than 1,200 casualties resulted from a second at\u00ad tack on Battery Wagner on 18 July, Craven decided to move all the wounded from Morris Island by steamer back to hospitals at Hilton Head and Beaufort, South Car\u00ad olina, which he did in two days with the help of three naval medical officers and a physician from the Sanitary Commission. When arrangements for an exchange of wounded prisoners were complete, Craven went by steamer from Morris Island back to Hilton Head to pick up thirty-nine wounded Confederate soldiers. Meeting a Confederate vessel in Charleston Harbor, he exchanged his prisoners for about half of the Union wounded in enemy hands, 105 officers and men, whom he sent back to Hilton Head.\" ))MSH 1, app.:241-42; WOR, ser. 1,28, pt. 2:10; 216 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 Among the difficulties Craven experi\u00ad enced while on Morris Island was insubor\u00ad dination. During the siege of Battery Wagner, a volunteer surgeon openly defied Craven's authority. Even after the medical director of the Southern Department or\u00ad dered him to obey Craven, the surgeon con\u00ad tinued to set up hospitals for his men wherever and whenever he chose, but whether disciplinary steps were ever taken against the miscreant is not known. During the rest of the summer until the enemy abandoned Battery Wagner in September , Craven also encountered both malaria and scurvy. In the end, however, the efforts of the expedition were frustrated, and as 1863 ended Charleston remained in Confederate hands.\" Although reports of scurvy from Union\u00ad held areas along the southern coastline were not frequent, fevers continued to be very common. Soldiers in the New Orleans area were hit hard by \"swamp fever,\" or typhoid; an officer under Butler wrote of hearing \"the screams and howls of the pa\u00ad tients in their crazy fits\" in a hospital half a mile from camp and noted that two\u00ad thirds of his regiment were dead or hos\u00ad pitalized. Fortunately, Union surgeons were prepared to treat malaria and took the problems it caused in stride. The mortality from malarial fevers was not high in pro\u00ad portion to the number of cases, but in the late summer and early fall, as many as half of the soldiers in some commands were off duty at one time because of these fevers, despite some use of whiskey and quinine or a related drug as a prophylactic .

Each regiment in North Carolina had its own hospital, but the Medical Department established general facilities in New Bern, Morehead City, and Beaufort to handle se\u00ad rious and chronic cases and to supply med\u00ad icines to a growing number of former slaves working for the Union, as well as for their families.\" Care of lhe Sick and Wounded in lhe Wesl Just as Meade was turning back Confed\u00ad erate forces at Gettysburg , Grant was ac\u00ad cepting the surrender of Vicksburg , Mississippi , after a campaign that lasted six months. Grant's drive on the southern city, however, involved many lesser en\u00ad gagements rather than one or two great battles. Working under Grant for this campaign were three Army corps, one of which, under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman , set an ex\u00ad ample for the others in the management of the sick and wounded , while a second, un\u00ad der Maj. Gen. John McClernand , partic\u00ad ularly needed to improve in this regard. McClernand was more of a politician than a soldier and, like Buell before him, tended to neglect his sick and wounded, leaving them behind without supplies or attend\u00ad ants and, on at least one occasion, without ambulances as well. Despite rough terrain and poor roads, the ambulance system in 17John William DeForest, A Volul/leer's At!lIewur e, a Union Captaill's Record ojlhe Civil War, ed. James H.

THE CIVIL WAR IN 1863: HAMMOND 'S LAST YEAR 217 Sherman' s IV Corps, which was basically that created by Letterman, was so effective that Medical Inspector Edward Vollum persuaded Grant to adopt it for his entire army. After March 1863, therefore , Grant's ambulance corps was organized by divi\u00ad sion, with a commissioned officer com\u00ad manding each unit at the division level, a noncommiss ioned officer in charge of each at the brigade level, and one driver plus two enlisted men assigned to each ambulance .\" Just at the time Vollum persuaded Grant to adopt Sherman 's ambulance plan for the entire Army of the Tennessee, a new med\u00ad ical officer, Madison Mills, a Regular Army surgeon, arrived to replace volunteer sur\u00ad geon Hewit as medical director. Hewit had already established a base hospital at Mil\u00ad liken's Bend, northwest of Vicksburg on the Mississippi. Now Mills created a field\u00ad hospital system for the troops taking part in the campaign , one that was designed to accommodate Grant's desire to keep as many of his sick and wounded as possible within his department. Mills also estab\u00ad lished both convalescent camps and corps facilities to supplemeQ! field hospitals at the division level, so that only the seriously incapacitated would need to be taken to distant general facilities.\" Mills' work was complicated by the fact that various units of the Union's Army of the Tennessee were moving about the coun\u00ad tryside on either side of the Mississippi River as Grant attempted to close in on Vicksburg. In some instances , Union forces made no attempt to hold ground previously taken, and any wounded not moved with their units found themselves within the en\u00ad emy's lines.

(Courtesy oj National Library oj Medicine.) tients, but again commanding officers were tempted to lighten their burdens by leaving regimental medical needs behind. Letter\u00ad man's organization of supply by brigade had apparently not been adopted in Grant's army, but Mills personally , as med\u00ad ical director for the entire army, took an extra supply of medicines, bandages, and similar items with him. He supplemented these, where possible, by what he could find at drugstores in the communities through which the troops moved. In March Sherman, then on the far side of the Mis\u00ad sissippi from Vicksburg and to the west of that city, was confident that his field hos\u00ad pitals were amply supplied. He deplored the spreading of rumors to the contrary. It may have been these very rumors, however, that led Hammond to seek permission to travel west on an inspection tour, even though Grant's army, once it was relatively stationary near Vicksburg , was easily sup\u00ad plied. Steamers made the round trip from Memphis in four to five days, and the Med\u00ad ical Department's needs were stockpiled at Young's Point, north of Vicksburg , where one vessel had been assigned to pick them up and deliver them wherever they were needed.\" Supply problems may have been few after May, but the surrender of Vicksburg on 4 July did not end the difficulties facing the Medical Department of Grant's army. As many as 6,000 or 7,000 Confederate wounded, most in very bad condition, de\u00ad pended on Union physician s for aid. The Sanitary Cor>lmission once again assisted the Union medical officers. A call also went out to the chief quartermaster for the De\u00ad partment of the Tennessee to assign some\u00ad one at once specifically to obtain the tents and buildings needed for hospitals , to ar\u00ad range for transportation, and to provide the wood, water, and other items needed by the Medical Department in Vicksburg . Men whose recovery would be prolonged or who would never completely recover from their wounds were evacuated from the V icksburg area after the siege. The hos\u00ad pitals near the city that served these pa\u00ad tients were consolidated into one, where men awaiting evacuation could receive temporary care. Each regiment also had its own hospital, located when possible in buildings once used by the Confederates for this purpose, where those with tem- \"MSH 1, app.:330-32; WOR, ser. 1,24, Sanitary Commission , p. 77; Ltr, Brown to SG (comment of approx. 20 Aug 1863 by unknown author, 9 Aug 1863), RG 112, entry 12; J.

The path of evac\u00ad uation from Arkansas to Memphis was not as well planned as that from Vicksburg, however. The Arkansas evacuees' boats were crowded and their accommodations drafty and so inadequate that patients had to lie on the deck. In late summer the sick\u00ad ness and mortality rates were high in the 20,000-man Army of the Arkansas as it worked its way toward Little Rock. The medical staff caring for those remaining with that army was small, and some phy\u00ad sicians were incompetent. Supplies, which had to be shipped from Memphis , came in slowly until the very end of the year. With so many difficulties involved in caring for patients in Arkansas, it is not surprising that almost 1,200 were sent to Memphis. To care for the patients coming from Ar\u00ad kansas and Vicksburg, the Medical De\u00ad partment in Memphis took over the largest and finest buildings they could locate, many of which were hotels, until they had space for 5,000 beds. By summer, however, all these hospitals were full, and patients from Vicksburg were being sent to such cit\u00ad ies as Cincinnati and St. Louis.\" ~lWOR , ser. 1,24, pt. 1:489-90; H. A.

While Grant was planning his effort against Vicksburg in early 1863, the Army of the Cumberland under Rosecrans , with its 4,000 wounded, was recovering from the battle of Murfreesboro and preparing for a new campaign that was not actually un\u00ad dertaken until the summer. Although the town itself, built on a rock, stank with the effiuvia of shallow privies as the weather became hotter, the hospital was reportedly immaculate. By spring it could boast of a fine garden; a visitor in early June de\u00ad scribed that facility as \"one of the brightest spots in the Department of the Cumber\u00ad land, ... a model army hospital.\" Mean\u00ad while, Rosecrans and his medical director From Dr. Warriner ,\" and \"Letters,\" all in Sanitary Reporter 1 (1863):21,62, and 63, respectively. 220 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 used the period of inactivity to have a board check into the competency of his medical officers, some of whom proved less than satisfactory.44 Rosecrans' new campaign, aimed at the capture of Chattanooga, a vital railroad junction, would try his medical officers to their utmost. Handicapped by mountain\u00ad ous terrain, vulnerable lines of communi\u00ad cations, and an unexpected but severe defeat, they were fated to see their patients suffer from exposure both on the battlefield and during evacuation, from capture by the enemy, and from the effects of near star\u00ad vation. In May, however, the availability of ripe blueberries and green corn in the fields was accompanied by a drop in the disease rate from 5 percent to 4 percent, where it remained until after the battle of Chicka\u00ad mauga, despite the wet weather that pla\u00ad gued the army on its march.\" Rosecrans' new medical director, Glover Perin, believed himself adequately pre\u00ad pared for the campaign when each regi\u00ad ment was supplied with all he estimated it could need for three months-like Madi\u00ad son Mills in Grant's army, he did not change to a system of supply by regiment. Perin planned to leave items held at the corps level intact as a reserve. Unfortu\u00ad nately, in at least some instances, amounts allowed were insufficient for the eventual need. He also did not follow Letterman's example by consolidating small hospitals, '\u00b7Quote from M. L.

He per\u00ad sonally preferred Letterman's approach, however, since better control could be ex\u00ad ercised over ambulance trains by having commissioned officers in charge of them. Perin also noted that no one was detailed in Rosecran's army to place patients into the ambulances and that these vehicles were still under the quartermaster 's con\u00ad trol. Their number was adequate , but since ambulances had been often used as baggage wagons during the winter and spring, many were in poor repair just when they were most needed. Each regiment in the Army of the Cumberland was accompanied by its own ambulance and hospital wagons, while a thirty-vehicle train also moved with each division.46 Perin was also able for a time to rely on two specially equipped railroad cars for the evacuation of his wounded , but an accident destroyed one and damaged the other sometime during the spring or summer, forcing medical officers to evacuate their wounded , as many as 100 a day, in boxcars. Evacuation by rail, furthermore, could not always be relied on because of the ease with which lines could be cut and because a por\u00ad tion of the line west of Chattanooga to Murfreesboro ran through enemy-held territory. \" A network of hospitals behind the front lines with their field hospitals awaited those who fell ill or were wounded during Rosecrans' advance or in the battle of Chickamauga. The principal facilities were in Nashville, where a group of highly re\u00ad garded general hospitals provided 3,000 beds for soldiers and apparently more <l6USSC. Surgical Memoirs 1:54.

Attempts were made in the summer of 1863 to vacate beds in Nashville, but al\u00ad though more than 2,000 casualties were sent to Louisville and thence to facilities nearer their homes, still others came in from Rosecrans' army to take their places. Hospitals in Murfreesboro were also emp\u00ad tied of their patients, to the extent possible, so that they could be used for the casualties of the campaign. A I,SOO-bed mobile tent hospital was left behind in Murfreesboro, organized and equipped so that it could be moved as needed. In August it joined other facilities located along the Tennessee River and the nearby railroad that were used as temporary shelters for soldiers from Rose\u00ad crans' army. When possible, these hospitals as well as the convalescent camps that were located along the route were sheltered in buildings or in tents abandoned by the Confederates.48 When Rosecrans' men reached Chatta\u00ad nooga, newly abandoned by the Confed\u00ad erates as they evaded Union efforts to cut them off, Perin attempted to set up hospital accommodations for as many as 3,000 men, but found space for only 500 beds in those buildings originally used by the en\u00ad emy for the same purpose. These struc\u00ad tures, furthermore, were far from ideal; many lacked both doors and windows . Neverthe less, Perin urged that the sick and wounded from Rosecrans' army be sent to ~8WOR , Barnum,\" \"Report of Rev.

Chattanooga before the impending battle so that field units would not be unneces\u00ad sarily encumbered . In the field at Chickamauga, crans finally met the enemy, medical offi\u00ad cers experienced all the difficultie s spawned by defeat, including the necessity for moving hospitals and the inevitable capture of many of their wounded . Perin has been criticized for locating most of the division hospitals in an area far from the battlefield and easily cut off by the enemy. He has also been blamed for not moving these units and their occupants as promptly as possible when they were in danger of capture. The site he chose, however, was near a vitally needed source of water. Since predicting the fortunes of this battle was particularly difficult and the area was \"un\u00ad dulating and thickly timbered ,\" evacuation was tedious and time-consuming. As many as 2,500 wounded were taken captive, 2,000 of whom had been left on the field on 20 September when the army fled, but 1,700 were soon exchanged.\" At Chattanooga, the Medical Depart\u00ad ment was once again not prepared to han\u00ad dle the number of wounded that flooded into the city. With the aid of the Sanitary Commission, Perin tried to find shelter for the 9,000 wounded . More than 200 bales of cotton that were discovered hidden in the town were rapidly converted into mat\u00ad tresses enough to accommodate all the ad\u00ad ditional wounded . Supplies sufficient to the needs of a hard campaign had not been accumulated, however, and food was scarce even before the defeat at Chickamauga, so that many patients arriving at the hospitals had nothing to eat for two days.so 49QUotc from MSH I, app.:268; Rpts.

A new tent hospital was es\u00ad tablished across the Tennessee River to the north, but not enough tents were available to shelter all of the 2,000 sent there, forcing surgeons to turn to use \"bowers of branches and leaves\" to protect their patients from the weather. Many patients were sent west on an exceedingly arduous trip to hospitals nearer Murfreesboro. In this effort, Perin encountered a familar problem in the per\u00ad sons of malingerers and the slightly wounded , anxious to escape further action. Medical officers were set to watch for them at the pontoon bridges across the ri ver. In the confusion, however, many who were not seriously hurt succeeded in joining the supply wagons that were laboring westward carrying the more seriously injured sixty miles to where the railroad to Nashville was still open. 51 Despite inexplicable claims by a medical officer in Louisvill e that shipments were getting through to the Army of the Cum\u00ad berland, there was no escaping the fact that Chattanooga was almost completely cut off from significant outside help. The river was not navigable near the city, the railroad led into enemy territory, and mountain roads had been rendered almost impossible by weather and enemy raids. By October, many of the horses that pulled ambulances were so starved that they were no longer useful, and although the Sanitary Com\u00ad mission stationed agents along the roads used in evacuation, their aid was also lim\u00ad ited by transportation problems. The wounded in the city suffered from their in\u00ad adequate diet and shivered as autumn chills deepened and fuel became scarce. \"Quote from MSN I, app.:288 Sal/irary Memoirs, pp. on its way, however. In late Sep\u00ad tember trains began bringing Hooker with two corps from the Army of the Potomac to Bridgeport, Alabama, west of Chatta\u00ad nooga on the Tennessee River. In late Oc\u00ad tober they finally opened the way from Chattanooga to the navigable part of the river, supplies could come through freely, and patients could be removed from the city without danger.\" By this point, Grant was in command of all forces in the West, and Sherman was on his way to Chattanooga from Memphis with two corps from the Army of the Ten\u00ad nessee. Sherman's men found all the food they needed in the countryside as they marched, and when they reached Chatta\u00ad nooga in late November, they were health\u00ad ier than they had been in some time. While Sherman was marching west, medical of\u00ad ficers in Chattanooga were preparing for the battle they knew would come, laying in new supplies and readying hospital build\u00ad ings in anticipation of as many as 5,000 casualties. During the battle to lift the siege of Chat\u00ad tanooga in late November, by which time Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas had replaced Rosecrans, ambulances were able to come closer to the battlefield than before because the terrain tended to shield them from en\u00ad emy fire. The 60,000-man Union force was victoriou s, and it was now the enemy who fled. Ambulan ce trains could function ef\u00ad fectively, and there was no need to move field hospitals repeatedly. Tents were still scarce within the city, but lumber from nearby buildings was used to make tem\u00ad porary shelters and new bunks. With few exceptions, all casualties were soon \"com\u00ad entry 12. SlQuote from MSI1 I, app.:290. THE CIVIL WAR IN 1863: HAMMOND'S LAST YEAR 223 Unfortunately , the crowding of patients, many still debilitated, into hospitals in Chattanooga led to the rapid spread of in\u00ad fection among them. Patients in the divi\u00ad sion hospitals located for twenty-five days in tents outside the city did not develop gangrene, even when it appeared in a large percentage of amputation stumps in hos\u00ad pitals within the city. The weather made evacuation inadvisable, thus precluding an early end to the overcrowding. It was only in January that trains could again travel to Nashville, carrying the wounded from Chattanoo ga.\" Perin's organization of the Medical De\u00ad partment in Rosecrans' army was not as efficient as that of Letterman , but the basic reason for the suffering of the wounded from exposure , crowding, and deprivation lay not in Perin's management but rather in the nature of the campaign. Supply lines were unusually vulnerab le, and the defeat at Chickamauga resulted in a rout and al\u00ad most complete isolation. Neither the sup\u00ad ply situation nor the shortage of beds would have been serious had medicines, food, and hospital stores come in freely and W'Report of Dr. Read,\" Sanilary Reporler (1863): 142-43; USSC, Sanilary Memoirs, p. 61. had patients been evacuated as soon as they could be moved. Conclusion Although Union victories in 1863 in some instances simplified the evacuation and immediate care of the wounded sol\u00ad dier, even success in battle could not elim\u00ad inate difficulties caused by lack of hospital space, nor could Medical Department at\u00ad tempts to emphasize the importance of what the soldier ate guarantee that diet would recei ve the serious consideration it deserved from officers commanding troops. The effects of underestimating cas\u00ad ualty rates were worsened by the reluctance of commanding officers to complicate the marches and maneuvers of their armies by bringing along many wagons loaded with tents and other department supplies. Large-scale prevention of contagious dis\u00ad ease was not yet possible, and the casual attitudes of line officers at all levels un\u00ad dermined attempts to improve the Army's health through greater attention to diet. Further improvement in the Army's health and in the care of the wounded would de\u00ad pend upon greater cooperation between all those responsible either directly or indi\u00ad rectly for the welfare of the Union soldier. CHAPTER 11 The Civil War in 1864: The Beginning of the End Under the direction of William Ham\u00ad mond, by 1864 an effective and more elab\u00ad orate organization had replaced the simple structure characteristic of the Medical De\u00ad partment in the days of Lovell and Lawson. Able administrators ran the various func\u00ad tional and geographic divisions of the De\u00ad partment, and sick and wounded soldiers routinely moved in orderly stages from bat\u00ad tlefield to general hospital, where a care\u00ad fully organized staff, including civilian nurses and cooks, awaited them. The req\u00ad uisite medicine s and supplies were usually available at every stage of the evacuation. Serious shortages or delays in the trans\u00ad portation of the wounded continued to oc\u00ad cur but chiefly as the inevitable result of the unpredict able nature of battle, of the failure of commanding officers to cooper\u00ad ate in attempts to prevent disease, or of decisions made to enable an army to move swiftly. His very success, however, caused the brilliant and abrasive Hammond to be\u00ad come expendab le and therefore vulnerable to the attacks of the many enemies he had made during the course of his short mili\u00ad tary career. Hammond's Trial Apparently never truly aware of his own vulnerability , Hammond was almost to the end convinced that a court-martial would find nothing of which it could convict him. He even pushed aside a final offer by Sec\u00ad retary of War Stanton to let bygones be by\u00ad gones with an arrogant demand for an apology. Knowing that Hammond had both stepped on many toes and bent many rules, making ene mies and providing them with the ammunition they needed to dis\u00ad lodge him from the position of surgeon general, not all of his friends shared his illusions as to the impregnability of his position.' Increasingl y determined to remove Hammond , Stanton named Hammond foes not only to the commission that in\u00ad vestigated the surgeon general but also to the court that tried him. Although Stan\u00ad ton's responsibility for some of the prob\u00ad lems Hammond encountered in planning his defense is not clear, papers needed by the defense apparently disappeared mys\u00ad teriously, and some of Hammond's most distinguished supporters, after signing a petition in his behalf, later inexplicably de\u00ad nied having done so. The resultant impli\u00ad cation of unscrupulous conduct on the part of Hammond or of someone acting in his behalf further blackened his name.'

The most serious and damaging charge aga inst him maintained that he had exceeded his legal authority when he pur\u00ad chased blankets personally rather than through the medical purveyor and that the blankets were overpriced and of poor qual\u00ad ity. Since Hammond was the purveyor's su\u00ad perior, the question of who actually accomplished the purchase might seem tri vial, but the potential for graft when the department head purchased directly was not a new issue. During the American Rev\u00ad olution, accusations of impropriety in con\u00ad nection with supply led to the trial of William Shippen. Although in Hammond 's case, evidence of personal profit was lack\u00ad ing and the questionable price and quality of the blankets he bought were easily ex\u00ad plained by the existence of urgent require\u00ad ments that could not otherwise be met, the hearts of his judges were not softened. In August he was found guilty on all charges. Sanitary Commission official George Tem\u00ad pleton Strong maintained that the surgeon general was convicted of \"little more than the technical sin of purchasing supplies too freely,\" but Hammond was dismissed from the Army and forbidden ever again to hold office in the U.S. government.

One writer of a neg\u00ad ative turn of mind accurately but rather unfairly pointed out that in two years Ham\u00ad mond had not succeeded in freeing the Medical Department from its reliance on millions of dollars of charitable donations or in establishing an Army-wide ambu\u00ad lance service, a concept opposed by Gen\u00ad eral in Chief Halleck. At least one of Hammond 's contemporaries concluded that it was \"painfully certain that the evi\u00ad dence fully sustained the charges pre\u00ad sented.\" When Hammond succeeded in having the conviction reversed in 1879, it was on the grounds that the court was prej\u00ad udiced and that evidence that had not been admitted cast doubt upon the verdict. Al\u00ad though technically Hammond was guilty of at least one of the charges, it seems obvious that he was doing what was necessary under the circumstances to provide the best care possible for the sick and wounded and that an impartial secretary of war would not have placed formal charges against him. Nevertheless , the net in which Hammond was caught was partly of his own making, the result not of greed but of arrogance.' Barnes' Administration Since Hammond was arrested in mid\u00ad January, the work of the Medical Depart\u00ad ment for the entire year of 1864 was the responsibility of the man who in August would formally succeed him as surgeon general, Joseph K. Barnes. Barnes was a 4First quote, Strong, Diary, p. 476; second quote, \"The Case of Surgeon-General Hammond ,\" 80Sl011 Medical and \"Hammond,\" pp. 109-10.

Although he was one of the medical officers passed over when Hammond became surgeon gen\u00ad eral, he was by no means the department's senior surgeon. Because of the way in which he came to office, there was little chance that Barnes could please Ham\u00ad mond's supporters, but with the strong backing of the secretary of war and with the guidelines established by his hapless predecessor, Barnes was able to lead the Medical Department successfu lly through the final year and a half of the war. Under Barnes, most of those projects closely associated with Hammond, among them the Army Medical Museum, the his\u00ad tory of the Medical Department during the Civil War, and, ironically , the Army-wide ambulance corps, went forward without further delay. At the museum, or, in Barnes' words, the \"Nationa l Pathological Cabinet,\" specimens were coming in rap\u00ad idly. The medical illustrators Barnes hired for the history worked in the museum and also went out into the hospitals , where they sketched and painted illustrations of wounds and the effects of hospital gangrene and similar complications. In the summer of 1864, the department added a \"photo\u00ad graphic bureau\" to support the efforts of both the museum and history, and at least one surgeon contributed to the depart\u00ad ment's endeavor a set of photographs he had made on his own initiative. Late in 1864, experiments in photomicrography began at the museum, where Joseph Jan\u00ad vier Woodward was beginning his work with stains for microscopic specimens. As a result of these efforts, by 1864 the work of the museum was attracting increasing attention , more so, apparently , among for\u00ad eign physicians than among Americans .' 5First quote. Ltr, Barnes to Thomas Longmore - JOSEPH J. WOODWARD. (COurlesy oj Na\u00ad lional Library oj Medicine.) When Congress passed the bill creating an Army-wide ambulance service in March 1864, Barnes again reaped the benefits of the crop that Hammond, in this instance with Letterman's aid, had sown. Among the significant features of the new legisla\u00ad tion was the prohibition of the use of am\u00ad bulances for any purpose except the moving of patients and, in an emergency, medical supplies. An officer who used an ambulance for any other purpose was to be reprimanded and, if the offense was re- (29 Jan 1864), RG 112, entry 2, 37:32; F. Pal\u00ad mer to Barnes (8 Sep 1864), RG 112, entry 12; Otis Report, in Lamb, \"History,\" p. 284; \"Army Medical Museum ,\" Americll\" Medical Times 8 (1864):306 ; Robert S. Henry, 71,e Armed Forces Illstitllle the Surgeon General, pp. 34-39. 228 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 peated, dismissed from the Army. Rather than giving each regiment a specific num\u00ad ber of ambulances, Congress called for the ambulance allowance to vary with the size of the regiment. An infantry regiment of 500 or more men would have three am\u00ad bulances, a regiment of fewer than 200 only one. In addition to the vehicles assigned to regiments, two ambulances were to accom\u00ad pany each corps headquart ers and two army wagons each division ambulance train. Time proved the major flaw in this legislation to be the inadequate number of ambulances.' The basic plan for the ambulance corps was unmistakably Letterman's. The med\u00ad ical director of each corps was, as he had intended, responsible for the ambulance service of that corps. A captain was in di\u00ad rect charge of the corps' ambulances, driv\u00ad ers, and attendants , and he reported to the medical director. A lieutenant commanded the ambulance corps of each division, a second lieutenant that of each brigade, and a sergeant that of each regiment. Three pri\u00ad vates worked with each ambulance and one private with each wagon. All men detailed to the ambulance corps were to be exam\u00ad i ned by a board of medical officers to de\u00ad termine their fitness.7 The law of March 1864 strictly forbade line officers to appropriate ambulances for their own use, but no such understanding existed concerning hospital ships. The mat\u00ad ter came to a head in September when Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, who demon\u00ad strated a generally high-hand ed attitude toward the Medical Department , matter\u00ad of-factly notified Barnes that he was tem\u00ad porarily taking over two hospital steamers, the only available vessels that would be safe 6Lettcrman , Recollections, p. 178; WOR, ser. 3, 4: 186\u00b787. J WOR. ser. 3, 4: 186. for an oceangoing voyage, to return men from Confederate prisons in Savannah. Butler apparently thought he had Grant's approval of the move, but, upon learning of the takeover, Grant demanded that But\u00ad ler explain his action. The secretary of war, unreservedly backing his new surgeon gen\u00ad eral, promptly informed Butler, \"this pro\u00ad ceeding is irregular, ... you will please abstain from giving such orders,\" and added that no vessels were to be removed from Medical Department service without his prior consent. 8 Other problems Barnes encountered in directing the Medical Department were also similar to those Hammond had faced. Medical officers continued to be frustrated in their efforts to preserve the soldier's health by improving his diet. Fresh vege\u00ad tables remained scarce in the field and ref\u00ad erences to scurvy and scorbutic taint remained common in the records of the pe\u00ad riod despite a slight drop in the frequency with which actual scurvy was reported. Desiccated vegetables, some of which were high in vitamin A, were unpopular. Al\u00ad though, unlike vitamin C, vitamin A could be stored for a relatively long period in the body, by 1864 the vitamin A reserves of some of those who had joined the Army in the precedin g three years were apparently seriously depleted, and the incidence of night blindness, the only reliable indicator of a vitamin A deficiency available from Civil War records, was increasing. The campaign to deliver more potatoes, high in vitamin C but relatively low in vitamin A, was apparently more successful than the ef- 8Quote from WOR. ser. 1,42, pt. 3:416; 1:1024, 1064 and pI. 3:416-17,418,432, 480; Ltrs, Butler to Stanton (26 Jan 1864) and McDouga ll to D.

The probable increase in the incidence of a vitamin A deficiency was not repre\u00ad sentative of the overall trend in disease un\u00ad der Barnes. In spite of the increase in the number of wounded, the sick and wounded together numbered less than 16 percent of the Army's total strength, and the death rate was declining. In June the report for the preceding twelve months revealed 300,000 fewer cases of disease among white troops than had been reported for the year ending June 1863, with the average soldier sick 2.2 times a year rather than the pre\u00ad vious figure of 2.4. The year's only epi\u00ad demic killed 278 soldiers when yellow fever struck at New Bern, North Carolina, but diseases associated with poor sanitation and hygiene, such as diarrhea and dysen\u00ad tery, were taking a lower toll. The decreas\u00ad ing incidence of typhoid fever suggests that many were immune to it by 1864.'0 Adding to the complexities of the work of the Medical Department at this time were the wounds and diseases of an in\u00ad creasing number of black soldiers. During the year ending 30 June 1864, almost 190,000 such cases, less than 4 percent of whom were suffering from wounds or other injuries, came to the attention of Army physicians . The disease rate among black troops in 1864 was almost twice that of whites, and their mortality from disease was four times higher. These statistics also indicated that while the rate of disease di\u00ad rectly associated with poor sanitation was similar in troops of both races, blacks suf- 'MSI1I, pt. 1:455: WOR. ser. 1,36, pt. 1:221,255 and ser. 2, 4:481; \"A Word to Aid Societies\" and John E.

They developed night blindness, however, only half as often as whites; as relatively new recruits, most probably still had adequate reserves of vi\u00ad tamin A,II The Army was caring for large numbers of newly freed blacks, not only soldiers but civilians as well, especially in the areas of such cities as Vicksburg , Mississippi , and Memphis, Tennessee , where the General Hospital for Freedmen was established for black civilians under the supervision of the medical director of the XVI Corps. Late in 1863, the adjutant general had called for 10 percent of the wages of employed blacks to be paid into a freedman's fund to aid their less fortunate brothers. This order al\u00ad lowed the Army to detail hospital stewards to the freedmen's hospital, paying them $17 to $36 a month from the fund. Army surgeons also worked in these freedmen's institutions. With conditions in refugee camps poor, the death rate among blacks was high, and Barnes opposed burdening the Medical Department with the enor\u00ad mous expenses that involvement with the care of freedmen could entail. In the sum\u00ad mer of 1864, the adjutant general rescinded the order that made Medical Department aid possible, a decision that resulted in confusion and a certain amount of despair among the Army surgeons affected by it. Barnes' objection to aiding blacks, how\u00ad ever, was presumably based on the enorm\u00ad ity of the challenge rather than any objection on principle to aiding civilians, since early in the year he had shown no reluctanc e in expanding one Army small\u00ad pox hospital in Washington and opening \"MSH I, pt. 1:300-301,456-57,665,669 and pt. 3:6; Grace, Manual, p. 171. 230 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTM ENT, 1818-1865 another in Alexandria in order to take in civilian victims of that dread disease.\" By June 1864, the 190 general hospitals that sheltered most of the sick and wounded soldiers, both black and white, had more than 120,000 beds, a figure that again reflected an expansion of old facili\u00ad ties as well as the creation of new ones. Included among the latter were general hospitals established for the exclusive use of officers, one in each geographica l de\u00ad partment. The Medical Department still tended to return general hospital patients to institutions near their homes, sometimes apparently even to civil hospitals, espe\u00ad cially when their period of disability would be long and the distance involved not too great. A desire to enable patients to vote in the upcoming presidential election rein\u00ad forced this tendency in the summer and fall. The department also paid insane asy\u00ad lums for temporary housing for military patients, but in this instance, rather than sending patients to hospitals near their homes, it moved any whose illness was likely to be prolonged back to Washington and its government-run asylum.\" Although no buildings had to be con\u00ad structed to create the new officers' hospi\u00ad tals, after July 1864 any new hospital IlLlr, D.

Ventilation was an important consideration in new buildings, where each sixty-patient ward had to be separate from the others. Even so, the number of cases of hospital gangrene and similar infections was climbing and military surgeons still preferred to have their patients in small field hospitals where rates of infection were relati vely low.\" Stanton's willingness to support the man he had chosen to be surgeon general led to the resolution of an old problem concern\u00ad ing the control of general hospitals. In De\u00ad cember and at Barnes' urging, Stanton ruled that general hospitals were under the exclusive control of the surgeon general and that medical officers serving in these facilities, whether regulars or volunteers, were not subject to orders from local com\u00ad manding officers. Within these institu\u00ad tions, medical officers had all the authority of commanding officers and were to be obeyed as such. Stanton did note, however, that although members of the Veterans Re\u00ad serve Corps could still be used as guards and attendants, doctors were under no cir\u00ad cumstances to retain able-bodied men in hospitals. \" In the fiscal year ending June 1864, the expense of hiring the contract doctors who formed most of the professional staff of general hospitals constituted roughly one\u00ad ninth of the department's budget.

THE CIVIL WAR IN 1864: THE BEGINNING OF THE END 231 whom the Medical Department was re\u00ad sponsible apparently led Barnes to reduce the number of contract physicians in Jan\u00ad uary. In June, however, the medical direc\u00ad tor of Baltimore's general hospitals informed Barnes that he had hired a \"large increase of Contract Surgeons and Nurses\" and that $15,000 would be needed each month to pay the former and another $5,000 for the latter. With new casualties resulting from the start of the campaign season, Barnes was finding it difficult to locate an adequate number of able private physician s willing to take the required ex\u00ad amination. By the end of the year, the over\u00ad all shortage of physicians had become sufficiently severe to cause the surgeon gen\u00ad eral to mount an aggressive campaign to persuade former volunteer surgeons to sign up again and to advertise for men to fill openings in the regular staff as well.\" Having concluded early in the year that the department had more stewards than necessary, by December Barnes had de\u00ad cided to reduce the department' s expenses by limiting the hiring of stewards to those who would be serving black regiments, even though medical officers still experi\u00ad enced occasiona l difficulties in obtaining stewards when they needed them. Further economies were achieved by reducing the salaries of white female nurses to 40<1: a day, even when white male nurses and cooks were still being paid $24 a month. The sal\u00ad aries of these contract employees were not always paid promptly, for on at least one occasion Barnes was forced to complain 16Quote from Ltf, C. C.

Managing supply and the network of hos\u00ad pitals involved was complex. In May the department moved the office of the assis\u00ad tant surgeon general, Robert C. Wood, to Louisville, Kentucky, where he could more effectively oversee the assignment of sur\u00ad geons and patients and the distribution of supplies in that part of the country. Despite the demands of the war, however, Stanton had apparently concluded that the depart\u00ad ment's network of medical inspectors could handle their responsibilities without the aid of Sanitary Commission inspectors. He refused to continue allowing the commis\u00ad sion to send its own men into the field, enraging Sanitary Commission leader Strong, who maintained that \"the corps of government inspectors [had] notoriously proved a nullity.\"18 The refusal to continue the Sanitary Commission's right to inspect hospitals and camps at the end of 1864 represented a general deterioration in its relationship with the Medical Department after Ham\u00ad mond lost control of the Surgeon General's Office. In the spring the secretary of war for a time even refused to issue the passes 17Quote from Ur, Barnes to George Harrington (23 Sep 1864), RG 112, entry 2, 38:283; WOR. ser. 3, 4:512; to Barnes (7 lui 1864) and McPariin to Barnes (20 Jun 1864), both in RG 112, entry 12; Ltf, Crane to T.

Stanton also denied the Sanitary Commission the right to use the adjutant general's records in compiling its directory of Army patients and their locations. The Sanitary Commission, like Hammond, was no longer completely indispensable.\" The very fact that the Medical Depart\u00ad ment could now afford to be high-handed in its relationship with the Sanitary Com\u00ad mission suggests the strength of Barnes' po\u00ad sition. Barnes' path had been well prepared by Hammond, who had created the de\u00ad partment's administrative framework and had placed experienced men to function within it. Secretary of War Stanton was ap\u00ad parently quite willing to support Barnes against p'ractically all comers. Because of the drop in the disease rate, the number of patients was dwindling, and the only real stress upon the department resulted from the demands of an aggressively waged campaign. Medical Care oj Forces in Virginia In the spring of 1864, Union forces launched two major drives against the Con\u00ad federacy, one in Virginia and the other in Georgia. Units in Virginia fought directly under Grant, now in command of the en\u00ad tire Union Army. Major General George G. Meade's Army of the Potomac and Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside's in\u00ad dependent IX Corps formed a 120,000- man force aided in the East by Butler's 33,000-man Army of the James and by var\u00ad ious other units. During this final year of 'QMaxwell, Sanitary Commission, pp. 263, 266, 311-13. the war, however, the medical care of the Union's principal army in northern Vir\u00ad ginia was no longer the responsibility of Jonathan Letterman, who asked to be re\u00ad lieved early in the year. The preparation of the Medical Department in the Army of the Potomac for the forthcoming campaign was, beginning in early 1864, in the hands of Thomas McParlin.20 The health of the Army of the Potomac at its camp along the Rapidan River during the first months of 1864 was relatively good. With the weather unusually cold, most of those who were sick suffered from respiratory infections, although venereal disease took a heavy toll among veterans returning from furlough. McParlin had the army vaccinated when smallpox appeared, and when he detected signs of scurvy in the form of a scorbutic taint, he urged com\u00ad missaries and medical officers to make sure that a proper diet was available. By I May he was convinced that the men were \"well sheltered, well fed, and well clothed, re\u00ad freshed by a long rest, and visits to home and friends, and full of confidence in their cause and in its leaders ... as nearly perfect in its health, strength, and morale as it is possible in so large a body of troops.\"\" Once the campaign was underway, how\u00ad ever, malaria and digestive complaints be\u00ad gan to haunt the Army of the Potomac. More patients suffered from these prob\u00ad lems than from gunshot wounds. It is likely that many of those with other diseases had malaria as well-McPa riin commented that he had observed a periodicity, or reg- 2\u00b0Letterman, Recollections, p. 185.

The qui\u00ad nine doled out at sick call was undoubtedly vitally important to the fighting ability of Union forces in Virginia. Caring for the sick and wounded under McParlin at anyone time were from 500 to 800 medical officers, among them an as\u00ad sistant medical director, two inspectors, and a medical purveyor and his assistant. McParlin assigned an assistant surgeon, John S. Billings, the principal responsibil\u00ad ity for the collection of statistics, a chal\u00ad lenge made more difficult by the fact that the medical staff was not large enough to guarantee the keeping of adequate records during those periods when battle was rag\u00ad ing. Billings nevertheless took to his new assignment with enthusiasm . On 30 April he wrote to his wife that he was being sent \"a barrel of whiskey ... with which to pre\u00ad serve surgical specimens and immediately after the next battle, I expect to send enough pickled arms and legs to the sur\u00ad geon general to make a museum of themselves,\"22 In April Meade named the specific sur\u00ad geons who were to serve as surgeons in chief at the brigade and division levels, a move that lessened the influence of com\u00ad manding officers who would otherwise have appointed their own chief surgeons. An average of from forty to sixty nonmed\u00ad ical officers served in the ambulance corps for the Army of the Potomac, supervising the work of 1,300 or more enlisted soldiers manning approxima tely 600 ambulances. Forty or more stewards worked in the corps hospitals .23 llQuotc from Garrison, Biflings, p. 76; Duncan, \"The Battle of the Wilderness,\" in Medical Depart\u00ad ment, pt. 9, p. 18. llDuncan, Medical Deparlmem , pt. 9, p. 18. JOHN SHAW BILLINGS. (Courtesy of Na\u00ad tional Library of Medicine.) When McParlin first took over from Let\u00ad terman, he relied upon regimental hospi\u00ad tals to care for those who fell ill, but in February he also organized division hos\u00ad pitals for the sickest of his patients. The organizat ion of the division hospital in the Army of the Potomac varied, but a surgeon in chief was routinely in charge, while a recorder, three operating surgeons, each with two assistants , and a medical officer responsible for food and shelter worked un\u00ad der him. The surgeon in chief, as one of the most experienced physicians on the staff, was usually a member of the oper\u00ad ating team at the division hospital, where almost all surgery was performed . With di\u00ad vision hospitals grouped together by corps, this system made it easier for the corps medical director to contact his immediate 234 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 subordinates. The absence of the division's chief surgeon from the battlefield was keenly felt, however, since he was needed to enforce discipline and order among the surgeons there. In some division hospitals during battle, musicians managed the pitching and strik\u00ad ing of tents, loading and unloading of the wounded, carrying of water and wood, burying of the dead, and policing of the hospital area. In one such facility, the 350 men and boys of the drum corps were or\u00ad ganized into five companies , each led by a sergeant, and the whole commanded by a lieutenant. A provost's guard usually en\u00ad forced discipline . Although McParlin had thoroughly pre\u00ad pared for patient care, hospitalization, and evacuation , he made no attempt to provide cavalry units with ambulances. He believed that mounted men moved too fast and cov\u00ad ered distances too great for hospital and ambulance trains to accompany them. After a cavalry engagement , surgeons ap\u00ad propriated nearby buildings and attempted to supply their patients by raids upon local resources. McPariin was not initially responsib le for the condition of the Medical Depart\u00ad ment in Burnside's IX Corps, which had left Annapolis at the end of April in great haste with inadequate transport and little room for medical supplies. The requisite number of ambulances moved with Burn\u00ad side, but many needed repairs. The am\u00ad bulance organization required by the legislation of March, furthermore , had not been fully implemented in Burnside' s force. Most of the required stretchers were missing, and the civilians hired to drive the ambulances deserted in droves early in the campaign . When Grant ordered Burnside's corps officially added to the Army of the Potomac on 25 May, McPariin found that it was not only still badly in need of trans-port, but \"badly supplied and organized\" as well.24 Despite his careful planning , factors be\u00ad yond McParlin 's control threw continual challenges his way. Recognizing that the army must move swiftly, he sent all his sick and wounded as well as all property he con\u00ad sidered unnecessary to the rear before the campaign started, but on 4 May Grant al\u00ad lowed only half the remaining ambulances to cross the Rapidan River with the troops. Since the number of these vehicles per\u00ad mitted to accompa ny the army still ex\u00ad ceeded the legally required minimum , Grant apparently did not anticipate the dif\u00ad ficulties that resulted from his order. McParlin was not profligate in his use of ambulances and was careful not to take chances with those that accompanied him, allowing only a limited number to be ex\u00ad posed to fire at anyone time, but events proved that the number of ambulances al\u00ad lowed by Congress was far too small for the aggressive campaign Grant waged. During the battle of the Wilderness that followed the crossing of the Rapidan, the removal of the disabled to ambulances proved unusually difficult. Dense scrub hid the injured, and fires raged in the dry brush and pine, burning or suffocating men too badly hurt to escape unaided, while the en\u00ad emy inhibited rescue attempts by firing at every movement. Despite their bravery, stretcher-bearers were unable to remove all of the almost 9,000 wounded from the field. As many as 200 died from the effects of the flames alone. Grant could not wait for these casualties to be brought back to safety, nor for them to be removed back along the chain of evacuation in the usual, rather leisurely manner. On 7 May, Meade ordered all his wounded sent back to Wash- HQuote rrom Ltr, McParlin to Barnes (30 May 1864), RG 112, entry 12. THE CIVIL WAR IN 1864: THE BEGINNING OF THE END 235 ington at once. More than 300 army wag\u00ad ons had to join almost 500 ambulances in attempting to execute the command, and more than 1,000 men were unavoidab ly left behind. The next day, fearing that guerril\u00ad las might capture them if they went directly to Washington , Meade ordered that casu\u00ad alties be taken instead to Fredericksburg . Because of the change of plans the wounded spent thirty hours on the road, and evacuation vehicles were late returning to pick up the casualties from the battle that started at Spotsylvania on 8 May.\" The ambulance corps took two weeks to remove all who had been left behind at the Wilderness. A large number died while waiting. Their wounds were severe, and the supplies left for them proved inadequate after stragglers came out of the woods to share them. Casualties returned from cap\u00ad tivity by the Confederates were also suf\u00ad fering from the same shortages that afflicted Lee's forces as the result of a suc\u00ad cessful Union cavalry raid that destroyed most of their medical supplies.26 Although they had not completed their count of the casualties from the Wilderne ss when Union and Confederate forces met again at Spotsylvania, after yet another day of battle, surgeons were struggling to care for over 9,000 more wounded. Few physi\u00ad cians remained in the field by this time, however, and McPariin's plans had been based on the assumption that patients would be evacuated from field hospital to general hospital before many had accu\u00ad mulated. But large numbers were held at depot facilities at Fredericksburg because Confederate guerrillas had cut the cd. E. B. Long, 2 (New York: Charles L. Webster & Co., 1866): pp. 19-20. to Aquia and were suspected of having mined the Rappahannock River. Because many of the surgeons accompanying the wounded to Fredericksburg had to stay there to care for them, medical officers re\u00ad maining in the field were overworked and exhausted.\" Both confusion and delay characterized the evacuation of the Spotsylvania casu\u00ad alties because ambulances were still busy removing the wounded from the Wilder\u00ad ness. In addition, the wounded on the bat\u00ad tlefield were too numerous for the available stretcher-bearers to handle. Two to four healthy soldiers could often be seen es\u00ad corting a severely wounded comrade to safety. Meade again ordered all available vehicles, regardless of type, made ready to remove the wounded. On 10 May the am\u00ad bulances finally returned from Fredericks\u00ad burg, but both horses and attendants were worn out. Since renewed action was ex\u00ad pected, Meade had ambulan ces and spring wagons (highly regarded as substitutes for ambulances) retained at the front and those of the wounded not yet removed to Fred\u00ad ericksburg sent off in returning supply wagons.28 The night of II May was dark and wet, but despite the exhaustion of men and beasts and the poor condition of the roads, the evacuation twelve miles back to Fred\u00ad ericksburg continued. Medical inspectors supervised the move of another 3,500 casu\u00ad alties on 12 May alone. The proportion of severely wounded among them was so high that fewer than a quarter of the injured could move themselves. Once again the lack of transportation prevented the prompt removal of many, and it was not until the 15th that 600 who had been left nLtr, McParlin to Barnes (10 May 1864), RG 112, entry 12. !8Grant, Memoirs 2:290. 236 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 behind earlier were picked up for the trip to Fredericksburg. The next day McParlin estimated that 18,500 patients had already gone through his field hospitals\" . On 19 May, McPariin had to order ve\u00ad hicles collected from other units for the use of newly arrived artillery regiments that had brought with them neither medicines and supplies nor transportation for their wounded. His surgeons assisted the artil\u00ad lery's medical officers in chosing men for their ambulance corps and advised them concerning the Medical Department' s rou\u00ad tine in caring for the sick and wounded, both on the march and during battle. The sick and wounded were not Mc\u00ad Parlin's only concern in the early weeks of the campaign. Malingerers by the thou\u00ad sands became a problem for him as they had been for Tripier and Letterman. Some appeared to have inflicted their own wounds. According to McParlin , they tended to present themselves not to mili\u00ad tary surgeons but to Sanitary Commission doctors, who could be more easily im\u00ad pressed by \"bloody bandages and judicious limping.\" Malingerers added to the con\u00ad fusion at Frederick sburg, where the estab\u00ad lishment of a large depot hospital system on short notice left McParlin with no chance to stockpile supplies for the 26,000 casualties who would eventually pass through that city.'o Initially supplies could come into Fred\u00ad ericksburg and patients could leave only through Belle Plain, on the Potomac River. The harbor there was shallow and, until the engineers intervened , had no wharf. The road from Fredericksburg to Belle Plain, furthermore, could be attacked by guerril\u00ad las. As a result, supplies did not reach Fred- lQGrant, /vlemoirs 2:237; Ltrs, McParlin to Barnes (13 and 16 May 1864), RG 112, entry 12. lOQuote from WOR, ser. 1,36, pt. 1:235. ericksburg until 10 May. The first twenty ambulances sent in to supplement those al\u00ad ready with Meade's army arrived at Belle Plain on the II th, when Sanitary and Christian Commission supplies also began coming in. To expedite food delivery to the hospitals, Meade assigned a lieutenant to each division facility to assume responsi\u00ad bility for hospital subsistence.\" In Fredericksburg enlisted patients oc\u00ad cupied the usual churches and public build\u00ad ings, although medical officers tried to locate the hospitals of each corps near one another. Wounded officers initially stayed in private homes where the owners cared for them. Facilities in Fredericksburg soon became crowded and infection took a heavy toll despite generally adequate ven\u00ad tilation and a good water supply. Near the end of the month, however, tents began to arrive, and doctors could move their pa\u00ad tients out of doors, where infection spread less rapidly. At this time, the Medical De\u00ad partment also established an officers' hos\u00ad pital at Fredericksburg.\" Because medical officers were required both at the front and in Fredericksburg, too few surgeons were available to meet the need at either place. On 9 May, for ex\u00ad ample, only thirty physicians were caring for 7,000 patients in Fredericksburg. On 8 May, therefore, Barnes put out a call to the surgeons general of Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts for ten surgeons each for ten days' service, broadening the call three days later to include other states in a request for five more physicians each.

'Morton, one of the developers of ether anesthesia, who, according to Joseph Jan\u00ad vier Woodward , anesthetized as many as 100 patients a day. Although the help of these civilians was invaluable , they also contributed to the confusion because of their unfamiliarity with Army routine.\" The road from Fredericksburg to Belle Plain was rough, the weather wet, and the confusion at the depot great. No facilities for the injured existed at Belle Plain. Since the wounded suffered greatly when moved any distance in ambulances and wagons, McParlin decided to keep the seriously wounded in Fredericksburg until the rail line to Aquia had been repaired and gun\u00ad boats had cleared the Rappahannock. By 14 May the situation at Belle Plain had im\u00ad proved, and supply was \"profuse,\" but 8,000 wounded remained at Fredericks\u00ad burg. With the river and railroad clear, McParlin had all those whose condition would keep them out of action for more than a month evacuated to Washington. By 22 May fewer than 6,000 remained in Fred\u00ad ericksburg facilities .\" Days before the last of the wounded left Fredericksburg on 28 May, Meade had or\u00ad dered the next depot for the advancing army established downstream at Port Royal. On 25 May he had the sick and wounded still with the army sent there, once again using wagons to the extent pos\u00ad sible to spare ambulances for work nearer the battlefield.

Within a few days the army had advanced too far beyond Port Royal to use it as a base. On 30 May, even while boats were still removing pa\u00ad tients from Port Royal, the Medical De\u00ad partment was beginning to set up tents at White House.\" From 23 to 31 May the Army of the Po\u00ad tomac moved south toward Richmond and then east around that city toward Peters\u00ad burg. Early engagements resulted in fewer than 2,800 injured, but in early June the battle of Cold Harbor accounted for almost 7,000 wounded . In addition, many who were sick rather than injured also had to be evacuated. For more than a month, the men's rations had included no vegetables . Scurvy was appearing among soldiers al\u00ad ready suffering from malaria and, with san\u00ad itation in the trenches poor, bowel complaints as well. Only after mid-June did shipments of the new crops of vege\u00ad tables begin to arrive for Grant's men, in\u00ad cluding a large supply for the depot at White House. By then, however, thousands of the seriously ill and wounded had left White House for general hospitals to the north.\" Although surgeons returning from their duties at Fredericksburg eventually re\u00ad lieved the shortage of physicians with the Army of the Potomac, transportation for the wounded remained inadequate , even after the arrival of forty-eight new ambu\u00ad lances and eight medicine wagons that lSRecd, Hospital Life. pp. 47-48; Ltrs, McParlin to Dalton (27 May 1864), in Edward Barry Dalton, Cor\u00ad respondence, Documents , and Certificates Pertaining 1861-72, Ms ffi29, NLM; Ltf, McPariin to Barnes (24 May 1864), RG 112, entry 12. l6Grant, Memoirs 2:290; WOR. seT. 1,36, pt.

A corps from Butler's Army of the Jamesjoining the Army of the Potomac in time for Cold Harbor caused further dif\u00ad ficulties by bringing with it only eighteen ambulances and no tents. Surgeons from another unit had to aid the doctors with Butler's men during the battle. Once again after Cold Harbor, because of the shortage of transportation, two or three able-bodied men could be seen escorting a single wounded companion from the front to the hospital.\" At the White House depot, surgeons at\u00ad tempted to load the patients from Cold .l1Rccd, Hospital Life, pp. 54-55. Harbor onto hospital boats for evacuation as soon as they had recei ved emergency care and had been screened to eliminate malingerers. The Quartermaster's Depart\u00ad ment worked closely with the Medical De\u00ad partment in this endeavor, but casualties were soon coming in as fast as they could be sent off. Medical officers shipped almost 1,300 patients north on 2 June alone, but on 4 June, when they sent off a similar number, 1,460 still remained at the White House depot, and McParlin was forced to turn to the Sanitary Commission to sup\u00ad plement his nursing force. In mid-June, the Army of the Potomac resumed its movement to the south, and once again the ambulances following it THE CIVIL WAR IN 1864: THE BEGINNING OF THE END 239 GENERAL HOSPITAL FOR ARMY OF THE POTOMAC at City Point, Vilginia. (Collrtesy of MassachusellS Commandery Military Order of the Loyal Legion and the u.s. Army Militwy History Instilllte.) were soon filled with the sick, many suf\u00ad fering from heat stroke. By 17 June field hospitals sheltered almost 1,900 sick and wounded. By the next day, however, sur\u00ad geons had established a new depot facility at City Point, on the south bank of the James northeast of Petersburg, and four days later White House stood abandoned.38 Although the siege of Petersburg eased the difficulties caused by the rapid move\u00ad ment of Grant's army, the wounded con\u00ad tinued to come in, especially after the battle of the Crater on 30 June. Problems resulting from poor sanitation and disease increased. In the heat of July the disease lSOrder (McParlin's copy, 15 lUll 1864), RG 112, entry 12. rate was twice the May average of 2.3 per\u00ad cent. Swarms of flies led McParlin to order mosquito nets for his patients. When the weather was dry, dust filled the tents where the sick and wounded lay, but when it rained, stagnant pools became so numer\u00ad ous that McParlin urged greater attention to drainage. Approximate ly 40,000 new re\u00ad cruits unfamiliar with the necessity for san\u00ad itation reinforced Grant's force in the course of the campaign of 1864, a fact that may explain why soldiers were once again relieving themselves wherever they were, ignoring latrines. Typhoid fever as well as diarrhea and malaria, diseases that to\u00ad gether caused more than half of the hos\u00ad pitalizations in the last six months of the year, became a greater danger to the Army 240 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 of the Potomac than the Confederate sol\u00ad diers besieged in Petersburg. \" The length of the siege required modi\u00ad fications in the way in which hospitaliza\u00ad tion was managed. When Grant's force took up its position outside the city, regi\u00ad mental surgeons established themselves within several hundred yards of the trenches, near ambulance stations, and McParlin kept division hospitals in tents. As winter approached, however, he had fifty-by twenty-foot log structures erected to shelter his patients from the cold. Most of the sick remained in these division hos\u00ad pitals, but when they became overcrowded, medical officers sent some of their patients back by train to the depot at City Point.'o The City Point depot covered an area of several hundred acres and contained five corps hospitals. A hospital at Point of Rocks, six miles up the Appomattox River, apparently sheltered Butler's remaining sick and wounded, but one of the City Point facilities was set aside for the black troops from Butler's command. Although not all reports agree, in the summer these institutions may have been able to house as many as 10,000 patients, but in the colder months, when pavilions replaced many of the tents, their population was probably less than 6,000. Despite much ini\u00ad tial confusion, the huge facility was soon operating smoothly, with a steam laundry and two steam engines keeping a 6,000- gallon tank filled with river water for ba\u00ad thing and washing, while dug wells pro\u00ad vided drinking water. A rail line went through the center of the depot so that pa\u00ad tients could be taken from the cars directly to their beds, without the use of ambu\u00ad lances. Although opponents of the practice 19Grant, Memoirs 2:239-89. <4OReed, Hospital Life, p. 94. pointed out that the use of convalescents as hospital attendants was harmful to their health, these men handled many of the du\u00ad ties at the City Point hospitals, including nursing and police. They apparently worked with great goodwill , since accounts of the period mention decorations put up by nurses and ward masters to make hos\u00ad pital rooms more cheerful. Blacks within the lines were ordered to duty as laun\u00ad dresses and cooks, while stragglers and sus\u00ad pected malingerers might also be put to work. Special-diet kitchens were often run by women who, in McPariin's opinion, \"were of much more use [there] than when employed as nurses in wards.\"\" Once again sending patients out and bringing supplies in was at first difficult. Piers were crowded, but temporary ponton wharves, including one for the Medical De\u00ad partment's exclusive use, were soon in place. Shallow draft vessels could come di\u00ad rectly to these wharves, leaving only deep draft boats to be unloaded by lighter. Se\u00ad verely wounded patients could then be quickly evacuated north. McParlin stored medical supplies that were temporarily un\u00ad needed in barges so as to free wagons for other uses. Although wagon traffic kept the area dusty in dry weather, as soon as an adequate pumping system had been in\u00ad stalled, water was available for spraying on the dust to lay it. During periods of rain, however, the entire area still became a quagmire. When rain fell during an at\u00ad tempt to move a hospital that had proved to be both inadequate and badly located, 41Quote from MSU I, pt. I, 0/ all Army Nurse Dur\u00ad ing the Civil War (New York: Greaves Publishing (no. 161, USSC Bull, 6 Dec 1864), RG 112, entry 12. THE CIVIL WAR IN 1864: THE BEGINNING OF THE END 241 the effort became an ordeal of mired am\u00ad bulances and exhausted men and horses.\" The management of the wounded was more than ordinarily difficult for units that for one reason or another temporarily left the immediate Petersburg area, usually in attempts to cut enemy supply lines. In one such instance, the II Corps moved to the north of the James River, sending its sick on to City Point before the move. Twenty ambulances followed each division of the corps as it marched to pick up the many men who became too exhausted in the July heat to continue on their own. Surgeons established a temporary hospital on the north bank near the ponton bridge by which the troops had crossed and a regular field hospital on the south bank, from which patients were taken to City Point. During a similar but longer-lived opera\u00ad tion, malaria became such a problem that surgeons had ditches dug around hospital sites to improve drainage and issued whis\u00ad key and quinine prophylactically for a brief period. Whenever possible they took over houses for use as hospitals and sent the sick back to City Point each time a move was necessary . As the weather turned cold, medical of\u00ad ficers with these expeditions found them\u00ad selves confronting the effects of cold weather and exposure upon men who had impatiently discarded heavier clothing and blankets during a warm spell. When rain and sleet accompanied the arrival of very cold weather, the rate of respiratory disease climbed among those who were forced to use temporary and inadequate shelter. To meet the needs of units leaving the im\u00ad mediate vicinity of Petersburg, medical of\u00ad ficers in one corps set up what they called a flying hospital, which consisted of a med- .1Ltr, McParlin to Barnes (24 Jun 1864), RG 112, entry 12. icine wagon, a hospital wagon, and half the number of ambulances allowed each bri\u00ad gade involved. Grant's 1864 campaign took a heavy toll among members of the Medical Depart\u00ad ment of the Army of the Potomac, espe\u00ad cially among the men \u00b7of the ambulance corps. From I May through 31 July alone, one medical officer and ten men from the ambulance corps were killed in action. Fi ve surgeons, three hospital stewards, and sixty-five members of the ambulance corps were wounded in the first three months of the campaign in eastern Virginia. In striking contrast to Grant's energetic campaign was that of Butler and his Army of the James, which never got farther than the junction of the James and Appomattox ri vers despite the fact that Lee was at first totally unprepared to meet an attack from this source. Like the Army of the Potomac, Butler's army moved initially with a bare minimum of medical supplies, ambu\u00ad lances, and the like, leaving its sick behind in hospitals in the Hampton -Portsmouth\u00ad Fort Monroe area. A steamer served as a storeship and as a shelter for the wounded. Several other smaller vessels took casual\u00ad ties back to Fort Monroe as soon as they could be moved. One corps soon estab\u00ad lished a permanent hospital at Point of Rocks, and the others followed its example soon thereafter. Because Butler got no fur\u00ad ther than Bermuda Hundred, however, his medical officers never faced the problems with evacuation and hospitalization that plagued their counterpart s with Grant in May and June. 4J Units fighting in western Virginia and Maryland experienced little success until they were consolidated under Maj.

(Courtesy o/Librmy o/Congress.) Philip H. Sheridan's command. Their set\u00ad backs resulted in the capture of many of their wounded. Sheridan 's medical direc\u00ad tor, James Ghiselin, was forced to put to\u00ad gether a medical organization more or less from scratch, but using Letterman 's plan as his guide, he successfully created both a medical team and a network of hospitals. The surgeon general cooperated promptly with requests for supplies and more sur\u00ad geons to man facilities established in Win\u00ad chester. In so doing, Barnes made it possible for Ghiselin to avoid the difficul\u00ad ties McParlin experienced during the battle for Spotsylvania, when his surgeons were spread thin trying to care for patients both in Fredericksburg and near the battlefield at the same time. Although the pattern of care and evac-uation was generally similar to that of the forces facing Lee in eastern Virginia, the shortage of ambulances here was less se\u00ad rious. It led to delays in retrieving the 4,000 wounded after the battle for Winchester, but the use of army wagons to supplement ambulances enabled the latter to remain with the army as it advanced. Most of the more than 10,000 wounded from 20 Au\u00ad gust to 31 October moved smoothly and quickly from field hospitals to depot facil\u00ad ities and thence by hospital train to general hospitals in Philadelphia, York, Wilming\u00ad ton, and Baltimore . In the course of caring for them, however, one surgeon was killed and three more died of their wounds, while two others were hurt but survived. The only major crisis, a temporary lack of food for hospitalized patients caused by Con-THE CIVIL WAR IN 1864: THE BEGINNING OF THE END 243 federate guerrilla activity, was quickly re\u00ad solved by the commandin g general's deci\u00ad sive action in ordering rations intended for troops in the field diverted to hospitals.\" Medical officers serving in Virginia in 1864 faced a variety of challenges, most of which arose from the fast-paced nature of Grant's campaign . His rapid moves against Lee in the spring and early summer com\u00ad plicated evacuation and hospitalization and emphasized the need for a larger am\u00ad bulance allowance for aggressi vely waged campaign s. The siege of Petersburg, on the other hand, brought with it all of the dif\u00ad ficulties involved in keeping standards of sanitation high among troops camped long in one area. In western Virginia, the med\u00ad ical director of Sheridan's new army grap\u00ad pled with the problems that arose from the hasty creation of an army from a hodge\u00ad podge of units with varying standards of medical care. Surgeons could not meet all of these challenges with complete success, yet even in the face of partial or temporary failure, they managed to function in a ra\u00ad tional, disciplined manner to limit the suf\u00ad fering of the sick and wounded . Sherman's Campaign in Georgia The second major campaign of 1864 was that led by Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman , under whose command three armies that had been fighting west of the Appalachians were consolidated to take At\u00ad lanta and then to push on to the coast. Sherman, like Grant, launched his cam\u00ad paign on 4 May, but the distance to be cov\u00ad ered was great and, unlike Grant, he made slow progress during the summer, needing seventy-four days to move the fi rst 100 ~~Brinton , Memoirs. pp. 293-301; WOR, ser.

The path Sherman took lay for the most part along a railroad, and his medical officers were able to make extensive use of hospital trains during the first half of the campaign, but transportation became in\u00ad creasingly uncertain because of enemy raids upon lengthening supply lines. Al\u00ad though his men had become skilled in the art of rebuildin g track and bridges rapidly, in leaving Atlanta Sherman finally decided to end his reliance upon support from the rear. His men would live off the land as he moved east, and he would keep with him those who fell ill or were wounded after his departur e.\" \"5Unlcss othcfV(isc indicated, all material on Sher\u00ad man's campaign is based on l'vfSfI I, Matloff, American Mililaf)' (COlll\"lesy When the campaign began, Sherman's medical officers had not had time to acti\u00ad vate Letterman's system in its entirety. Field hospitals were for the most part still organized by brigade rather than division. The medical officers who were to perform surgical operations for the Army of the Cumberland, one of Sherman's three ar\u00ad mies, were initially named by brigade, but in June George Cooper, the newly arrived medical director, adopted the division method of organization, thus making it a simple matter for each division's physi\u00ad cians to assist one another regardless of the units to which they were attached. The medical director of the Army of the Ohio, Henry Hewit, initially appointed a com\u00ad mittee of surgeons at the army level to per\u00ad form surgery, but he, too, eventually turned control over this aspect of the care of the wounded to his division chiefs.\" The system of Union Army hospitals that evolved during the summer of 1864 in Georgia varied to some degree from army to army and from place to place. As a rule, however, ambulances and, when necessary, army wagons initially evacuated patients to field division hospitals. If these units had to move on with the army before depot fa\u00ad cilities could take in all their patients, sur\u00ad geons sent the sick and wounded to mobile general field hospitals, and then finally to the depot for the train trip back to Chat\u00ad tanooga, 136 miles from Atlanta. Casual\u00ad ties were often sent beyond that city, with one train going 151 miles to Nashville, an\u00ad other the 185 miles from Nashville to Louisville. Hewit pointed out that his pa\u00ad tients had to continue immediately on to Knoxville, which could be very hard on the wounded , especially if they had to change trains. It was desirable, however, to keep the Nashville and Chattanooga hospitals available for the newly wounded, and thus those who had been treated were usually moved on, further from the battlefield . The casualties of the small Army of the Ten\u00ad nessee were for a time sent to a hospital in Rome, Georgia, rather than to Chatta\u00ad nooga. Cavalry units with Sherman, like those with Grant, had neither hospitals nor ambulance service, and their wounded had to enter infantry facilities or houses along the route of march where private families could be paid to care for them.\" At least one of the problems of evacu\u00ad ation was caused by Sherman's command\u00ad ing officers who, following the time- 46Ltr, Perin to Barnes (6 Jan 1864), RG 112, entry 12.

THE CIVIL WAR IN 1864: THE BEGINNING OF THE END 245 honored custom of trying to appoint the weakest men to ambulance duty, ignored the strenuous nature of this assignment. Ambulances were also in a poor state of repair as the campaign got under way, but the necessary work was completed during the season. The animals that pulled the am\u00ad bulances, however, were chosen from among those that had almost starved to death at Chattanooga the previous fall and winter. Many had not recovered from that ordeal and were unfit for arduous work. Since forage was not easily found as sup\u00ad ply lines lengthened, and since a campaign many had expected to be short continued month after month, a substantial amount of supplies and equipment was left behind to reduce the number of animals that had to be fed. Nevertheless, Sherman allowed the Medical Department to bring an ade\u00ad quate supply of medicines and hospital needs. He also assigned an acting commis\u00ad sary of subsistence to the field hospital or\u00ad ganization. Between Sherman's effort and those of the various volunteer commis\u00ad sions, the diet of the sick and wounded in the field was reportly as good as that of their counterparts hospitalized in the rear, and this even when ahle-bodied soldiers were suffering from scurvy. Many of the men in the field with Sher\u00ad man were veterans who, with the scent of victory in the air, had reenlisted. At the start of the campaign, they were reported to be in good health, but the condition of men who were new to the army was, as usual, poor. Once again, many had been accepted without adequate medical screen\u00ad ing. A diet low in vitamin C and an arduous campaign caused scurvy to appear early and by June men were breaking down. At least one surgeon blamed the lack of veg\u00ad etables for the difficulty that many men had withstanding the rigors of the cam\u00ad paign. By July definite signs of scurvy had appeared in an average of 20 percent of those in one division of the Army of the Ohio and what was described as a scorbutic taint was sufficiently pronounced to be identified in more than half of the men. The problem began to di.minish in impor\u00ad tance only when green corn became edible in the fields. Blackberries and many vege\u00ad tables ripened at the same time as corn and were probably responsible for the im\u00ad proved health ascribed by many to corn. As Sherman's force moved slowly toward Atlanta, surgeons caring for his sick and wounded showed flexibility in their ap\u00ad proach to the problems they encountered. On at least two occasions in the campaign, when a division hospital of the Army of the Cumberland needed help, surgeons from other divisions came swiftly to its aid. When the rail line was cut or a bridge de\u00ad stroyed, surgeons established temporary hospitals to shelter patients until the route back to Chattanooga had been restored. One such facility was located in an aban\u00ad doned Confederate hospital at Kingston in Tennessee, a second at Acworth in Georgia after the enemy had cut a railroad bridge. After the bridge had been rebuilt, surgeons at Acworth did not wait for the arrival of hospital trains but shipped their patients west on returning freight cars. In late June, medical officers faced a par\u00ad ticularly unpleasant situation when or\u00ad dered to move the casualties resulting from the battle of Kenesaw Mountain within twenty-four hours. Division hospitals were six to nine miles from the nearest depot, and surgeons had to use every kind of transport they could find, including bag\u00ad gage wagons, to move the 2,000 wounded along roads rendered virtually impassable by days of rain. Scurvy was by this time almost rampant among Sherman's men and proper food was apparently not yet available for the casualties who boarded 246 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 the trains after the battle. The situation be\u00ad came all the more difficult when the trip took three times longer than had been an\u00ad ticipated, but Cooper asked the Sanitary Commission to aid the wounded by setting up rest stops at Kingston, Tennessee , and at Resaca and Dalton, Georgia. Not all at\u00ad tendants on board the train were consci\u00ad entious about their duties, but physicians could not walk from car to car to check on their work while the train was moving. Given the hasty nature of the evacuation, however, the Medical Department proba\u00ad bly could not have done better.\" As Sherman's troops drew nearer At\u00ad lanta, field hospitals followed, moving fi\u00ad nally from Marietta to Vinings Station, where they remained until Atlanta fell and they moved into the city itself. Even within Atlanta, however, these facilities never be\u00ad came fixed. When the initial location of one of these hospi tals was needed for new fortifications, medical officers moved it from its original site to a less desirable one. Almost 6,000'were wounded in action near Atlanta, and at least half that number re\u00ad mained in Atlanta hospitals in October, when Confederate attacks upon the rail\u00ad road leading back to Tennessee virtually cut Atlanta off from supplies for several weeks. Until the rail line could be repaired, food supplies were supplemented by items brought in by foraging parties.\" On 29 October, with the railroad finally repaired, Sherman sent the division field hospitals of his three armies back to Resaca in boxcars, no hospital trains being avail- 4lDuncan, Medical Departmelll, pt. 10, p. 12; \"Ex~ tracts From the Report of Mrs. J.

Since medicines could not be found in the countryside and Sherman planned to destroy the rail line behind him to pre\u00ad vent the enemy from using it, surgeons would from that point onward have to manage with what they could carry with them. Sherman took with him, therefore, only his fittest men, hoping to minimize the depletion of medical supplies by send\u00ad ing the weak, whose the health might fail under the rigors of the march, back west with the sick and wounded.'\u00b7 Before leaving Atlanta, Sherman and his medical officers determined carefully what they should take with them. They allowed each division of 6,000 men approximately thirty ambulances, a medicine wagon car\u00ad rying sixteen tent flies, a month's allowance of the most useful medical supplies, and several army wagons that could be used to move the packs of men who became too weak to carry them. Their plans proved en\u00ad tirely adequate, since relatively few fell ill on the march, and the rate of sick and wounded averaged only 19 per 1,000. The clear air and food gathered from the coun\u00ad tryside, including berries and sweet pota\u00ad toes, actually brought about an improvement in health. Medical officers examined the few who did fall ill each morning before breakfast and loaded those unable to march into ambulances. Each unit had its own foraging party to bring in food for the sick, including fresh meats, vegetables, fruits, and honey. Cows accom\u00ad panying the march provided milk. One sol\u00ad dier wrote his wife that the men had \"not lived so well before in the army.\" John Moore, medical director for Sherman's command in the fall of 1864, was con\u00ad cerned that the medical supplies taken )O<'Letters From Mr. Hoblit,\" Sanitary Reporter 2 (1864):100-101; E.

His concern proved unnecessary, but when Sa\u00ad vannah surrendered on 21 December , four ocean-going hospital transports met Sher\u00ad man's army with supplies for 5,000 patients\" Sherman's preparations for his march to the sea included sending Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas with part of the Army of the Cumberland back to Tennessee to protect Nashville, a vital supply center, from Con\u00ad federate forces under General John B. Hood. Although in late November Thomas still did not consider himself ready to com\u00ad mit his main forces against the enemy, two corps saw heavy action outside Nashville as they attempted to gain time for him. While Union forces dropped back first to Franklin and then to Nashville itself, am\u00ad bulances and wagons evacuated as many as possible of the sick and wounded either to a train depot or directly to Nashville. Within the city, preparations for defense went forward, but considerable confusion prevailed because of the manpower short\u00ad age. Thomas gathered all available men into an \"extemporized\" unit and called in all surgeons in the area on leave or other\u00ad wise unassigned to serve as its medical staff. His medical officers scoured the city for ambulances. Only one corps' medical department was effectively organized.

The director of the general hos\u00ad pitals in Nashville took over every building that could be used to house casualties until he had 4,000 vacant beds awaiting them. Just as his new patients began to arrive, however, so did reinforcements in the form of troops from Missouri, and these units added to the problems facing medical of\u00ad ficers because they were \"deficient in al\u00ad most everything belonging to the hospital department.\" \" On 15 December Thomas attacked Con\u00ad federate forces besieging Nashville and drove them beyond the Tennessee River in HQuote from MSfI I, pt. 1, app.:323; Brinton, Memoirs. p. 327. 248 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 great confusion. By this time the weather was exceedingly cold, and the incidence of fevers, respiratory problems, rheumatism, and diarrhea increased among his troops. The wounded suffered greatly, but medical officers cared for them promptly in the field and quickly moved almost 8,000 back to the city. Since the railroad had been cut, the wounded had to use ambulances for the entire trip. As Thomas pursued the enemy, surgeons collected growing numbers of casualties in hospitals in towns along the way, including Franklin, where they dis\u00ad covered 185 survivors from the more than 200 Union casualties of the battle of Frank\u00ad lin. They also found approximate ly 1,500 Confederate wounded abandoned there, \"in a lamentab le condition,\" a state of af\u00ad fairs a Sanitary Commission representative attributed in part to \"bad nourishment.\" Trains evacuated all the wounded from Franklin and other communities back to Nashville as soon as they were in a con\u00ad dition to be moved and the track had been repaired. \" Although as many as 3,600 beds were available at Chattanooga and over 800 at Murfreesboro and Tullahoma-among the cities to which Army of the Cumberland patients were taken-Nashville held more than any other. In June general hospitals there sheltered 6,000, of which more than 2,000 were in tents, but by November a pavilion hospital for 2,000 was nearing completion. Among other hospitals in that city were an Army-run facility for smallpox victims and another for blacks, both sol\u00ad diers and civilians. \" HQuotes from Mr. Ruggles,\" Wounded at Franklin-Report Mr. C.

THE CIVIL WAR IN 1864: THE BEGINNING OF THE END 249 failure from the outset, and its failure inev\u00ad itably complicated the work of medical of\u00ad ficers. The 15,OOO-man force led by Maj. Gen. Frederick Steele that should have left Arkansas to meet the main part of the force under Banks at Shreveport had to turn back. Banks' drive north toward that city in early April also fell short of its goal, and left more than 1,600 of his men injured. The enemy captured almost 500 Union wounded , 9 medical officers, and 70 am\u00ad bulances , evacuation having been seriously retarded by a \"stampeded mass of wagons, artillery, infantry and cavalry.\" Four more medical officers voluntarily remained be\u00ad hind to help care for the captured Union wounded . Although surgeons had to aban\u00ad don division hospitals with little food or \"ordinary comforts\" for their occupants, Confederate authorities allowed Union doctors to bring several loads of medical supplies to the casualties, whom the enemy commanding general agreed to parole as soon as they could be moved. Medical of\u00ad ficers sent Banks' wounded on to general hospitals in New Orleans and Baton Rouge.\" The medical director who would nor\u00ad mally have kept the records for Steele's force was in the East for Surgeon General Hammond 's trial from late January to early May, and the records of the medical care for this half of the Red River force during April are missing. Some of the wounded were arriving at hospitals in Arkansas by the time of the medical director's return, however, a few at Pine Bluff and the rest at Little Rock. Medical officers had taken over private homes to house their patients in Little Rock but, sharing the belief of so many of his colleagues that such buildings S6QUotcs from MSH I, pI. I, app.:336.

Ery\u00ad sipelas had already appeared among them, however, and convalescence took unusually long. Surgeons eventually had many of the wounded moved 'to northern hospitals, either accompanied by a medical officer or, ifconvalescent, in small unattended groups on passenger vessels. Although the Army dropped its Red River campaign, Arkansas saw further ac\u00ad tion when a Union force of 6,500 men came through in pursuit of Confederate guerrillas in September. The Union general sent his sick, numbering more than 600, to the hospital at Duvals Bluff and his con\u00ad valescents to a camp established for them in Arkansas. These new patients added to the strain placed upon the hospital system by the sick and wounded of units normally in the area, where the disease rates were high and the proportion of medical officers to men was low. Conclusion The campaign west of the Mississippi was not a failure as far as the Medical De\u00ad partment was concerned, despite military defeats, the capture of many of the wounded and a number of medical officers, the loss of ambulances, and the absence of one of the leaders of the department in Ar\u00ad kansas during the first five months of the year. Surgeons were also plagued by tem\u00ad porary shortages of vegetables and supplies caused by low water in the Arkansas River, unexpected ly low temperatures, and the destruction in a fire of quinine reserves. But experience with the demands of war had by now taught the leaders of the Med\u00ad ical Department in both the West and the East the nature of the challenges they could 250 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-;1865 expect to meet, and many of their subor\u00ad dinates the nature of military medicine. Despite adversities, therefore, the Depart\u00ad ment was able to keep the situation in the West under control and to handle the dif\u00ad ficulties encountered in the course of the year as well as circumstance permitted. The armies that would bring about the final defeat of the Confederacy, however, were fighting in the East. It was in Virginia and Georgia that medical officers were ex\u00ad periencing unfamiliar challenges. Grant's constantly moving army made a shambles of an evacuation system that had under other circumstances been adequate. The long and vulnerable supply lines in the wake of Sherman's force as it penetrated deep into enemy territory called for the ex\u00ad ercise of more than ordinary ingenuity in anticipating and meeting medical and hos\u00ad pital needs. Because they had the active support of both the surgeon general and the secretary of war, medical directors of the armies of Sherman and Grant could con\u00ad centrate upon meeting these new chal\u00ad lenges, and the members of the Medical Department as a whole could function ef\u00ad fectively as a team in the final months of the Civil War. CHAPTER 12 The End From January to early April 1865, the Civil War continued in full fury, but on 9 April, after pushing his men close to the limits of their endurance, Grant forced the surrender of Lee's Army of Northern Vir\u00ad ginia at Appomattox. Further south, Union armies took Mobile and swept through Al\u00ad abama and southwestern Georgia. Sher\u00ad man led his army north from Savannah through the Carolinas, forcing Confederate General Joseph Johnston to abandon the struggle a few days after Lincoln's assas\u00ad sination on 14 April. Weeks before the last Confederate army formally surrendered on 26 May, the bloodiest conflict the nation had ever known had essentially come to an end. The Union's sick and wounded from re\u00ad cent campaigns had never been the only patients for whom the Medical Depart\u00ad ment was responsib le. Thousands of Con\u00ad federate soldiers in Northern prisons as well as a trickle of sick and wounded Union soldiers released from captivity in the South during the course of the war looked to Union medical officers for help. The campaigns of 1865 began to release Union prisoners of war in the thousands, and the health of many was shattered . Thus, even as it prepared to cut back its operations to a peacetime level, the Medical Department was taking on increased wartime obligations. Administration Other than the collection of routine re\u00ad ports and the coordination of the work of the various branches of the Medical De\u00ad partment, much of the administrative work of the Surgeon General's Office in the first half of 1865 continued to involve the re\u00ad duction of the department 's size and ex\u00ad penses to a peacetime level. In January 1865 the number of general hospitals still operating was already three less than the 204 that marked its peak. These installa\u00ad tions had treated more than a million white troops during the conflict, but by the end of June, after the Army began mustering patients out directly from hospitals , 170 were closed. The War Department's order of 28 April to cut back on expenses was followed by the reduction of the depart\u00ad ment's small fleet of ocean-going hospital transports from four to one, the return of all its river transports to the Quartermas\u00ad ter's Department , the elimination of all hospital trains but one in the West, and the collection of excess medicines and hospital supplies for sale at public auction. Barnes dismissed the medical boards that had been examining surgeons for the wartime Army and ordered his purveyors to stop buying until all surpluses had been con\u00ad sumed. He began clo sing purveying depots, keeping open only seven distributing sites 252 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 and the main depots at New York, Phila\u00ad delphia, and Louisville. He started reduc\u00ad ing the size of the department's laboratorie s. His medical directors inten\u00ad sified the process of consolidating patients, both Union soldiers and Confederate pris\u00ad oners of war, and of converting large hos\u00ad pitals to post facilities, while Barnes began discharging contract doctors and hospital attendants . The surgeon general also de\u00ad cided that the department could loan its excess bedsteads, bedding, and blankets to soldiers' homes. All the while, the Depart\u00ad ment was processing requests for confir\u00ad mation of death from the Pension Bureau, averaging 5,500 a month in May.' Among the expenses the Medical De\u00ad partment could not reduce in the spring of 1865 were those involving sick and injured freedmen and refugees, for although Con\u00ad gress voted aid to these men in March, the law was apparently not quickly imple\u00ad mented. Thus for several more months in 1865, much of the cost of the care of such patients, including that incurred in hiring contract surgeons and nurses, continued to be borne by the Medical Department, with the understanding that it would be reim\u00ad bursed, and the War Department contin\u00ad ued to detail medical officers to assist in the care of the unfortunate new citizens' Ltrs, William J.

Less than two months before Lee's surrender, the War Departm ent finally or\u00ad dered the pay of medical directors in\u00ad creased. Medical directors of armies in the field composed of two or more corps and medical directors of military departments whose general hospitals housed 4,000 or more patients were given the rank and pay of colonels, and those with lesser respon\u00ad sibilities were given the rank and pay of lieutenant colonels. These increases, how\u00ad ever, were to be effective only while these officers bore exceptional responsibilities, and at least two-third s of these positions were reserved for surgeons and assistant surgeons of the volunteers. Thus, with the end of the war, very few regular officers in the Medical Department would be entitled to retain ranks above major] Although the surgeon general's support and influence in Washington was invalu\u00ad able, by 1865 medical directors were ex\u00ad perienced enough to need little guidance from Barnes. While the surgeon general co\u00ad ordinated the efforts of his various sub\u00ad ordinates , prepared the Departm ent for a return to peacetime duties, and supervised the collection of records and specimens that would be used for the Medical De\u00ad partment's history and museum, his sub\u00ad ordinates followed familiar routines, caring for their patients on the battlefield and in the various hospitals that sheltered the sick and wounded.

More than 500 medical officers and 40 hospital stewards served 4 army corps, a cavalry division, and several independent commands , in\u00ad cluding artillery and Signal Corps units. More than 1,900 men and 43 officers formed the ambulance corps, although the former figure dropped to 1,600 as the cam\u00ad paign continued. Field hospitals housed 2,500 patients, another 2,900 occupied the City Point depot hospital, and almost 8,000 had been sent to general hospitals in the North. Slightly more than 22 percent of the soldiers of this army were sick in January, many of them with bowel ailments or fevers, usually typhoid or malaria. Res\u00ad piratory problems and rheumatism were not uncommon. Scurvy was specifically di\u00ad agnosed in only 52 patients in January, but at least I medical inspector blamed the se\u00ad verity of the diarrhea that prevailed on a lack of fresh vegetables caused by a shortge of transport ation. It is highly likely that many men were suffering from a subclin\u00ad ical form of scurvy.4 In addition to the diseases that almost invariably amicted armies in the Civil War, surgeons in the field with Union troops around Petersburg contended with diseases associated with poorly located camps and inadequate shelter or con\u00ad tracted by men on furlough. Around Pe\u00ad tersburg the campsite that military requirements dictated might be poorly drained, and shallow wells were easily con- 4Unless otherwise indicated , all information con\u00ad cerning the Armies of the Potomac and the James is based on MSH 1:491-92, 495, and app.:202-23. 253 taminated by surface water. The health of two V Corps divisions camped in a partic\u00ad ularly marshy area did not improve until these units moved elsewhere. Circumstan\u00ad ces also forced the men of one division to live several days without adequate shelter or blankets, and their health suffered ac\u00ad cordingly. In mid-January men returning from leave added to these difficulties when they brought smallpox back with them. The mass vaccination program ordered as a re\u00ad sult was not completed until mid-February, but surgeons established a smallpox hos\u00ad pital where they could isolate victims of that highly contagious disease. Most of the 3,000 wounded and 6,400 who fell ill while in camp or field in Jan\u00ad uary and February 1865 were initially shel\u00ad tered in division hospitals. Surgeons sent those whose recovery was not likely, as well as all those sick when the division was about to march, back to City Point. Should the number in a division hospital exceed its capacity, which in at least one instance was 100, the excess was also sent to the depot facility. The twenty-bed brigade ar\u00ad tillery hospital, unlike other field hospitals, remained at Petersburg until the end of March; artillerymen falling ill or suffering wounds elsewhere entered the hospital of the division with which they were serving. The cavalry division had its own 120-bed hospital and ambulance corps with 26 am\u00ad bulances, 3 medical wagons, and 15 army wagons. Sick and wounded officers, however, did not have their own facility. Disabled offi\u00ad cers in the field often took shelter outside hospitals, a practice McParlin wished to discourage, but no rules existed to dictate how their expenses should be handled if they were hospitalized. In March McParlin finally sent out a circular calling for officers to meet the cost of feeding themselves and any servant who attended them in the hos-254 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT, 1818-1865 FIELD HOSPITAL NEAR PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA. (Courtesy of Library of Congress.) pital, but forbidding the levying of any other charges.' McParlin's order meant that the depot hospital at City Point would shelter officers from both the Army of the James and the Army of the Potomac, since patients from Butler's army outside Richmond had been using the City Point depot as a way station, whence they were soon sent to the Army of the James hospital at Point of Rocks. City Point's popularity resulted in large measure from its easy accessibility by both water and rail, in the latter instance either directly or by means of a single change of trains at an intermediate station. Although there were some complaints of inadequate care, neither gangrene nor any form of ep- 'WOR, ,er. 1,46, pI. 2:609, 616. idemic appeared at City Point, and those familiar with the conditions under which it had to operate regarded it highly.' City Point experienced staffing prob\u00ad lems, however, once Grant's force began to prepare for the final stages of the campaign in northern Virginia, and McParlin had to order regimental medical officers on duty at the depot hospital to join their units. To replace them the surgeon general sent in contract surgeons, some recent graduates of the Harvard Medical School, committed to serve three months. The fact that con\u00ad tract nurses worked only in general hos\u00ad pitals left City Point short of attendants when commanding officers ordered the 6Rpt, Proceedings of Board of Inquiry (26 Jan 1865), RG 1i2, entry 12. THE END musicians serving as nurses to prepare to march. Veterans in the Reserve Corps who could serve in hospitals were few, and the need for a hospital corps was particularly evident. Despite the shortage of atten\u00ad dants, McParlin ordered the capacity of the City Point hospital, then variously esti\u00ad mated as between 5,400 and 6,000, ex\u00ad panded by 1,000 beds or more; one surgeon reported that tents were to be pitched to increase its overall capacity to 8,800. McParlin also ordered hospital transports readied to remove all patients destined for general hospitals.7 Union troops suffered more than 1,200 wounded in the enemy's unsuccessful at\u00ad tack on Fort Stedman, outside Petersburg, on 25 March and captured large numbers of Confederate casualties as well, all of whom were sent to Union facilities.

His effort to have the quartermaster keep a reserve train of ambulances available for his use failed, forcing him to rely entirely on ve\u00ad hicles that were old and much repaired and 7Ltrs.

It had been raining heavily before Grant began his attack on Lee on 31 March, and the downpour had turned the Virginia clay into a treacherous quagmire that rendered roads virtually impassable. Supplies were left behind to lighten wagons. Although stretcher-bearers moved with their com\u00ad mands, ambulance drivers pitched in to help those trying to improve the roads. En\u00ad emy action had wounded more than 1,500 from 29 to 31 March, and delays in evac\u00ad uation necessitated keeping field hospitals in operation even after the troops moved on, requiring the establishment of new fa\u00ad cilities as the army advanced even while the old ones remained open in the rear. Surgeons had to use tents to supplement available buildings along the way.'o As Union troops moved forward after Lee evacuated both Richmond and Peters\u00ad burg in the first days of April, McParlin ordered the chief medical officer of the City Point depot hospital to establish a sub\u00ad depot facility as far forward as the railroad was open. He hoped, apparently, that this hospital could be set up at Burkeville, or Burke's Station, fifty miles from Peters\u00ad burg where the rail line to Lynchburg crossed that from Richmond to Danville. Twenty-five medical officers, 3 hospital stewards, and 100 attendants started out for the new depot with tents and food for 2,500 wounded, but when they arrived at Wilson's Station on 7 April, they found they could go no further by rail. While 'WaR, ser. 1,46, pI. 1:609. \"WaR, ser. 1,46, pI. 1:707,843-45. 256 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 awaiting the completion of repairs to the track and its conversion to a uniform gauge, they set up a facility at that inter\u00ad mediate point. Patients from Sheridan 's command received care at Wilson's Sta\u00ad tion, and surgeons of the IX Corps, as\u00ad signed to guard the Burkeville junction, set up their division hospitals to accommodate all the wounded from units that had pushed beyond Burkeville in their pursuit of the enemy. Confederate wounded had crowded the Burkeville hotel, so the division hos\u00ad pitals were housed in private homes, ware\u00ad houses, tents, and makeshift shelters. Foragers were sent out to find food, while the medical purveyor's wagons continued beyond Burkevi lle in the wake of the troops. \" As Grant drove his men in a relentless pursuit of the enemy, the strain took its toll. Hospital wagons and ambulances ex\u00ad perienced difficulty keeping up with the troops, who were covering twenty to thirty miles a day. Some of the ambulance horses were \"completely used up.\" As ambulances from the IX Corps at Burkeville shuttled to and from the front, stretcher-bearers were hard pressed because of the shortage of vehicles in which to remove the casual\u00ad ties. By the time the two armies reached the vicinity of Appomattox, even General Meade was among the sick, \"hardly able to get out of bed,\" as Grant recalled, although Meade continued to obey Grant's orders \"with great energy.\" Under the stress, Grant himself was suffering from a per\u00ad sistent headache that responded neither to mustard plasters on his wrists and neck nor to mustard and hot water baths for his feet. Grant wrote later, however, that \"the in\u00ad stant\" he heard of Lee's readiness to sur\u00ad render, he was \"cured.\"12 II Reed, Hmpilal Life, pp. 160, 168. I2Quotes rrom Grant, Memoirs 2:466, 482-83, 485. The end of the war in Virginia led to a gradual closing of the field and depot hos\u00ad pitals that had served Grant's men, includ\u00ad ing, finally, the main depot hospital at City Point. McParlin estimated that this facility had admitted more than 11,000 wounded from units under Grant from I January through 31 May 1865. Including the sick, in the first six months of 1865, over 26,000 patients passed through City Point. Of these, more than 12,000 were returned di\u00ad rectly to duty. McParlin sent those wounded in the last days of the campaign back to City Point as promptly as possible and after Lee's surrender continued to empty his field hospitals by sending 2,000 more back. On 30 April, he ordered the capacity of the City Point hospital reduced to 2,500 beds. On 4 May the Medical De\u00ad partment moved the facility to Alexandria , and destitute former slaves apparently took shelter in the vacant buildings. Three weeks after its final move, the hospital closed and its remaining patients were transferred to general hospitals, whence they were eventually discharged from the Army.\" The Burkeville subdepot of the City Point hospital took in 660 sick and 192 wounded during its existence , from 9 to 30 April, 838 of whom went on to City Point. For part of this period, both the Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James camped at Burkeville , and Confederate wounded still occupied a hotel there, but many of the wounded at the facility also came from Farmville , where after occu\u00ad pying the town, Union forces had shared a large Confederate hospital. By II April, railroad cars supplied with straw for bed\u00ad ding were available to move 1,450 of the 2,200 patients in the various facilities in 1lA. W.

Two attendants accom\u00ad panied each car, and medical officers rode every train to City Point. Another 600 pa\u00ad tients started back on 12 April, but because of a transportation shortage, 150 Confed\u00ad erate patients remained at Burkeville. Am\u00ad bulance s continued arriving at this subdepot from field hospitals, however, so by the 13th, another 450 awaited trans\u00ad portation. On 29 April ambulances began moving Confederat e patients from Farm\u00ad ville to the subdepot on the first leg of their journey to hospitals set up for them within the city of Petersburg . Small numbers of sick and wounded continued to arrive at Burkeville even after McParlin closed the facility and sent its supplies and hospital train on to City Point.\" In mid-April , with the war all but over, a surgeon with the Army of the Potomac noted that disease had become a greater problem than it had been when the troops were in action. Perhaps it was easier for disease to spread when the men remained longer in one spot and water sources were more likely to become contaminated with the organisms that cause diarrhea. The cases of diarrhea that McParlin was en\u00ad countering, however, were markedly more severe than they had been. The surgeon blamed not only bad water but fatigue and, above all, the lack of vegetables. No ob\u00ad vious cases of scurvy confronted him ex\u00ad cept for a few in men newly returned from southern prisons, but these returnees, wherever they were, caused much anxiety among Army physicians, since their dep\u00ad rivations in the South had severely under\u00ad mined their health. Nevertheless, the fighting was over for the Army of the Potomac. For the medical officers who accompanied it, the months of struggle to keep pace with an aggressive , I~Grant , Memoirs 2:513. 257 at times very fast-moving campaign that often left them without an adequate num\u00ad ber of ambulances and sometimes without adequate field facilities as well, were be\u00ad hind them. The war was not yet over, how\u00ad ever, for further south the army of Confederate General Joseph Johnston still struggled on. Sherman's Campaign For the four Army corps of the Military Division of the Mississippi that would de\u00ad feat Johnston, the first months of 1865 brought a march from Savannah, Georgia, to Raleigh, North Carolina, during which the men once again lived largely off the land. Sherman had great confidence in the \"quiet, industrious, and most skillful\" sur\u00ad geons who accompanied him, but the na\u00ad ture of his campaign placed a considerable burden upon them from the outset by once again requiring that what they took with them be strictly limited. Sherman did not on this occasion, however, plan to keep his sick with him, and by having them promptly evacuated east to ports whence transports could move them north, he also limited the number of patients who would draw upon the supplies he brought with him.ls In Savannah , preparing for the campaign to come early in 1865, John Moore, med\u00ad ical director under Sherman , set up hos\u00ad pitals, staffed for the most part with contract surgeons, where he could leave those unable to march. He drew one month's supplies from the resources ac\u00ad cumulated for his use by the medical pur\u00ad veyor at Hilton Head, South Carolina, apparently planning to rely heavily upon 'SWOR, scr. 1,47, pt. 1:17, 119; quote from 1:46.

He attempted in vain, however, to acquire new ambulances to replace the aged and worn vehicles that were all he had. In mid\u00ad January Sherman and 60,000 men started out, but the rains that had flooded swamps and rivers forced the temporary abandon\u00ad ment of the move. While they awaited a change in the weather, surgeons sent those who fell ill back to the hospitals in Savan\u00ad nah and contained an incipient epidemic of smallpox by isolating the twenty-five cases that appeared in a three-day period.\" Sherman's men were able to ad vance again early in February, and on the 17th the right wing entered Columbia, South Carolina, which had been virtually aban\u00ad doned by its defenders. As Confederate garrisons along the coast began to surren\u00ad der, Union soldiers also occupied such cit\u00ad ies as Charleston and Wilmington, North Carolina. Medical Director Moore noted that, despite the weather, an average of only 2 percent of the army was sick. He concluded that the variety and abundance of food gained by foraging and the absence of opportunities for drunkenness, as well as the high spirits of the men, contributed to the army's health.\" The Union force paused for a few days when it reached Fayetteville in North Car\u00ad olina on II March. Surgeons then shipped 200 to 300 of the approximately 1,500 dis\u00ad abled, most of whom were sick rather than wounded, by river east to Wilmington, where the surgeon general ordered five con\u00ad tract surgeons sent to assist in their care. The men remaining with Sherman were at this time still in good condition, according to that general. Relatively few had been 16Sherman, Memoirs 2:260; WOR, ser. 1, 47, pt. 1:439-41; Ltrs, Moore to SG (30 Jan and 30 Mar 1865), Campbell to SG (13 Jan 1865), and Clymer to SG (4 Feb 1865), all in RG 112, entry 12.

When Sherman arrived at Golds\u00ad boro, however, the disease rate had dou\u00ad bled. Over 3,000 of his men were ill and more than I, I 00 wounded as a result of encounters with Confederate forces. Sur\u00ad geons once again sent the seriously disabled east to the coast, on this particular occasion to New Bern, North Carolina, where Barnes sent five more contract surgeons to assist in their care. IS Despite the difficulties he encountered as Sherman's force moved north, Moore believed that his care of the sick and wounded was adequate. Letterman's sys\u00ad tem for managing evacuation and field hos\u00ad pitals was proving successfu l. The 100 new ambulances that arrived during the course of the campaign were, however, but one\u00ad fifth of what Moore needed, and since these vehicles were still scarce, surgeons Qnce again had to rely on army wagons to evac\u00ad uate their patients. Moore reported during March that he was experiencing no short\u00ad age of items necessary to the care and com\u00ad fort of his patients, and after the occupation of Goldsboro at the end of the month, the supplies that had been awaiting them arrived from New Bern. He noted that by the 26th all the sick and wounded were comfortable in bunks set up in tents or private homes and that all patients did well, partly because their health was excel\u00ad lent when they were wounded.\" 18WOR, ser. 188, 440; Sherman, ,305; Llrs, Campbell to SG (13 Mar 1865) and Moore to SG (14 Mar 1865), both in RG 112, entry 12.

THE END Although Moore was happy about the condition of the men and Sherman himself described them as \"saucy\" despite their \"dirty, ragged\" state, the Sanitary Com\u00ad mission had received a contrary impres\u00ad sion of the state of affairs. Not allowed by the general to come near troops in the field because he believed that the commission members favored men from their own com\u00ad munities, they nevertheless concluded that the men must be in poor physical shape. Since, by his own admission, Sherman had \"gained the ill-will of the agents of the San\u00ad itary Commission,\" some commission of\u00ad ficials may have been eager to conclude the worst.20 While Sherman was leading one army north from Savannah, Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield was leading another in a suc\u00ad cessful campaign to take Wilmington , through which Sherman could then receive supplies and evacuate his sick and wounded by hospital transport. Apparently unaware of the secretary of war's firm in\u00ad structions to General Butler late in 1864 and of the issuance of general orders for\u00ad bidding the removal of hospital vessels from Medical Department control early in 1865, Schofield appropriated the S. R. Spaliiding for use as his headquarters. He pointed out, when taken to task, that the vessel had been merely \"lying idle without a single sick or wounded man on board, ... of no use but to furnishing quarters to three assistant surgeons, who had nothing to do but lounge in the steamer's cabin.\" He added that the Spaliiding could still be used as a hospital ship when he was aboard, and, indeed, was all the better suited for that purpose, since as his headquarter s, she 2\u00b0Sherman, Memoirs 2:306, 392, quotes from both; Maxwell, both in Sanitary Re\u00ad porler 2 (1864): 165 and 191, respectively. 259 moved up and down the river, following the action and thus close to the largest number of wounded . 21 Schofield and troops from New Bern and Wilmington joined Sherman's troops be\u00ad fore they left Goldsboro on 10 April. The Confederates retreated before this enlarged force, which was still pursuing Johnston to\u00ad ward Raleigh when the news of Lee's sur\u00ad render arrived. The main body of Johnston 's army no longer formed a real threat to Sherman's men, and in his haste Sherman moved ahead of a group of con\u00ad valescents accompanied by twenty-three hospital attendants, leaving them vulner\u00ad able to an attack by guerrillas on II April, when all but two were captured. Sherman continued north despite the attempts of Confederate cavalry to slow him, and en\u00ad tered Raleigh on 13 April, where the next day he received a Confederate request for a truce. The process of finding an accept\u00ad able formula for Johnston 's surrender proved surprisingly tedious, but word of the truce was sent to other units fighting under Sherman , and fighting in the Deep South came to an end.22 While Moore moved north with Sher\u00ad man to manage the care of those wounded or falling ill with the army, members of the medical staff of the Department of the South struggled to care for the men left be\u00ad hind. Those who could no longer fight pre\u00ad sented a considerab le problem for the medical director, surgeon of the volunteers Meredith Clymer. The release or exchange of many former prisoners of war only added to his difficulties. In March, antic\u00ad ipating that disease might create a need for a temporar y general hospital in Charleston, Clymer prepared to open one on short no- \"WOR, scr. pI. MEREDITH CLYMER. (Collrtesy of National Library of Medicine.) tice, a step he apparently was never actually required to take. Clymer tried to prevent overcrowding in his department by moving patients retained at Savannah north as soon as they could tolerate the voyage and transports could be obtained . He lowered his patient load there from 2,800 in late February to 800 a month later. He hoped that by continuing to send patients north he could reduce any facilities he might have to establish in Charleston and Savannah to post hospitals and concentrate future casu\u00ad alties at port cities further up the coast. 2l Contract surgeons staffed many of the facilities serving returning prisoners of war as well as the men Sherman left behind. HLtrs, Cuyler to SG (17 and 23 Mar 1865) and Cly\u00ad mer to SG (22 Mar and 22 Apr 1865), all in RG 112, entry 12. Clymer distrusted these physicians, how\u00ad ever, and rejoiced in May when he discov\u00ad ered that the sick rate was lower than he had anticipated among the 4,000 who re\u00ad turned to Union control in Florida and that his earlier request for six contract surgeons had become unnecessary. Permitted to terminate their contracts after three months, acting assistant surgeons tended to head north when the sickly season began. Having repeatedly but apparently vainly urged that they be signed for six-month terms, Clymer could only hope to function without them. After the war ended, several assistant surgeons of the volunteers were assigned to the quarantine stations at such yellow fever-threatened ports as Charles\u00ad ton, Savannah, and Fernandina, Florida, reducing the number of physicians avail\u00ad able to care for the new, unacclimated troops that were arriving in the South to man new posts. Although recovering pa\u00ad tients were being discharged from the Army directly from hospitals, Clymer was forced to call again and again for contract surgeons to replace those who went north for the summer\" Adding to Clymer's woes in the Depart\u00ad ment of the South was the fact that au\u00ad thorities there did not initially honor the law of March 1864 concerning ambulances and their use. For more than two months Clymer agitated and appealed, pointing out that, contrary to law and custom, the Med\u00ad ical Department in his area exercised no control over the use of ambulances. He cited stories of pleasure jaunts from which neither the line officers appropriating the vehicles nor the ambulances always re\u00ad turned safely. Only on 5 May did Maj. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore, commanding in the Department of the South, order that all l4Ltrs. Clymer to SG (29 and 30 Apr, 6 and 19 May. and 8 and 24 Jun 1865), all in RG 112, entry 12. THE END ~mbulances, medicine wagons, and similar vehicles be placed under the control of his medical director.\" Units under Sherman's command were not limited to service on the coast. Men led by Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson crushed the last significant Confederate resistance in Alabama and western Georgia. Fifty med\u00ad ical officers accompanied Wilson and his 13,500 men through Alabama from west to southeast , beginning in late March. Despite daily marches that sometimes covered more than twenty-five miles, neither wounds nor diseases caused major losses. On 2 April Wilson's surgeons established a hospital in a church at Plantersville, where 2 doctors and attendants remained to care for 40 wounded and 18 sick while the command continued on to Selma. After Wilson launched a night assault, Confed\u00ad erate Lt. Gen. Nathan B. Forrest retreated from Selma back to Plantersville and cap\u00ad tured the unguarded Union hospital. For\u00ad rest required the attendants and those patients who were only slightly wounded to swear not to participate further in the war before paroling them, but he let the sur\u00ad geons care for the seriously injured without interference. When Forrest left Planters\u00ad ville, Union medical officers brought the patients there south to Selma, where they had established corps hospitals to care for the 24 officers and 212 men wounded in taking the town. When the command re\u00ad sumed its march, 2 surgeons remained at Selma with the 68 patients who could not be moved, keeping with them forty days worth of rations and other supplies.

When Montgomery surrendered to Union forces on 12 April, medical officers entering the city were alarmed to discover that a smallpox epidemic was \"raging fu\u00ad riously.\" Fortunate ly, vaccination proved effective for Wilson's men, and the epi\u00ad demic did not spread among them. Doctors unloaded the wounded and placed them in a local hospital. Because the disabled had proved a serious encumbrance when moved with the army, Wilson now decided to leave 144 of them in Montgomery with an assistant surgeon when he continued east on 14 April. The di vision that went on to Columbus, Georgia, sustained an addi\u00ad tional 28 wounded in capturing that city four days later. The taking of West Point the same day produced 30 more Union wounded. Leaving 35 patients at Colum\u00ad bus, Wilson moved on to take Thomaston on the 19th and Macon on the 20th before word of Sherman's armistice agreement with Johnson ended his campaign .\" Wilson's medical director , Surgeon Francis Salter, was quite pleased with the way his branch of the Medical Department had functioned during this campaign . De\u00ad spite the speed with which the army moved, no patients were left by the road\u00ad side or cared for in makeshift shelters. \"Regularly furnished hospitals\" received all casualties. Although Salter had appar\u00ad ently been concerned about whether an ambulance corps could function effectively for cavalry units, his experience in this campaign led him to conclude that such an 26Unlcss otherwise indicated, all material on Wil\u00ad son's march is based on MSfll, app.:327-29.

Gen. Edward R. S. Canby allowed only a single ambulance for every 400 men (under the law of March 1864, a regiment of 500 men should have had two ambu\u00ad lances). He had an additional ambulance permanently attached to each artillery bat\u00ad talion, and two more for each army head\u00ad quarters and each corps headquarters. Three wagons were to accompany each di\u00ad vision hospital train to carry hospital tents and other equipment. Predictably, the number of ambulances available during the seige of Spanish Fort and Blakely, Ala\u00ad bama, guarding Mobile, proved inade\u00ad quate, and once again wagons had to be used to carry some of the wounded. \" No deficiencies appear to have marked the work of Canby's ambulance corps or the organization and management of di\u00ad vision hospitals , to which were allotted one hospital tent for every 600 men in the di\u00ad vision. At Spanish Fort enemy fire delayed the removal of casualties from the field un\u00ad til dark each day. Their able-bodied com\u00ad rades covered the wounded with rubber blankets, thus limiting their sufferings in the heavy rain. At Blakely, shells from the enemy gunboats forced surgeons to move division hospitals several times. Boats re\u00ad moved casualties from field hospitals at both Spanish Fort and Blakely to general facilities in New Orleans within two or four days.J<l The ordeal that Mobile was to endure at the hands of the Union Army was not yet 21QUotc from MSII app.:337-39. over. Late in May ammunition stored in a warehouse there exploded , causing what a witness described as \"a terrible calamity\u00ad beyond description. Acres of ground were covered with flames .... The loss of life [was] terrible ... several steamers were torn to pieces.\" The hospital serving Army engineer units was totally destroyed, and the interior of the building used as a freed\u00ad man's hospital was gutted. All the injured were initially taken into the city's hospital for merchant seamen, where white victims remained while blacks were quickly moved to another facility. Because the accident oc\u00ad curred just as regimental medical officers were leaving the city with their units, the surgeon in charge of the general hospital at Mobile sent out a frantic call for more phy\u00ad sicians, and Canby ordered that all medical officers in the area come to the aid of the injured.\" Except for those areas in which Union troops commanded by Grant or Sherman were fighting the last major battles of the war, Army surgeons were already beginning to return to their peacetime occupations . In Arkansas the surgeon at Helena con\u00ad verted the 250-bed general hospital into a post facility in March. At Fort Smith, newly reoccupied after its evacuation in 1864, the chief health problem was appar\u00ad ently scurvy. The countryside had been so devastated that no vegetables were avail\u00ad able locally, and guerrillas continued to threaten shipments coming in. A Sanitary Commission agent offered seeds to start a post garden, the Western Sanitary Com\u00ad mission furnished some vegetables, and the department's commanding officer ordered a special issue of vegetables to control the )1 WOR, ser. 1,49. pI. 2:741, 911-14, quote from (26 May 1865), RG 112, entry 12. THE END inroads of scurvy until local crops could mature.32 It was also west of the Mississippi , at Brownsville , Texas, that on 13 May 1865 a small number of Union and Confederate soldiers fought the last battle of the Civil War. Although the 26 May surrender of this last Confederate army formally ended the war, for the Medical Department a consid\u00ad erable challenge remained . The end of the conflict brought with it the release of the last prisoners remaining in captivity in the South and the beginning of the return of Confederate prisoners to their homes, with Union surgeons being responsible for the care of the sick and wounded in both groups. The apparatus of war also had to be dismantled, and the transformation of the Medical Department to a peacetime or\u00ad ganization would not be complete for many months. Prisoners oj War Although the difficulties involved in maintaining or restoring the health of pris\u00ad oners of war peaked in 1865, the challenge was not new. From the outset, the Medical Department of the Union Army had been responsible for the prevention of disease in Northern prisons, for the health of Con\u00ad federate captives, and for the care of sick and wounded Union soldiers returned through exchange or released by successful Union armies. Union surgeons had little to do, however, with the care of Northern men while they were in Southern prisons, since during most of the war, medical officers were not held captive, and when they were imprisoned, they were apparently concen- .l2\"Report of Mr. Carpenter,\" Sanitary Reporter 1865-66, Ms C126, NLM; U.S. Army.

Medical officers taken in April 1861 in Texas were paroled and allowed to return home after swearing not to care for com\u00ad batants until formally exchanged. Surgeons on both sides were held captive for varying periods of time until the spring of 1862, when the Union War Department ordered all medical officers \"unconditionally re\u00ad leased.\" This order was not invariabl y obeyed, as there were apparent ly some mis\u00ad understandings about it, but generally for a time thereafter both sides released sur\u00ad geons unconditionally , allowing medical officers to stay with the captive wounded of their own armies until their captors could provide adequate medical attendance .34 In 1863, however, the state of Virginia claimed that a certain captured Union medical officer had committed crimes pun\u00ad ishable under state law. He was, therefore , ineligible for return under any circumstan\u00ad ces until he had been tried. Union author\u00ad ities reacted by claiming the right to hold a Confederate physician hostage against the safe return of the Union surgeon. The agreement to return medical officers un\u00ad conditionally collapsed complete ly in July when Confederate authorities refused to recognize the Union's right to hold a hos\u00ad tage.

Captives were by then in prisons far from the front, however, and their return proved tedious. Word that physicians were to be released did not always reach prisons in a timely fashion. In one instance, Con\u00ad federate refusal to allow a flag-of-truc e boat to carry Confederate physicians on the fi\u00ad nal leg of their journey home led to addi\u00ad tional difficulties when General Butler concluded that the alternative of letting these doctors through his lines in Virginia would be unsafe because they would then \"know too much.\" The status of hospital stewards caused further confusion, but in March 1864 the War Department ruled that these men were to be treated in the same manner as surgeons.36 Although they rarely cared for men held in Confederate prisons, Union surgeons as\u00ad sumed responsibility for their health when they returned from the South. Until Union armies began to occupy large areas of the Confederacy, only limited numbers of cap\u00ad tives returned home, but as the war went on, these men presented a growing chal\u00ad lenge to the Medical Department because of their numbers and their condition. Many were sick before they started north, and those who remained in captivity until the last months of the conflict suffered increas\u00ad ingly from the effects of an inadequate diet \"WOR, 2, 5:212 and Captive of War (New York: McClure, Phillips & Co., 1900), p. 54. \"WOR, ser. 6:1078, 7:127-28,141,481,491,710, 853,860-62, and 8:156, quote from 7:412-13 . and often from the effects of exposure and poor sanitation as well. Despite a formal agreement in 1862 call\u00ad ing for the parole of all prisoners within ten days of their capture, actual exchanges were erratic because of squabbles concern\u00ad ing interpretation. Some difficulties ap\u00ad parently arose from the Union's lack of enthusiasm for a step that would renew the Confederacy's dwindling manpower supply by returning healthy prisoners. The Union seems to have been less reluctant to take part in exchanges of those \"who will not soon be fit for service.\" The cartel of 1862 called for most exchanges, whether of healthy or disabled men, to take place through the City Point area or Vicksburg, but wounded prisoners could also be re\u00ad turned directly to their units shortly after battle on the initiative of individual com\u00ad manders involved.\" By the fall of 1863, the effects of mal\u00ad nutrition upon invalids returning from the Richmond area via City Point were pro\u00ad nounced . As often happened, a few of the disabled men sent from City Point to An\u00ad napolis hospitals died before reaching Maryland. Many returnees had diarrhea, and chronic diarrhea was the most com\u00ad mon cause of deaths occurring soon after exchange, although pneumonia and debil\u00ad ity added to the toll. Some taken at Get\u00ad tysburg maintained that their wounds had never received medical attention . With sick prisoners returning in such precarious health, Union authorities soon realized that extraordinary measures would be nec\u00ad essary to limit suffering and the number of deaths.

Clark, reported that a contract surgeon, a contract hospital corpsman, and two nurses were serving on the truce ship.\" On an average run, the truce ship carried 600 men, only 5 percent of whom needed immediate care during the 16-to 20-hour voyage to Annapolis, and no addition to her fifty-six hospital bunks was necessary. But when the ship carried exclusively sick returnees, facilities on board were inade\u00ad quate, even when an additional ten bunks were set up on deck. By early 1864, how\u00ad ever, the Medical Department had suc\u00ad ceeded in obtaining hospital transports to move the sick and wounded. Sometimes, if the patients' condition permitted, these vessels took them beyond Annapolis to hospitals in Baltimore and Philadelphia, since even before the start of 1865, thou\u00ad sands of sick and wounded returnees whose condition was \"indescribable\" were almost overwhelming Annapolis facilities.\" In 1865, as Sherman drove north through the Carolinas, newly released prisoners , many in need of medical care, began gath\u00ad ering in Wilmington for transportation to hospitals farther north. By March 1865, 3,700 sick former captives were crowding facilities in North Carolina. The surgeon general diverted medical supplies and of\u00ad ficers intended for Sherman and Schofield to the care of the newly released prisoners. Quick attention and prompt transfer north interrupted a typhoid fever epidemic, but a shortage of clothing and bedding ren\u00ad dered the voyage arduous, and the \"wretched condition\" of many made it ad\u00ad visable in some instances to terminate it at 2, 6:446, 1161, quote from 7:1160; Ltr, McCormick to SG (17 Apr 1864), RG 112, entry 12. Fort Monroe. A contract physician at An\u00ad napolis, where many returnees from Wil\u00ad mington arrived in the spring of 1865, maintained that they were being shipped without medical attendance, crowded, and \"in a most horrible plight.\" The most des\u00ad perately sick or wounded were packed in the hold, where the ventilation was entirely inadequate. The medical officer responsi\u00ad ble for loading the ships at Wilmington , however, pointed out that it was impossible to spare a physician to accompany each ship and insisted that only those who ap\u00ad peared able to withstand the voyage were sent north. Prisoners had started arriving at Wilmington only five days after Union forces took the city, he said, but he insisted that, although the quartermaster general was initially unable to supply enough blan\u00ad kets and bedding for all returnees, those sent to Annapolis were adequately pro\u00ad vided for.40 The situation in which sick and wounded prisoner s returning through Vicksburg found themselves was similar to that in the East, and many patients died before they had been long in Union hands. Prisoners released from Andersonvi lle were in 'par\u00ad ticularly deplorable shape, almost all need\u00ad ing medical care. Exchanges were cut off during several months of 1863 while Grant was closing in on Vicksburg , but in 1865 so many prisoners were returning that the city's hospitals had to be emptied of other patients.

THE END and added still further to the strain on the evacuation system, although surgeons were able to send the 500 injured survivors on to Memphis.41 When caring for enemy prisoners rather than their own returnees, authorities in the North and South alike occasionally exhib\u00ad ited a certain vengefulne ss. The \"Instruc\u00ad tions for the government of armies of the United States in the field\" issued by the Union in April 1863 maintained that the Confederate prisoner was a \"public en\u00ad emy,\" who should be \"penitent\" and should not be coddled. Prisoners should not receive clothing beyond that absolutely necessary, regardless of whether the cloth\u00ad ing came from the federal government or from friends. In 1864 Union authorities , including Surgeon General Barnes, Gen\u00ad eral Halleck, and Secretary of War Stanton, agreed not to furnish able-bodied captives a diet any better than the one Confederate soldiers were receiving from their own army in the field. A Southern medical of\u00ad ficer fulminated against what he took to and brutality\" of the as typified by the inade\u00ad quate diet, shelter, and hospital facilities made available to Southern prisoners of war.42 Union authorities were kinder to the sick and wounded among their captives than to the able-bodied . After the battle of Gettys\u00ad burg, they ordered medical officers to en\u00ad sure that Confederate patients were treated with all the care granted Union casualties, 41WOR, seT. 1,48, pI. 1:217 and sec. 2, the oners\" and Mr. Tone,\" both 2 (1864): 188 and 190, respectively'; Ltc, Azpell to Wood (8 Apr 1865), . 2WOR, seT. 2, 6:602, 7:151, and 8:161, first and second quotes from 5:674 and third quote from 6: 102; J.

The same Southern physicians who wrote of Northern indifference and brutality noted that Union surgeons were compassionate. Speaking for the Union, General Butler in\u00ad formed Secretary of War Stanton in Feb\u00ad ruary 1864 that he had \"received less complaint of the treatment by rebels of our prisoners in hospitals than elsewhere.\" He added that he had had \"occasion to know, the treatment in the hospitals by rebels of our soldiers prisoners in their hands [has] been reasonably proper and sufficient.\"\" Although the death rate among Confed\u00ad erate soldiers in Union hands was less than that of Northern soldiers in Southern in\u00ad stitutions , more than 26,000 of 220,000 rebel captives died during the course of the war. This rate of 12 percent compared fa\u00ad vorably with the almost 18 percent char\u00ad acteristic of Confederate prisons, where 22,576 of approximately 126,950 Union 4lWOR, seT. 2, 5:676,6:98 ,106, and 8:5, first quote from 6: 149 and second and third quotes from 7:468; A.

Although they were sick as often and suffered from the same diseases as Con\u00ad federate soldiers in the field, twice as many Confederate captives died. One authority suggested that it was possible that the least healthy were the most likely to be taken prisoner. Almost 6,000 deaths in Union prisons resulted from diarrhea and dysen\u00ad tery, over 5,000 from respiratory diseases, and just under 3,500 from smallpox, mea\u00ad sles, erysipela s, scarlet fever, and similar rash-producing diseases. \" Setting the policies that governed the management of prisons and the hospitals that served them was a relatively simple matter, but the attitudes that lay behind these policies may well have contributed to the relatively high death rate in many of these institutions. Northern camps were hastily established at a time when large numbers of prisoners, many in poor health, were coming in. As a result, these camps often acquired unenviable reputations that challenged Army physicians , but improve\u00ad ments were not always immediately forthcoming . Medical inspectors and prison doctors attempted to prevent diseases at these prison camps as well as to cure them, in\u00ad specting sanitation and living condition s in the prisons and their hospitals and making recommendation s for improvements. Worst among the institutions for which they were responsible was Elmira, New York, \"a perfect pest-hole\" established in 1864, where 241 of every 1,000 prisoners died each year it was in operation. Diar\u00ad rhea and dysentery killed almost 1,400 of the 12,000 men who were at one time or \"MSH I, pI. 3:47; WOR, scr. 2, 8:948; another imprisoned at Elmira. One factor contributin g to the high disease rate was the drainage of effluent from the sinks into a pond within the camp's boundarie s. An\u00ad other was the paucity of fresh vegetables available in the diet. Since the vitamin C reserves of most of the men confined there were undoubtedly low, scurvy afflicted a large number, at one point as many as 2,000 at a time.\" Conflict between the camp commander at Elmira, Benjamin Franklin Tracy, future secretary of the Navy, and the chiefmedical officer, a surgeon of the volunteers, con\u00ad tributed to the difficulties in both the camp and the hospital attached to it. The entire medical staff, which in addition to the chief surgeon included seven contract surgeons, an assistant surgeon to a militia unit, and a New York State National Guard assistant surgeon, accused Tracy of interfering in the management of the hospital and thereby making their work more difficult. Although the Medical Department's investigation of the prison hospital confirmed the surgeons' complaints, Commissioner General of Prisoners William Hoffman concluded that all concerned , medical staff and camp com\u00ad mander alike, were incompetent. Under Hoffman' s prodding , however, Tracy im\u00ad proved camp drainage and pushed the building of better accommodations for the prisoners.47 So much illness among so many men at Elmira initially threatened to overwhelm hospital facilities regardless of what anyone could do. The hospital was still under con- 46MSH I, pt. 3:63, quote from p. 56; WOR, scr. 2, 7:465, 1093. 47Benjamin Franklin Cooling, Benjamin Franklin Tracy, Father o[ the Modem American Fighting Navy (Hamden, Conn.: Shoe String Press, Archon Book, Confederate sol\u00ad diers began arriving, and the sick among them had to lie on bare bunks. Straw for bedding and medical supplies arrived only after several weeks, but by October the hos\u00ad pital contained six new wards with an av\u00ad erage of sixty-two beds each. The completion of yet another ward in Novem\u00ad ber allowed the abandonment of an old one. Construction continued until, by the end of the year, four more hospital build\u00ad ings were approaching completion.\" Sickness was on the increase, however. Smallpox had broken out and, since a delay in the arrival of vaccine made the imme\u00ad diate immunization of the entire camp im\u00ad possible, new cases continued to appear. By 24 January 1865, 397 men had been sent to the tents hastily pitched to isolate small\u00ad pox patients, and hospital accommoda\u00ad tions remained inadequate. Perhaps motivated by the need to reduce the pop\u00ad ulation at Elmira, the surgeon in charge was less discriminating than he should have been in selecting patients for the 41-hour voyage to the exchange point, and some men broke down under the strain. Even so, the hospital remained crowded, and in Feb\u00ad ruary 1865 a medical inspector found 200 patients being cared for in their quarters when in his opinion they should have been hospitalized. In mid-March the excess hos\u00ad pital patient load was still being cared for in quarters, and more than 1,700 of 6,000 prisoners were sick. An inspector reported their condition as \"pitiable.\" Only the end of the war and the return of warm weather led to significant improvement in condi\u00ad tions at Elmira shortly before its closing late in June.\" The Medical Department regarded John- \"MSH I, pI. 3:56; WOR, scr. 2, 7:1173,1272. ~9MSH I, pt. 3:57, p. 57; WOR, ser. 2, 8:181,232. 269 son's Island, on the other hand, as one of the healthiest prisons. It opened early in 1862 on a 360-acre island near Sandusky, Ohio. Drainage was excellent, the water good, and the diet almost ideal. Most of the prisoners were officers, however, and thus may have been in better health at the time of their capture than the enlisted men who formed the majority of prisoners at camps like Elmira. The regimental surgeon in charge at Johnson's Island for much of the time it was in operation was a Union physician , but he was assisted by Confed\u00ad erate surgeons, doctors who had been serv\u00ad ing in the Confederate Army as line officers and therefore were not released. The sur\u00ad geon in charge was authorized to hire con\u00ad tract surgeons when he needed them, but the isolation of the prison made finding civilians willing to serve for $80 a month difficult. so Medical Inspector Clark found much to criticize at Johnson's Island in spite of its wholesome location and the health record of its inmates. In the fall of 1863, the hos\u00ad pital was in need of repair and improved ventilation, the wards were crowded and badly kept, more physicians were needed, and the nursing, which was probably done by prisoners , was careless. The latrines were badly maintained , and some of the beds \"in a horribly filthy condition.\" Even when improveme nts were made at the hos\u00ad pital, the camp kitchens and latrines re\u00ad mained filthy, policy in such matters having been \"left to the caprice of the pris\u00ad oners themselves,\" and the patients' cloth\u00ad ing was inadequate for cold weather. By late July 1864, although the hospital was well-policed and the patients were receiv\u00ad ing good care, the prison itself had not im\u00ad proved. The number of sick was growing rapidly, principall y because of diarrhea \"WOR, scr. 2, 3: 196 and 6:827-28; MSH I, pI. 3:54. 270 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 UNION ARMY PRISONER OF WAR CAMP, Johnson's Island, Ohio. (Courtesy of Library of Congress .) and dysentery. Under the stress of impris\u00ad onment and disease, some prisoners de\u00ad veloped scurvy, and the surgeon increased the allotment of onions to sixty pounds for every 100 men twice a week. Nevertheless, the annual sick rate of 811 per 1,000 and the death rate from all causes of 35.4 per 1,000 were less than a fifth that of the sec\u00ad ond most healthy prison.\" The health problems experienced at many of the prisons were similar\u00ad diarrhea, dysentery, fevers, respiratory dis\u00ad eases, and occasionally scurvy. At many prisons, smallpox , classified as an eruptive fever, was a minor problem, but at Alton, Illinois, it was responsible for greatly in- \"WOR, ser. 2, 6:364-66, 826-28 and 7:484-85 , tively; MSfll, pI. 3:61. creased disease and death rates. The fact that from Alton healthy prisoners were usu\u00ad ally sent quickly to other prisons, leaving their sick comrades behind, contributed to misleading statistics, but the long-lasting epidemic at Alton raised the annual sick rate to 10,000 per 1,000, compared to 1,544 at Elmira. The death rate at Alton was also higher than that at Elmira, al\u00ad though dysentery and diarrhea took a higher toll at the New York hospital. The prison surgeon at Alton had believed that he could successfully isolate his smallpox patients within the prison, and by the time he realized he was wrong, smallpox was af\u00ad flicting guards as well as inmates and was threatening the civilian population of the area as well. Despite a policy of vaccinating every new prisoner on arrival, the disease flared anew as each new group of prisoners THE END arrived, and the surgeon in charge finally concluded that the vaccine he was receiv\u00ad ing from St. Louis was worthless. The med\u00ad ical inspector who came to the prison at the end of July at the request of the des\u00ad perate medical officer recommended that a smallpox hospital be established outside the confines of the prison. In August, de\u00ad spite opposition from property owners, land was finally obtained two miles from the town and the surgeon general ordered the erection of a tent hospital. By March 1864 Alton had only five patients with smallpox, and these were all con valescent. 52 When a contagious disease appeared at a prison, the threat of its spread was not always limited to the immediate vicinity. Apparently unaffected prisoners were sometimes moved from a fort where small\u00ad pox had appeared to another or sent south for exchange. If they fell ill in transit with this highly contagious disease, they endan\u00ad gered the populations of the areas through which they moved as well as those at their destinations. In October 1863 the appear\u00ad ance of smallpox in prisoners moving to\u00ad ward City Point from Fort Delaware caused so much anxiety that delaying fu\u00ad ture exchanges from the fort seemed ad\u00ad visable. The disease at Fort Delaware apparently arrived with a prisoner from Camp Chase. Although no surgeon would permit a man obviously suffering from smallpox to travel, men known to be suf\u00ad fering from chronic diarrhea did make the journey south for exchange. Some had to be hospitalized along the route, and others died\" As the end of the war drew nearer, the challenge to prison physicians grew. New prisoners poured in, especially to facilities \"MSH I, pI. 3:50-51, 61-62, 67; WOR, 6:96, 422, 477 and 8:231. 271 in the more southern locations . The pop\u00ad ulation at Ship Island in the Mississippi River was 4,000 in April, and during the same month that at Point Lookout, be\u00ad tween the Potomac River and the Chesa\u00ad peake Bay, rose from less than 8,000 to almost 12,000. The sick and dead at Point Lookout were particularly numerous- 203 died in April, when more than 1,700 were sick. By May, when nearly 1,600 left Point Lookout, prisoners were heading home in great numbers. Sick rates remained high at Point Lookout, however, where another 1,800 were ill during May. Almost all de\u00ad tainees at Ship Island left before June, and prisoners departed from other camps so rapidly that by the end of the month rel\u00ad atively few remained except for those too sick or too weak to be moved. 54 Men in blue or gray were not the only patients for whom Medical Department physician s were responsible during 1865. The chief elected officers of both Union and Confederacy, the one an assassin's vic\u00ad tim, the other a defeated, harrassed , and ailing prisoner at Fort Monroe, received medical care at the hands of Army sur\u00ad geons. The first doctor to come to the aid of Abraham Lincoln in his box at Ford's Theater on 14 April 1865 was 23-year-old Charles Leale, assistant surgeon of the vol\u00ad unteers. It was Leale, an ardent Lincoln ad\u00ad mirer who apparently came to the theater that night only because he knew the Pres\u00ad ident would be there, who determined the nature of Lincoln's wound. Lea1e directed the efforts of two other physicians , one an Army contract surgeon, Charles Taft. Taft joined him in the President's box, attempt\u00ad ing to revive the victim by pumping his arms up and down, clearing his throat, and blowing into his mouth. The physicians re\u00ad peatedly removed the clot that clogged the \"WOR, ser. 2, 8:173, 259, 480, 482, 493,1001-02. 272 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 HOSPITAL AND PRISONER OF WAR DEPOT at Point Lookout, Maryland. (Courtesy of Library of Congress.) wound, after having noticed that their pa\u00ad tient's breathing and heart rate improved when they did so. Although they were cer\u00ad tain almost from the outset that the injury would prove fatal, one of the physicians administered a few drops of brandy. They ordered that a room nearby be procured where the President's last hours could be spent and helped carry Lincoln to a nearby house. Leale then sent for his patient's reg\u00ad ular physician and for Surgeon General Barnes. Until Barnes and Surgeon Charles Henry Crane, who would be Barnes' suc\u00ad cessor as surgeon general in 1882, arrived a short while later, Leale continued to di\u00ad rect the patient's care, which included the application of mustard plasters the length of his body. Barnes probed the wound deeply and repeatedly without encounter\u00ad ing the bullet, and agreed with the other physicians gathered around the bedside that Lincoln could not survive his injury. Crane and Taft alternated holding Lin\u00ad coln's head as they waited, and Leale was holding his patient's hand when Barnes pronounced him dead shortly after seven in the morning of 15 April.\" The physicians responsible for the health of Jefferson Davis after his capture were also military surgeons. When Davis first ar\u00ad rived at Fort Monroe on 19 May, John J. Craven, surgeon of the volunteers, reported on his health. By the time Surgeon George Cooper, former medical director for the Army of the Cumberland, assumed the SS Jim Bishop, The Day Lit/coIn Was Shot (New York: Bantam Books. 208-14, 230, 256, on Abraham Lincoln, Ms CI08, NLM; MSfl2, pI. 1:305-06.

During the two years he remained a pris\u00ad oner, the former president of the Confed\u00ad eracy suffered from a variety of conditions, his patient's health and the effect of imprisonment upon it led the officer in charge of the prison to accuse the surgeon of being \"entirely under the influence of Mr. and Mrs. Davis\" and to refer disparagingly to Mrs. Cooper's Southern connections . In making this last comment, the commandant may not have realized that Surgeon General Barnes him\u00ad self, despite his birth in Philadelphia and education in New England, also had ties with the Confederacy , for his brother had worked actively for the Southern cause.\" Conclusion In mid-1865 , only Davis and a relatively few seriously ill soldiers and prisoners of war still remained to remind Medical De\u00ad partment surgeons of the great conflict that ~6WOR. ser. 1, 52:171 and ser. 2, 8:56, 558, 571, 577,71 1,720,740,754-55,775,846,871,875,883, 919, first, second, and third quotes from 8:846, 919, and 976, respectively; James M. Phalen, Chiefs, p. 47. 274 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 had just ended. Surgeon General Barnes was occupied principall y in preparing his organization for a return to peacetime sta\u00ad tus. The Quiet was welcome after the tu\u00ad multuou s last months of the war. Returning prisoners in fragile health had poured in. Grant's army in its final drive had moved so rapidly that the countryside between Pe\u00ad tersburg and Appomattox had been strewn with wounded, Union and Confederate. Sherman had once again covered great dis\u00ad tances with a minimum of medical sup\u00ad plies. Ambulances had been in short supply and many vehicles in poor repair. Although prisons were not managed with the health of their occupants as the main considera-tion, nor campaigns planned with the care of the wounded as the prime concern, the Medical Department had functioned as ef\u00ad fectively in prisons as it had in the field under conditions it could not control. But now the war was over; it continued to exist only in the memory of survivors and in an enormous volume of records that would as the years went by be compiled, published, and studied, so that from this hideous con\u00ad flict, something worthwhile might still emerge. 57 HSGO, pp. 244-45. CHAPTER 13 Achievements and Failures During the Civil War The Medical Department had intended that its detailed and copious records con\u00ad cerning the Union's sick and wounded guarantee the emergence of something of value to medical science as well as to the Army from the most frightful conflict that the nation had ever faced. During the strug\u00ad gle and the months immediate ly following it, more than 12,000 medical officers\u00ad regulars, volunteers, and contract\u00ad examined over 250,000 wounds and treated more than 7 million cases of dis\u00ad ease. In the course of their duties, more than 300 Army surgeons died from wounds, disease, or accidents .' In spite of their heavy case loads, many were able to record what they saw for pos\u00ad terity. The value of their observations , however, was to some degree negated by the fact that they, like their civilian coun\u00ad terparts, knew little of bacteria and the methods by which one microscopic crea\u00ad ture could be clearly distinguished from an\u00ad other. Furthermore , the heavy demands placed on Army surgeons left little time for the careful consideration of the signifi\u00ad cance of what they saw. As a result, their observations were haphazard and often of little value. Since surgery was usually per\u00ad formed in great haste and under difficult 'Brown, , pp. 245-46; MSfl2, pl. 3:1, 3-4, 910. circumstances, there was also little time available for trying new or intricate tech\u00ad niques. The frightening mortality that re\u00ad sulted from infection obscured the possible achievem ents of new approaches to sur\u00ad gery. The most important progress made by the Medical Department during the Civil War involved practical matters of or\u00ad ganization and administration and resulted in the creation of an effective and efficient medical department for the large and ac\u00ad tive Union Army.' Disease In the nineteenth century, disease ex\u00ad acted a heavy toll when large groups of men were gathered closely together under con\u00ad ditions of stress and poor sanitation. In the Civil War, it killed twice as many men as battle. The conflict thus provided millions of cases of various diseases for study, but Union surgeons, like their counterparts everywhere, were still unable to distinguish harmless organisms from those causing dis\u00ad ease-the developments that would make this possible were yet to come.' 2MSU 2, pI. 3: 1. 3-4, 910; Phyllis Allen, \"Etiological Theory in America Prior to the Civil War,\" JOllrnal 0/ the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences (1947):514.

More than 1.6 million cases of diarrhea and dysentery were diagnosed in the Union Army, and an average of 14.31 per 1,000 mean strength died from it. A Union medical officer found \"the preva\u00ad lence of diarrhoea s among the rebel pris\u00ad oners ... absolutely astonishing. \" But the gradual realization that living organisms might be causing this and other major problems would gain impetus only after the Civil War. Lacking the staining and cul\u00ad turing techniques available a few decades later, physicians were also unable to com\u00ad pile records that would enable the modern scientist to identify positively the orga\u00ad nisms responsible for the Union Army's ep\u00ad idemics It seems probable that Entamoeba Shigella, Giar\u00ad dia, Salmonella, and the soldiers of 1861-1865. Never\u00ad theless, fourteen years after the end of the war, Joseph Janvier Woodward , editor of the volume on dysentery and since 1864 a pioneer in the art of staining specimens, was still skeptical about the possibility that minuscule forms of life could be causing diarrhea and dysentery. He, like others of his contemporaries, refused to take seri\u00ad ouslyan 1876 publication maintaining that an ameba might be capable of causing this disease.' 4Quote from \"Chronic Diarrhoea at pt. 2; Researches ... ,\" American JOl/mal o/Ihe Since they did not know what was really causing diarrhea and dysentery, medical officers had little chance of devising a cure. Shrewd observation based on trial and er\u00ad ror was the only hope for progress, but they were also handicapped by their apparent assumption that dysentery was a single dis\u00ad ease. Although occasional success was re\u00ad ported with the use of ipecacuanha, which is effective against amebiasis , when trials at a Washington hospital proved disap\u00ad pointing, this drug was rarely used. Among other medicines used to treat diarrhea, opi\u00ad um was often mistrusted, especially after medical officers began to realize it was only a palliative and not a cure. Bismuth sub\u00ad nitrate, also somewhat effective in easing the symptoms of dysentery , was used with caution because the presence of arsenic as an impurity was \"exceedingly common.\" Strychnine, oil of turpentin e, and cathar\u00ad tics, including mercurials and castor oil, were among other remedies tried without success. A few surgeons used lead acetate, but the very genuine risk of lead poisoning made many others reluctant to try it. Since malaria could cause diarrhea, quinine was \"extensively employed,\" and \"with a lib\u00ad eral hand.\" Although they had little control over the purity of the water the men drank in the field, doctors took great care to en\u00ad sure the purity of the water their dysentery patients consumed, preferring rainwater, distilled water, or boiled water, or, as a last resort, the addition of a little claret to what\u00ad ever was available . Their efforts to treat dysentery and diarrhea were to no avail, however. Although only I in 178 dysentery patients died in the first year of the war, Medical Sciences 49 (1865):106-13.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND FAILURES DURING THE CIVIL WAR 277 by June 1865, when long campaigns, dis\u00ad ease, and deprivation had weakened many soldiers, 1 in 29 was failing to survive.' The most effective steps taken against the diarrheal diseases involved sanitation . Without knowing precisely why, military experts had long realized that filth, espe\u00ad cially when large numbers of men were grouped together, was associated with dis\u00ad ease. But in an army composed largely of amateurs, enforcing strict standards of san\u00ad itation and hygiene posed great problems. When many were amicted with diarrhea, these problems became even more urgent, both in hospitals and in camps. Officers often ignored regulations requiring the dig\u00ad ging of sinks for every camp. Men ignored trenches that were dug for this purpose, which were \"often so badly managed that it was disgusting to use them.\" When drink\u00ad ing water came from shallow wells, pollu\u00ad tion was inevitable, and typhoid as well as diarrhea and dysentery resulted. The need for improved camp sanitation inspired san\u00ad itary commissions from the beginning of hostilities, and with time, and perhaps as the men themselves began to understand the importance of sanitation, the number of diarrheal cases per 1,000 men began to drop, from 770 in the year ending June 1862 to 686 three years later, and this de\u00ad spite the rising death rate.6 lMSH I, pt. 2, first Quote from p. 793, remaining quotes from p. 800; Woodward, Outlines, pp. 216-17, 222, 229; Charles Beneulyn Johnson, Muskets and Medicine, or Army Life in the Sixties (Philadelphia: F.

Wishing to reduce the amount of even temporary disabilit y caused by malaria, Union surgeons contin\u00ad ued to experiment with the prophylactic use of quinine, mixing the dose with whis\u00ad key to increase its attractions. It was not always possible, however, to obtain enough of both ingredients , and even when several times the normal dose of three to eight grains was administered daily, fever parox\u00ad ysms might still occur. The disease was re\u00ad ported to return with even greater severity if the prophylactic doses were stopped once started, and prophylactic quinine never be\u00ad came routine.7 The Medical Department's interest in malaria extended to the question of the rel\u00ad ative susceptibi lity of blacks and whites. Perhaps on the assumption that blacks were less likely to be disabled by this dis\u00ad ease, the Army tended to send black regi\u00ad ments to areas with higher malaria rates.

The death rate for blacks with malaria was twice that of whites suffering from that disease, but he remained convinced that blacks had a lesser susceptibility to malaria than whites, a belief that modern research has to some extent confirmed.8 Typhoid was yet another disease about which medical officers discovered little that was new during the Civil War, despite devastating epidemics. Although many sol\u00ad diers coming from the North were exposed to both typhoid and malaria at essentially the same time, the announcement that the resultant collection of symptoms consti\u00ad tuted typhomalarial fever merely added to the confusion. Medical officers, though aware of the connection between poor san\u00ad itation and typhoid, remained as much mystified by the disease in 1865 as in 1861. The data collected in the Medical and Sur\u00ad gical History did, however, help Army phy\u00ad sicians after the war to realize that water was indeed one source of typhoid infections ' Smallpox was no longer the formidable threat it had been during the American Revolution , but medical officers still had to treat many cases, since an average of 5.5 per 1,000 mean strength among whites and 36.6 among blacks contracted the disease. It was not always possible to immunize im\u00ad mediately the thousands of volunteer troops who came pouring in, and doctors were already aware that periodic revaccin\u00ad ation was necessary if the spread of small\u00ad pox was to be prevented. Surgeons learned that possible complications made it advis- 'Bi,pham, Malaria, pp. 34, 119; MSJ{ I, pI. 3:12-13, 80, 85, 89, 92, 107, 109, 110-11. 'MSJ{ I, pI. 3:372-73, 375, 494; Kenneth F.

They also discovered that vaccine could be safely preserved and shipped in narrow glass tubes, three inches or less in length, for each dose so stored. Because of the efforts of the Medical De\u00ad partment, during the autumn of 1863 and the winter of 1864 more people were vac\u00ad cinated than had ever been immunized be\u00ad fore in a comparab le period of time.lo The inroads of other diseases, including the very prevalent respiratory infections that also affiicted Union soldiers, were rel\u00ad atively easy to appreciate, but the effects of a deficient diet were not. Medical offi\u00ad cers, helpless to solve the transportation problems that led to the deficiency, were well aware that the standard ration of the soldier in the field was likely to lead to scurvy, although they were not aware that the soldier who refused to eat desiccated vegetables was also in danger of suffering from a lack of vitamin A. Surgeons usually recognized cases of scurvy at its worst, but the less obvious effects of subclinical scurvy were hard to pinpoint. As a result, one can only conjecture about precisely how much the vigor and effectiveness of troops in the field were affected by the depression and lethargy that accompanied the earliest stages of a vitamin C defi\u00ad ciency, since they could have resulted from or been reinforced by other health prob\u00ad lems as well. It is difficult, too, to estimate to what extent a deficient diet, sometimes low in protein and calorie content as well as in vitamins, contributed to the prolon\u00ad gation of other ills, to the failure of injuries to heal, and to devastation wrought by \"MSJ{ I, pI. 3:625-27,635,638; F.

A Sanitary Com\u00ad mission official familar with the problems caused by scurvy commented , however, that \"The pecuniary loss to the nation, by badly regulated and insufficient army ra\u00ad tion, constitutes one of the great burdens of taxation now pressing upon the people.\" II Although the Army did what it could to treat the sick, many soldiers returned to their homes and to civilian life with their health permanently impaired by chronic disease. Usually the lingering illness in\u00ad volved diarrhea that, even when inactive, hung like the sword of Damocles over the veteran's head, likely to fall when' his body was overstressed. Many deaths from dys\u00ad entery acquired during the war occurred in peacetime in soldiers whose health de\u00ad clined slowly even after they returned to their families. Veterans suffering from ma\u00ad laria acquired when they were far from their northern homes became a potential source of infection for local Anopheles mos\u00ad quitoes. A study of former soldiers in Mas\u00ad sachusetts made in the 1890s showed that they also suffered from such diseases as tu\u00ad berculosis and rheumatism at a rate far greater than that of the general popUlation of that state. The rate of diarrhea and dys\u00ad entery among veterans was almost fifty-six times that among the rest of the popula\u00ad tion, that of rheumatism five times, that of heart and circulatory problems six times (possibly as a legacy of streptococca l infec\u00ad tions), and that of consumption twice. There was no indication, however, whether \"USSC, Surgical Memoirs 1:51, 88, 274, 276. 278, quote from 278; USSC, Document s I, no. 17:11-12; MSH I, pt. 3:68-70, 684, 705-07, 713.

Except for improved sanitation, they could do little to prevent diseases other than smallpox, but their renewed ap\u00ad preciation for sanitation undoubtedly con\u00ad tributed to a marked drop in the disease rate in the postwar Army as compared with the prewar force. Despite voluminous rec\u00ad ords, medical officers made no significant progress during the Civil War toward find\u00ad ing ways in which to' prevent or cure the diseases that ravaged the Union Army.\" Injection and Wounds Although aware that scurvy or even a scorbutic taint delayed healing, medical of\u00ad ficers were ignorant of how infections spread from wound to wound. As a result, they were initially unable' to combat the horrors of what now appear often to have been streptococcal infections. These bac\u00ad teria spread through hospital wards, turn\u00ad ing even small wounds into gaping, oozing pits of hospital gangrene, poisoning the bloodstream , and spreading the rash of er\u00ad ysipelas among wounded and unwounded alike. On the basis of the many cases they saw during the war, some surgeons did be\u00ad gin to suspect that these infections as well as scarlet fever, rheumatism , and some forms of heart disease might all be related, \"MSH I, pI. 2:651 and pI. 3:77-78, 82; Johnson, Muskets and Medicine. p. 170; John S.

Some had a very high mortality ; of 2,812 cases diagnosed as pyemia, a systemic infection, 2,747 were fatal. Surgeons recorded surprising ly few cases of tetanus, but much gangrene, which killed 45 percent of its victims and neces\u00ad sitated surgery that would not otherwise have been performed. Of the wounded af\u00ad flicted with erysipelas with its spreading areas of swollen, em purpled skin, 41 per\u00ad cent died. Surgeons observed once again that patients in tent hospitals suffered less from infection than those housed indoors and that good ventilation reduced the in\u00ad fection rate. Although some theorized that erysipelas spread through the blood, many were convinced that it moved through the air, noting that it seemed to spread in the direction the wind was blowing.

Hospital gangrene, probably caused by Streptococcus pyogenes , had such a rapid and horrible effect on wounds that it in\u00ad spired both dread and strong efforts to find a cure. The skin around gangrenous wounds sloughed off, revealing flesh that slowly turned \"reddish, greenish, purplish, or black,\" while the gray edges of the open\u00ad ing grew wider at the rate of half an inch an hour. Arteries and even bones were rap\u00ad idly exposed and the stench of rotten meat filled the air. As his skin turned gray the patient's breath became sickly sweet, his body alternated between chills and sweats, and his pulse grew ever faster, ever feebler. So great was the fear of the spread of this infection that in several areas medical of\u00ad ficers established special facilites to isolate its victims.16 Gas gangrene was not the infection that caused so much alarm in the military hos\u00ad pitals of the Civil War. Civil War records reveal that one of the most terrifying as\u00ad pects of hospital gangrene was the rapidity with which it spread from patient to pa\u00ad tient, but gas gangrene is not contagious. The presence of a clostridial infection can\u00ad not be ruled out, however, especially since the occasional mention of a sweetish odor from the wounds strongly suggests its pres\u00ad ence. We know, however, that less than a third of all wounds become infected with clostridia , and only 5 percent of these ac\u00ad tually develop gas gangrene. Gas gangrene, moreover , tends to appear in deep wounds, especially when damage to major blood vessels has reduced the oxygen supply to the muscles, a type of injury that during the Civil War usually led to relatively prompt amputation before gas gangrene 16Quote from Goldsmith, Gangrene, pp. 25, 27.

Apparently find\u00ad ing bromine the easiest to use, surgeons be\u00ad gan applying it to wounds and the rash of erysipelas, vaporizing it to disinfect the air, Co., 1965), Wintrobe et aI., Harrison's PrinCiples, ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 HOSPITAL GANGRENE as illustrated in the Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion. and mIxing it with glycerine for internal use, not thinking, however, to use it to ster\u00ad ilize instruments. One successful technique involved inserting bromine on wooden sticks into diseased tissue; another called for injecting bromine by hypodermic into healthy tissue bordering the infected area. These procedures could cause so much pain as to require the use of anesthesia. Used in adequate strength and quantity, bromine prevented the spread of gangrene both in the individua l patient and among patients. Although some surgeons using bromine reported that deaths from hospital gangrene had been entirely eliminated, others remained skeptical and apparently regarded the approach as something of a fad.\" \"Wangcnstccn and Wangcnsteen , Rise of Surgery, Attempts to find the cause of hospital gangrene and other infections met with less success than efforts to find a cure. Micro\u00ad scopic studies revealed an elevated white blood cell count in the victims of hospital gangrene , but beyond that \"only the ordi\u00ad nary bacteria which are to be observed in every decomposing animal substance.\" This last comment, although strange to modern ears, was the natural result of ig\u00ad norance about the range and variety of disease-causing organisms and the absence of stains and other techniques that would emphasize the characteristics of cells seen under the microscope .\" The injuries that were the sites of such grim infections usually resulted not from bayonet or saber but from the slow-moving minie ball, which shattered bone and crushed soft tissues, carrying into the body bacteria-laden bits of clothing and other debris. A few minie balls were actually ex\u00ad plosive and, while shattering bone still fur\u00ad ther, embedded bits of copper, lead, and pewter in the shredded flesh. Many victims bled to death on the battlefield. Even with\u00ad out infection, the fractures caused by the minie ball would challenge a twentieth cen\u00ad tury orthopedist.

One area of experimentation involved the hermetic sealing of chest wounds. Although this pro\u00ad cedure gave instant relief for breathing dif\u00ad ficulties and bleeding, it also eliminated the possibility of external drainage and thus provided no improvement in the man\u00ad agement of infection. Many surgeons vig\u00ad orously opposed its use. Another area of relatively intense study involved nerve in\u00ad juries.

He experimented also with hypodermic injections of atro\u00ad pine to ease muscle spasms. In this facility he took thou sands of pages of notes in prep\u00ad aration for later publication .\" Since such a large proportion of wounds involved the extremities, much of the data collected on wartime surgery dealt with amputation , excision (the removal of a ma\u00ad jor portion of bone), and attempts to pre\u00ad serve bone essentially intact.

Sandbags and elongated box splints limited motion during transportation, and several different kinds of splint were used in the hospital, including one designed by an Army surgeon. In cases where the femur, or thigh bone, was fractured, extension or traction devices were rarely used. Such treatment might prevent solid contact be\u00ad tween the broken ends and thus inhibit or preclude healing, but without it, a leg tended to mend inches shorter than it had been and at times could be badly deformed as well. Other complications included ab\u00ad scesses and sinuses or abnormal channels that lasted for years and drained the pa\u00ad tient's strength, and splinters of shattered bone left in the wound that continued to work their way to the surface, adding to the patient's lingering anguish.

Although there was much disagree\u00ad ment on the value of a conservative approach to the managem ent of shot frac\u00ad tures, the mortality of patients chosen for conservat ive treatment proved less than that of those treated with excision or am\u00ad putation. In a series of 386 men with shot fractures of the hip, for example, 249 of 304, or 82 percent, treated conservatively died, but 53 of 55, or 96 percent, undergo\u00ad ing excision failed to survive, and 25 of27, or almost 93 percent, enduring amputation died.

One surgeon maintained that he had seen the entire shaft of the tibia (the principal bone of the lower leg) regener\u00ad ated. Even without regeneration, however, an arm could be surprisingly useful despite the removal ofa large amount of bone, and doctors regarded any function as better than none.

In one such case, although Army doctors considered the result to be satis\u00ad factory, a pension examiner recommended amputation in 1867. Excision became less popular as the war went on-the chances for infection were great, the period of heal\u00ad ing was long, and the results, except in the instances when the usefulness of a hand was retained, were questionable, if not ac\u00ad tually disastrous. The death rate, further\u00ad more, was comparable to or greater than that in amputations, with pyemia the chief danger and hemorrhage a significant problem's Although occasional reports of excessive enthusiasm for amputations did surface during the Civil War, this form of surgery \"MSfl2, pI. 2:518, 548, 563, 611-12, 670, 966, 3:874-76; USSC, Papers I :5-7; \"Conservative Surgery,\" American Medical Times 3 (1861):295. 286 THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT , 1818-1865 was apparently often undertaken only after careful consideration of the alternatives. Excision was generally viewed as the least desirable choice, however, in cases where there was damage to the upper leg, and damage to a joint was often regarded as necessitating amputation. The records con\u00ad cerning the number of amputations per\u00ad formed are not complete, but the figure was at least 30,000. The most common am\u00ad putation was that of the hand or fingers, while the highest fatality rate, of 83.3 per\u00ad cent, occurred after amputation at the hip joint. Surgeons discovered that amputation at the knee took a surprisingly high toll of 57.2 percent, and even amputation of the lower arm was followed by the deaths of 20.7 percent of those operated on. Consid\u00ad erable difference of opinion existed as to how the amputation was to be performed in any event, with many favoring a flap pro\u00ad cedure that could be quickly done on the field and involved less danger from bleed\u00ad ing than the circular form of the operation. Some surgeons favored immediate opera\u00ad tion, others a very brief wait until the first shock had worn off. The surgery itself was apparent ly a rapid procedure even though anesthesia was generally used. A hip am\u00ad putation reportedly took two minutes, in\u00ad cluding the time needed to tie off the femoral artery.26 Some surgeons were still a little wary of anesthesia, however, and avoided its use when the patient's condition was very poor. Few deaths were actually blamed on these agents, but surgeons noted the adverse ef\u00ad fects on appetite and the nausea and vom\u00ad iting that followed their use. Some continued to believe that anesthesia pre- \"MSH 2, pt. 2:746 and pt. ld, Mo.,\" American Medical Times 3 (1861 ):364. vented quick healing and therefore led in\u00ad directly to increased rates of infection and hemorrhage. Nevertheless , by the time of the Civil War, most Army surgeons, even conservative Surgeon General Thomas Lawson, had accepted its use.\" Anesthetics were used in at least 80,000 cases during the Civil War. More than 76 percent of the time the agent used was chlo\u00ad roform, but ether was popular in general hospitals , and a combination of ether and chloroform was used in 9.1 percent of the cases. A failure to use any form of anes\u00ad thesia was recorded only 254 times. The debate over which anesthetic to use cen\u00ad tered around the difficulties and dangers involved. Deaths from chloroform aver\u00ad aged 5.4 per 1,000 cases, those from ether 3 per 1,000. Ether was flammable and par\u00ad ticularly hazardous when operations were performed by candlelight, while chloro\u00ad form caused some inexplicable deaths, al\u00ad though it was easy to take and even a small amount acted with considerable speed. Surgeons well aware of its dangers and its reputation still preferred to use this anes\u00ad thetic, although they did so with care, at\u00ad tempting to limit the length of time it was administered and to ensure that an ade\u00ad quate amount of air was inhaled with it\" An anesthetic, whether ether, chloro\u00ad form, or a mixture 27Hamilton .

ACHIEVEMENTS AND FAILURES DURING THE CIVIL WAR 287 ently usually administered by means of an impregnated cloth, which might have been rolled into a cone with an anesthetic\u00ad soaked sponge at its apex, held over the mouth and nose. Experience taught medi\u00ad cal officers that in the open air where so many amputations were performed, merely pouring an anesthetic on a cloth was not effective. Premedication, if given, might take the form of a dose of whiskey. As a rule no ill effects resulted from the inhal\u00ad ation of an anesthetic. On occasion, how\u00ad ever, a patient inhaling chloroform would begin to make convulsive movements, and the veins in his neck would start to swell. The physician would often note that his patient's heart was either at the point of arrest or had already stopped beating. In such cases, respiration soon also ceased, and all the efforts of doctors and nurses were often to no avail. It was only in March 1865, however, that the surgeon general was sufficiently disturbed over the problem of anesthesia deaths to order his surgeons to report on their experiences with these agents.29 In addition to anesthetics, medical offi\u00ad cers used analgesics, including both alcohol and opiates, in their battle against pain. Alcohol was used not only to relax a patient before the administration of anesthetics, but also to serve as a vehicle for quinine. Some physicians, including Letterman , feared that this free use of alcohol could induce addiction or mask symptoms, but alcoholism did not become a significant problem during the Civil War. Authorities should perhaps have been more concerned about the possible overuse of opiates, since 29Frederick E. Lente, \"Sulphuric Ether as an An~ Times 4 (1862):36 MSH2, pI. 3:888; 890-91, J. H.

Opium itself had long been prescribed for diarrhea, but dur\u00ad ing the Civil War morphine was also dusted in wounds or administered by hypodermic. Occasional mention was also made during this period of the use of cannabis for pa\u00ad tients with tetanus or head injuries.'o The hypodermic, apparently used chiefly to inject morphine , was one of a few new devices slowly gaining in popularity in the Army during the Civil War. It was regarded to some extent as experimenta l. Although the Medical Department did have clinical thermometers, they were not in common use, and the model available was very long, intended for use in the armpit. Such in\u00ad struments as hemostatic forceps, retrac\u00ad tors, and dilators were not available, and few doctors knew how to use an ophthal\u00ad moscope or laryngoscope. Microscopes were few and far between. Real progress, however, was being made in the design of artificial limbs, enabling crippled soldiers to walk with only a limp or, with the aid of gloves, to conduct their lives with few aware that they had lost a hand or an arm. A relatively new development was mobility in the ankle of an artificial leg. A device developed by one firm for patients with re\u00ad sections of the elbow or shoulder was so effective that it permitted a greater reliance on this form of surgery as opposed to am- 3OWoodward, Ou/lilles, p. 170; Hall, Researches, p. 173; MSH I, pI.

Medical officers also developed considerab le ingenuity in devising for those whose lower jaws had been torn away prostheses that limited drooling and made taking liquids possible. The actual selec\u00ad tions of the firms to make prostheses and of the designs to be used was apparently significantly influenced by a committee of distinguished doctors appointed by Sur\u00ad geon General Hammond. The soldier whose artificial limb was approved by the Medical Department could choose any limb costing $50 or less from one of several authorized manufacturers. \" The benefits to medical science arising from the Civil War are not easily estab\u00ad lished, but undoubtedly the civilian pop\u00ad ulation profited from the presence of surgeons like S. Weir Mitchell and his col\u00ad leagues who had received more training and experience during that conflict than they would otherwise have had in a life\u00ad time. Although the records and specimens that would form the Medical and Surgical History, and the Army Medical Museum were of little help in improving the care of the sick or wounded during the struggle, both would be of value to future genera\u00ad tions, just as would be the techniques in staining specimens for the microscope and JIMSH I, pt. 3:965; MSH 2, pt. 1:398; Ltrs, Brinton to Barnes (8 Dec 1864), RG 112, entry 12.

A more effective use of the department's newly huge medi\u00ad cal staff was but one of its achievements. Great flexibility proved necessary to care for the enormous numbers of sick and wounded that poured in from battlefield s and camps, both east and west. No ratio of surgeons to men that would be adequate under all circumstances could be efficiently established for a given unit. To deal with this situation, the Department departed from the Mexican War pattern to create positions for surgeons and assistant sur\u00ad geons of the volunteers, who could be as\u00ad signed as needed and whose qualifications were determined by the Medical Depart\u00ad ment. More than 500 of these physicians worked with a Regular Army staff num\u00ad bering less than half that figure. Almost 6,000 regimental medical officers, whose qualifications were initially ascertained at the state level, also served at one time or another in the Union Army. An equivalent number of civilian doctors unwilling or un\u00ad able to join the Army worked as contract surgeons, either for short periods when ne\u00ad cessity dictated or in general hospitals in the cities where they lived. Although a few Army doctors, especially in the early months of the war, earned unenviable rep\u00ad utations, the Department was apparently J2Henry, Armed Forces Illstillite, pp. 34-39; Ander\u00ad son Hunter ill the (Cambridge , Mass.: Belknap Press of Harvard Uni\u00ad versity, 1957), p. 129. ACHIEVEMENTS AND FAILURES DURING THE CIVIL WAR 289 able to gather a medical staff that was on the whole highly regarded. The new type of organization, where regular medical of\u00ad ficers shared their responsibilities at all lev\u00ad els with a large volunteer staff, was needed more in war than in peace, but it blazed a trail that would not be forgotten.3J The war also served to emphasize the ne\u00ad cessity for abandoning the customary hap\u00ad hazard approach to the problem of providing an adequate number of hospital attendants , nurses, clerks, and guards. Ex\u00ad pecting to find a sufficient number of able and disciplined men and women to work in hospitals on short notice proved unrea\u00ad sonable. Complaints about the caliber of the nurses rounded up to care for military patients were numerous , yet by the end of the war, the problem remained only par\u00ad tially resolved. Line officers understand\u00ad ably resented having to leave healthy and competent men behind to care for the sick. As the war progressed and the number of invalids grew, the Invalid Corps signifi\u00ad cantly eased the staffing shortage, but few were available early in the war. Since these men had no training in the care of the sick, their usefulness was limited. Moreover , few women had any formal training in nursing, although their practical experience in car\u00ad ing for their families stood many in good stead. The obvious need for professiona l training of nurses influenced those respon\u00ad sible for staffing civilian hospitals after the war, not only to give nurses the expertise needed but also to separate the dedicated from the dilettante. Of the latter, many had found their way to the hospitals in the guise of nurses during the Wound Dresser ... (Boston: Small, 3:958; The Medical Department also intro\u00ad duced greater system into the management of field hospitals. Early in the war, surgeons started organizing these facilities princi\u00ad pally on a division basis rather than a reg\u00ad imental one. Medical officers also established small stations near the battle\u00ad field and evacuation hospitals at rail depots or near wharves along waterways. Tents, marked as hospitals by yellow flags with green numerals , became an increasingly common sight in the field, since they of\u00ad fered many advantages over the buildings that might be available near a battlefield. They could be pitched in an hour by some\u00ad one familiar with them, and although those designed for hospital use could accom\u00ad modate only eight patients comfortab ly, their design permitted two or more to be joined to serve larger numbers of wounded. Smaller tents could be used to shelter med\u00ad ical officers and medical and kitchen sup\u00ad plies. Surgeons found that there was less infection among patients sheltered in tents, where in good weather the walls could be raised to achieve perfect ventilation. An ex\u00ad perienced Army surgeon concluded , \"One of the most valuable lessons taught by the experienc e of the American War of 1861-65 was the demonstration of the ines\u00ad timable value of the tent as a hospital.\" Unlike field hospitals , base or general hospitals were located almost entirely in buildings , although tents were occasionally Whitman , The Wound Dresser, pp. 42-43; Charles S.

In a former hotel or barracks, no amount of purification , clean\u00ad ing, and disinfecting could disguise the odors that spoke of inadequate ventilation. Maximum efficiency by a large staff, fur\u00ad thermore , was impossible in a badly de\u00ad signed building; every 1,000 patients required a staff of 20 wardmasters, 100 nurses,5 or 6 cooks, 8 to 10 assistant cooks, 4 or 5 launderers with occasional assis\u00ad tants, 3 or 4 bakers, 10 to 15 men to run the stables and shops, 3 or 4 more men to manage the morgue and cemetery, lOin the headquarters and library, about 15 physi\u00ad cians, and an undetermined number of medical cadets, all under the command of a regular or volunteer medical officer.\" \"MSH I, pI. 3:956-57; MSH 2, pI. 3:902, 908; As a result of the inconvenience and the sanitation problems involved in using ex\u00ad isting buildings to house general hospitals , the Army began to design and erect struc\u00ad tures intended from the outset for this pur\u00ad pose. Small post facilitie s had been designed and built specifica lly to house sick and wounded soldiers ever since the days of Lovell, but the Medical Department had never before encountered such a pressing need to design very large hospitals. Exper\u00ad iments undertaken in its drive to create them contributed considerab ly to civilian medicine too. The concept of the pavilion hospital was later adopted by such famous institutions as the Johns Hopkins Hospital, for which John Shaw Billings, who as a Woodward , Outlines, p. 120; Northern MOllfhly(no. 2, Dec 1864), in U.S. Armory Square General Hospital , Washington , D.C., Orders, Correspondence, and Printed Matter, 1862-1869, Ms C60, p. 191, NLM.

Since the separation could result in ad\u00ad ministrative problems , various arrange\u00ad ments of the pavilions were tried to achieve the best combination of good ventilation and efficiency. On occasion, a hybrid hos\u00ad pital design was created by adding pavil\u00ad ions to a preexisting structure, which was HMitchell. \"Medical Department ,\" p. 1446; MS/-I I, pt. 3:896-98; Fielding H.

Some of the earliest facilities, hastily erected, were of frail construction as well as poor design, and their walls even\u00ad tually required buttressing to prevent their collapse. One design that proved satisfac\u00ad tory called for pavilions 24 to 25 feet wide and 12 to 14 feet high, which represente d a 7-foot increase in width and a 4-to 6- foot increase in height over the earliest models, with the length cut from 200 feet to 150 feet. This plan also called for ridge ventilation on well-spaced buildings. \" Hospital designers believed that the ideal facility would consist of one-story build\u00ad ings set 3 to 4 feet above ground level where each patient had 1,000 cubic feet of air. In warm weather, ventilators at the ridge of the roof, sheltered from the rain by a small roof of their own, would keep the air cir\u00ad culating, and open corridors would add to the fresh air available. Cold weather ven_ tilation would be achieved by closing shut\u00ad ters in the ridges and using a system of shafts that minimized the loss of the heat generated by stoves.39 Although city water and city sewers were available to some general hospitals, the problems involved in achieving sanitation goals, already difficult when so many pa\u00ad tients suffered from diarrhea, were in some instances exacerbate d by water shortages and the need to dispose of patient waste without city plumbing . The Medical De\u00ad partment was forced to experiment with so\u00ad lutions to such difficulties.

ACHIEVEMENTS AND FAILURES DURING THE CIVIL WAR 293 the latrine was flushed two or three times a day and emptied by pipe into a deep cov\u00ad ered pit some distance from the buildings. When hospital effiuvia was discharged near the building or retained any length of time within it, odor became a problem, a par\u00ad ticularly alarming one because doctors as\u00ad sumed that with odor came infection.'\u00b7 As a rule, base hospitals sheltered pa\u00ad tients suffering from every kind of disease, wound, and infection, but a few specialized facilities were beginning to appear. One such facility was the hospital in Philadel\u00ad phia, where Mitchell, Moorehouse, and Keen studied patients with neurological and nervous problems. In 1863 the Army also established an eye and ear hospital in St. Louis, while in Nashville patients with erysipelas had their own facility. At Wil\u00ad mington, Delaware, patients who had lost feet or toes to frostbite were hospitalized together, and in the fall of 1862 Surgeon General Hammond ordered the establish\u00ad ment of a facility for \"mutilated soldiers\" in New York City.\" Innovative thought was as necessary in dealing with evacuation as it was with hos\u00ad pitalization. The enormity of the conflict made it plain early in the war that the cas\u00ad ual approach of peacetime would not be adequate for the wounded and sick of 1861-1865. The two-wheeled ambulance proved too fragile and too uncomfortable for wide use on the battlefield . The Army was forced to experiment to find a convey\u00ad ance that could move the wounded quickly from the battlefield to the nearest aid sta\u00ad tion and sturdier models to move them thence the longer distance to a hospital, hospital train, or hospital transport.

Gen. Daniel H. Rucker, a Quartermaster's Department officer. Mule litters of varying design were also tried, but without signif\u00ad icant success. The best stretcher proved to be one weighing less than twenty-four pounds and designed to be carried by man rather than beast. 42 The Medical Department also discov\u00ad ered that it was highly desirable to have trains and ships equipped specifically for the evacuation of the wounded.

In Sherman's army, civilians hired by the Quartermaster's Department served as conductors and train crew, while enlisted men served as cooks and nurses. The Medical Department staff present on such a train usually consisted of a surgeon in charge, an assistant surgeon, and a hos\u00ad pital steward. Clearly identified by its bright red smokestack , engine, and tender, and its three red lanterns at night, the hos\u00ad pital train was apparently never molested by the enemy. The various sanitary com-missions also helped outfit specially equipped hospital ships and provided more vessels of their own when necessary\" Although the most important obstacle had been surmounted when the Medical Department recognized the simple fact that a formal organization, careful plan\u00ad ning, and trained and disciplined personnel \"MSH 2, pt. 3:959, 961, 964, 970-73, 977-98; John E.

Let\u00ad terman's struggle to have the ambulance corps placed under the command of med\u00ad ical officers succeeded in the Army of the Potomac only with General McClellan's support, and his approach was officially adopted throughout the Army late in the war. Medical Department control over hos\u00ad pital transport ~ was not generally conceded until early 1865. The improvements in the management of hospitalization and evacuation achieved during the course of the Civil War were considerable. By the end of the war, evac\u00ad uation tended to be as prompt and as sys\u00ad tematic as the military situation permitted . As a result, the number of regimental med\u00ad ical officers and attendants drawn away from the battlefield was minimal, and the need for tents and equipment for field and depot hospitals was limited. Although many patients still had to endure the heavy ride of Army wagons for short distances, increasing numbers made the major por\u00ad tion of their journey north or east in the comfort of well-appointed hospital ships or trains. The hospitals they stayed in along the way were more likely to be efficiently organized, and there was a better chance that the hospitals they reached at the end of their trip would be carefully designed and ventilated institutions where the staff was able to work with maximum efficiency. In 1865 Army surgeons remained to a large degree helpless in the face of disease, and because of the devastating infections they. confronted, they made little progress in their handling of wounds.

These accom\u00ad plishments were initally impossible, how\u00ad ever, because those who shaped the Medical Department policies understood neither the unprecedented nature of the conflict nor the demands it was placing upon them. After William Hammond in\u00ad spired the department's overwhe lmed medical officers to withstand frustration and adversity while he initiated new and determined approaches to their problems , there was no turning back to the old ways. By cooperating closely with one another, the very men who had been Hammond's undoing were able to continue successfully along the path he had laid out. Epilogue The creation of the Medical Department on a permanent basis in 1818 had far\u00ad reaching consequenc es both for the U.S. Army and for medical science. Endowed by Congress with the responsibility for a per\u00ad manent organization rather than a tem\u00ad porary wartime expedient , the surgeon general was in a position from this time onward to make long-range plans for the care of the Army's sick and wounded in war and peace and to direct continuing efforts to contribute to the sum of medical knowl\u00ad edge. Much depended , however, on the ability of the physician who served as sur\u00ad geon general. The first man to head the Medical De\u00ad partment was the young and brillant Jo\u00ad seph Lovell, who quickly moved to improve the caliber of his staff and to begin collecting information on factors that might be affecting the Army's health. Be\u00ad cause of Lovell's efforts, the highly trained and disciplin ed physicians who gradually replaced the motley crew that formed the department in 1818 began to regard them-selves as members of a proud profession. The beneficial effects of this change in at\u00ad titude were soon evident, for, on the whole, the first career military surgeons in the na\u00ad tion's history worked diligently to meet the responsibilities placed upon them. The appointment of the most senior sur\u00ad geons in the department rather than the most able as Lovell's two immediate suc\u00ad cessors did not augur well for further prog\u00ad ress in the Medica l Department. Nevertheless, Thomas Lawson's enthusi\u00ad asm for the department and its work led to the winning of rank for Army surgeons. He also obtained the right to enlist hospital stewards, continued the collection of data started by Lovell, and worked to develop an effective ambulance. Lawson grew old and ill in office, however, and when he died, the department was still unprepared for war. Lawson's successor , Clement Fin\u00ad ley, while healthier than his predecessor , was probably less competent and came to office entirely because of his seniority. As a result, the Medical Department be\u00ad gan to meet the challenge of the Ci viI War only when Finley was succeeded by a phy\u00ad sician who was, like Lovell, both young and talented. Appointed surgeon general de\u00ad spite his lack of seniority, William Ham\u00ad mond built upon the small but sturdy foundation laid and maintained by his predecessors. Forcing through the changes in the department's organization and administration that were necessary to meet the needs of vast numbers of sick and wounded , with the assistance of the De\u00ad partment's small nucleus of Regular Army surgeons , Hammond , like his successor, initiated thousands of civilian physicians into the mysteries of their wartime duties. Unlike his predecessors during the Civil War, Joseph Barnes, who took over as sur\u00ad geon general upon Hammond's disgrace, was regarded with great favor by Secretary ACHIEVEMENTS AND FAILURES DURING THE CIVIL WAR 299 of War Stanton. He was, therefore, able to continue along the lines set out by Ham\u00ad mond with far greater ease than Hammond himself. During Barnes' tenure, Congress finally created the ambulance corps for which Hammond and his supporters had fought. In the last months of the war, Barnes finally gained for the Medical De\u00ad partment complete control of evacuation and the management of hospitals . The last Civil War surgeon general so pleased his superiors that he was brevetted major gen\u00ad eral in March 1865. Although five surgeons general directed the Medical Department from 1818 through 1865, two of them were principally responsible for the shaping of the depart\u00ad ment's character to meet the demands placed upon it. Lovell professionalized the care that the Army's sick and wounded would in the future receive and, in insisting on regular and detailed reports on all mat\u00ad ters that might relate to the soldier's health, let it be known that the Medical Depart\u00ad ment planned to playa major role in the world of medicine. Circumstances required that Hammond create the department anew, but even as he worked to reorder the structure under which the sick and wounded received care, he demonstrated his agreement with Lovell's ambition for the department by calling for the gathering of case histories and specimens from his surgeons. As they strove to adapt' the Med\u00ad ical Department's structure and operations to the needs of their times, both Lovell and Hammond blazed clear paths that their less talented successors could follow. Neverthe less, the willingness of the first surgeons general to take advantage of the department's potential for contribution to science and their determination to improve the medical care offered to the nation's sol\u00ad diers did not result in major scientific dis\u00ad coveries. The era when clinical observations and statistica l compilations were the principal approach to the myster\u00ad ies of human health was rapidly passing. As the tribulation s of William Beaumont proved, even in peacetime the Medical De\u00ad partment of the 1818-1865 period was not in a position to foster experimental research. The department was able during this pe\u00ad riod to contribute to medical science in lesser, practical ways because the use of any remedy or treatment in relatively large numbers of patients by physicians working under the discipline of a single organiza\u00ad tion inevitably constitutes a trial of its worth. It was the Army's experience since 1800 that clearly demonstrated the benefits of mass vaccination against smallpox. Army surgeons established both the advis\u00ad ability and safety of using higher doses of quinine than those customary outside the South and the powers of bromine against infection . The Army's Civil War use of an\u00ad esthetics demonstrated on a large scale the benefits and the relative safety of these agents when carefully used. With the acceptance of the germ theory, however, would come the discovery of the causes of typhoid, malaria, dysentery, and other major diseases, and the resultant de\u00ad velopment of better ways in which to pre\u00ad vent and treat these scourges. In comparison to these dramatic events, the Army's informal testing appears insignifi\u00ad cant. As the end of the century approached , however, and medical science moved for\u00ad ward with great rapidity, medical officers of the U.S. Army would be in the forefront of many great advances . Army surgeons would be increasingly able to prevent and cure disease and infection . With new and better weapons, post-Civil War physicians would wage a more successful struggle against disease and infection , but they would never conduct a more gallant fight than the Army surgeons of 1818-1865. Bibliography The National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the National Library of Medi\u00ad cine in Bethesda , Maryland, hold a major\u00ad ity of the manuscripts and other unpublished material used in the research for The Army Medical Deparlmen l, 1818-1865. As always in this series on the history of the Army Medical Department , the Records of the Office of the Surgeon General, Record Group (RG 112), and par\u00ad ticularly the letters to and from the Surgeon General, have been invaluable. Other im\u00ad portant material in the National Archives is contained in the Records of the Adjutant General (RG 94), the Records of the In\u00ad spector General (RG 159), the Records of the Judge Advocate General (RG 153), and the Records of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedme n, and Abandoned Lands (RG 105). The National Library of Medicine collections include a wealth of correspon\u00ad dence, diaries, reports, orders, and similar material, both printed and unprinted , orig\u00ad inating with the Surgeon General's Office, individual surgeons, individual hospitals , and the U.S. Sanitary Commission. Other repositories consulted for this volume include the New York Academy of Medicine, which holds the Nathan Jarvis papers, the Library of Congress, where there is a small collection of the papers of such surgeons as Benjamin King and Thomas Lawson, and the U.S. National Museum , better known as the Smithsonian Institution , which holds the papers that re\u00ad sulted from the work of various surgeons who gathered data and specimens for the Smithsonian.
