P L A I N /uni00A0 L A N G U A G E /uni00A0 S U M M A R Y The eects of primary-level workers on people with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries This Cochrane Review update aims to assess the eects of engaging community-based workers, such as primary-care workers and teachers, to help people with mental disorders or distress. The review focused on studies from low- and middle-income countries and found 95 studies for inclusion (including 23/uni00A0from the previous review). Key messages Primary health professionals, lay health workers, teachers, and other community workers may be able to help people with mental health issues if they are trained. However, more evidence is needed. What was studied in the review? In low- and middle-income countries, many people with mental illness/uni00A0do not receive the care they need because of stigma and diiculty accessing services. One solution is to oer services through 'primary-level workers'. These are people who/uni00A0are/uni00A0not mental health specialists but who receive some mental health training, including primary health professionals (e.g. doctors, nurses); lay health workers; community volunteers; and other community members/uni00A0(e.g. teachers, social workers). Primary-level workers deliver these services alone or in collaboration/uni00A0with specialists. What are the main results of the review? 95 relevant trials from 30 low- or middle-income countries were found. The review authors searched for evidence about the eects of these strategies on the number of people who had mental health problems,/uni00A0the number who recovered, their symptom severity, quality of life, day-to-day functioning, use of health services, and/uni00A0negative eects of treatment. All results were measured/uni00A0one to six months a/f_ter treatment completion, except in group 5, in which results were measured immediately a/f_ter treatment completion./uni00A0When results are not presented, this is because there was no evidence, or/uni00A0because the evidence was very uncertain. Evidence of the results below is of low to moderate certainty.

Mental illness also come with substantial economic costs. A report on the global economic burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) suggests that by the early 2030s, mental disorders and distress/uni00A0alone will account for loss of an additional USD16.1 trillion, with dramatic impact on productivity and quality of life (Jan 2018). Data on macro- economic costs for low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings remain poor (Trautmann 2016). However, the economic and social costs for individuals and families are substantial. High direct costs are incurred in countries where health spending is met largely through private, as opposed to public,/uni00A0spending, and where/uni00A0health insurance and employer-met health payments are not substantial (Levin 2016). High indirect costs are also incurred due to informal caregiving and lost work opportunities, and may be related to untreated disorders and their associated disability (Razzouk/uni00A02017; S\u00f8rensen 2017). More recently, mental health and ill health have been re-framed to be seen as a continuum from health to ill health:/uni00A0from 'at risk' to experiencing 'mental distress' to developing 'sub-syndromal symptoms' (some of which are suggestive of a mental disorder but are not suicient to reach diagnostic categories) to finally developing 'mental disorders' (Patel 2018). Alongside, eorts have been made to/uni00A0implement/uni00A0interventions targeting each stage of this continuum. This reflects the growing approach towards seeing the value in treating mental/uni00A0ill health/uni00A0as a response to functional issues or common elements/uni00A0(transdiagnostic approach) (Dalgleish 2020). This Cochrane Review update therefore includes a broader spectrum of people with mental symptoms, ranging from distress up to more severe symptoms and diagnosed conditions. The gap between those who could benefit from mental/uni202Fhealth interventions and those who receive such care is very large (Patel 2016; Singla 2017 ; WHO 2018);/uni00A0in LMICs, up to 90% of people needing care do not receive it/uni00A0(Alonso 2018 ; Docrat/uni00A02019; Patel2010 CRCT India), despite the existence of a range of cost-eective interventions in mental health care (Barbui 2020;/uni00A0Levin 2016; WHO 2010 ). Major barriers to closing the treatment gap include the huge scarcity of skilled human resources, large inequities and ineiciencies in resource distribution and utilisation (LMICs spend/uni202Fonly USD1 per capita on mental health compared to USD80 in high-income countries (HICs), and most of that is spent on hospital care) (Chisholm 2019 ; Mugashi 2017; WHO 2018), and the significant stigma associated with psychiatric illness (Semrau 2015). With increasing evidence of the economic and well- being-related burden of mental disorders, implementing/uni202Fevidence- based mental health interventions on a large scale through task-shi/f_ting/uni202F(i.e. delegating appropriate tasks to/uni202Fnon-specialists) and/uni202Ftask-sharing (ensuring there is some collaboration and ongoing supervision with specialists)/uni202Fin the community/uni202Fshould be seen as a high priority/uni202F( Galvin 2020 ; Ola 2019; Patel 2018;Petersen 2019). The World Health Organization (WHO) and other global organisations have long held the position that methods of providing psychological treatments that are less resource intensive, less accessible, less aordable, and non-stigmatising to patients are of great importance for reducing the global burden of mental distress/uni00A0(Keynejad WONCA and one of the targets in the WHO 2013-2020 mental health action plan is provision of comprehensive, integrated mental health and social care services in community-based settings/uni00A0(https://revman.cochrane.org/#/501210041309211330/ dashboard/htmlView/4.211.54?revertEnabled=false#REF- WHO-2013)./uni00A0The primary care setting is the point of entry into the health system for most people, and primary care and community-based providers are well placed to deliver mental health interventions due to their potential for longitudinal relationships with patients and their families, their ability to respond to undierentiated problems, their use of a bio- psychosocial model, and their ability to integrate care of mental conditions with care of physical conditions/uni00A0(WHO & WONCA 2008).

Description of the intervention Primary-level worker (PW) interventions for the care of patients with mental disorders and distress are the focus of this review.

As per the Lewin 2010 review, LHWs perform diverse functions related to healthcare delivery (Lewin 2010). Although LHWs are usually provided with job-related training, they have no formal professional or paraprofessional tertiary education and can be involved in either paid or voluntary care. The term LHW is thus necessarily broad in scope and includes, for example, community health workers, village health workers, treatment supporters, and birth attendants (Barnett 2018; Patel 2018; Shahmalak 2019 ). As LHWs are diverse and may be linked to a health setting or to a community organisation, we have categorised these together in comparisons as LHWs./uni00A0They have broadly similar backgrounds (usually from local communities with little if any professional background) and receive minimal training. Primary care health professionals (PHPs). These professional health workers are not specialising in mental disorders and have not received in-depth professional specialist training in this clinical area. They may include doctors, nurses, auxiliary nurses, lay health workers, and allied health personnel such as midwives and occupational therapists. PHPs have received professional training in health care and include clinicians (e.g. physicians, nurses,/uni00A0physician assistants) and allied health professionals (e.g. occupational therapists, social workers). As LHWs are diverse and may be linked to a healthcare setting (lay PHW) or to a community organisation (lay CW), we have categorised these together in comparisons as LHWs./uni00A0They have broadly similar backgrounds(usually from local communities with little if any professional background) and receive minimal training. Community professionals (CPs). These non-healthcare professionals are involved as community-level workers but are not within the health sector. CPs are not health trained per se but play a role in promoting/monitoring mental health. As many people, particularly adolescents and young adults, have minimal contact with healthcare workers, CPs are another human resource instrumental in delivering mental health care. This category includes teachers/trainers/support workers from schools and colleges, social workers, and community development workers/ managers. Generalist social workers are o/f_ten linked to the health sector in that they provide well-defined and expected extended mental health support role for patients via social support (Barnett 2018; Patel 2018; Shahmalak 2019 ). In the comparisons in this review, CPs are o/f_ten combined with nurses, although occasionally they are combined with teachers.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews specialists (collaborative care). One example of a collaborative care intervention is seen when a psychiatrist may diagnose a patient with a disorder and supervise the team; the primary health professional provides follow-up for the patient and may prescribe or adjust medication dosages or provide a psychological intervention; and an LHW provides psychosocial counselling or support. Such/uni00A0collaborative care teams o/f_ten/uni00A0use a stepped-care approach comprising dierent levels of care according to the patient's response/uni00A0to the interventions/uni00A0(see Table 1 for definitions). These encompass early clinical interventions and monitoring for people/uni00A0with mental distress or sub-syndromal symptoms, acute interventions for people with/uni00A0mental disorders in the acute phase, and long-term follow-up and rehabilitation for people with chronic mental disorders. Training/uni00A0PWs to deliver psychological or psychosocial interventions, or to participate as members of collaborative care teams, may be a way of expanding provision of services for the care of individuals with mental disorders and distress, as/uni00A0well as making these services more accessible and acceptable to communities. With regards to intervening at the mental distress or sub-syndromal level, this could prevent full-blown mental disorders from becoming established, which for many may become chronic or relapsing conditions/uni00A0(Patel 2018)./uni00A0It/uni00A0has/uni00A0been suggested that interventions that/uni00A0rely/uni00A0on/uni00A0PWs/uni00A0could/uni00A0deliver general health and mental health interventions that are at least/uni00A0as/uni00A0eective/uni00A0and/uni00A0acceptable/uni00A0as/uni00A0those/uni00A0delivered by specialist health/uni00A0workers (Lassi 2013 ; Lewin 2010; Mendenhall 2014 ; Padmanathan/uni00A02013)./uni00A0PWs have been used in various services including those/uni00A0delivered/uni00A0by governmental,/uni00A0private,/uni00A0and/uni00A0non- governmental organisations (NGOs) in clinics, halfway homes, and communities.

Nurses, social workers, and LHWs may also take on follow-up or educational/promotional roles (Khan 2017; Patel 2017; Tol 2020). In addition, doctors with general mental health training have been involved in identification, diagnosis, treatment, and referral of complex cases (Archer 2012; Goodrich 2013 ; Seidman 2017 )./uni00A0These interventions may consist of collaborative care models, whereby a PW is involved as part of a team or/uni00A0a step-wise/uni00A0process for accessing care (Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE); Patel 2010). These models may therefore have elements of psychiatric/specialist intervention or support, and patients may even be recruited from secondary care (such as those with severe mental disorders). Many challenges are involved in implementing such interventions in LMICs. Dierences in the organisation of mental health services between LMICs and HICs, with poorer countries having few or no mental health service structures in primary care or in the community, mean that in such settings,/uni00A0PWs may need to work with little or no support from specialist mental health services with fewer options for referral (Chisholm 2019 ; Mugashi 2017). Although PW interventions o/f_ten have lower up-front costs compared with reliance on professional specialist health workers, these savings may be cancelled out by higher downstream resource use (Rocks 2020). Other reviews have looked at the eectiveness of interventions in perinatal/uni00A0mental disorders (Clarke 2013; Rahman 2013), as well as in child and adolescent mental disorders/uni00A0(Barry 2013; Burkey 2018; Purgato 2018), or have specifically focused interventions delivered by PWs (Huntley 2012; Singla 2017 ) (see Table 2/uni00A0for additional information)./uni00A0This review diers from other reviews in that it focuses particularly on whether task-shi/f_ting and/or task-sharing (as in the case of collaborative care) is eective broadly for all types of psychological, psychosocial,/uni00A0and/ or pharmacological interventions in the care of mental disorders and distress.

Implementation studies of these complex interventions have indicated that although the composition of the mental health workforce may vary, a key contributor to its eectiveness lies in the quality and intensity of training, supervision, and subsequent mentoring of non-specialist workers (Kakuma 2011). Due to the spectrum of illness encompassed in common mental disorders, most are non-pharmacological interventions and tend to be abbreviated, time-limited versions of well-established, evidence- based transdiagnostic psychological therapies such cognitive- behavioural therapy and problem-solving therapy (Dalgleish 2020 ). To ensure that interventions are appropriately applied, many involve a stepped approach whereby patients with more severe or complex illnesses, or who do not respond adequately to treatment, are 'stepped up' to more intensive treatments. This may entail having more treatment sessions with the PW, being 'stepped- up' to receive more intensive pharmacological or psychological treatments provided by health workers with more training or expertise, or, in some cases, being referred to specialist care (Rathod 2017).Why it is important to do this review The growing burden of mental disorders coupled with treatment gaps and shortages of specialist human resources in LMICs has/uni00A0made the need to involve non-specialists in mental/uni00A0healthcare provision more urgent (Patel 2016). People in LMICs need care for mental disorders and distress as much as people in HICs do, yet many LMICs have poorer mental health resources and organisation, fewer psychiatrists, and fewer psychiatric nurses than HICs. The median number of psychiatrists is 172 times lower in low-income countries (LICs) than in high-income countries (HICs) (Kakuma shi/f_ting/sharing model, in which tasks traditionally allocated to a mental health professional are done by non-specialists, requires/uni00A0far fewer specialist resources and makes available a larger taskforce./uni00A0Primary-level providers are less stigmatising, more accessible, and more acceptable to people needing mental health care, who may be reluctant or unaware of how to access mental health services (Rathod 2017). Reliable evidence is needed on the eectiveness of PWs in scaling up mental health interventions, including for detection, treatment, and rehabilitation of mental/uni00A0disorders.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews provide the evidence needed to inform policy development for sustainable scaling up of mental health services in LMICs. The aim of this/uni00A0first update/uni00A0of the original 2013 Cochrane/uni00A0Review - van Ginneken 2013 - is to evaluate/uni00A0the eectiveness of mental health treatments delivered by PWs to people/uni00A0with mental distress/disorders living in LMICs. To expand the applicability of findings, this review update builds on the first review by/uni00A0including/uni00A0people with a broader/uni00A0spectrum of illness and symptom severity/uni00A0than was addressed in the 2013 review, to include people experiencing mental distress,/uni00A0sub-syndromal symptoms, and diagnosable disorders. Following consultation with a panel of stakeholders (clinicians delivering care in LMICs, project implementers, academics, and policymakers), the review team decided to conduct an additional parallel review on the role of PWs in delivering interventions focused on/uni00A0prevention of mental ill health and promotion of mental well-being (Purgato 2021).

In the/uni00A0previous/uni00A0version of this review/uni00A0(van Ginneken 2013), we included a range of non- randomised/uni202Fstudies (NRSs). However these/uni202Fother study designs (non-randomised/uni202Ftrials, time studies)/uni202Fcontributed little/uni202Fto bias. Furthermore, We/uni00A0included/uni00A0only studies conducted in LMICs, as defined by the/uni202FWorld/uni202FBank on the year(s) that each study was conducted,/uni00A0and we excluded/uni00A0all/uni00A0studies conducted in HICs./uni202FSimilar to the 2013 review, this update remained focused/uni00A0on LMICs as a response to the call for more community-based models of care to address the challenges encountered in delivering mental health care in these settings. When data were available, we included/uni00A0economic studies if/uni00A0they were/uni00A0conducted as part to/uni00A0analyses that examine the ratio of the/uni00A0cost/uni00A0of a particular intervention to a chosen unit of/uni00A0eectiveness, which is dierent from/uni00A0'cost-saving',/uni00A0which refers only to the monetary value of an intervention without consideration of its eects./uni00A0We described whether the analysis took a 'societal perspective'/uni00A0(which takes into account costs incurred to all, such as to the health service, the patient, etc.), or whether it/uni00A0took/uni00A0a/uni00A0'health system perspective'/uni00A0(which takes into account only costs to the health service and system) (Zilberberg 2010). We extracted and reported/uni00A0only/uni00A0cost and resource usage outcomes from these studies.Types of participants We/uni00A0included children (aged/uni00A0< 18 years) and adults with mental disorders or distress seeking first-level care/primary care or detected in the community in LMICs./uni00A0We also included participants who had a diagnosis established in secondary care or by specialists in community care and for whom the intervention was then performed in primary or community settings (e.g. follow-up monitoring to improve/maintain mental health a/f_ter discharge, collaborative care/shared care between primary and secondary care). Additionally,/uni00A0we/uni00A0included carers/uni00A0of people with/uni00A0mental disorders or distress/uni00A0(i.e. any relatives or friends of any age who defined themselves as key supporters to a person with a/uni00A0mental condition),/uni00A0as/uni00A0some/uni00A0interventions/uni00A0may/uni00A0be/uni00A0directed/uni00A0at/uni00A0the/uni00A0carers/uni00A0rather than at patients themselves (e.g. interventions to alleviate/uni00A0carer/uni00A0burden). Mental disorders included are in accordance with the ICD-11 classification of mental disorders (WHO 2019 ), and include common mental disorders, severe mental disorders, perinatal mental disorders, /uni00A0disorders specifically associated with stress, disorders associated with substance abuse, neurocognitive disorders such as dementia, /uni00A0as well as all mental developmental (e.g. autism), emotional (e.g. mood disorders) and behavioural (e.g. ADHD) disorders associated with childhood (based on those included in the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) guide (WHO 2016 ). (See/uni00A0Table 1/uni00A0for further definitions of participants, 'LMIC', and 'primary care', and for the list of included mental disorders, as well as a definition of mental distress.) Types of interventions Cadres of interventionists Primary-level workers (PWs) include primary healthcare professionals (PHPs), such as doctors, nurses, and pharmacists; lay health workers (LHWs) (i.e. people living at the community level with no prior health professional training); and community professionals (CPs), such as social workers, teachers, and development workers./uni00A0We combined PHPs and/or CPs and LHWs (1) when interventions and roles were similar but due to dierent contexts, dierent cadres were used (comparisons 6, 8, 10, and 13), or (2) because multi-disciplinary teams were involved, such as within collaborative care (comparison 2). For example, social workers were combined with PHPs (doctors, pharmacists, nurses) in comparison 6, as psychosocial interventions and roles were similar in helping adults in humanitarian settings with mental distress and post-traumatic stress with similar regular extended mental health supportive roles (also as described in the study descriptions) within their work for these populations, who o/f_ten needed more intensive community support. Community-based lay providers could be linked to the health sector or attached to community networks or organisations. Because they were very similar in terms of function, trainability, and educational background, and were embedded in communities, we opted to categorise all lay workers together within comparisons/uni00A0as 'lay health workers' See/uni00A0Figure 1/uni00A0for full definitions of/uni00A0primary- level/uni00A0workers/uni00A0and types of interventions.

We excluded such trials if no patient/uni00A0outcomes were measured (e.g./uni00A0when they/uni00A0assessed/uni00A0only knowledge/uni00A0or attitude/uni00A0changes,/uni00A0as/uni00A0in pre- post/uni00A0training evaluations). Studies with a prevention component From our previous 2013 review (van Ginneken 2013), 12 out of 38 included studies had interventions that combined both treatment and prevention. For trials that included subgroup analyses that split out these dierent populations,/uni00A0we retained treatment outcomes in this review and we will include prevention outcomes in a parallel prevention review (Purgato 2021; Figure 2). We decided whether the aim of each study was prevention or treatment, and we looked at the inclusion criteria for participants (studies had to have as an inclusion criterion the presence of mental distress/prodromal symptoms or a diagnosable disorder)./uni00A0When/uni00A0there was no clear distinction between prevention and treatment groups, we made/uni00A0a pragmatic decision about whether these trials were primarily about well-being/prevention or were primarily about treatment, and we then allocated trials to the appropriate review, or we included them in both reviews and performed sensitivity analyses while excluding them./uni00A0 Comparators For all study populations aside from adults with severe mental disorders, PW interventions/uni00A0were/uni00A0compared to 'usual care'. Usual/uni00A0care could consist of functional usual care (e.g. provided by/uni00A0a/uni00A0non-trained/uni00A0existing/uni00A0PW), non-functioning theoretical usual care,/uni00A0or essentially no care/uni00A0(i.e. care that is nominally there but is poorly accessed or is not always available/accessible)./uni202FIn addition, due to the heterogeneity of/uni00A0provision,/uni00A0we included 'enhanced usual care'/uni00A0(defined as minimal additional/uni00A0mental healthcare intervention such as a/uni00A0one-day/uni00A0training workshop or provision of a leaflet or manual)/uni00A0or/uni00A0external/uni00A0support or/uni00A0some other minimal follow-up arrangement/uni00A0(such as the option of referral/uni00A0to a specialist), or any other non-mental health intervention (such as a/uni00A0lecture on/uni00A0physical disease prevention). For adults with severe mental disorders (comparisons 11 and 12), primary-level worker treatments were compared to/uni00A0treatments provided by mental health specialists in/uni00A0primary care and in the/uni00A0community.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews If an outcome was reported more than once during any of the above time points, we used/uni00A0the latest time point within that category (e.g. if there was a measure at 3 months and at 6 months, we used the results at 6 months for T2) or the time point that correlated/uni00A0best with other studies compared within each/uni00A0outcome.

The time points in this review update dier slightly from those in the 2013 review/uni00A0(van Ginneken 2013), where T1 was 0 to 2 months, T2 4 to 6 months, and T3 8 to 12 months post intervention, as we wanted to better capture the dierence between post- intervention recovery and remission, and we wanted to include a measure of long-term outcomes. A 2019 review/uni00A0concluded that/uni00A0the duration criteria for declaring remission versus recovery may be unnecessary and not meaningful (de Zwart 2019), even though these had previously been thought to be important (Spijker 2002). Depressive remission can be defined as the asymptomatic state a/f_ter a depressive episode, without application of any duration criterion. Stability of remission is relatively low on the first day but increases gradually with its duration. The term 'recovery' is then used as a concept that would involve more than absence of symptoms and would also include better social functioning or subjective well-being, and may include the absence of significant treatment, as this would better fit the concept of recovery from a patient's perspective (de Zwart 2019)./uni00A0 This review does not attempt to present the illness recovery outcome as a single outcome,/uni00A0although individual studies may provide some of the information pertaining to illness recovery/uni00A0(such as social functioning). Primary outcomes /uni00A0 /uni00A0 /uni00A0 /uni00A01. Recovery and prevalence 1.1. Clinical illness/uni00A0recovery: number of people who recover from mental distress or mental disorder (defined by study authors as number of people reaching minimal or no symptom category on a validated symptom scale, such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)). If the time point was < 1 month post intervention (T1), we called this 'remission' 1.2. Disease prevalence: number of people with the illness at a point in time. Some trial authors separated recovery and prevalence outcomes, as prevalence did not equate to 'one minus recovery'. Disease prevalence involves a person having an illness based on diagnostic criteria (e.g. for the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression, this would include those scoring > 10). Recovery applies to those who were well, so below a certain threshold on a scale (e.g. with PHQ-9, this would be < 5). However those who scored as having mild or sub-threshold symptoms would not feature in either (in this example, PHQ-9between 5 and 9). We were therefore not able to combine or transform figures to create just a single outcome /uni00A0 /uni00A0 /uni00A0 /uni00A02. Clinical/uni00A0symptom severity: average clinical symptom scores for a study population at a point in time, or change in average clinical scores from baseline (i.e./uni00A0average improvement or change in symptom scale across the study population), such as scores or change in scores/uni00A0from baseline on/uni00A0the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ), the PHQ-9, Depression /uni00A0 /uni00A03.

The EPOC Information Specialist revised the search strategy in collaboration with the review team. The search strategy was peer reviewed by two Cochrane Information Specialists using the/uni00A0PRESS checklist 2016. Search strategy amendments included new search terms (such as mental distress, sub-syndromal syndromes) and removal of some exclusions (such as epilepsy). Search strategies comprised/uni00A0natural language and controlled vocabulary terms related to PWs and mental health. We did not apply any language or date limits./uni00A0 We used two search filters - one to restrict search retrieval to/uni00A0randomised/uni00A0trials (Cochrane RCT sorter) and one for LMICs. We employed strategies to search for and include relevant unpublished studies. These strategies included searching the grey literature and prospective trial registration databases to overcome time-lag bias. This search method was used for both this treatment review and the parallel prevention review, so screening was done simultaneously for both.

We also searched the reference lists of existing reviews (De Vet 2008). We did not search for economic analyses. We retrieved potentially eligible economic analyses when screening records generated by the various searches reported above, but we selected only those performed alongside identified eectiveness studies. We contacted the authors of all included eectiveness studies to ask for information on any published or unpublished economic studies related to their trials. We also scanned the reference lists of eligible trials and economic analyses (where these were reported separately for eligible trials) and other related reviews and papers for additional eligible studies.

When appropriate, we contacted study authors by email to ask for further information. Data extraction and management Two review authors independently extracted descriptive and outcome data for each paper using an adapted version of the EPOC data collection checklist into/uni00A0a Microso/f_t Excel spreadsheet. The two extractions were cross-checked by the two review authors, and a third review author (NvG, WC, YCL, NH, LYC) resolved discrepancies and re-checked all descriptive and outcome data during analysis. Chinese and Iranian papers relied on data extracted by one bilingual researcher and translation of key parts of the paper to allow double assessment of risk of bias and outcome extraction by a second review author. Review authors contacted trial authors to ask for missing statistical data and additional descriptive data and most o/f_ten received responses particularly to statistical queries. Review authors entered the final agreed descriptive extracted data into relevant tables of characteristics in Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2012). Two review authors (NH and LYC) entered the checked outcome data into Review Manager 5 for meta- analysis and/uni00A0cross checked each other's entries/uni00A0(RevMan 2012). We extracted the following information for all included studies. 1.Details of the intervention: type and length of each of the clinical, psychosocial, and service interventions; a full description of cadre(s) of PWs consulting with the patient, including details of their training and supervision/support; length, frequency, and type of intervention delivered by eachPW; a description of the specialist providing care (including type, experience, training in using reference standard). 2.Participants: a full description of participants (including sex, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity) and details of the mental condition being treated. 3.Setting: country, type of health service (e.g. government funded, NGO), rural versus urban, organisation of primary care and specialist services, specialist outreach or generalist. We used the World Bank classification of countries by gross national income per capita in all calendar year(s); the study was conducted to assign studies to the appropriate low-income and middle-income country category. Data from included studies were not transformed before presentation in the review. When 2 \u00d7 2 data or means and standard deviations were not available for each group in the included studies, relative measures of eect were extracted and meta- analysed by the generic inverse variance method.

We assessed attrition bias for two types of outcomes: eicacy outcomes and safety outcomes (e.g. adverse events, unintended consequences)./uni00A0If no mention was made of safety outcomes/uni00A0being assessed,/uni00A0the study was rated as/uni00A0having 'unsure' risk of bias/uni00A0for safety outcomes./uni00A0We divided the blinding domain into blinding of participants and personnel and blinding of outcome assessment. We considered incomplete outcome data separately for eicacy and for adverse outcomes. For economic studies, we adapted the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) list (see Appendix 2 ) to include an extra/uni00A0question/uni00A0on the sources of data used, and we re-formulated other/uni00A0CHEC criteria headings into discrete sub-questions. We had a total of 24 questions. Measures of treatment eect For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean dierences (MDs), standardised mean dierences (SMDs), or mean change dierences (MCDs) with 95% CIs. When studies reported only relative measures of eect (and not raw data per group), we used the generic inverse variance method to combine trials. For SMDs, we used the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to interpret their clinical relevance using the following cut-os: 0.2 represented a small clinically appreciable eect, 0.5 a moderate eect, and 0.8 a large eect (Cohen 1988 ). We attempted to establish minimally important dierences for each outcome (as suggested in Guyatt 2013), but this was not possible due to the wide variety of instruments used.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration.59Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Unit of analysis issues When possible, we re-analysed studies that randomised or allocated clusters (health professionals, healthcare settings, or geographical areas) but did not account for clustering in the analysis ( Ukoumunne 1999). We adjusted the results for clustering by multiplying the standard errors of estimates by the square root of the design eect when the design eect was calculated as DE = 1 + (M - 1) ICC, where M is mean cluster size and ICC is the intracluster correlation coeicient (ICC). When included studies did not report ICCs for the respective outcome measures, we derived ICCs from a dierent outcome from the same study, or from a dierent study included in the same meta-analysis. Details on the ICC used and the sources are provided in the footnotes of each analysis under the forest plots. We combined adjusted measures of eects of cluster-randomised trials with the results of non-cluster trials, when it was possible to adjust adequately the results of cluster trials. There were too few studies per meta-analysis to perform sensitivity analyses comparing eects estimates with and without inclusion of cluster trials. If a single study compared two or more primary-level worker (PW) interventions (with or without a control arm), we labelled the arms separately in analyses. Each PW-led intervention within a trial was analysed separately, and if necessary, the control group was split to perform independent comparisons. Dealing with missing data For missing or unclear information, we contacted study investigators for clarification or additional information. We were able to access all required authors for the purpose of requesting statistical information. Some remaining missing information on the qualitative description of interventions that we did not get despite several attempts at following up with study authors is highlighted in the Characteristics of included studies tables. To reduce the risk of overly positive answers, we used open-ended questions when contacting investigators (as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions; Higgins 2009 ). When possible, we extracted data to allow an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis in which all randomised participants were analysed in the groups to which they were originally assigned. For studies that reported continuous data but did not report standard deviations, we calculated these from other available data such as standard errors or confidence intervals, or we imputed these using the methods suggested in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2009 ). We did not make any assumptions about loss to follow-up for continuous data, and we analysed results for those who completed the trial. Assessment of heterogeneity We first made a qualitative assessment of the extent to which studies assessing a particular comparison were similar to one another. This included assessment of settings, interventions, participants, and outcomes to determine whether a meta-analysis was appropriate. We obtained an initial visual overview of statistical heterogeneity by scrutinising the forest plots and examining the overlap between confidence intervals around the estimate for each included study. To quantify inconsistency across studies, and thus the impact of heterogeneity on the meta-analysis,we used the I/two.sups statistic, and we defined I/two.sups > 50% as indicative of substantial heterogeneity. We then considered these assessments when interpreting the results of a pooled analysis. For analyses where the 12 statistic was 95-97%, we opted to present the results and then to grade down the evidence on the basis of high levels of statistical heterogeneity. We took this approach as the interventions cover a wide range of settings and disorders and so we anticipated higher levels of statistical heterogeneity. We do not report pooled results for analyses where the I2 was found to be 98% or higher. However, these pooled analyses are visible in the Analyses section as it is not possible to selectively de-activate pooling for some sub-analyses. Assessment of reporting biases To assess publication bias, funnel plots were to be produced for outcomes with more than four studies to visualise whether there was asymmetry. None of the plots showed asymmetry. We did not perform any statistical testing for funnel plot asymmetry, as none of the meta-analyses included more than 10 studies. Data synthesis We grouped the studies into 15 comparisons by: 1.Type of disorder: there were six disorder categories: common mental disorders (including depression and anxiety), perinatal depression, post-traumatic stress (some distress following trauma)/post-traumatic stress disorder (the disorder meeting diagnostic criteria), dementia, severe mental disorders, and substance use disorders (see Table 1 for details of categories of disorders included); 2.Age of participant: child interventions (< 18 years old) were separated from interventions for adults; 3.Type of provider: we separated interventions by types of health workers based on whether they were lay or professional, and whether they worked in the health sector or in the community (such as teachers, NGOs). All lay/uni00A0workers, whether they were linked/uni00A0to the health sector or to the community, were grouped together as LHWs for analyses. Hence, primary-level workers (PWs) were classified as primary health professionals (PHPs), as community professionals (CPs), or as LHWs (see/uni00A0Table 1/uni00A0for definitions). These providers worked in a collaborative capacity (as part of a larger complex intervention) or as a sole component of a psychological intervention. Because their roles sometimes overlapped, the interventions were similar, and/or they worked collaboratively, these cadres were combined together for some comparisons; and 4.Comparator group: comparators were usual care, enhanced usual care (EUC), or specialist care. On occasion, usual care was essentially no care, as access to usual care sometimes was not feasible for participants. We did this as these groupings and these categories fit with current models of service delivery in LMICs. This grouping was chosen a/f_ter consultation with stakeholders in the first review, and was checked before the start of this update with a focus group of stakeholders who agreed that it was important to divide the information by types of disorders because of relevance to dierent professionals and patients of classifying and treating disorders (Patel 2018). It was Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews also important to divide these studies by types of PW and whether PWs were delivering an add-on intervention or were working as part of a collaborative team, as policy and practice stakeholders need to know for the purpose of allocating their workforce (Kakuma 2011). For the common mental disorders comparisons, where trials reported only depression scores, these were combined within the common mental disorder analysis (which included both anxiety and depression). For/uni00A0each comparison, we created tables/uni00A0of/uni00A0summary/uni00A0statistics/uni00A0including/uni00A0baseline and follow-up summary statistics, eect estimates, and their precision./uni00A0We/uni00A0used forest plots to display the data/uni00A0graphically./uni00A0When pooling was considered appropriate, we employed a random-eects meta- analysis using the DerSimonian and Laird method (DerSimonian 1986), as it was assumed that eect size might vary across studies and settings, and that the included results are estimates of dierent but related quantities.

Economic data We conducted all elements of the economics component of this review according to current guidance on the use of economics methods in preparation and maintenance of Cochrane Reviews (Aluko/uni00A02021). We classified the included economic evaluations based on an established system (Drummond 2005 ; Trautmann 2016). We summarised the characteristics and results of included economic evaluations using additional tables, supplemented by a narrative summary that compared and evaluated methods used and principal results between studies. We displayed resource use and cost data in a table, along with unit cost data (when available). A unit cost was defined as the cost of each specific resource input calculated by multiplying the measured number of units (quantities) of an item of resource use (e.g. the number of hours of time provided by a senior teacher) by an applicable unit cost (e.g. the salary cost of one hour of senior teacher time). We reported the currency and price year applicable to measures of costs and unit costs in each original study. Measures of costs are highly likely to vary across and within study settings, and over time as the result of variations in underlying quantities of resource use and variations in underlying unit costs . Because the data on resource use and costs were very heterogeneous, meta-analysis was not appropriate, and we presented the findings narratively. We discuss the limitations of this approach below. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity Within each comparison, we planned the following subgroups. 1.Categories of health workers: primary health/uni00A0professionals of interventions collaborative versus psychological interventions). 3.Settings (e.g. government versus non-government).A/f_ter considering the studies included in this review, we revised the comparisons, so that separate analyses would be performed for categories of health workers and types of community interventions as the main analyses - not as subgroups. We were not able to perform other subgroup analyses to check if the intervention eect varied with dierent population characteristics, as the number of included studies for each comparison was insuicient ( RevMan 2012). Sensitivity analysis When data were suicient, we planned to perform sensitivity analyses by removing from the analysis studies that were at high risk/uni00A0of/uni00A0bias. However, the number of included studies for each comparisons was insuicient to allow sensitivity analyses to be conducted. Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence We used the GRADE approach to assess the level of certainty of evidence related to each of the primary outcomes (Guyatt 2008; Sch\u00fcnemann 2009 ). We used the GRADEpro profiler import data from Review Manager 5 (GRADEpro GDT; RevMan 2012), and we created 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison. Only the 1 to 6 month (T2) time point is presented for each outcome in the 'Summary of findings' tables, as this approach best shows whether participants have gone into remission (see explanation of time points under Types of outcome measures). For assessments of the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome that included pooled data, we downgraded the evidence from 'high certainty' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias), indirectness of evidence (applicability), inconsistency of results (heterogeneity), imprecision of eect estimates (few events or wide confidence intervals), and publication bias. We used these assessments, along with evidence for absolute benefit or harm of the intervention and the sum of available data on all outcomes from each study included for each comparison, to draw conclusions about the eectiveness of primary-level workers/uni00A0in providing mental health care in LMICs.

The drugs used were typically amitriptyline or fluoxetine/uni00A0according to WHO guidelines for depression, although/uni00A0two studies used sertraline at a starting dose of 50 mg or 25 mg instead (Chen 2015 ; Indu 2018 ); fluoxetine 20 to 40mg per day or sertraline 50 to 100 mg per day for perinatal depression (Rojas 2007); and antipsychotics/uni00A0for severe mental disorders, such as depot antipsychotics (Malakouti 2015), equivalents of chlorpromazine up to 238 mg \u00b1 9.67 mg per day/uni00A0(Tan 2005), or/uni00A0equivalents of perphenazine up to 29.05 \u00b1/uni00A09.83 mg per day/uni00A0(Li 2002), with one study adding on sulpiride/uni00A0up to 200 mg per day for depressed mood, apathy, or withdrawal and alprazolam for poor sleep (Li 2002). In 63/uni00A0studies, some form of psychosocial intervention/uni00A0was provided such as psychoeducation, various support and general counselling/coping skills interventions, and stimulation programmes for children. One study utilised a day rehabilitation set-up, and one utilised a clubhouse model set-up to deliver psychosocial interventions (Shen 2016 ). In 66/uni00A0studies, specific psychological interventions were used on their own or as part of a collaborative care model:/uni00A0nine/uni00A0used motivational interviewing, five/uni00A0used 20 used combinations/uni00A0of methods; one studied cognitive processing therapy versus a transdiagnostic intervention/uni00A0versus control (Weiss 2015 ), and one studied motivational interviewing with or without problem-solving therapy versus control (Sorsdahl 2015). One/uni00A0study/uni00A0used alternative therapies (yoga) in combination with psychosocial interventions (Niemi 2016 )./uni00A0No studies examined detection by/uni00A0PWs,/uni00A0and none reported relevant health worker outcomes.

Economic studies Of the 20/uni00A0studies that included economic evaluations, 13 were cost- eectiveness studies two were cost-benefit analyses (Barron Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Excluded studies We excluded 790/uni00A0studies:/uni00A0695/uni00A0were of interest but were excluded/uni00A0due to specific participants, interventions, comparators, and outcomes (PICOS) not met (documented in/uni00A0Characteristics of excluded studies and in Figure 3 in the PRISMA flow chart), including 12 studies from the previous review, the/uni00A0most common reason being wrong intervention (e.g./uni00A0interventions not performed by or not involving PWs), followed by wrong patient population (prevention trials or non-primary care populations), followed by wrong setting (conducted in HICs) and wrong study design (not randomised trials or cluster-randomised trials). Three/uni00A0other studies that were included in the 2013 review were/uni00A0moved to the prevention review, as the more stringent criteria of/uni00A0participants for this review (given splitting of the review into separate prevention andtreatment reviews) were not met. Of the remaining studies, 45 were excluded because they were duplicate records of a study that had already been excluded or included,/uni00A040 were excluded because we had insuicient information despite our best eorts to classify them (e.g. trial registry entries with incomplete information and with no published findings, 2 to 3 attempts to contact study authors for clarification failed), four were withdrawn, and three were retracted. We identified 13 studies in the 2013 review/uni00A0that included economic data on/uni00A0mental disorders and distress but/uni00A0were not linked to studies included in this review. These are summarised in Appendix 17 .

Although they were randomised, they sometimes used alternate allocation of randomised people or other potentially quasi-randomised methods. However due to some randomisation featuring in the allocation sequence generation, it was agreed to include these studies and downgrade them accordingly./uni00A0Four/uni00A0utilised an alternating or planned sequence to/uni00A0allocate participants (Ayoughi/uni00A02012; Connolly ; Jiang/uni00A02017 and one/uni00A0 used/uni00A0 a combination of random and non-random sequence generation (Sherman 2009 )./uni00A0For 14/uni00A0studies, risk of bias was/uni00A0unclear because/uni00A0the/uni00A0method of random sequence generation was not described. A total of 74 studies had low risk of bias. For allocation concealment, 57/uni00A0studies/uni00A0had/uni00A0low risk/uni00A0of bias./uni00A0Eight studies had high risk of bias, as they explicitly did not conceal allocation./uni00A0For 30/uni00A0studies, risk of bias was unclear due to poor reporting. We judged four/uni00A0studies to be at high risk/uni00A0of bias due to unequal baseline characteristics between groups/uni00A0(Bolton 2007; Neuner 2008 ; Peltzer 2019; Sherman 2009 ). For three studies, risk/uni00A0of bias was high due to unequal baseline measurements of outcomes/uni00A0(Barron 2013; Pradeep 2014; Sherman 2009 ). These possibly reflected lack of adequate randomisation./uni00A0Risk/uni00A0of bias due to unequal baseline characteristics was low in/uni00A077 studies and was unclear in 14 studies./uni00A0Risk/uni00A0of bias due to unequal baseline measurements of outcomes was low in 82 studies and was unclear in 10. Blinding When assessing risk of performance bias, we recognised the diiculty of blinding participants and personnel in studies employing/uni00A0psychosocial or/uni00A0psychological interventions./uni00A0For two studies, risk of bias was high, as/uni00A0lack of blinding of participants and personnel/uni00A0was likely to/uni00A0have/uni00A0influenced the results/uni00A0(Neuner 2008 ;Xie 2019)./uni00A0For 32 studies, although there was/uni00A0lack of blinding/uni00A0of participants and personnel, it is unclear how this/uni00A0could have influenced results./uni00A0In/uni00A0the/uni00A0remaining 61/uni00A0studies, risk of bias was low because/uni00A0there was blinding of participants and personnel, and/uni00A0lack of blinding/uni00A0was/uni00A0unlikely/uni00A0to have influenced the outcome. Almost two-thirds of studies blinded outcome assessors to participants' allocated intervention group. For 30 studies, risk of bias was high, as there was no blinding of outcome assessments./uni00A0Of the remaining studies,/uni00A0risk of bias was/uni00A0low in 58 studies and was/uni00A0unclear in/uni00A0seven/uni00A0studies because blinding/uni00A0of assessors/uni00A0was not described/uni00A0or/uni00A0was incomplete, or because unmasking was thought to have occurred./uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0 Incomplete outcome data We considered incomplete outcome data separately for eicacy and for adverse outcomes. Studies were deemed at high risk of attrition bias if they had greater than 20% attrition in any arm, or, in the case of Dybdahl 2001 , an unreported number of participants participated in outcome measures at each time point. For/uni00A059/uni00A0studies,/uni00A0eicacy/uni00A0data were complete; however for/uni00A020/uni00A0studies, this was unclear, and/uni00A016/uni00A0had/uni00A0high risk/uni00A0of bias due to high rates of attrition/uni00A0(Adewuya/uni00A02019; Ali 2003; Arjadi/uni00A02018 ; Bonilla- Escobar 2018; Bryant 2017; Chen 2015 ; Connolly 2011 ; Dawson 2016; Dybdahl 2001 ; Indu 2018 ; Malakouti 2015);/uni00A0for eight/uni00A0studies, it is unclear whether attrition resulted in incomplete safety data because of incomplete adverse event reporting or loss of records (Araya 2003; Bass 2013 ; Chibanda 2019 (EXPONATE); Li 2018; Oladeji 2015 ; Weiss 2015 ); in about half of studies (49), adverse events were not monitored, rendering this bias category \"not applicable\"/uni00A0(Figure 4; Figure 5). This made analysis of adverse outcomes diicult for most comparisons./uni00A0 Selective reporting For 43/uni00A0studies, there appeared to be no selective reporting based on outcomes listed in the associated published protocols and/uni00A0on Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews contact with authors where there was doubt. Nine studies/uni00A0were at/uni00A0high risk/uni00A0of bias due to/uni00A0selective reporting when outcomes that were planned in published trial protocols were not reported in the final publication/uni00A0(Arjadi/uni00A02018 ; Bryant 2017; Chatterjee 2014; Dawson 2016 ; ; Indu ; Lund 2020; Peltzer 2019; Zhong 2015). For 43/uni00A0studies, the risk of selective reporting was not clear (see Characteristics of included studies tables). Other potential sources of bias Risk of contamination was quite common among studies./uni00A0We assessed/uni00A031/uni00A0studies as having unclear risk because insuicient information was available regarding whether contamination across groups was/uni00A0likely, and/uni00A0conclusive information on this could not be obtained from study authors. We assessed an additional/uni00A0ten/uni00A0studies as being at high risk of contamination (Abas/uni00A02018; Araya 2003; Berger 2009; Bolton 2007; Bolton 2014 (Iraq); Bolton 2014 (Thailand) ; Khan 2017 ; Neuner 2008 ; Sherman 2009 ; Weiss 2015 ). Contamination was documented in Abas/uni00A02018/uni00A0(a number of/uni00A0control participants received/uni00A0the intervention due to concerns about their/uni00A0mental health amongst the sta)/uni00A0or/uni00A0was thought to be likely, as in/uni00A0Berger 2009, in which all teachers had received training and students assigned to the control group may have inadvertently received elements of the intervention; or was thought to be highly possible, as in/uni00A0 Bolton 2007, in which recipients in both groups lived close to one another and may have shared information and skills acquired during the intervention./uni00A0 Other sources of bias that were detected included (1) control and intervention arms potentially delivered interventions that were too similar, as mentioned by the study authors (Sherman 2009 ); (2) sources of bias related to statistical analysis/uni00A0due to lack of correction for clustering (Berger 2009); and (3) conduct of multiple analyses that were not pre-specified (Dybdahl 2001 ). Possible conflicts of interest were declared in a small number of studies. These were related to receiving royalties for books on treatment of psychological diiculties (Abas/uni00A02018); receiving payments for conducting workshops (Araya 2003), lectures (Arjadi/uni00A0 2018 ; Nadkarni 2017/uni00A0- unrelated to study; Patel 2017/uni00A0 - unrelated to study), or training sessions (Arjadi/uni00A0 2018 ); travel expenses (Arjadi/uni00A0 2018 ; Bass 2013 ); and receiving expenses, payments, research fellowships,/uni00A0or research grants from the funding source (Araya 2003; Nadkarni 2017; Patel 2010; Patel 2017). As each of these studies had/uni00A0been assessed for risk of bias by the same process that was used in the other studies, these possible conflicts of interest were deemed to have no significant impact on the results of this review./uni00A0/uni00A0 Economic studies - risk of bias assessment with adapted CHEC list criteria All studies had some significant risks of bias (Table 3), although we considered no study to be at/uni00A0high risk/uni00A0of bias on more than seven of the 24 adapted/uni00A0CHEC list criteria. The risk of identified biases was potentially important for interpretation of costing, such as not discounting costs in all but one study (Galarraga/uni00A02017, reference in/uni00A0Papas 2020), not conducting sensitivity analysis in all except/uni00A0Barfar 2017, not including appropriate costs or outcomes, and not valuing some outcomes appropriately. In one study (Galarraga/uni00A02017, reference in Papas 2020), this occurred because study authors presented/uni00A0modelled costs rather than actual costs.Eects of interventions See: Summary of findings 1 Lay health worker-led psychological interventions compared to usual care in treating common mental disorders in adults in low- and middle-income countries; Summary of findings 2 Primary-level worker-led collaborative care compared to usual care in treating common mental disorders (CMDs) in adults in low- and middle-income countries; Summary of findings 3 Lay health worker-led psychosocial interventions compared to enhanced usual care for treating perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries; Summary of findings 4 Primary health professional-led collaborative care interventions compared to usual or enhanced care in treating perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries; Summary of findings 5 Lay health worker-led psychological interventions compared to usual care in treating adults with post-traumatic stress or common mental disorders in humanitarian settings in low- and middle-income countries; Summary of findings 6 Primary health professional-led psychological interventions compared to usual or no care for treating adults with post-traumatic stress or common mental disorders in humanitarian settings in low- and middle- income countries; Summary of findings 7 /uni00A0Lay health worker- led interventions for adult patients with harmful or hazardous alcohol or substance use compared to enhanced usual care in low- and middle-income countries; Summary of findings 8 Primary health professional- and community professional-led interventions compared to enhanced usual care for adult patients with harmful or hazardous alcohol or substance use in low- and middle- income countries; Summary of findings 9 Lay health worker-led interventions compared to enhanced usual care for adult patients with alcohol dependence in low- and middle-income countries; Summary of findings 10 Primary health professional- and community professional-led interventions compared to enhanced usual care for adult patients with substance dependence in low- and middle-income countries; Summary of findings 11 Lay health worker- compared to specialist-led care for people with severe mental disorder in low- and middle-income countries; Summary of findings 12 Primary health professional-led or collaborative care compared to specialist-led care for people with severe mental disorder in low- and middle-income countries; Summary of findings 13 Primary health professionals and lay health workers compared with usual care in improving dementia patients' and carers' outcomes in low- and middle-income countries; Summary of findings 14 Lay health worker-led psychosocial interventions/uni00A0vs usual or no care in treating children with post-traumatic stress and common mental disorders in humanitarian settings in low- and middle-income countries; Summary of findings 15 Community professional-led interventions vs no care in treating children with post-traumatic stress and common mental disorders in humanitarian settings in low- and middle-income countries Results of meta-analyses of outcomes for the following comparisons were described (except comparison 9, for which results from the one study in this category were described). 1.Lay health worker-led psychological interventions versus usual care in treating common mental disorders/uni00A0(N = 10 studies). 2.Primary-level worker-led collaborative care versus usual care in treating common mental disorders in adults (N = 13). 3.Lay health worker-led psychosocial interventions versus usual care in treating perinatal depression (N = 7 studies).

The full GRADE evidence profiles for this review are available on Zenodo (van Ginneken 2021). Comparison 1. Lay health worker-led psychological interventions versus usual care in treating common mental disorders (CMDs) We identified ten studies from nine countries across Africa (Abas/uni00A02018; Bolton 2003; Chibanda/uni00A02016; Petersen 2014), Asia (Ali 2003; Arjadi/uni00A02018 ; Jiang/uni00A02017 ; Murphy 2020 ; Patel 2017), and South America (Matsuzaka 2017). Two studies included only elderly adult males and females aged > 60 years (Chibanda/uni00A02016; Jiang/uni00A02017 ). Two studies included patients receiving HIV antiretroviral therapy (Abas/uni00A02018; Petersen 2014). In three studies, participants were from very low-income households with high rates of unemployment (Bolton 2003; Patel 2017; Petersen 2014). Details/uni00A0of study settings, participants, interventions, and comparisons/uni00A0are described in/uni00A0Appendix 3 .A summary of key findings has been tabled in/uni00A0Summary of findings 1. Primary outcomes 1. Recovery from common mental disorders (CMDs) (Analysis 1.1 ) Three studies reported recovery from CMDs, defined as scoring < 8 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) in/uni00A0Matsuzaka 2017, scoring 7 on the 20-Item Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) in/uni00A0 Murphy 2020 , and scoring 5 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in/uni00A0Patel 2017./uni00A0Lay health worker (LHW)- led psychological interventions may increase the likelihood of remission from CMDs (short-term recovery) up/uni00A0to 1 month post intervention/uni00A0compared to usual care (risk ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 2.16; 1 study, 222 participants; P = 0.03; low certainty due to serious indirectness and imprecision) (Murphy 2020 ). LHW-led psychological interventions may increase the likelihood of medium-term recovery for people with CMDs/uni00A01 to 6 months post intervention/uni00A0compared to usual care (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06/uni00A0to 1.56; 2 studies, 308 participants; I/two.sups = 0%; P = 0.010; low certainty due to serious indirectness and imprecision) (Matsuzaka 2017; Murphy 2020 ). LHW-led psychological interventions may increase the likelihood of long-term recovery from/uni00A0CMDs/uni00A0> 6 months post intervention/uni00A0compared to usual care (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.87; 1 study, 493 participants; P = 0.0005; low certainty due to serious indirectness and imprecision) (Patel 2017). 2./uni00A0Prevalence of common mental disorders (CMDs) /uni00A0 (Analysis 1.2 ) Three studies reported change in prevalence of CMDs defined as Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosable major depression in/uni00A0Bolton 2003, scoring 9 on the PHQ-9 in/uni00A0Chibanda/uni00A02016, and scoring > 7 on the SRQ-20 in/uni00A0 Murphy 2020 ./uni00A0It is uncertain whether LHW-led psychological interventions reduce/uni00A0the prevalence of common mental disorders up to 1 month post intervention compared to usual care (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.77; 2 studies, 336 participants; I/two.sups/uni00A0= 92%; P = 0.29; very low certainty due to serious study limitations, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision) (Bolton 2003; Murphy 2020 ). LHW-led psychological interventions may reduce the prevalence of CMDs at 1 to 6 months post intervention/uni00A0compared to usual care/uni00A0(RR 0.42, 95% CI I/two.sups = 87%; P = 0.04; low certainty due to serious inconsistency and imprecision) (Chibanda 2016;/uni00A0Murphy 2020). 3. Severity of common mental disorder (CMD) symptoms (Analysis 1.3 ) Eight studies reported change in symptom severity of CMDs (Abas/uni00A02018; Ali 2003; Bolton 2003; Chibanda/uni00A02016; Matsuzaka 2017; Murphy 2020 ; Patel 2017; Petersen 2014). In these trials, symptom severity was measured using depression/uni00A0symptom inventories (e.g. PHQ-9) or more generic measures of psychological distress containing items related to both anxiety and depression symptoms (e.g. Hopkins Symptom Checklist, SRQ-20). For the purpose of this meta-analysis, we reported pooled depression and CMD scores, as the interventions used/uni00A0were transdiagnostic.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews when only depression inventory scores were used were almost identical to results based on CMD scores. LHW-led psychological interventions may reduce the symptom severity of CMDs up to 1 month post intervention compared to usual care (Ali 2003; Bolton 2003; Murphy 2020 ; Petersen 2014); however the range at which the actual eect may be noted (the \"margin of error\") indicates/uni00A0that the intervention may make 94%; P = 0.01; low certainty due to serious inconsistency and serious imprecision). LHW-led psychological interventions may reduce the symptom severity of CMDs at 1 to 6 months post intervention compared to usual care (SMD -0.59, 95% CI = 83%; P = 0.007; low serious inconsistency imprecision) (Abas/uni00A02018; Chibanda/uni00A02016; Matsuzaka 2017; Murphy 2020 ). LHW- led psychological interventions may slightly reduce the symptom severity of CMDs at > 6 months post intervention compared to usual care (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.14; 1 study, 493 participants; P = 0.0005; low certainty due to serious study indirectness and imprecision) (Patel 2017). 4. Quality of life (QOL) (Analysis 1.4 ) Only one study reported change in quality of life (QOL) as an outcome (Chibanda/uni00A02016). LHW-led psychological interventions may/uni00A0improve/uni00A0the QOL of people with CMDs at 1 to 6 months post intervention/uni00A0compared to usual care (SMD 0.51, to serious imprecision and indirectness, as/uni00A0the evidence was derived/uni00A0from one trial in one setting only). 5. Functional impairment and disability (Analysis 1.5 ) LHW-led psychological interventions may have/uni00A0little to no eect on functioning in people with CMDs up to 1 month post intervention compared to usual care (SMD -0.09, 95% CI = 0%; P = 0.25; low certainty due to serious study limitations and imprecision) (Bolton 2003; Murphy 2020 )./uni00A0LHW- led psychological interventions may slightly reduce functional impairment in people with CMDs at 1 to 6 months post intervention compared to usual care (SMD -047, 95% CI 89%; and imprecision) (Chibanda 2016;/uni00A0Murphy 2020 ; Patel 2017). LHW-led psychological interventions may have little to no eect on functioning in people with CMDs at > 6 months/uni00A0post intervention compared to usual care (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.02; 1 study, 493 participants; P = 0.08; low certainty due to serious imprecision/uni00A0and indirectness) (Patel 2017). 6. Service utilisation One study reported missed outpatient appointments (study on persons living with HIV with depression; Abas 2018)./uni202FAt baseline, a similar proportion of participants in the enhanced usual care (EUC) arm (22%) and in the problem-solving therapy-addiction (PST-AD) arm (29%) had missed appointments in the previous three/uni00A0months. However, at follow-up, a greater proportion in the EUC arm (44%) than in the PST-AD arm (21%) had missed appointments in the prior 3/uni00A0months. Given that this was a pilot study with a small number of participants, this finding was not statistically significant (P = 0.266). The intervention used a stepped care approach, and 36% (5/14) of participants were 'stepped up' to step two/uni00A0(to be seen by the psychologist at session four). Two of these 14 patients (14%) were then further referred to see a doctor for step three/uni00A0(to be commenced on antidepressant therapy)./uni00A0Patel 2017/uni00A0reported unplanned hospitalisations in 3/245 and 7/248 participants in the usual care and LHW-led interventions care arms, respectively (P = 0.34; RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.66; 1 study, 493 participants; very low certainty due to serious indirectness and very serious imprecision). 7. Adverse events Three trials reported a monitoring process for adverse events (Chibanda/uni00A02016; Murphy 2020 ; Patel 2017). In/uni00A0Chibanda/uni00A02016, no evidence of harm was associated with the intervention. At follow- up, 32 participants (12.3%) in the control group and 6 (2.3%) in the intervention group were identified as having suicidal ideation. In/uni00A0Murphy 2020 , the monitoring committee met three times during the trial and identified no concerns regarding safety or adverse events. In/uni00A0Patel 2017, deaths and suicide attempts were infrequent and were similar between groups (6/uni00A0(2%) in the EUC plus Health Activity Programme (HAP) group versus 3/uni00A0(1%) in the EUC alone group). LHW-led interventions may reduce the likelihood of suicidal ideation or attempts compared to usual care (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.58; 2 studies, 1014/uni00A0participants; low certainty due to indirectness and inconsistency)./uni00A0The evidence is uncertain/uni00A0regarding whether LHW-led interventions have any eect on deaths compared to usual care. /uni00A0 Study Adverse events Chibanda/uni00A02016 No evidence of harm was associated with the intervention.

Arjadi/uni00A02018 /uni00A0evaluated an 8-week online psychoeducational and behavioural activation intervention supported by lay counsellors for adults with PHQ-9 scores 10 in urban Indonesia. The control group received online psychoeducation only. A/uni00A0total of 159 and 154 subjects were randomised to the intervention arm and the comparison arm, respectively. At 10 weeks (2 weeks post intervention), participants in the intervention group had a 50% higher chance of remission at 10 weeks (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.88; P < 0.0001). PHQ-9 scores were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the comparison group (mean dierence (MD)/uni00A0-1.26 points, 95% CI -2.29 to -0.23; P = 0.017). The eect was sustained over time up to 6 months (eect size = 0.24 at 10 weeks, 0.24 at 3 months, and 0.27 at 6 months). No adverse events were reported in either group. Jiang/uni00A0 2017 /uni00A0evaluated a 6-month online intervention in Hunan Province for Chinese 'empty nesters' aged 60 years who scored 11 to 25 on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Nursing school students and community volunteers trained participants to use Chinese social media platforms, online shopping, online health services,/uni00A0and/uni00A0other cloud-based services. Services included a 24- hour health and psychology help line run by doctors and nurses to help with physical and mental health issues. The comparison group had access to the usual community health care but did not receive any additional interventions. Of the 80 participants, 40 were randomised to the intervention and 40 to the control. At baseline, mean GDS scores were 17.72 (standard deviation (SD) \u00b1 4.78) in the intervention group and 16.65 (SD \u00b1 4.84) in the control group (P = 0.945). At the end of the 6-month intervention, mean GDS scores were 11.82 (SD \u00b1 3.86) in the intervention group and 15.02 (SD \u00b1 4.26) in the control group (P = 0.001), indicating that GDS scores were significantly lower in the intervention group. Comparison 2. Primary-level worker-led collaborative care versus usual care in treating common mental disorders (CMDs) in adults We identified 13 studies from 7 countries across Africa (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE); Jenkins 2013 ; Oladeji 2015), South 2003; Fritsch 2007), 2015; 2014; settings, participants, interventions, and comparisons/uni00A0are described in/uni00A0Appendix 4 . A summary of key findings has been tabled in/uni00A0Summary of findings 2. Primary outcomes 1. Recovery from common mental disorders (Analysis 2.1 ) Seven studies reported recovery from CMDs, defined as scoring < 6 on the PHQ-9 in/uni00A0 Adewuya/uni00A02019/uni00A0and/uni00A0Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE), scoring 4 on the PHQ-9 in/uni00A0Niemi 2016 , scoring < 5 or having a 50% reduction from baseline on the PHQ-9 in/uni00A0Oladeji 2015 , scoring < 8 on the HDRS 2003, scoring < 7 on/uni00A0the HDRS scoring/uni00A0 11 on the GDS in/uni00A0Xie 2019. Collaborative care may increase the likelihood of short-term remission/recovery/uni00A0from CMDs up to 1 month post intervention compared to usual care (RR 3.75, 95% CI 1.68 to 8.34; 5 studies, 781 participants; I/two.sups = 70%; P = 0.001; low certainty due to serious study limitations and inconsistency) (Adewuya 2019;/uni00A0Araya 2003; Chen 2015 ; Niemi 2016 ; Xie 2019). Collaborative care may increase/uni00A0the likelihood of intermediate- term recovery from CMDs at 1 to 6 months post intervention compared to usual care (RR 2.26, 95%CI 1.50 to 3.43; 5 studies, 804 participants; I/two.sups = 67%; P = 0.0001; low/uni00A0certainty limitations and inconsistency) (Adewuya 2019;/uni00A0Araya 2003; Chen 2015; Oladeji 2015 ; Xie 2019). For recovery from CMD > 6 months post intervention, pooled results for this outcome/uni00A0are not/uni00A0reported due to very high statistical heterogeneity (98% to 99%). Rather, the individual results of contributing trials are reported. It is uncertain whether collaborative care has/uni00A0any eect on long-term recovery from CMDs at > 6 months post intervention compared to usual care./uni00A0In/uni00A0Adewuya/uni00A02019, recovery was observed in 60.3% of participants in the intervention group compared to 18.2% in the control group (absolute risk reduction/uni00A03.10, 95% CI 2.15 to 3.87). In/uni00A0Chen 2015 , recovery was observed in 57% of participants in the intervention group compared to 9% in the control group (odds ratio (OR) 12.7%, 95% CI 9.5 to 17). In/uni00A0Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE), however, recovery was similar in the intervention and control groups, at 76% and 77%, respectively (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.4). The certainty of evidence was very low/uni00A0 due to serious study limitations, serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision (3 studies, 922 participants;/uni00A0Adewuya/uni00A02019; Chen 2015 ; Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE). 2. Prevalence of common mental disorders (CMDs) (Analysis 2.2 ) Two studies reported change in prevalence of CMDs, defined as one minus the percentage recovered in/uni00A0Araya 2003, and International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of CMD on the Clinical Interview Schedule - Revised (CIS-R) in/uni00A0Patel 2010.

Collaborative care may have little or no/uni00A0eect on reducing/uni00A0the longer-term prevalence of CMDs at 1 year post intervention compared to usual care (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.33; 1 study, 2009 participants; P = 0.77; low certainty due to serious indirectness and imprecision) (Patel 2010). 3. Severity of depression/CMD symptoms (Analysis 2.3 ) Severity of depression/CMD symptoms was measured in 12 studies (CMD scores:/uni00A0Jenkins 2013 ; Patel 2010; Gureje/uni00A02019 2019; Niemi 2016 ; Oladeji 2015 ; Xie 2019). It is uncertain whether collaborative care has/uni00A0any eect on short- term symptom severity of depression/CMDs up to 1 month post intervention compared to usual care because the certainty of the evidence is very low (SMD -1.23, 95% CI -1.68 to = 0%; P < 0.00001; very low certainty due to serious indirectness, serious imprecision, and serious study limitations) (Niemi 2016 ; Xie 2019). Collaborative care interventions may slightly reduce intermediate- term symptom severity of depression/CMDs in the intermediate term at 1 to 6 months post intervention/uni00A0when compared to usual care in studies with change from baseline data (SMD -0.35, 95% CI = 89%; P = 0.01; low certainty to serious inconsistency and serious imprecision) 2003; Gureje 2019 (STEPCARE);/uni00A0Jenkins 2013 ; Patel 2010). For longer-term symptom severity of CMDs at > 6 months post intervention, pooled results for this outcome are not reported due to very high statistical heterogeneity (98% to 99%). Rather, the individual results of contributing trials are reported.

In/uni00A0Jordans 2019, dierence in PHQ-9 scores diered by -3.7, (95% CI -5.7 to -1.7). In/uni00A0Patel 2010, amongst participants who were diagnosed with depression based on the ICD-10, the mean dierence in CIS-R scores between intervention and control groups was -2.14, favouring the intervention group (95% CI -4.32 to 0.04). The certainty of evidence is very low due to serious study limitations, serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision (4 studies, 3274 participants;/uni00A0Chen 2015 ; Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE); Jordans uncertain whether collaborative care has/uni00A0any eect on the short-term symptom severity of depression up to 1 month post intervention/uni00A0compared to usual care in studies with endpoint data (SMD -0.87, 95% CI -1.55 to -0.19; 1 study, 38 participants; P = 0.01; very low certainty due to serious study limitations, serious indirectness, serious imprecision, and sparse data) (Indu 2018 ). Collaborative care may slightly reduce intermediate-term symptom severity of depression/CMDs at 1 to 6 months in studies withendpoint data (SMD -0.30, = 0%; and/uni00A0serious imprecision) (Fritsch 2007; Pradeep 2014; Xie 2019). We could not examine dierences in the severity of CMDs between outcomes for government and private facilities due to limited data. 4. Quality of life in adults with common mental disorders (Analysis 2.4 ) Eight studies reported QOL in adults with ; Jenkins 2013 ; Oladeji 2015 ; Pradeep 2014). It is uncertain whether collaborative care improved short-term QOL up to 1 month post intervention/uni00A0in people with CMDs compared to usual care because the certainty of evidence was very low (SMD 0.73, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.99; I/two.sups = 0%; P < 0.00001; very low certainty due to serious study limitations, indirectness, and sparse data) (Araya 2003; Indu 2018 ). Collaborative care may slightly improve intermediate-term QOL (1 to 6 months post intervention) in people with CMDs compared to usual care (SMD 75%; P = 0.0003; low imprecision) 2014). For long-term QOL, pooled results for this outcome are not reported due to very high statistical heterogeneity (98% to 99%). Rather, the individual results of contributing trials are reported./uni00A0It is uncertain whether collaborative care has/uni00A0any eect on/uni00A0long-term QOL at > 6 months post intervention/uni00A0for people with CMDs compared to usual care. In/uni00A0Chen 2015 , the between- group dierence in 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) scores was 9.6, favouring the intervention group (95% CI 8.1 to 11.1), but in/uni00A0Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE), intervention and control groups scored similarly on the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument, Short Form (WHOQOL-BREF) (SMD 0.08, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.25). The certainty of evidence was very low due to serious study limitations, serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision (2 studies, 711 participants;/uni00A0Chen 2015 ; Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE)). 5. Functional impairment and disability in adults with common mental disorders (CMDs) (Analysis 2.5 ) Seven studies reported functional impairment and disability in adults with CMDs (Araya ; Patel 2010). Collaborative care interventions probably have/uni00A0little to no eect on intermediate-term functional impairment at 1 to 6 months post intervention/uni00A0in people with CMDs compared to usual care (SMD = 48%; 2015 ; Patel 2010).

In/uni00A0Adewuya/uni00A02019/uni00A0at 12 months, compared with the intervention group, the EUC group reported more referrals to the mental health team (21.1% versus 9.6%) and more losses to follow-up (21.3% versus 14.3%). In/uni00A0Oladeji 2015 , all 165 participants received the first intervention session, 123 (74.5%) received at least two sessions, and 34.6% completed at least six sessions of counselling. Of the 165 participants, 42 (25.5.%) were prescribed antidepressants, and 25 (60%) of these participants completed at least 3 months of treatment. A total of 48 (29%) participants were discussed with the primary care physician by telephone; of these, 17 participants (10.3%) required an in-person consultation with the primary care physician, and 3 (2%) were referred to a psychiatrist. Based on results from/uni00A0Adewuya/uni00A02019, stepped care interventions led by primary health workers may reduce/uni00A0referral to mental health specialists/uni00A0for people with CMDs (at 7 to 12 months post intervention) compared to usual care (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.64; 1 study, 907 participants; low certainty due to very serious indirectness).7. Adverse events Only five/uni00A0trials reported adverse events (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE); Indu 2018 ; Jenkins 2013 ; Patel 2010). In/uni00A0Adewuya/uni00A02019/uni00A0at the 12th month, fewer deaths (adjusted/uni00A0RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.65) and fewer cases of deliberate self-harm (adjusted RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.55) were reported with the stepped care intervention compared to usual care. The 18 deaths that occurred within the 12-month follow-up were investigated and were deemed to be unrelated to study procedures./uni00A0Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE)/uni00A0reported 17 deaths in the intervention group (n =/uni00A0562) and 16 in the control group (n = 473); however all adverse events were deemed not related to the study. In/uni00A0Indu 2018 , adverse events were monitored but none occurred. In/uni00A0Jenkins 2013 ,/uni00A0no adverse events were reported. In/uni00A0Patel 2010, there was no dierence in suicide attempts among those diagnosed with CMDs at 1 year (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.32; 1905 participants) and within 2 to 6 months./uni00A0For deaths, the certainty of evidence was very low due to very serious imprecision and serious indirectness. For attempted suicide or deliberate self-harm, PW-led collaborative care may reduce risk compared to usual care (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.66; 2 studies, 3336 participants; low certainty due to very imprecision). /uni00A0 Study Adverse events /uni00A0 Adewuya/uni00A02019/uni00A0/uni00A0 /uni00A0 /uni00A0At 12 months, compared with the stepped care intervention group, the enhanced usual care group reported significantly more deaths (15/451; 3.3% vs 3/456; 0.6%) and 2.2%) Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE) /uni00A0At 12 months, 17 deaths had occurred in the intervention group (total 562) and 16 in the control group (total 473).

One patient developed psychosis and 1 developed bipolar disorder in the intervention group, and 1 developed bipolar dis- order in the control group.

Interventions were participants, interventions, and comparisons/uni00A0are described in/uni00A0Appendix 10 . A summary of key findings has been tabled in/uni00A0Summary of findings 8. Primary outcomes 1. Recovery from harmful or hazardous alcohol use/uni00A0 (Analysis 8.1 ) Recovery from harmful or hazardous alcohol use was reported in/uni00A0HuisIntVeld 2019,/uni00A0Mertens 2014,/uni00A0and/uni00A0Pengpid 2013/uni00A0at 1 to 6 months post intervention, and in/uni00A0HuisIntVeld 2019/uni00A0and/uni00A0Pengpid 2013/uni00A0at > 6 months post intervention. Recovery was defined as attaining an AUDIT score indicating low risk or abstinence in/uni00A0 HuisIntVeld 2019/uni00A0 and/uni00A0 Pengpid 2013, and an ASSIST score indicating low risk in/uni00A0Mertens 2014. PHP-led interventions probably had/uni00A0little to no eect on the likelihood of recovery from harmful or hazardous alcohol use at 1 to 6 months post intervention compared to enhanced usual care (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.77/uni00A0to 1.12; 3 studies, 1075 participants; I/two.sups = 28%; P = 0.43; moderate certainty due to serious indirectness). PHP-led psychological interventions may have little to no eect on the likelihood of recovery from harmful or hazardous alcohol use/uni00A0at > 6 months post intervention compared to enhanced usual care/uni00A0(RR 0.88, 95% CI 4%;/uni00A0P = 0.18; low certainty due to serious indirectness and imprecision).2.

Mertens 2014/uni00A0reported that PHP-led interventions had little to no eect on the prevalence of at-risk alcohol use (P = 0.96), at- risk cannabis use (P = 0.62),/uni00A0or at-risk methamphetamine use (P = 0.75)/uni00A0compared to enhanced usual care at 1 to 6 months post intervention (363 participants). Noknoy 2010/uni00A0reported that PHP-led interventions decreased the prevalence/uni00A0of hazardous drinking per drinking day during the previous week (P = 0.04) and/uni00A0of hazardous drinking per week during the previous week (P = 0.005) compared to enhanced usual care at 1 to 6 months post intervention (92 participants). Mertens 2014/uni00A0reported that PHP-led interventions had little to no eect on the prevalence of heavy drinking/uni00A0compared to enhanced usual care at 1 to 6 months post intervention/uni00A0(RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.05/uni00A0(reported OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.12); 363 participants). 3. Severity of harmful or hazardous alcohol use - risk of harmful or hazardous drinking based on AUDIT or Alcohol ASSIST score (Analysis 8.3 /uni00A0Analysis 8.4 /uni00A0Analysis 8.5 ) Risk of harmful or hazardous drinking based on the AUDIT or Alcohol ASSIST score was reported at < 1 month post CP intervention for/uni00A0Marais 2011; at 1 to 6 months post PHP intervention for/uni00A0HuisIntVeld 2019,/uni00A0Mertens 2014, and/uni00A0Pengpid 2013; and at 6 months post PHP intervention for/uni00A0HuisIntVeld 2019/uni00A0and/uni00A0Pengpid 2013.

In studies reporting mean change scores, the clinical eect on reducing functional impairment is uncertain (MCD -2.19, 95% CI -4.22 to -0.16; 1 study, 104 participants; P = 0.03; very low certainty due to serious study limitations, indirectness, and very serious imprecision) (Analysis 14.8)./uni00A0The overall evidence was of low certainty due to serious inconsistency and imprecision. In the medium term (1 to 6 months post intervention), mean change scores were reported in/uni00A0Jordans 2010,/uni00A0Tol 2008, and/uni00A0Tol 2012, and mean scores were reported in/uni00A0Ertl 2011 .

Primary outcomes 1. Recovery from PTSD/uni00A0 (Analysis 15.1 ) This was reported in/uni00A0Barron 2013, where recovery was derived from taking the dierence between the total number scoring above the cuto for PTSD on the Child Revised Impact of Events Scale-13 (CRIES-13) at baseline and the number scoring above the cuto for PTSD on CRIES-13 on follow-up divided by the total number scoring above the cuto for PTSD on CRIES-13 at baseline. It is uncertain whether psychosocial interventions led by community professionals (new school counsellors) improve/uni00A0recovery from/uni00A0PTSD in children at 2 weeks post intervention, as despite an apparently important eect, this study was conducted on a very small number of people (RR 3.93,95% CI 1.31 to 11.80; 78 participants, 1 study; P = 0.01; very low certainty due to serious study limitations, indirectness, and very serious imprecision).

Study authors reported/uni00A0a large eect on reduction in PTS symptoms in the intervention group compared to the control group post intervention (d = 0.76; P < 0.05), which correlated/uni00A0with the moderate clinical eect noted above in the meta-analysis. At 1-6 months post intervention, severity of PTS symptoms was reported in/uni00A0Berger 2009,/uni00A0Betancourt/uni00A02014, and/uni00A0Gordon 2008. Due to large variation between studies in reported eects and serious risk of bias, it is uncertain whether CP-led interventions reduce PTS symptoms among children versus existing care/uni00A0at 1 to 6 months post intervention/uni00A0(SMD -0.37, = 94%; P = 0.39; very low certainty due to serious study limitations, inconsistency, and very serious imprecision).

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Economic studies related to included studies Although literature is emerging on the eectiveness of primary- level workers in delivering mental health services, very limited data on unit costs and resource requirements are available. This is mainly due to the diiculties associated with conducting economic analyses, time lags from inputs to outcomes, and many confounding variables. Table 4/uni00A0shows the data from the 20/uni00A0included studies that reported cost-eectiveness or costs in relation to the care of adults and children with mental health disorders. These studies underline the feasibility and potential cost-eectiveness of PWs in providing mental health care, and report costs related to absenteeism and healthcare utilisation. However, all of the studies had significant risks of bias that cast doubt on the accuracy and reliability of these data. Not all relevant alternatives and costs (such as productivity loss)/uni00A0were considered or reported, some costs relied on estimates, future costs were not discounted properly, and chosen time horizons were less than one year in most cases. 1. PW-led interventions for adults with common mental disorders compared to usual care/uni00A0(Comparisons 1 and 2) Four of the 12 included randomised trials in the CMD comparison groups reported some form of economic evaluation: all four are cost-eectiveness studies of PWs delivering psychological interventions for depressive disorders. Two studies were multi- disciplinary (i.e. were delivered by doctors, nurses, and LHWs) (Gureje 2019 (STEPCARE); Araya 2006, reference in/uni00A0Araya 2003), (Patel 2017). combined/uni00A0cost-eectiveness and cost-utility analysis/uni00A0was conducted (Buttor 2013, reference in/uni00A0Patel 2010), which was linked to a randomised trial on people with depression and/or anxiety by/uni00A0Patel 2010./uni00A0/uni00A0 Findings in two studies suggest that PW-delivered psychological interventions for depressive disorders may be cost-eective (Gureje 2019 (STEPCARE);/uni00A0Patel 2017), whilst Araya 2006 (reference in/uni00A0Araya 2003) suggests/uni00A0that the stepped-care programme was marginally expensive when compared to usual care./uni00A0Patel 2017's assessment of cost-eectiveness (incremental cost-eectiveness life-year (QALY) gained was $1,721. This indicates/uni00A0that Health Activity Programme (HAP) plus enhanced usual care (EUC) was associated with both lower costs and better outcomes than EUC alone. These researchers concluded that the HAP was cost-eective when wide societal eects on productivity were considered./uni00A0Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE)/uni00A0showed/uni00A0considerable reductions in service costs. The reduction in cost per 1-point improvement on the PHQ-9 with the stepped-care intervention compared with the control was USD 29.69/uni00A0(95% CI USD -21.56 to 89.45)./uni00A0Study authors concluded that their/uni00A0stepped-care intervention combined with enhanced usual care lowered costs more than enhanced usual care alone, with some evidence for a more favourable cost- eectiveness profile for treating depression in this setting./uni00A0Araya 2006 (reference in/uni00A0Araya 2003) estimated that the stepped- care programme cost an extra USD0.37 per depression-free day compared to the/uni00A0usual in/uni00A0Patel the task-sharing psychological intervention by LHWs were similar to those of the/uni00A0EUC. However,/uni00A0time costs were lower and health outcomes significantly better in the intervention arm thanin the control arm. In addition,/uni00A0the intervention appeared to be both cost-eective/uni00A0and/uni00A0cost-saving/uni00A0for the public primary-care facilities./uni00A0Therefore, participants in the intervention arm used and/ or lost less cash and showed greater improvement in mental state than control participants. Evidence for cost-eectiveness of LHW-led interventions is very uncertain due to serious study limitations, indirectness, and imprecision. PHP-led collaborative care interventions are probably cost-eective compared to usual care (moderate certainty due to serious study limitations). There seemed to be no change in either hospital outpatient or inpatient costs between arms in/uni00A0Patel 2017. Patient costs seemed to be overall less in the intervention arms compared to the control arms, and their productivity was increased for two of the four/uni00A0studies in which this was reported (Patel 2010; Patel 2017). Evidence for health system costs of LHW-led interventions is very uncertain due to serious study limitations, indirectness, and imprecision. PHP-led collaborative care is probaby marginally more expensive compared to usual care (moderate certainty due to serious study limitations). 2. PW-led interventions for women with maternal depression compared to usual or enhanced usual care (Comparisons 3 and 4) Four of the nine included studies in the perinatal comparison group had economic evaluations: three studies assessed cost- eectiveness of LHW interventions versus EUC in pregnant women 18 years of age or older (Fuhr 2019; Lund 2020; Sikander 2019), whilst one study assessed cost-eectiveness of professional (nurse/ midwife)-led interventions and LHWs for pregnant women aged 16 years or older (Gureje 2019 (EXPONATE)) versus a low-intensity intervention (mhGAP). The only study to say that a PW intervention was not cost-eective was/uni00A0Lund 2020. This group found no significant dierences in participant unit costs nor in mean costs per visit to a healthcare provider but learned that psychological treatment was more costly per participant per year (USD 117.16) versus EUC (USD 85.30). However, in/uni00A0Fuhr 2019, ICER estimates showed that the Thinking Healthy Programme peer-delivered (THPP) intervention was cost- saving through reduced health care and time and productivity costs and was relatively cheap compared to the EUC only. In addition, the THPP delivered in/uni00A0Sikander 2019/uni00A0oered/uni00A0an appreciable improvement in health at a low marginal cost over a willingness-to- pay threshold of USD 60 per unit of improvement in PHQ-9 score. The high-intensity stepped-psychological intervention in/uni00A0Gureje 2019 (EXPONATE)/uni00A0was cost-eective, but because the mhGAP (low- intensity treatment) in the control group was associated with similar changes in health, functioning, and cost, no significant dierence was found for the more intensive strategy. We found that three of the studies in this group showed that interventions were cost-eective (Fuhr 2019; Gureje 2019 2019 (EXPONATE)/uni00A0was more cost-eective than its low-intensity control - while/uni00A0Lund 2020/uni00A0found that the psychological treatment was more costly per participant per year. LHW-led interventions may or may not be cost- eective compared to EUC (low-certainty evidence due to serious study limitations and inconsistency). PHP-led collaborative care interventions may be slightly or no more cost-eective than EUC (low certainty due to serious study limitations and indirectness).

PHP-led collaborative care interventions may incur higher health service costs compared to EUC (low certainty due to serious study limitations and indirectness). 3. LHW-led interventions for adults with alcohol and substance use compared to enhanced usual care/uni00A0(Comparison groups 7 to 10) Four of the 17 included studies in the alcohol and substance use comparison reported some form of economic evaluation: delivering psychological interventions for alcohol dependence -/uni00A0Nadkarni 2017/uni00A0- and harmful or hazardous drug use - Dwommoh Sorsdahl 2015. Galarraga 2017 (see under/uni00A0Papas 2020) used model-estimated costs rather than real cost data in its economic evaluation. None of the trials that reported economic data evaluated interventions delivered by health professionals. Findings of all four studies in this comparison group suggest that LHW-delivered interventions may be cost-eective (see/uni00A0Table 4). All three studies that assessed cost-eectiveness from a societal perspective found that these task-shi/f_ting interventions had/uni00A0potential to be eective and to (Nadkarni 2019; Dwommoh 2018, see/uni00A0Nadkarni 2017; Sorsdahl 2015). The study that undertook a cost-benefit analysis of shi/f_ting interventions for alcohol dependence among HIV-positive persons from professionals to paraprofessional providers showed that this could generate economic benefits in the medium and long term (Galarraga 2017, see/uni00A0Papas 2020). LHW-led interventions for patients with harmful and hazardous alcohol use may be cost-eective compared to EUC (low certainty due to serious study limitations and indirectness), but the evidence for LHW- led interventions for patients with alcohol dependence is very uncertain (due to serious indirectness and very serious imprecision). We found few/uni00A0data on resource use, and among those reported, there seemed to be little to no dierence between intervention and control groups, although/uni00A0Sorsdahl 2015/uni00A0suggested/uni00A0total patient costs were/uni00A0higher the more intensive the arm control due to travel, counselling sessions (motivational interviewing/problem- solving therapy (MI-PST)), and time o work./uni00A0Costs to patients were lower or uncertain. Evidence for health service costs for LHW-led interventions for harmful or hazardous alcohol use or dependent alcohol use compared to EUC is very uncertain (due to serious study limitations, indirectness, and imprecision, and to serious indirectness and very serious imprecision, respectively). 4. PW-led interventions for adults with severe mental disorders compared to specialist-led care (Comparisons 11 and 12) Four out of the seven/uni00A0studies in the/uni00A0comparison of primary health professional-led or collaborative care versus specialist-led care for people with severe mental disorders performed economic evaluations. A cost-eectiveness analysis was performed in three of them (Barfar 2017; Malakouti 2015; Tan 2005), and a cost analysis was performed in one (Li 2002). In all four studies, interventionsdelivered by primary health professionals or collaborative care resulted in cost savings compared to specialist-led care. In/uni00A0Barfar 2017, cost-eectiveness analysis showed that primary health professional-led or collaborative care interventions were USD 66,000/uni00A0cheaper than specialist-led care, and/uni00A0the average total cost per patient in the specialist-led group was USD 4651/uni00A0compared to USD 3823/uni00A0in the primary health professional-led group (equivalent to a cost reduction of about USD 800/uni00A0per person). In/uni00A0Malakouti 2015, interventions delivered by general physicians and nurses yielded ICERs of USD 583.20/uni00A0and USD 512.86/uni00A0per QALY gained, respectively, leading study authors to conclude that nurse-led care was most cost-eective. In/uni00A0Tan 2005, study authors reported that collaborative care involving primary health professionals resulted in lower direct costs (USD 17.02 \u00b1 18.34 versus 82.08 care. In/uni00A0Li 2002, trial authors found that specialist-led care cost 3.19 times more in direct costs compared to primary health professional-led care. The cost-eectiveness of PHP-led collaborative care compared to specialist-led care is very uncertain due to serious study limitations, indirectness, and imprecision. In/uni00A0 Chatterjee 2014/uni00A0- one of the two/uni00A0studies that compared LHW-led interventions for people with severe mental disorders versus specialist-led care, a cost-eectiveness and cost-utility analysis was performed, and findings/uni00A0were that/uni00A0costs in the intervention group were on average greater than those in the control group, and that about a third of these additional costs were attributable to supervision./uni00A0A/f_ter adjustments for baseline, the/uni00A0mean dierence/uni00A0between the two groups/uni00A0was USD CI USD 136.00 to USD 252.51). The/uni00A0ICER/uni00A0based on the/uni00A0Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) shows that a cost of USD 51.93/uni00A0was needed/uni00A0to achieve a 1-point reduction on the PANSS/uni00A0and cost of/uni00A0USD 204.98 on the IDEAS./uni00A0The cost-eectiveness and health service costs of LHW-led interventions compared to specialist- led care are very uncertain due to serious study limitations, indirectness, and imprecision. We found few data on resource use and patient costs. Overall health service costs were higher, although costs of hospitalisations were reduced (Tan 2005). Patient costs were variable, depending on the type of intervention./uni00A0Tan 2005/uni00A0also reported that patients receiving collaborative care involving primary health professionals had improved productivity; they missed on average 7.7 fewer days of work per month for health reasons, saving USD 27.90/month as a result, compared to patients receiving specialist-led care, and their family members missed 2.3 fewer days of work per month, saving USD 7.13/month as a result./uni00A0Evidence for health system costs of PHP-led collaborative care is very uncertain due to serious study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision. 5. PW-led interventions for children and adolescents with post- traumatic stress (PTS) or common mental disorders (CMDs) compared to usual or no care (Comparisons 14 and 15)/uni00A0/uni00A0 Three of the 15 included studies in this comparison group reported some economic evaluation: one cost-eectiveness study -/uni00A0Barron 2016/uni00A0- and two cost analysis - Jordans 2011, see/uni00A0Tol 2008; Tol 2012/uni00A0- of LHWs delivering psychological interventions for PTS and CMD./uni00A0 Findings of both studies showed economic gains and recommended delivery of these interventions to other populations Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Given the high returns and low costs of the Teaching Recovery Techniques (TRT) intervention versus the wait-list (cost- eectiveness),/uni00A0Barron 2016/uni00A0concluded that the /uni00A0TRT could be cost-eective and could be delivered throughout the West Bank. However, evidence for cost-eectiveness of CP-led interventions was very uncertain due to serious study limitations, indirectness, and imprecision. Cost analysis of a school-based psychosocial intervention versus wait-list control for children aged 7 to 15 years in Indonesia - Jordans 2011 (reference in/uni00A0Tol 2008) - estimated that the mean cost per service user lies between USD 4.60 and 23.04./uni00A0The same cost analysis conducted in Sri Lanka/uni00A0of school-based psychosocial intervention versus wait-list control for children aged 9 to 12 years - Jordans 2011 (reference in/uni00A0Tol 2012) - showed that/uni00A0mean cost per user/uni00A0was USD 8.85. This study suggests/uni00A0that a multi-layer psychosocial package appeared/uni00A0feasible and satisfactory for reaching out to populations of distressed children through dierent levels of care./uni00A0LHW-led interventions probably can be delivered at low cost compared to no care (moderate certainty due to serious study limitations). We found no data on resource use nor on patient costs or productivity, apart from/uni00A0Barron 2016,/uni00A0which acknowledged some transport costs that may be an important out-of-pocket cost for patients. Evidence for health service costs of CP-led interventions is very uncertain due to serious study limitations, indirectness and imprecision./uni00A0 D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results This review identified 95 randomised trials evaluating the eectiveness of primary-level worker (PW) interventions for treatment of mental disorders and distress in 30 low- and middle- income countries (LMICs). In general, PWs seem to have a small to moderate eect on reducing mental health symptoms and improving quality of life and functioning. Details of this summary are described in the abstract and in the plain language summary. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence This review aimed to assess the eectiveness of/uni00A0PWs including primary health professionals (PHPs), lay health workers (LHWs), and community professionals (CPs) such as teachers/uni00A0in delivering care for people with mental disorders, to provide guidance to health policy makers in LMICs. Several issues need to be considered when judgements are made about the applicability of these findings to large-scale programmes. Factors related to the type and role of primary-level/uni00A0workers The included studies used many dierent types of/uni00A0PWs, some of whom were existing cadres within the health service sector, while others were additionally trained resources, particularly for common mental disorders (CMDs) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, we identified/uni00A0only a/uni00A0few studies for most comparisons and details of intervention and training o/f_ten were inadequately reported. We found suicient studies to divide the analyses by/uni00A0professional/uni00A0versus non-professional cadres/lay workers, which we hope is useful for policy makers in seeing which cadres may best fit with their current/uni00A0workforce, so that they can/uni00A0prioritise specific interventions accordingly. However, we were/uni00A0not able to explore the eects of interventions according todierent PW/uni00A0characteristics (such as selection, training, support, incentives, or remuneration). Although mentioned in many studies, the training and support of PWs were not described in detail in more than half the studies. Incentives and remuneration were mentioned in only three studies. We also were not able to explore the independent eects of/uni00A0PWs/uni00A0when they were part of complex interventions (such as collaborative care) nor the eects of the intensity of PW-led interventions, as this was also inadequately described. More complete and uniform reporting of this information would help guide policy makers in tailoring the types of/uni00A0PWs/uni00A0and their roles within scaled-up programmes appropriately and may be featured in a separate publication. Furthermore, many/uni00A0studies considered/uni00A0the role of PWs as an 'add- on' to usual care./uni00A0Only/uni00A0the/uni00A0nine studies within the/uni00A0two severe mental disorders comparisons/uni00A0compared these cadres versus specialists, but these studies had serious risk of bias issues and/uni00A0some/uni00A0outcomes that could not be pooled. Therefore, we cannot be certain whether task-shi/f_ting (with appropriate supervision) to non-specialists/uni00A0(i.e. actually substituting specialists with non-specialists)/uni00A0leads to equivalent quality of care or equivalent results in terms of appropriate care. Very few studies measured adverse/uni00A0events/uni00A0or unintended consequences of/uni00A0PW-led care, and such eects could impact the appropriateness and quality of care,/uni00A0potentially leading to patient harm. Interventions Comparisons of studies were performed by/uni00A0mental/uni00A0disorder,/uni00A0by broad types of interventions (such as collaborative care/uni00A0and psychological interventions), and/uni00A0by/uni00A0professional or lay cadre/uni00A0of workers/uni00A0delivering the intervention(s). With regards to cadres delivering the intervention, it was possible, given the low to moderate certainty of evidence,/uni00A0to/uni00A0conclude that both LHWs and/uni00A0PHPs may be slightly or moderately eective for most mental disorders, delivering a variety of psychological or psychosocial/social interventions and collaborative care interventions (sometimes with pharmacological interventions/uni00A0prescribed/uni00A0by/uni00A0primary health professionals). None of the included studies addressed the/uni00A0indirect/uni00A0impact of delivering mental health care on other elements of/uni00A0health care delivered by PWs or on other roles (e.g. the impact of a mental health intervention on primary care doctors' other tasks such as treating patients with diabetes, the impact on their working pattern such as consultation times)./uni00A0However,/uni00A0several studies within CMD, perinatal depression, and severe mental disorder comparisons did provide information on hospital admissions and outpatient consultation/uni00A0attendances./uni00A0Similarly, more recent studies published since the previous version of this review were more likely to report adverse events. Even so, less than/uni00A020% of studies reported/uni00A0service utilisation and adverse events. Service or social interventions that measure mental health outcomes were not included - only specific mental health interventions. Mental health outcomes are closely related to social determinants of health such as poverty. This will have excluded interventions (probably most o/f_ten delivered by lay workers or social workers) that primarily aect mental health/uni00A0outcomes but/uni00A0are not mental health interventions. We recommend this to be the focus of subsequent reviews. Some of those identified are listed in our Excluded studies. Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration.96Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews We categorised mental disorders in this review similarly to our 2013 review, but we took a more nuanced approach to the grouping of post-traumatic stress syndromes. It was important to dierentiate PTSD (meeting specific diagnostic criteria) from PTS symptoms (acute reactions to stress), notably to understand the progression of symptoms along the mental health spectrum. This was important with regards to dierentiating recovery from progression of symptoms in this review but will also be important for dierentiating primary prevention from trauma exposure to PTS symptoms, and secondary prevention from PTS symptoms to PTSD, in our sister review on the use of PWs in prevention of mental illness and promotion of mental health (Purgato 2021). Programme delivery Several issues need to be considered in applying these findings to healthcare delivery systems. First, these are interventions delivered in research settings where/uni00A0PWs/uni00A0are more likely to have been carefully selected; project leaders are more motivated; remuneration may be more available because of research funding; and training, supervision, and monitoring are generally much more intensive. These conditions may not be replicable at scale or may not be as eective at scale. Second, the types of study design chosen here were not appropriate or suicient to inform judgements regarding the sustainability of programmes; alternative study designs, such as longitudinal studies, economic evaluations, and qualitative studies are needed for this. Third, the applicability of review findings needs to be considered in each setting where decisions on task-sharing or task-shi/f_ting for mental health treatment are made (Lavis 2009 ). Factors that decision-makers may wish to consider include the extent to which their settings resemble those of the included studies, such as on- the-ground constraints, health service and system arrangements, dierences in baseline conditions, presence of specific groups that might benefit from the intervention, sociocultural factors in those populations such as cultural perceptions of mental health and stigma, and availability of routine data on mental health issues and treatment./uni00A0Although the review covered 30 LMICs (13 of which were conducted in low-income settings), data were insuicient for any subgroup analyses by country or income setting within the overarching classification of mental disorders and types of health workers. Fourth, it is important to know the financial burden of such interventions. Only 20/uni00A0studies reported cost data,/uni00A0and these were all from dierent settings, with no more than/uni00A0five/uni00A0studies pertaining to one comparison. This suggests that/uni00A0interventions may be cost- eective/uni00A0and of low cost for some studies,/uni00A0but/uni00A0due to localised costs and data, the results cannot be generalised to all LMICs. Also no studies included health service or societal perspective costs for training specialists (for delivery or for supervision of the community intervention). This may therefore lead to underestimation of the costs of these interventions when specialists are involved in collaborative care or shared care. Given that only cost and cost- eectiveness data from included studies feature in the cost and cost-eectiveness analysis, this analysis may be incomplete. A systematic review of the literature to look for stand-alone cost or cost-eectiveness studies would complete these findings.Outcomes This review attempted to be transdiagnostic by looking at mental distress and mental illness as a spectrum. However, we were limited by what the studies reported. It was not possible to combine concepts of recovery, prevalence, and severity due to the very heterogeneous definitions of these, even within each of these concepts. We therefore resorted to report as best we could on mental disorders. Furthermore for two comparisons (Summary of findings table 1; Summary of findings table 3), the same tool (and thus data) was used with dierent thresholds for recovery and change in symptoms (e.g. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to look at continuous outcomes of symptom change with the view that if the score is < 5, this indicates recovery). This may have led to overestimation of the eect. We reviewed the inclusion criteria for studies that looked at mental distress or prodromal disorders and decided to include some of these in the prevention review instead as secondary or tertiary prevention interventions (Purgato 2021). Studies that were transdiagnostic and had as their inclusion criteria people who met the diagnostic criteria for disorders and those who did not are included in both reviews. Studies awaiting classification An update in 2020 of the searches for this review identified 16 further studies that are awaiting classification. Due to resource limitations, it was not possible to incorporate them into this review update. These additional studies may lead to some changes in review findings at a future update, but current findings represent a substantial step forward in understanding the eectiveness of mental health treatments delivered/uni00A0by primary-level workers. Quality of the evidence This review included 95/uni00A0randomised trials covering a wide range of interventions and settings. For studies included in the meta-analyses, evidence for most outcomes was of low to moderate certainty./uni00A0Risk of bias/uni00A0assessments highlighted concerns regarding insuicient information on sequence generation and allocation concealment; dierences in baseline outcome measurements;/uni00A0detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors; and failure to address incomplete outcome data adequately, particularly safety data and data on contamination/uni00A0between intervention and/uni00A0control arms./uni00A0With regards to safety data, most studies did not report adverse events, and among those that did, event numbers were very low. This may impact confidence intervals (CIs) around eect estimates, and this would be taken into account in the GRADE assessment./uni00A0 When meta-analysis was possible, the results were fairly consistent in showing improvements in favour of/uni00A0PW/uni00A0interventions, although for some interventions and outcomes, there were important variations in reported eects that could not be explained. For example,/uni00A0it is not clear in the harmful alcohol and substance/uni00A0use/uni00A0comparison/uni00A0why LHWs may be more eective than health professionals, and why for some studies results favoured the control group. Some studies assessed large numbers of outcomes, increasing the probability of finding statistically significant dierences for some outcomes by chance. Furthermore, the diversity of psychometric and other outcome measures used made interpretation of Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration.97Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews statistically pooled outcome data diicult./uni00A0The validity and psychometric properties of the same measure across dierent settings may also vary, which may further limit the reliability of the information. Our primary search date occurred in June 2019, and a repeat search was performed in August 2020. Due to the complexity and size of the review and the multiple iterations we had been through, we put the 16 new studies identified into 'awaiting classification', and we plan to update the review with these findings soon. This may limit the up-to-date completeness of findings presented in the meta- analyses. This update/uni00A0of/uni00A0the/uni00A0review/uni00A0has highlighted a wealth of information on several dierent disorders,/uni00A0and we note that publications in this field are likely to continue to increase, particularly in light of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its eects. Further updates will need to consider subdividing this area by dierent disorders/uni00A0rather than including all disorders in one review./uni00A0This would allow more in-depth analysis into other variations and factors and may help provide more nuanced answers about which types of interventions and which types of professionals/lay workers (and training and other perspectives) may be more specifically eective. Potential biases in the review process PWs, particularly LHWs,/uni00A0remain poorly indexed in the literature. Although we tried to cover a broad range of synonyms for these health workers, it is possible that some studies have been missed. In addition, PWs/uni00A0and LHWs do not have standard widely accepted definitions, so some readers may disagree with these definitions or with how this review has aggregated dierent health worker cadres. We found too few studies within each comparison to assess publication bias through assessment of asymmetry. However,/uni00A0we assessed publication bias by checking on ongoing studies/those awaiting classification/uni00A0from the 2013 review/uni00A0and did not notice any publication bias (all had been published; those that had not been published had been aborted for non-clinical reasons). Many meta-analyses were performed; therefore, some of the findings may be due to chance. Many pooled results were statistically and clinically heterogeneous, mainly because of the small number of included studies and the breadth of geographical, health worker, intervention, and patient characteristics. Therefore the results need to be interpreted with caution. A further limitation was that 33 of the 89 trials meta-analysed that did not conduct an intention-to-treat analysis generally were not re-analysed or their missing data were not imputed (except for one analysis/uni00A0for which/uni00A0we were able to source data:/uni00A0PW- led psychological interventions for depression - prevalence of depression)./uni202FThis may have an impact on the estimates of eect. Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews We identified 23/uni00A0reviews related to this current/uni00A0review, which examined various aspects of primary or community mental health care delivered by a non-specialist workforce (Table 2). None of these reviews presented a comprehensive summary of all PWs across all mental disorders/distress in LMICs. Also, a number ofthese reviews are based on searches that are now very out-of-date, which may limit the usefulness of their findings. Several systematic reviews reviewed models of delivery (but not specifically types of health workers) such as collaborative care (Bower 2006; Woltmann 2012 ), psychological 2020 ; Huntley 2012; Shahmalak 2019 ), mental health interventions provided in humanitarian settings (Purgato 2018; Tol 2011), interventions provided for common perinatal mental disorders among women in LMICs Munodawafa 2018; Rahman 2013),/uni00A0school- and community- based mental health interventions for young people in settings in LMICs ( Barry 2013; Burkey 2018; Klasen 2013 ), and recovery of people living with severe mental illness in LMICs (Gamieldien 2020 ). Certain reviews focused on health workforce competencies for community-based providers (Kohrt 2018), as well as roles of mid-level health workers in delivering healthcare services to the general population (Lassi 2013 ). Only four reviews specifically examined/uni00A0the eectiveness of non-specialist providers (1) in providing psychological treatments for depression, anxiety, and PTSD outcomes (randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) (Singla 2017 ); (2) in implementing mhGAP (a World Health Organization mental health gap/uni00A0programme) in LMICs (Keynejad 2018); (3) in using LHWs for prevention of mental disorders (Mutamba 2013); and (4) in using peers to deliver mental health interventions (Fuhr 2014). Similar to our findings, the/uni00A0 Singla 2017 /uni00A0meta-analysis showed pooled results for anxiety, depression, outcomes demonstrating benefit (standardised mean dierence (SMD) 0.49, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.62). However, this review did not divide findings by type of health worker, nor did review authors extract dichotomous outcomes. Both/uni00A0Fuhr 2014/uni00A0 and/uni00A0 Mutamba 2013/uni00A0suggested that peers or LHWs may improve psychosocial and mental outcomes, although these findings are out-of-date (Mutamba 2013/uni00A0is being updated by/uni00A0Purgato 2021). Furthermore, this review did not include peers unless recruited as LHWs to perform a wider community role. Peers o/f_ten have a dierent informal role just within their own family or environment, and these roles are qualitatively dierent, as they rely on a close relationship (see definitions in/uni00A0Table 1)./uni00A0Keynejad 2018/uni00A0could not perform a meta-analysis, as only two randomised trials were identified. Most identified literature on the mhGAP was implementation and observational literature. An additional 14 reviews incorporated aspects of interventions delivered by non-specialists/paraprofessionals/primary workers that were included in this current review (Barry 2013; Boer 2005 ; Bower 2006; 2012 ). All of these review authors agree with our review findings of mild to moderate benefit of PWs, also among those that reviewed studies in high-income countries (Boer 2005 ; Bower 2006; Woltmann 2012 ). Most of these were reviews without meta-analyses, although the four studies that did include meta-analyses reported findings and magnitude of eects similar to ours (Purgato 2018; Rahman 2013; Tol 2011; Woltmann 2012 ). For example,/uni00A0Rahman 2013, a systematic review on interventions for women with perinatal disorders in LMICs, included LHW-led interventions, and the final pooled estimate was very similar to ours, showing that these interventions may lead to benefit (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.21). Details of these reviews and on how they agree or dier from this review are presented in/uni00A0Table 2.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews A U T H O R S ' /uni00A0 C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice Most results from the 95 randomised trials suggest that primary- level workers (PWs) delivering interventions for the care of individuals with mental disorders and distress have some impact on patient outcomes, although most evidence is of low certainty. Given the multitude of settings, disorders, interventions, and health worker expertise covered in this review, studies within each category are still too few to allow conclusions on specific intervention characteristics (such as type of health worker, duration of intervention, levels of training and supervision, etc.) that may impact eectiveness. Evidence does show important results across studies, in particular, the impact of lay health workers/uni00A0(LHWs) and primary health/uni00A0professionals (PHPs) on/uni00A0clinical symptoms and improvement in functioning and quality of life for patients,/uni00A0as mentioned above. 1. Adults with depression and anxiety Treatments from/uni00A0LHWs compared to usual care may increase recovery, may reduce the number of people with depression/ anxiety, may improve/uni00A0quality of life, may slightly improve day- to-day functioning, and may reduce risk of suicidal/uni00A0thoughts or attempts. Treatments from primary-level workers in collaboration with mental health specialists compared to usual care may increase/uni00A0recovery; may reduce the number of people with depression/anxiety, although the range for the actual eect/uni00A0indicates they may have little or no eect; may slightly reduce/uni00A0symptoms; may slightly improve/uni00A0quality of life; probably have little to no eect on day-to-day functioning; and may reduce referral to mental health specialists. 2. Women with depression related to pregnancy and childbirth Treatments from LHWs compared to usual care may/uni00A0increase recovery; probably slightly/uni00A0reduce/uni00A0symptoms of depression; may slightly improve day-to-day functioning; and may have little to no eect on risk of death. 3. Adults in humanitarian settings with post-traumatic stress or depression and anxiety Treatments from LHWs compared to usual care may slightly reduce symptoms of depression; probably slightly improving/uni00A0quality of life. Treatments from primary health professionals compared to usual care may reduce the numbers of adults with post-traumatic stress and depression. 4. Adults with alcohol or substance use problems/uni00A0 Treatments from LHWs compared to usual care may increase recovery/uni00A0from harmful/hazardous alcohol use, although the range for the actual eect/uni00A0indicates they may have little to no eect; probably slightly reduce the risk of harmful/uni00A0or hazardous drinking; may have little to no eect on day-to-day functioning; and may have little to no eect on the number of people who use methamphetamine.Treatments from primary health and community professionals compared to usual care probably have little to no eect on recovery from harmful/hazardous alcohol use; probably/uni00A0slightly reduce/uni00A0risk of harmful/hazardous alcohol and substance use; and probably have little to no eect on quality of life. 5. Adults with severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia Treatments from primary health professionals alone or in collaboration with mental health specialists compared to mental health specialists alone may improve day-to-day functioning. 6. Adults with dementia/uni00A0and their carers Treatments from lay and professional health workers may have little to no eect on/uni00A0the severity of behavioural symptoms/uni00A0in dementia patients and may reduce/uni00A0carers' mental distress. 7. Children in humanitarian settings with post-traumatic stress or depression and anxiety Treatments from LHWs may/uni00A0have little to no eect on post- traumatic stress probably/uni202Fhave/uni00A0little to no/uni00A0eect/uni00A0on depressive symptoms or on day-to-day functioning; and make little to no dierence in adverse events. Treatments from community professionals (teachers and social workers) may have little to no eect on depressive symptoms; and make little to no dierence in adverse events. Very few studies measured unintended consequences/uni00A0of PW-led care. We divided adverse events (as per description in the methods) into clinical indicators, service delivery indicators, and social indicators. How we defined and categorised adverse events was arbitrary, reflecting lack/uni00A0of reporting for this important outcome. Health service utilisation was thus included within adverse events to reflect that increased utilisation is linked to worsening symptoms./uni00A0Few studies reported adverse eects (although these studies seemed to describe a few of these). Of the adverse events reported, most were clinical indicators (such as suicide rates and worsening of mental health) and health service delivery indicators (hospital re-admissions, increased use of outpatient or alternative mental healthcare services). There were no social indicators (such as measuring impact on social exclusion/integration), nor were there indirect eects on other parts of the primary health service delivery (e.g. diversion of resources leading to neglect of other aspects of care) or on carers. Such eects could impact the appropriateness and quality of care. Economic evaluation/uni00A0techniques are useful for conducting cost- eectiveness analyses of dierent interventions to inform policy. Results from this review show that, in general,/uni00A0task-shi/f_ting for the care of mental disorders and distress in LMICs could be cost- eective, particularly for child and adolescent PTSD, perinatal depression, and alcohol and drug use, for which findings were consistent. This approach may be cost-eective or cost-saving for common mental disorders and severe mental disorders, though these findings were less/uni00A0consistent/uni00A0(see details in Table 4)./uni00A0We found no data on adult PTSD or dementia. Although several studies that showed cost-eectiveness in their settings have recommended implementing the intervention in LMIC settings, the numbers of studies identified were small. However,/uni00A0these results could start to/uni00A0inform and influence policy making regarding allocation of resources at a national level.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Implications for research Although this review has identified a large number of studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a number of important research questions remain. Research recommendations have been subdivided into those for trialists, those for systematic reviewers, and those for other researchers. Trialists/uni00A0 Trialists need to: 1.describe trial interventions better, for example, in terms of training, supervision, and incentives for/uni00A0primary-level workers (PWs). This will allow systematic reviewers to identify and compare characteristics that may help to better explain the eects of/uni00A0PW/uni00A0interventions; 2.conduct trials comparing interventions with dierent characteristics/types of/uni00A0PWs,/uni00A0modes of delivery, and types of training and supervision or intensity of intervention, to enhance understanding of the eects of these variations. This is particularly applicable to collaborative care and other complex interventions for which there may be several types of specialists and/uni00A0PWs and several types of interventions on oer (such as stepped care); 3.conduct trials of dierent high-risk populations (people living with HIV, people who are victims of domestic violence, veterans, etc.), as dierent populations may respond dierently to these therapies and may have dierent outcomes of interest; 4.compare/uni00A0PWs/uni00A0versus specialists to assess the potential for task- shi/f_ting/(substitution of roles); 5.consistently/uni00A0consider whether and how to include/uni00A0adverse eects or unintended consequences of/uni00A0PWs related to safety. We noticed about/uni00A0half of trials did not report safety data. This could have aected confidence intervals around point estimates. Not all trials of health systems interventions (such as task-shi/f_ting) will explicitly collect safety data, as it is o/f_ten the case that main concerns do not reflect safety in the clinical sense but unintended adverse eects (e.g. negative changes in quality of care; fewer appropriate referrals). This/uni00A0points to the need for more trials to assess the most relevant adverse outcomes,/uni00A0whether for the patient or the service, and other adverse impact; 6.include better data on service utilisation, which are important for understanding costs and cost-eectiveness, but also for understanding (as mentioned above) the indirect consequences of an intervention for broader services provided and utilised; 7.improve the conduct of trials including more rigorous/uni00A0allocation concealment, randomisation,/uni00A0outcome/uni00A0assessment,/uni00A0and reporting;/uni00A0local validation of instruments; and agreement on standard instruments for specific outcomes and disorders to facilitate pooling and comparing of data; 8.use core outcome sets when available. This would be useful for developing core outcome sets when these are not yet available; 9.focus on clinical issues that/uni00A0have been/uni00A0poorly addressed mental disorders,/uni00A0alcohol/substance dependence,/uni00A0and child mental disorders; 10.include process evaluations alongside trials, to (1) better understand intervention fidelity and the pathways through which interventions impact outcomes; (2) assess the/uni00A0indirect/uni00A0impact of delivering mental health care (whenthis is added to existing roles and tasks) on other elements of/uni00A0PW/uni00A0health care or other roles (e.g. is it taking time away from other job roles); and (3) assess the impact on well-being of PWs (stress/burnout); and 11.consistently include economic data in their trials, as costs and cost-eectiveness are important for health planning across all mental disorders and distress; Low- to moderate-certainty clinical evidence is available for common mental disorders (CMDs), adult post-traumatic stress (PTS), and perinatal depression, but additional studies are needed to examine severe mental disorders, alcohol and drug use, dementia, child PTS, and other child mental disorders, which were not meta-analysed. Systematic reviewers/uni00A0 Further systematic reviews drawing on a range of study designs (such as reviews on processes of care,/uni00A0but also economic evaluations and qualitative work) are needed, particularly to evaluate these trials through the implementation science lens and to provide broader certainty about whether they are feasible, acceptable, eective, and sustainable in their various settings. In particular, mixed qualitative and quantitative reviews should focus on: 1.factors aecting the sustainability of/uni00A0PW/uni00A0interventions when scaled up; 2.eectiveness of dierent approaches to ensure programme sustainability, including use of dierent types of incentives and payment systems for/uni00A0PWs; 3.mechanisms for integrating LHW/uni00A0programmes into the formal health system; 4.equity impact of these programmes and factors of accessibility and acceptability; 5.fidelity and quality of these programmes; and 6.cost-eectiveness, coverage, and scalability of these programmes. Other researchers/uni00A0 Given the very broad range of/uni00A0PWs/uni00A0with considerable variation in their characteristics (e.g. training, supervision), settings, interventions, and delivery mechanisms in mental health care, there is a need to develop a comprehensive typology for/uni00A0PWs (and how they are selected, trained, and supported/supervised), as well as for the interventions they provide, which would help health planners and future researchers to develop more standardised and comparable interventions and situations.

Content of intervention: 6 to 8 same sex groups of adolescent Acholi youths per facilitator; manu- alised G-IPT based on the concept that depressive episodes are related to difficulties in 1 or more of 4 interpersonal areas: grief, interpersonal disputes, role transitions, and interpersonal deficits. The focus is on improving depressive symptoms and functioning by identifying interpersonal problems most rel- evant to the current depression and by assisting the individual in building skills to manage those prob- lems. \"The flow and organization of the IPT-G sessions was organized in three phases:/uni00A0The initial phase (corresponding roughly to sessions 1-4) focused on building rapport, setting personal treatment goals and learning to identify mood states./uni00A0The middle or working phase (corresponding roughly to sessions 5-12) involved exploring major issues related to grief, transitions, disputes and building interpersonal skills and connections among group members./uni00A0The final, closure phase (corresponding roughly to ses- sions 13-16) was dedicated to preparing for the end of the IPT-G intervention and the close of formal group meetings.

The study will take place at 16 primary care clinics (PCCs) randomly assigned to deliver either DCM or CAU (8 clinics each) to 320 patients (aged 60 years) with major depression (20/clinic; n = 160 in each treatment condition). In the DCM arm, PCPs will prescribe 16 weeks of antidepressant medica- tion according to the TG protocol.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews guilt, or depression, that they wished to address. Once a participant has identified a specific problem, a typical TFT session begins with exposure to the problem, usually by the therapist asking the partici- pant to think about the problem. While the participant is thinking about the problem and identifying feelings elicited by thinking about the problem, the participant is asked to simultaneously stimulate selected acupoints on the surface of the skin by tapping with the fingers, in a sequence that is specific to the identified emotion(s). Each TFT tapping protocol or algorithm designates the specific acupoints to be tapped, as well as the order in which they are to be tapped. These algorithms address a range of emotions such as anxiety, fear, anger, guilt, shame, depression, embarrassment, and addictive urges. Elements of PTSD, such as hyperarousal, dissociation, and defensive avoidance, are targeted by a trau- ma treatment protocol. A participant first rates the emotional intensity he or she feels when thinking about the problem, usually by giving it a 0 to 10 subjective units of distress (SUD) rating (Wolpe, 1958). The practitioner then selects the most appropriate tapping protocols for the participant's identified emotions and models the tapping sequence. The participant simultaneously taps his or her body, tap- ping on the points modelled/uni00A0by the practitioner, while keeping the memory or trigger mentally activat- ed. Then an SUD is taken and, if symptoms are lessening, another round of tapping is done after some auxiliary activities (including eye movements, bilateral stimulation, and counting). A subsequent SUD is assessed. The process is repeated following additional auxiliary activities involving other acupoints, until the rating is down to 0 or the lowest it can go for the participant in the time available. Then, what- ever other traumatic memories or triggers have arisen or remain may be addressed. Optimally, in treat- ing a trauma survivor, each major traumatic memory that triggers the individual is addressed.

Classroom training was followed by 4 weeks of practice cases (approximately 3 clients per CHW) under close supervision. CHWs were then re- quired to pass competency assessments before PM+ was offered to participants involved in the feasi- bility study.

For instance, in vivo exposure was applied to women reporting symptoms of cog- nitive worry as opposed to anxious avoidance. In vivo exposure was not used in an exploratory trial of PM+ in Peshawar, Pakistan [33]. In vivo exposure is ar- guably a more complex strategy to train non-specialist providers to deliver ef- fectively, although other research groups have managed this [34]. In this study, in vivo exposure required the CHW to identify the source of anxious avoidance, to develop a gradual exposure plan, and to accompany the client during initial steps of this plan. It is possible the specific source of avoidance was difficult for CHWs to define, and that accompanying the client was logistically prohibitive; therefore in vivo exposure was readily abandoned as a strategy to implement with clients. Consequently, the revised version of PM+ omits in vivo exposure [35]Dawson 2016 /uni00A0/uni00A0(Continued) /uni00A0 characteristics design: and carer dyads) 1.

We attempted to blind outcome evaluations by ensuring that allocation status was kept in a separate office from the outcome evaluation teams. We had also instructed the families not to divulge information on the visits by the Home Care Advisor. However, we anticipated that some unmasking would occur because both the intervention and outcome evaluations were home-based. In order to evalu- ate the masking process, researchers were asked to guess the intervention sta- tus. Another limitation in trials of this nature is that the researchers did, during the course of their outcome evaluation, correctly guess the allocation status in nearly two-thirds of individuals because of the information on health care use which typically led some care-givers to share contacts with the intervention team\"Dias 2008 /uni00A0/uni00A0(Continued) Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Intervention focuses attention on maternal psychosocial well-being, associating it with optimal growth and development of the unborn child. Main areas of the intervention were empa- thetic listening, availability of social support, ensuring the pregnant woman regarding the circle of sup- port that is available, domestic peace, balanced diet, rest, engagement of the pregnant woman in plea- surable activities, routine check-up during pregnancy, consulting doctor in case the distress is not re- lieved, and maintenance of household peace and harmony throughout. These were described as steps for the health and well-being of the pregnant woman and her unborn child. Each of these steps has a maternal well-being message for the whole family.

Nurses, doctors, and assistant doctors participated in the third course. They were trained in psychoeducation and counselling and in the 8-week yoga course. Yoga practices consisted of slow movements and breathing exercises, and providers were trained for 3 full days in teaching the content of all 8 sessions in succession.

For patients in the pre-contemplation stage, the main technique was feedback, using reflection and questioning skills to elicit self-motivational statements. If change was contemplated, the study nurse would work with the patient's ambivalence using a pros and cons technique. At the same time, an empathic counselling style and encouragement of the patient's self-efficacy were used to sup- port change in drinking behaviour. Subsequently, each participant's readiness to change drinking be- haviour was assessed if, in the determination stage, options on how to reduce drinking behaviour were provided CONTROL (n = 53) Patients without MET intervention, who were told that the trial focused on health behaviours, which in- cluded questions on smoking, exercise, eating behaviour, weight, and alcohol use (to minimise inter- vention effects on health behaviour) CO-INTERVENTIONS: none Outcomes Patients 1.

Duration/frequency: both phases carried out consecutively between April 2007 and September 2009 2. Content of intervention: LHCs provided psychoeducation: psychoeducation taught patients strate- gies to alleviate symptoms, such as breathing exercises for anxiety symptoms and scheduling activities for symptoms of depression. Encouraging adherence to treatments for these disorders and providing information about social and welfare organisations when needed were other key components of psy- choeducation. Individual (not group) IPT was also provided by the LHC as the psychological treatment of choice. Focus on interpersonal problems such as grief, disputes, and role transitions. Minimum of 6 sessions, with an optimum of 8 and a maximum of 12 sessions, was offered to each eligible participant. Interpersonal psychotherapy was reserved for patients who had moderate or severe common mental disorders, and was offered as an alternative to, or in addition to, antidepressant drugs for those who did not respond to antidepressant treatment. Physician/GP roles: prescribe antidepressants according to a protocol for moderate to severe depression (private GPs could prescribe their drug of choice, PHC doctors had to use/uni00A0fluoxetine 20 to 40 mg/d). Other key roles of physicians were to encourage patients to meet the LHC, to avoid use of unnecessary drugs, and to provide usual care for any co-existing phys- ical health problems. Referral: Referral to the clinical specialist was reserved for patients who were as- sessed as having high suicide risk at any stage, were unresponsive to earlier treatments, posed diag- nostic dilemmas, had substantial comorbidity with alcohol dependence, or had other associated sub- stantial medical problems, or for whom the PC physician requested a consultation CONTROL (n = 1269) Enhanced usual care: physicians and patients in usual care practices received screening results and were given the treatment manual prepared for PC physicians.

Facilitators were members of the local community 2. Educational background: facilitators were local graduates with bachelor's degrees without mental healthcare experience 3. Training: facilitators received 7 days of intervention training by a master trainer (KSD). Intervention training included education on adversity and its effects on mental health, basic helping skills, delivery of intervention strategies, skills in group facilitation, and facilitator self-care. To assess competency, all facilitators delivered 1 practice group each at an accelerated rate (5 sessions in 2 weeks) with partici- pants living outside the trial area and under intensive supervision (10 hours' supervision over 2 weeks), who were assessed for their competency using a specially developed checklist that evaluated basic counselling skills and their use of intervention strategies through direct observation 4. Supervision: supervision of facilitators was done through 2 hours of weekly group session by experi- enced Islamabad-based supervisors via telecommunication software (Skype Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). In turn, supervisors received 1\u00b75 hours' fortnightly supervision via Skype by the master train- er in Sydney, NSW, Australia. Supervision included review of participants' progress and individual case management, refresher training on strategies, and rehearsal of skills through role-play 5. Incentives/remuneration: facilitators received a small honorarium of USD100 per month Intervention details 1. Duration/frequency: 5 group sessions per week, with approximately 6 to 8 participants per group, each session lasting for approximately 2 hours (excluding breaks) 2. Content of intervention: first session included psychoeducation, goal-setting, and brief motivational interviewing. Sessions 1 to 4 introduced strategies for stress management, problem-solving, behaviour- al activation, and strengthening of social support. Each strategy was reviewed in every subsequent ses- sion, and the final session involved revision of learning, education on preventing relapse, and a closing ceremony. Given that many participants were non-literate, the intervention included locally relevant pictorial materials and adopted a narrative format. The groups, facilitated by local women, gave partic- ipants a safe space to share their feelings and to learn from one another's experiences, allowing a de- gree of empowerment and control over their lives as they problem-solved together CONTROL: EUC for all participants comprised feedback about assessment results, the offer of psychoe- ducation for themselves and accompanying family members, the opportunity to talk about their health with their LHW (who received a half-day training programme in psychoeducation and supportive com- munication), and information about options for seeking care for distress (i.e. through the PHC centre or the tertiary healthcare centre).

Incentives/remuneration: not specified Intervention details 1. Duration/frequency: group sessions consisted of 1 session per week for 8 weeks (maximum 20 at- tendants, with every session lasting 50 minutes). Women received medical appointments at 2 and 4 weeks, and subsequently every month for the first 6 months 2. Content of intervention (by types of health workers and per patients/carers): Doctors: proto- col: first choice of drug was fluoxetine (20 to 40 mg/d) but sertraline (50 to 100 mg/d) was also available for those who did not respond to fluoxetine or were breastfeeding. All medication was supplied free for both groups. Group leaders: psychoeducation intervention, which consisted of information about symptoms and treatments, problem-solving and simple behavioural activation, and cognitive tech- niques. All topics were presented with examples relevant to the postnatal period. Groups consisted of 1 session per week for 8 weeks (maximum 20 attendants), with every session lasting 50 minutes. Groups followed a structured format, with every session covering something different but with plenty of time for sharing experiences. There was poor attendance of these psychoeducational sessions: \"mean num- ber of multicomponent intervention group sessions attended was 2\u00b77 of eight (SD 3\u00b71), and attendance was not associated with the EPDS score\"; \"women taking medication attended slightly more sessions\". Group leaders delivered sessions but had no further contact with patients. Doctor was ultimately re- sponsible for the group. Non-professionals : designated trained, non-professional persons monitored attendance at consultations and group sessions and provided support and advice about antidepres- sant use following a structured format. If any problems were detected, patients were advised to see their doctors, and some assistance was provided to obtain medical appointments sooner if deemed es- sential CONTROL: usual care (n = 116)/uni00A0 \"Usual care included all services normally available in the clinics, including antidepressant drugs, brief psychotherapeutic interventions, medical consultations, or external referral for specialty treatment.

Participants in the peer education condition also attended 2 booster ses- sions that occurred 3 months and 6 months after study entry 2. Content of intervention: \"peer education condition was based on theory, informed by an extensive 18-month formative research phase, and built upon our previous intervention experience in Thailand and USA\". \"The peer education condition aimed to teach participants to think critically about and re- duce their methamphetamine use and sexual risk behaviours. Participants were taught communication skills that they practised in role-plays during the sessions and used to convey methamphetamine and risk reduction messages to specific social network members that were identified through a social net- work inventory administered at baseline. The first session aimed to build group cohesion and identity, through having the group establish its own 'group rules' to follow during the ensuing sessions. During this session, participants delineated how methamphetamine affected themselves, their social network, and their family. The second session focused on social influences in initiating methamphetamine use and taught participants a set of communication tools that were reinforced and used throughout the subsequent sessions in designated role plays and videos. The third and fourth sessions focused on sex- ual risk reduction, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and communication skills in sexual situations. The fi/f_th session focused on stigma and examined methamphetamine's effects on participants' families and the broader community. Because of the intervention's focus on creating a positive and construc- tive role for participants, the sixth session was dedicated to participants being involved in a community service project, which was chosen by each group. These projects lasted two to four hours and included painting or cleaning temples, garbage clean-up in villages, renovating a village playground, and weed- ing a community garden. During the seventh and final session, participants reviewed the content from the previous sessions and graduated from the project. Sessions were comprised of interactive teaching modules, instructive games, and problem-solving activities. Sessions ended with assigning peer educa- tion homework in which participants would discuss a specific issue with specific peers (MA-using and/ or sexual partners), which was reviewed at the beginning of the next session\" CONTROL (n = 440) Best practice intervention: a life skills building approach based on a skills building approach. \"It was largely derived from cognitive-behavioural psychology, which is widely used with youth in drug treat- ment and juvenile justice settings in Thailand. Juvenile justice sta were consulted throughout the development of the life skills condition. The sessions focused on the causes and consequences of methamphetamine use at the individual level, with specific attention to stress in the role of drug use. 1 session focused on STIs and sex risk behaviours. The sessions placed no emphasis on communicat- ing the session content to social network members. The first session focused on examining the role of methamphetamine in participants' lives. The second session reviewed problem-solving tools and friendships. The third session focused on the physiological effects of methamphetamine use. The fourth session addressed STIs and safer sex practices. The fi/f_th session considered stress and coping. The sixth session focused on managing emotions and self-worth. The last session reviewed the inter- vention and participants graduated\" CO-INTERVENTIONS: prevention of STIs as part of what peer educator sessions comprisedSherman 2009 /uni00A0/uni00A0(Continued) Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Content of intervention: 3-day workshop used discussion, experiential exercises aimed at foster- ing interpersonal exchange, and games to explore themes of trauma, loss, anger, trust, and the roots of violence; the Healing and Reconciling Our Communities workshop manual (African Great Lakes Ini- tiative of the Friends Peace Teams, 2006) emphasised that recovery from trauma lies in the restoration of relations between community members, and in understanding how trauma can affect these rela- tionships and individuals. The Healing and Reconciling Our Communities programme integrates the- oretical frames as described by Herman 1997 and Staub 2005. Each of Herman's 3 stages of recovery from trauma was incorporated within the Healing and Reconciling Our Communities workshop design. There was emphasis on the need for personal recovery and interpersonal reconciliation by means of \"a neighbour-to-neighbour healing process, which must include cognitive and affective engagement with experience in the context of interpersonal support\". Psychoeducational content on the first day of the workshop included a 90-minute presentation and discussion of the 17 specific symptoms of PTSD. Ori- entation to and solicitation of potential Criterion A (according to the DSM) events were also included. These ideas were reviewed again in the afternoon, and participants shared how they had been affected by the traumatic events they had experienced (1 hour additional). Coping with trauma was addressed in terms of teaching relaxation skills with substantial emphasis on repairing relationships with commu- nity members INTERVENTION 2 (n = 37) Name: 1.

Duration/frequency: standard intervention included 2 phases. 6 groups of approximately 20 partici- pants gathered for 3 days, and 1 month later, each workshop group reconvened for a full-day follow-up session, during which major workshop components were reinforced 2. Content of intervention: active workshop condition with no psychoeducation was identical to that described in intervention 1, with 2 exceptions. First, this condition did not include the introduction of PTSD psychoeducational content. Second, to ensure that both workshop conditions were of equal length, additional time was devoted to an exercise in which participants formed pairs and answered questions provided to them. Assigned topics facilitated communication around perspectives on trust, safety, sense of security, and interethnic relations in the community (e.g. \"someone I trust and why\", \"a time I overcame fear\"). It is important to note that participants were encouraged to discuss how they have been affected by events during the war, but unlike in the workshop with the psychoeducation condition, facilitators did not augment this discussion with any PTSD psychoeducational content CONTROL: wait-list control (n = 38) Received workshops after second assessment period CO-INTERVENTIONS: none Outcomes Patients 1.

Facilitators did report 3 instances (in the course of over 2500 participant-hours) in which a partici- pant proposed the concept of 'trauma' during a brainstorm about the consequences of the war.

PCPs in village clinics have on average 3 years of medical education after completing high school. They receive systematic training in the diagnosis and treatment of com- mon chronic medical illnesses; however, they receive little training in the diagnosis or treatment of mental disorders. An AW typically has a middle-school education, knows the residents well, and is well connected with the village leadership. Although the AWs have no special training in social work, they receive in-service training from the Bureau of Civil Affairs and have experience in ad- dressing the villagers' social needs. Their responsibilities for the COACH intervention include base- line and ongoing assessment of social stressors and supports, fostering social connectedness, be- havioural activation, adherence support, facilitating communications with the PCP, and education of the patient, family, and community about depression and HTN and their management. Psychi- atrists have on average 5 years of medical training after high school followed by 2 years of special- ty training. Their scope of practice includes psychiatric diagnosis and management of patients of all ages with mental illness from across the county. Their role in COACH is to provide baseline diag- nosis and initial prescription of depression treatment, and to provide ongoing consultation to the team in its algorithm-driven management of the patient's illness Control/uni00A0 Enhanced care as usual for 12 months PCPs are told when study participants screen positive for depression and are provided with copies of depression practice guidelines developed for the study Outcomes Primary outcomes 1.

Usual care is given. For the psychosocial intervention, the intensi- ty of care management is tailored according to the needs of participants (Stepped Care). The inter- vention is based on measurement-based (with the PHQ-9) care, psychoeducation, behavioural ac- tivation, relapse prevention, and use of a tablet application. Intervention lasts for 17 weeks with an option to extend to 22 weeks. The initial 3 weeks include 3 weekly meetings. In the next phase, participants can have access to either low- or high-intensity regimens, based on their PHQ-9 score. CHWs receive training prior to delivering the intervention, in 3 group sessions of 6 hours each, and are supervised by a psychologist, first weekly, then fortnightly or less frequently, depending on need during the intervention Control Enhanced usual care Research group will send to the FHUs information about participants' level of depression based on their PHQ-9 scores.

No access to telephone/mobile Interventions Intervention LTP Plus (Psychosocial intervention) LTP Plus group participants will receive intervention over the telephone for 3 months 1 session per week for 2 months and the rest of the sessions fortnightly by trained graduates, expert in delivering LTP plus intervention. LTP Plus comprises 2 components: learning through play (LTP) and interper- sonal psychotherapy (IPT). LTP Plus is a low-literacy, sustainable programme intended to provide parents with information on the healthy growth and development of their young children. LTP re- search-based activities enhance children's development while simultaneously promoting attach- ment security by building parents' ability to read and being sensitive to their children's cues and through active involvement in their children's development. The interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) intervention comprises a supportive element, an educational element, a parenting element, and an interpersonal relationship element. Intervention goals include helping mothers feel supported, empowered, and confident about their parenting abilities, which would directly influence reduc- tion in depressive symptoms as well as resolution of interpersonal conflicts Control /uni00A0 Treatment as usual (TAU) TAU group will receive routine care and follow-up will be done after completion of the intervention, then at 6 months post randomisation Outcomes Primary outcome measures Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to check severity of depressionNCT03430622 2019/uni00A0 Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

This intervention is based on WHO treatment guidelines for conditions related to stress (WHO, 2013). It is a 5-session interven- tion that is delivered by trained non-specialists and is available in individual and group delivery for- mats for both children and adults. PM+ includes evidence-based techniques such as problem-solv- ing, stress management, behavioural activation, and access to social support. It was proved effec- tive by 2 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in Kenya and Pakistan (Bryant, Dawson, Schafer, Si- jbrandij, & van Ommeren, 2016; Rahman, Hamdani, Awan, Bryant, Dawson, Khan, Mukhtar-ul-Haq Azeemi, et al, 2016). Participants in the experimental arm will receive Group PM+ by trained, non- specialist peer refugees in addition to E-CAU Control Enhanced care as usual (E-CAU) only 190 participants will be randomly assigned to E-CAU group. CAU ranges from the free health ser- vices government provides to Refugee and Asylum Seekers Assistance and Solidarity Association's (RASASA) mental health services, which are provided by the Psychological Support Unit (MHPSS Support Unit), which includes counselling as well. The enhanced care arm (CAU, with the addition of a leaflet that will include information on the services they can get from RASASA and other pub- lic services) is to be used as a benchmark for measuring the effectiveness of STRENGTHS's interven- tion, which is Problem Management Plus (PM+) Outcomes Primary outcome measures 1.

Sub-scales can be calculated for de- pression (13 items) and anxiety symptoms (10 items). Two items are related to somatic symptoms. The items are rated on a 1 to 4-point Likert scale, with a well-validated cutoff score of 1.75. The cur- rent study will primarily look at the total score at which lower values represent a better outcome. Furthermore, aim is to examine changes in case-ness in depression; a cutoff score for the depres- sion subscale of 2.1 will be used Secondary outcome measures 1. PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) [Time/uni00A0Frame:/uni00A0Change from baseline assessment, at 1 week post-intervention assessment (6 weeks after baseline), change from post-assessment at 3 months post-intervention assessment (4 to 4.5 months after baseline), and change at 12 months post inter- vention assessment] 2.

The aim is to assess the change in self-identified problems. PSYCHLOPS consists of 4 questions. It contains 3 domains: 2 questions on problems, 1 question on function, and 1 question on well- being. Participants are asked to give free text responses to the problem and function domains. Re- sponses are scored on a 0 to 5 scale, producing a maximum score of 20 (6 points per domain).

Atten- dance at sessions will be monitored via session attendance records. Adherence to strategies will be monitored by checklists of strategies employed. The study for any participant will conclude after immediate post-trial follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 1.5 months Outcomes Primary outcome Level of psychological distress as measured with the GHQ-12 at 3-month follow-up (i.e. 3 months after the fi/f_th PM+ session) Secondary outcomes 1. General functioning as measured with the WHODAS 2. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms will be measured using the PCL-5, which is a 20- item checklist corresponding with the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Items are rated on a 0 to 4 scale and add up to a total severity score of 80. The PCL-5 will be adapted to ask for symptoms in the last week (rather than month) to enhance sensitivity to change. PSYCHLOPS will be administered at all assessments and at the beginning of each PM+ session to assess progress on problems for which the person seeks help. It consists of 4 questions that en- compass 3 domains: problems (2 questions), functioning (1 question), and well-being (1 question). Participants are asked to give free text responses to the problem and function domains. Respons- es are scored on an ordinal 6-point scale, producing a maximum score of 20 (5 points per question). The PSYCHLOPs version administered at post-treatment and at follow-up also includes an overall valuation question (determining self-rated outcome ranging from \"much better\" to \"much worse\"). PSYCHLOPS has been validated in primary care populations across several countries Other measures 1. Previous stressor exposure will be assessed using the LEC. This is a widely used list of 17 experi- enced or witnessed events, such as rape, serious injury, combat exposure, or the sudden death of a loved one. A Kiswahili version of this list is available. At post-test, question phrasing will be adapted to capture life events that have occurred since the trial commenced Five key questions of the Swahili version of the WHOVAW as developed for use in the WHO Mul- ti-Country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence are administered. Indicators of economic impact will be assessed using the WHODAS question on days out of role and by selected SRI questions on healthcare service use Process evaluation 1. Feasibility and difficulties and successes in carrying out research and intervention activities will be explored through semi-structured interviews with 20 key informants, including 5 CHWs 2. The burden of completing assessments and PM+ on the time and effort of participants, satisfac- tion with the intervention, and barriers and facilitators to adherence will be explored through se- mi-structured interviews with a sample of 5 participants (including participants that have dropped out) 3. In addition, 5 decision-makers with responsibilities for developing or implementing health poli- cy, including heads of relevant clinics, and 5 PHC sta (clinical officers/nurses) will be interviewed to obtain their perceptions of the benefits and challenges of integrating PM+ into the CHW routine services provision Starting date 15/4/2015 Contact information r.bryant@unsw.edu.auSijbrandij 2016/uni00A0/uni00A0(Continued) Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews We decided not to include interventions delivered by people who were not within the medical para- digm (such as faith healers or yoga masters) Community professionals (CPs)/uni00A0Professional people who were involved as community-level workers but were not within the health sector, as many people, particularly adolescents and young adults, have low contact with health workers. This category included, for example, teachers/trainers/support workers from schools and colleges, social workers, community development workers/managers, etc. These CPs have an im- portant role, particularly in promotion of mental health and detection of mental disorders (Patel 2007; Patel 2008a ; WHO 2003 ) /uni00A0 Generalist social workers often linked to or overlapped with roles performed within the health sec- tor in that they have a well-defined and expected extended mental health support role towards pa- tients, all social support. In certain comparisons in this review, they are therefore often combined with nurses, although occasionally they are combined with teachers/uni00A0 /uni00A0 We excluded certain health workers whom we classified as specialists, including those who were not traditionally thought of as specialists by the psychiatry/medical system: for example, when school counsellors were trained to exclusively do that and had a qualification, with or without extra experience, and when their sole focus was on child psychology/counselling. In this review, many of the school counsellors may not have been that highly trained and therefore were included (Lewin 2010; Patel 2007 ; Patel 2008a ; WHO 2003 ) First-level care, primary care, and communityFirst level of contact with formal health services including community-based interventions or/uni00A0pri- mary care interventions (or both), on their own or attached to hospital settings, provided they had no specialist input apart from supervision (modified from/uni00A0Wiley-Exley 2007 ). This would include in- dividuals with mental illness living in the community and programmes in outpatient clinics or pri- mary care practices. This would not include programmes in hospitals unless these programmes were providing care to outpatients (i.e. generalists in outpatient departments). Community: as mentioned above, detection of mental disorders in all age groups was often done outside the health facility, for example, through school, training, and other community settings Therefore, we considered interventions outside the health sector Lay health workers (LHWs) /uni00A0As per the/uni00A0Lewin 2010/uni00A0review, lay health workers (LHWs) perform diverse functions related to healthcare delivery. Although LHWs are usually provided with job-related training, they have no formal professional or paraprofessional tertiary education and can be involved in either paid or voluntary care. The term LHW is thus necessarily broad in scope and includes, for example, com- munity health workers, village health workers, treatment supporters, and birth attendants. As LH- Ws are diverse and can be linked to a health setting or to a community organisation, we have cate- gorised these together in comparisons as LHWs. They have broadly similar backgrounds (from local communities with little if any professional background) and minimal training We excluded from this review studies that looked at informal care provided by family members or extended members only to members of their own family (i.e. who were unavailable to other mem- bers of the community). This would have excluded certain peer-led interventions./uni00A0As previously highlighted in Lewin's Cochrane Review, \"these qualitatively different from other LHW [lay health worker] interventions included in this review given that parents or spouses have an established close relationship with those receiving care which could affect the process and effects of the intervention\" ( Lewin 2010)./uni00A0We also excluded all healthcare providers within non-biomed- ical systems (e.g. a yoga master), as we had not searched for these specifically and it was difficult to judge, from our perspective, what constituted for them a mental health intervention Low- and middle-income country (LMIC)Any/uni00A0country/uni00A0that/uni00A0has/uni00A0ever/uni00A0been/uni00A0an/uni00A0LMIC,/uni00A0as/uni00A0defined/uni00A0by/uni00A0the/uni00A0World/uni00A0Bank lists of LMICs/uni00A0 Mental condition/uni00A0 Term used to encompass mental disorders, mental distress, sub-syndromal mental illnesses, and chronic and relapsing conditions/uni00A0Table 1. /uni00A0 Definitions/uni00A0/uni00A0(Continued) Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Lay health worker-led psychological interventions versus usual care in treating common mental disorders Settings Ten studies were identified from nine countries across/uni00A0Africa (Abas/uni00A02018; Bolton 2003; Chibanda/uni00A02016; Petersen 2014), Patel 2017), and/uni00A0South America (Matsuzaka 2017). Interventions were delivered in Patel 2017 Petersen 2014), rural settings (Bolton 2003), and both (Murphy 2020 ). Participants Six trials included adult males and females aged 18 years (Abas/uni00A02018; Bolton 2003; Matsuzaka 2017; Murphy 2020 ; Patel 2017; Petersen 2014), one trial included only females aged 18 to 50 years (Ali 2003), and two trials included elderly adult males and females aged > 60 years (Chibanda/uni00A02016; Jiang/uni00A02017 ). Two studies were conducted on patients receiving HIV antiretroviral therapy (Abas/uni00A02018; Petersen 2014). Six trials provided descriptions of participants' socioeconomic status. In three studies, participants were from very low-income households with high rates of unemployment (Bolton 2003; Patel 2017; Petersen 2014), one study took place in a lower-middle class setting (Ali 2003), and in one study the average household income was US$690/month (Matsuzaka 2017). Participants were recruited from primary care facilities in six trials (Abas/uni00A02018; Chibanda/uni00A02016; Matsuzaka 2017; Murphy 2020 ; Patel 2017; Petersen 2014), one trial recruited using random household screening (Ali 2003), and one trial used local village leaders to help identify potentially at-risk individuals for screening (Bolton 2003). Eight trials included participants with at least mild CMD symptoms using locally developed or locally adapted screening instruments including the PHQ-9 ( Abas/uni00A02018), the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (Abas/uni00A02018; Chibanda/uni00A02016), the Aga Khan Anxiety and Depression Scale (Ali 2003), the WHO Self-Reporting Questionnaire (Murphy 2020 ; Petersen 2014), the Zung Scale (Matsuzaka 2017), and Hopkins Symptom Checklist (Bolton 2003). Of these, two trials further evaluated participants using a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV disorders (Petersen 2014), or the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Matsuzaka 2017), and included only those with a confirmed major depressive disorder. One trial included only participants with severe depressive symptoms identified by PHQ-9 scores 15 (Patel 2017). Two studies used online interventions with no face-to-face delivery of psychological interventions (Arjadi/uni00A02018 ; Jiang/uni00A02017 ). Outcomes for these studies have not been pooled with those of other studies for meta-analysis and are reported narratively only. Interventions Training and supervision of LHWs A large variety of backgrounds and training were provided for lay health workers delivering the intervention. Two trials used existing HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence counsellors from local primary health clinics to deliver the intervention. In Abas/uni00A02018, ART adherence counsellors (primary care counsellors or nurse aides with at least secondary school education) were trained over 2.5 days by the research team to deliver the intervention; therea/f_ter LHWs met weekly with a local psychologist to discuss their caseload. In Petersen 2014, lay HIV counsellors were provided with 4 days of training by a clinical psychologist, and psychology trainees and lay counsellors had weekly then monthly supervision meetings with psychology trainees.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. on behalf of The Cochrane Collaboration.626Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Four other trials used existing lay workers from local primary health centres to deliver psychological interventions. In Chibanda/uni00A02016, non- health professional employees of the local primary health centre with a minimum of 10 years of schooling were provided with nine days of training on intervention delivery by the research team, supported by an intervention manual. Subsequent supervision and support were provided by a clinical psychologist and other research team members, who could be contacted as needed by mobile phone. In Matsuzaka 2017, community health workers working in the local primary health centre were provided with three days of group-based training by the research team, and subsequently attended group-based monthly supervision meetings. Support was available as needed by telephone, text, or email. In Murphy 2020 , lay social workers with pre-existing community involvement (e.g. as village care workers, as NGO volunteers) were provided with three days of training in study logistics and intervention delivery. Each lay worker received two visits from the research team to observe delivery of the intervention, to provide support and assess fidelity. One trial collaborated with an NGO to identify and train lay health workers. In Bolton 2003, local gender-matched non-clinician World Vision employees were fluent in English and Luganda and had completed high school level education. LHWs received two weeks of intensive treatment by faculty members of the New York Psychiatric Institute assisted by a trained psychologist and an experienced group therapist employed by World Vision. Subsequent supervision was provided by World Vision mental health professionals. Three trials recruited and trained community volunteers to deliver psychological interventions. In Ali 2003, female volunteers belonging to the local community could read and write Urdu. Each LHW received 11 three-hour training sessions held over four weeks led by a family practitioner, a sociologist, a psychiatrist, or a clinical psychologist. The lay counsellors had access to the training team for support when needed. In Patel 2017, lay counsellors were recruited through advertisements in newspapers and a local television channel. They needed to have a minimum of 10 years of schooling and no prior mental health training. Each underwent a three-week training workshop focused on general counselling skills and manualised treatments followed by a six-month internship. Knowledge was assessed via an exam and performance on role-plays using vignettes. Support was provided through weekly peer-led small group meetings. Description of interventions There was wide variation in the range and intensity of psychological interventions delivered by LHWs. Three trials used interpersonal counselling (Bolton 2003; Matsuzaka 2017; Petersen 2014), and three trials used problem-solving therapy (Abas/uni00A02018; Ali 2003; Chibanda 2016). One trial used a manualised/uni00A0psychological treatment based on/uni00A0behavioural/uni00A0activation (Patel 2017), and one trial used bibliotherapy to deliver CBT with support by the LHW (Murphy 2020 ). The number of intervention sessions ranged from three/uni00A0to four/uni00A0sessions in Matsuzaka 2017 to 16 sessions in Bolton 2003, with most ranging between six/uni00A0and eight/uni00A0counselling therapy sessions (Abas/uni00A02018; Ali 2003; Chibanda/uni00A02016; Murphy 2020 ; Patel 2017; Petersen 2014). Two interventions were group-based (Bolton 2003; Petersen 2014), and one intervention consisted of six/uni00A0individual counselling sessions, followed by six/uni00A0group-based peer support sessions (Chibanda/uni00A02016). In one trial, the intervention was delivered at the participant's home (Murphy 2020 ). In the others, the intervention was delivered at a community or primary health centre. Comparators In seven trials, the comparison group was provided with 'usual/uni00A0care' relevant to the setting in which participants were recruited. This included routine HIV care and ART adherence counselling (Abas/uni00A02018; Petersen 2014), treatment by local traditional healers (Bolton 2003), nurse-led evaluation with psychoeducation and antidepressants if necessary (Chibanda/uni00A02016), and regular medical care delivered by primary care providers (Murphy 2020 ; Patel 2017). In one trial, 'usual care' was essentially no or minimal care due to poor access to health care (Ali 2003). In another trial, the comparison group received case management by research psychologists funded through the study but who had not been trained to deliver interpersonal counselling (Matsuzaka 2017). Appendix 4. Study descriptions (Comparison 2). Primary-level worker-led collaborative care versus usual care in treating common mental disorders in adults Settings We identified 13 studies from seven countries in/uni00A0Africa/uni00A0(Adewuya/uni00A02019; Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE); Jenkins 2013 Niemi 2016 ; Patel and/uni00A0in both/uni00A0(Adewuya/uni00A02019; Jenkins 2013 ; Oladeji 2015 ; Patel 2010). Participants 11 trials included adults aged 16 or/uni00A0 18 Niemi 2016 ; Oladeji 2015 ; Patel 2010 ;/uni00A0Pradeep 2014 ). Two studies/uni00A0examined only elderly depression in participants aged 60 to 65 years (Chen 2015 ; Xie 2019). Three studies were conducted in very low socioeconomic status settings including economically deprived women from urban Santiago (Araya 2003), Kenyan primary care patients with high levels of food insecurity (Jenkins 2013), and Indian women from Bangalore villages (Pradeep 2014). Four studies included only females with depression (Araya 2003; Fritsch 2007; Indu 2018 ; Pradeep 2014). All studies included patients with depressive symptoms identified using screening instruments including PHQ-9 (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Chen 2015 ; 2007; Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Seven trials further evaluated participants to confirm the presence a major depressive disorder using a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM- IV disorders (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Chen 2015 ), the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE); Oladeji 2015 ), the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Indu 2018 ,/uni00A0Pradeep 2014), or the Clinical Interview Schedule Revised ICD-10 (Patel 2010). All studies included patients with depression. Two studies/uni00A0also included patients with other common mental disorders (Jenkins 2013 ; Patel 2010). Interventions Types of PWs These collaborative care models involved multi-disciplinary teams consisting of existing PHC sta, including private and government PHC doctors Niemi 2016 ; Oladeji 2015 ; Patel 2010 ;/uni00A0Pradeep 2014), non-medical professional primary care or community/uni00A0sta (nurses, social workers, other professional/uni00A0community health workers) (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Araya 2003; Chen 2015 ; 2013 ; Jordans 2015 ; Niemi 2007; Jordans 2019; Patel 2010) with access to referral to specialist care for complex cases. Training and supervision of PWs Training of PWs was described in 12 studies. Training duration and intensity varied from 3 to 12 hours (Chen 2015 ; Fritsch 2007; Araya 2013 ; Niemi 2016 ; Oladeji 2015 ; Pradeep 2014), to two months (Patel 2010), to six months (Jordans 2019). Training for doctors was typically a half- or full-day session focused primarily on diagnosis and guideline-driven use of antidepressants, o/f_ten supplemented with a manual manual (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE); Oladeji 2015 ). Most studies that reported the content of the training had a mixture of didactic and practical training. In/uni00A0Niemi 2016 , in addition to being trained to assess and manage depression, doctors, nurses, and assistant doctors were trained to teach a slow movement and breathing yoga course. Training for nurses, social workers, and lay health workers was directed primarily at psychoeducation and structured psychological interventions. Ongoing supervision of PWs was described in 11 trials (Adewuya/uni00A02019; ; Indu 2018 ; Oladeji 2015 ; Patel 2010). Supervision ranged from minimal or ad hoc supervision in Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE); Indu 2018 ;/uni00A0and Jenkins 2013 to regular monthly visits in Adewuya/uni00A02019; Chen 2015 ; Patel 2010;/uni00A0and Fritsch 2007 and intensive mentoring in Jordans 2019. Supervision was provided by specialists (psychiatrist/psychologist) or by the research team (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Chen 2015 ; 2007; Jordans 2019; Niemi 2016 ; Patel 2010; Pradeep 2014), or by a local senior non-mental health specialist physician (Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE); Indu 2018 ; Oladeji 2015 ; Patel 2010). In three/uni00A0trials, access to supervision was attained primarily by mobile phone (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE); Oladeji 2015 ). Description of interventions All collaborative care interventions involved multi-disciplinary teams with complex multi-component interventions. Six trials used a stepped care approach (Araya 2003; Adewuya/uni00A02019; Chen 2015 ; Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE); Oladeji 2015 ; Patel 2010). A four-step process was used with regular monitoring and increasing intensity of interventions provided for participants with more severe symptoms or for those who did not respond adequately to initial treatment. Stepped care interventions included an intake assessment to assess symptom severity. All patients received psychoeducation (step 1). Participants with mild to moderate symptoms were oered a limited series (four to six sessions) of structured psychological counselling (step 2). For participants with moderate to moderately severe symptoms, or who did not respond to initial psychological interventions, treatments were intensified with the addition of an antidepressant by the doctor or with additional sessions of counselling, or with both (step 3). Participants with very severe symptoms or who were at risk of suicide were referred for specialist care (step 4). Seven trials used an integrated collaborative care approach (Fritsch 2007; Indu 2018 ; Jordans 2019; Niemi 2016 ; Pradeep 2014; Xie 2019), whereby doctors diagnosed patients, provided medical treatment, and provided follow-up/referral as per the existing government health delivery model, and non-medical clinic sta (nurses, social workers, community health workers, or lay workers) provided adjunctive psychological treatment or other supportive services such as adherence counselling or monitoring. Seven trials involved a combination of structured psychological interventions and pharmacotherapy (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Araya 2003; Gureje/uni00A02019 (STEPCARE); ; Patel 2010 ; Pradeep 2014). Three trials did not include any pharmacotherapy component (Jordans 2019; Niemi 2016 ; Xie 2019). Three trials did not include any structured psychological interventions (Chen 2015 ; Fritsch 2007; Jenkins 2013 ). All trials 2010; Xie 2019), interpersonal therapy (Patel 2010), telephone monitoring and adherence counselling (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Chen 2015 ), home visits (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Indu 2018 ), and yoga (Niemi 2016 ; Patel 2010). The intensity of structured psychological interventions ranged from 6 to 12 weekly sessions (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Oladeji 2015 ; Patel 2010), with more sessions oered to those with more severe Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Antidepressant regimens (when used) were dictated by local availability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. Comparators Comparison groups were in the same PHC settings in which PWs did not receive additional training ('usual care') (Fritsch 2007;/uni00A0Gureje 2019; Niemi 2016 ; Pradeep 2014; Xie 2019), or where PWs were provided with a manual or guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of depression ('enhance usual care') (Adewuya/uni00A02019; Araya 2003; Chen 2015 ; Oladeji 2015 ; Patel 2010). In one trial, the comparison group also received psychoeducation provided by a lay health worker (Adewuya/uni00A02019). Appendix 5. Study descriptions (Comparison 3)./uni00A0Lay health worker-led psychosocial interventions versus usual care in treating perinatal depression/uni00A0 Settings We identified seven studies in five countries across Africa (Chibanda 2014; Lund 2020; Peltzer 2019), the Middle South Asia (Fuhr 2019; Rahman 2008; Sikander 2019). These studies were conducted in urban settings ((Chibanda 2014; Lund 2020; Milani 2015), in rural settings in Pakistan (Peltzer 2019; Rahman 2008 Sikander 2019), and in urban and rural settings (Fuhr 2019)./uni00A0An eighth/uni00A0study,/uni00A0Khan 2017/uni00A0(which has described/uni00A0along side/uni00A0findings here) was/uni00A0performed in Pakistan./uni00A0 Participants Women the age of 16 were recruited antenatally (Fuhr 2019; Lund Rahman 2008, Sikander 2019, and Milani/uni00A02015 ,/uni00A0which were recruited from the community./uni00A0Peltzer 2019 recruited women who had HIV./uni00A0Participants were/uni00A0generally from/uni00A0lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Interventions LHWs Lay health workers were selected from peers/similar communities as participants (Fuhr 2019 Khan 2017 ; Milani/uni00A02015 Sikander 2019), existing grassroot/NGO workers (Peltzer 2019; Rahman 2008)./uni00A0 LHW training varied from Fuhr 2019 (25- to 40-hour classroom teaching/uni00A0+ 2-month/uni00A0clinical/uni00A0internship + assessment) to quite minimal 2-day training (Chibanda 2014). Other studies had intermediate length of training (Lund 2020,/uni00A0Peltzer 2019 - 5 days; Rahman 2008, Sikander 2019 - 2 days/uni00A0initial/uni00A0training + 1 or more days refresher training). Supervision varied from weekly supervision (individual/uni00A0- Chibanda 2014; group/uni00A0- Lund 2020), to/uni00A0fortnightly/uni00A0group supervision regular supervision (Rahman 2008; Sikander 2019). Milani/uni00A02015 did not specify the duration of training nor supervision, although both were present. Description of interventions Interventions were delivered/uni00A0at home (using telephone in Milani/uni00A02015 , or face-to-face in Sikander 2019 and Rahman 2008), at home or in the/uni00A0antenatal/uni00A0clinic (according to participant choice) (Lund 2020), at community centres (Fuhr 2019 Peltzer 2019), or in primary care clinics (Chibanda 2014).

Appendix 14. Study descriptions (Comparison 13)./uni00A0Primary health professional- and lay health worker-led psychosocial interventions versus usual care in improving dementia patients' and carers' outcomes Setting We found two studies that were conducted in urban areas in India - Dias 2008 - and in Russia - Gavrilova 2009. Participants Interventions were directed at carers of people with dementia. Carers were generally aged between 50 and 60 years and had varying economic backgrounds. Interventions PHPs and LHWs Dias 2008 used two types of LHWs (home care advisors and lay counsellors) trained intensively for one week, whereas Gavrilova 2009 used newly qualified doctors trained for two days, to deliver the intervention. LHWs were supervised every two weeks by a specialist. The supervision provided to doctors was not described. Description of interventions In both studies, brief carer interventions were conducted, based on a larger 10/66 dementia initiative (Prince 2004). However, Gavrilova 2009 organised a short training package for carers only, and supervision/psychiatric involvement was not specified, whereas Dias 2008 implemented a collaborative care package (LHWs undertook psychoeducation and counselling,/uni00A0facilitated group support meetings, and Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Participants Children with PTSD diagnoses - Dawson 2016 ; Ertl 2011; Jordans 2010; Murray 2015; Tol 2008; Tol 2012 - with PTS - Bolton 2007 - or with both - O'Callaghan 2014 - were included. Other than Ertl 2011/uni00A0and Murray 2015, children were also screened/uni00A0for/uni00A0depressive/uni00A0and anxiety symptoms, or for behavioural problems. The ages of children varied from broader age categories: from 5 (or 7) to/uni00A018/uni00A0 years (Murray 2015; O'Callaghan 2014 ), to narrower primary school or secondary school age (Bolton 2007 (14 to 18 years); Jordans 2010 (11 to 14 years);/uni00A0Tol 2008; Tol 2012/uni00A0(8 to 13 years))./uni00A0One study included child soldiers aged 12 to 25 years (Ertl 2011). Most children came from low-resource backgrounds. Interventions PWs LHWs (of both sexes) were people selected by the community who received manual-based training for their respective interventions (Bolton 2007; Ertl 2011; Jordans 2010; Tol 2008; Tol 2012), or via apprenticeship/uni00A0on-site training (Murray 2015), with training duration of about 2 weeks (Bolton 2007; Jordans 2010; Murray 2015; Tol 2008; Tol 2012). Supervision varied from regular weekly in Bolton 2007; Jordans 2010; Tol 2008; Tol 2012; and Murray 2015 to intensive (e.g. case discussions of treatment sessions and of notes) in Ertl 2011. Description of interventions Most interventions were delivered to groups in schools, except one in community groups (Bolton 2007), and two at home (Ertl 2011, Murray 2015). All interventions were psychological or psychosocial interventions targeted at children. They had dierent focuses of therapy:/uni00A0psychoeducational (Ertl 2011 arm 2 O'Callaghan 2014 ); therapy-based such as trauma-focused CBT in Murray 2015 and narrative exposure therapy in Ertl 2011/uni00A0(arm 1); group interpersonal therapy in Bolton 2007 (arm 1); or a combination. Jordans 2010, Tol 2008, and Tol 2012 had the same manual-based, classroom-based intervention (CBI) (creative-expressive therapy, co-operative play, and CBT)./uni00A0Interventions were mainly delivered in groups except for Ertl 2011 (individual therapy), and in child-carer dyads/uni00A0for Murray 2015,/uni00A0over 8 to 15 sessions, weekly or thrice weekly (Ertl 2011 Jordans 2010; O'Callaghan 2014 Tol 2008 Tol 2012), spread over three weeks in O'Callaghan 2014 to four months in Bolton 2007./uni00A0/uni00A0 Comparators This was overall eclectic, although most studies had/uni00A0no care (or existing care was o/f_ten poorly available) and wait-list control (Bolton 2007 Jordans 2010 O'Callaghan 2014 /uni00A0Tol 2008 Tol 2012).

Most children were from the general population, although in Betancourt/uni00A02014, most children had been child soldiers. The ages of children included pre-school children (5 to 6-year-olds and their mothers - Dybdahl 2001 ); those under/uni00A014 years/uni00A0old (6 to 14 years; Berger 2009; Barron 2013; O'Callaghan 2013 ); and those 12 to 17 years and over/uni00A024 years/uni00A0old (14 to 17 - O'Callaghan 2015 ; 14 to 18 - Gordon 2008; 15 to 24 - Betancourt/uni00A02014).

Supervision was weekly (Berger 2009; Dybdahl 2001 , Betancourt/uni00A02014), or it was provided regularly (Gordon 2008), by mental health professionals. Less intensive supervision was delivered in Barron 2016 (in pairs or groups monthly)./uni00A0 Description of interventions All interventions were targeted at children, except in/uni00A0Dybdahl 2001 , where the target group was mothers, and/uni00A0in O'Callaghan 2013 , which had an additional three sessions aimed at carers. Interventions were delivered to groups in schools except in two for community groups (Betancourt/uni00A02014; Dybdahl 2001 ), one for individuals (Barron 2013), and two that combined individual and group sessions (O'Callaghan 2013; O'Callaghan 2015 ). Interventions were psychological/uni00A0therapeutic interventions (Teaching Recovery Techniques/trauma recovery + CBT - Barron 2013; Barron 2016), mind-body techniques (Gordon 2008), therapeutic group discussions/coping skills (Dybdahl 2001 ), or a combination of psychoeducation and psychological and social interventions (Berger 2009; Betancourt/uni00A02014; O'Callaghan 2013 ; O'Callaghan 2015 ). Group interventions varied from five sessions (Dybdahl 2001 ; Barron 2013; Barron 2016), to nine/uni00A0sessions (O'Callaghan 2013 ; O'Callaghan 2015), to 12 sessions (Berger 2009; Betancourt/uni00A02014; Gordon 2008), to 20 sessions delivered weekly for most studies (except for Gordon 2008 - twice weekly for 6 weeks; and a/uni00A05-day/uni00A0workshop - Dybdahl 2001 ). Most interventions were manualised. Comparators No accessible care was described for most studies, and most included wait-list controls (Barron 2013; Barron 2016; Berger 2009; Betancourt/uni00A02014; O'Callaghan 2013 ; O'Callaghan 2015 ), although the latter mentions that control group teachers received training for the intervention at baseline but were asked to implement it only one year later (risk of/uni00A0spillover/uni00A0eect). Only/uni00A0Dybdahl 2001 mentions available usual care (i.e. medical physical care provided by local physicians). Appendix 17. Other economic studies of relevance but not included (from 2013 review and not updated) Thirteen economic studies did not meet our inclusion criteria, as they did not relate to one of the included studies. Their findings are presented and compared with those included in this review to enhance the usefulness and applicability of the Cochrane Review for healthcare decision-making. The economic questions addressed in excluded studies mainly fall into three broad categories in terms of cost analysis of specific disease conditions, carer and family burden, and comparison of improved or integrated mental health care with primary care with usual or no care. Studies that looked at healthcare costs cannot be compared with included studies, as they were from dierent settings, conditions, and outcomes. Health services costs Chisolm 2000 /uni00A0dealt with integration of mental health services into primary health care in India and Pakistan and found that a significant category of healthcare costs consisted of consultations with GPs. In/uni00A0Luengo-Fernandez 2011, primary care was costed in European middle- income countries as constituting 36% (Portugal) and 9% (Greece) of total healthcare costs. There is no costing specific to NSHWs. One review showed that collaborative care costs are no greater than costs of usual care (Woltmann 2012 ). A community outreach intervention in rural India for untreated schizophrenia study found that the costs of informal care sector visits and family caregiving costs were considerably reduced during the follow-up period from US$10 to about US$2 (Murthy 2005 ). This study gives detailed costs of outreach clinic setup, unit costs per person accessing services, and outcome data at intervention baseline and follow-up to 18 months. It shows that costs of services increase over time (the increase in costs is for specialist outreach services - not for PHC services), and that overall costs remain stable (around US$34). This study also emphasises the need for early diagnosis, and availability of services close to aected populations helps in increased uptake of services and reduces associated costs. The most promising study on service changes and costs is from South Africa, where Petersen 2012/uni00A0estimated that the costs of a primary healthcare staing package (one post for a mental Primary-level worker interventions for the care of people living with mental disorders and distress in low- and middle-income countries (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews health counsellor or equivalent, and 7.2 community mental health worker posts) would be oset by a reduction in the number of other specialist and non-specialist health personnel required to close service gaps at a primary care level. The cost of these personnel amounts to GBP28,457 per 100,000 population. Costs of specific interventions Suh 2006 /uni00A0in a study on economic costs of dementia in Korea found that costs of care for dementia patients needing full-time care in community (US$44,121) were about 10 times higher than for those who did not need long-term care (US$3986), and that costs of informal care were very high, but it is unclear what costs related to NSHWs were. Another study dealt with societal costs of dementia (mainly informal costs) in both developed countries and LMICs but does not explicitly state the costs of an NSHW-delivered service (Wimo 2007 ). The costs of providing epilepsy care through primary care in Zambia is estimated at under US$25 a day (Birbeck 2012 ). Informal care costs The high level of burden among family carers was also highlighted in other studies (Chisolm 2000 ; Murthy 2005 ; Papastavrou 2010; van Steenbergen-Weijenburg 2010; Woltmann 2012 ), and this was significantly related to the severity and frequency of patient symptoms, patient gender, and educational level of the carer. Resource requirement analysis and resource use Some studies have described the status of resource use. Chisolm 2000 /uni00A0showed a low level of service utilisation in government centres. Others attempt to calculate resource requirements. Scaling-up specific interventions such as child and adolescent mental health services in their country context was done by modelling (Lund 2009), for dierent levels of coverage in South Africa. The model suggests most costs should be spent at a primary care level, with a range of NSHWs (occupational therapists, social workers, general nurses) and specialists (psychiatric nurses). However, this forecasted ideal situation is currently unrealistic due to budgetary constraints. Siskind 2010 estimated the cost-eectiveness of usual care compared with improved primary care for depression in Chile using a computer-based Markov cohort model. They found the incremental cost-eectiveness ratio (ICER) of usual care CLP113 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus no treatment, whereas stepped care had an ICER of CLP468 per QALY versus usual care. A sensitivity analysis was performed, and the results were sensitive to assumptions made about recurrent episode coverage and cost of treatment, and were insensitive to changes in health state utility of depression and rate of recurrence. We found one cost-eectiveness study on a mental health intervention package in Nigeria (Gureje 2007), which estimated costs per DALYs averted for schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, and alcohol use. The most cost-eective intervention for schizophrenia was 70% coverage of antipsychotic drugs with psychosocial treatment or case management, with cost per DALY US$642 and US$680, respectively. Cost per DALY averted for depression was lowest for older antidepressant drugs, with psychotherapy at US$767. Similarly, for epilepsy, older antiepileptic drugs in primary care implemented at 80% coverage oered the best cost per DALY at US$100 per DALY averted. Random roadside breath-testing for alcohol had a cost per DALY averted at US$85 (Gureje 2007). A systematic review that included two cost- eectiveness studies in LMICs for costs of collaborative care showed these to be cost-eective (van Steenbergen-Weijenburg 2010).

This provides an explanation that mental ill health is on a continuum from at-risk, to distress, to sub-syndromal/uni00A0symptoms, to actual classifiable disorders./uni00A0 However it is clear from the literature that interventions still/uni00A0fall/uni00A0broadly/uni00A0into/uni00A0two categories: those/uni00A0focused/uni00A0on prevention/uni00A0and mental health promotions,/uni00A0and those/uni00A0aiming to address/uni00A0various of psychological distress and diagnostic (and transdiagnostic)/uni00A0categories./uni00A0 This Cochrane Review Update on/uni00A0treatment/uni00A0interventions for mental disorders is therefore being re-framed to include the spectrum of mental ill health as broader than just diagnostic categories (this was already/uni00A0partly/uni00A0included in the previous version of the review/uni00A0but was not/uni00A0made/uni00A0explicit)./uni00A0The prevention/promotion review features in a separate protocol (Purgato 2021). The comparison of review aims and outcomes can be found in/uni00A0Figure 2. Other amendments Authors We have changed many authors compared to the previous review -/uni00A0van Ginneken 2013/uni00A0- due to previous author unavailability and due to the large scope of this review and the need for involvement of more people. Review authors were chosen from those with expertise in dierent areas of mental health care research in LMICs (and for some, from and living in LMICs) and according to their interest in mental health. We also worked with/uni00A0authors who will be taking over leadership of the parallel/uni00A0prevention review (Purgato 2021). Terminology of health workers We received feedback in our consultations that the terms/uni00A0non-specialist health workers (NSHWs)/uni00A0and/uni00A0other professionals with health roles (OPHRs), used in the previous version/uni00A0of this review/uni00A0to describe the types of included mental health care providers (van Ginneken 2013), are diicult to understand. We therefore used the following/uni00A0terms/uni00A0in this update, also taking into account that it was easier to have an overarching term for both clinical and non-clinical workers:/uni00A0primary-level/uni00A0workers/uni00A0(PWs). We subdivided these into lay health workers (LHWs), community professionals (CPs), and primary health professionals (PHPs). See the main text,/uni00A0Figure 1, and/uni00A0Table 1/uni00A0for definitions. Methods Population - mental disorders and distress As mentioned/uni00A0above, the/uni00A0mental disorders and distress/uni00A0included in this review will therefore include any mental illness symptoms and expressions/uni00A0of distress, not just mental disorders, in line with the transdiagnostic approach. Due to now having a parallel review on/uni00A0mental/uni00A0prevention/uni00A0and promotion of mental health (Purgato 2021), we have moved some of the previously included studies to the prevention review/uni00A0(Shin 2011 and Baker Henningham 2015 - in excluded studies). Also/uni00A0we have removed 'neurological disorders' from this review (thus/uni00A0Li/uni00A02009/uni00A0epilepsy was excluded) but we have kept substance abuse, as treatment/uni00A0needs for neurological disorders/uni00A0are/uni00A0likely/uni00A0to be/uni00A0dierent, with more pharmacological treatments. For this update, we/uni00A0focus on the spectrum of/uni00A0mental disorders and distress/uni00A0seen/uni00A0frequently/uni00A0in primary care./uni00A0We have updated the ICD-10 codes to the ICD-11 codes in the table of definitions of mental disorders (Table 1). Setting - definition of LMICs The definition of LMICs was refined to include the World Bank historical criteria, to be more consistent about what was and was not included as an LMIC. This meant that some interventions were re-classified and excluded (e.g./uni00A0those from/uni00A0HongKong, Taiwan/uni00A0(Chen 2000 and Tiwari/uni00A02010),/uni00A0were/uni00A0previously/uni00A0included/uni00A0as they were considered to be/uni00A0in/uni00A0China, but they were/uni00A0stand-alone/uni00A0economies in the World Bank classification/uni00A0and are considered HICs).

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Interventions/uni00A0 We make clear that the intervention does not include trials that only compare training competencies or methods, which do not have any aim of assessing patient outcomes./uni00A0 We wish to specify that we have included only studies that have one of our primary outcomes and not only those with our secondary outcomes. Outcomes/uni00A0 Outcomes have been adjusted to first make health service/uni00A0utilisation/uni00A0a primary outcome (due to relevance for policy and practice, as recommended by the stakeholders we consulted). We had originally in the 2019 protocol to this review update -/uni00A0van Ginneken 2019/uni00A0-/uni00A0changed the prevalence outcome to a recovery outcome. However during analysis, we realised a lot of the older papers had prevalence data that could not be transformed to recovery data, principally due to sub-syndromal symptoms. In the 2013 review, we had also transformed some continuous outcome data into prevalence data (e.g./uni00A0Rojas 2007), but on looking through studies this time, we found this was very subjective and thus we could not identify the cuto for having depression. Although it is possible to convert continuous to dichotomous data, because we used these continuous data in symptom severity outcomes, we decided not to transform continuous data to dichotomous data for this review. In/uni00A0addition, compared to the 2013 review/uni00A0(van Ginneken 2013),/uni00A0we have simplified secondary outcomes to include direct and indirect costs to patients and health services. We have elaborated on what is included within these costs by defining opportunity costs better as also including eects on patient employment, income, retention,/uni00A0etc./uni00A0(see below)./uni00A0Compared to the 2019 protocol to this review (van Ginneken 2019), we have further refined how we present data for these by specifying which costs and cost-eectiveness data are presented in these reviews, along with which are resource use and societal costs (see amended section under secondary outcomes in methods). Comparison groups/uni00A0 We amended the 2019 protocol -/uni00A0van Ginneken 2019/uni00A0-/uni00A0to try to divide/uni00A0the various comparison/uni00A0groups due to the heterogeneity of availability of 'usual care'/uni00A0(i.e./uni00A0into trained versus untrained PWs, no care, usual care, enhanced care)./uni00A0However/uni00A0when it came to sub- grouping studies, we/uni00A0realised/uni00A0that/uni00A0these comparison groups were not always so obvious to tease out. We therefore combined them with no/uni00A0care,/uni00A0broadened the definition,/uni00A0and simplified the comparison categories/uni00A0to usual care/uni00A0(with combination with no care and enhanced care)/uni00A0(see definitions/uni00A0and methods above)./uni00A0Although we intended to subgroup the dierent/uni00A0comparison groups, we found too few studies to make these subgroups meaningful. Study design/uni00A0 We decided based on the 2013/uni00A0review findings that the studies that were not RCTs did not contribute any additional information to the review. Therefore we decided to exclude CBAs, NRCTs, and ITSs/uni00A0(i.e. the/uni00A0following studies were excluded for being 2009, Loughry 2006 CBA,/uni00A0Lyketsos/uni00A01999,/uni00A0Paranthanam/uni00A02010, Scholte 2011,/uni00A0Thabet/uni00A02005,/uni00A0Wolmer/uni00A02005,/uni00A0and Zambori/uni00A02002,/uni00A0in/uni00A0van Ginneken 2013). Foreign language papers/uni00A0 We have been more specific about our management of double data extraction with foreign language papers, as we have included several foreign language papers in this review (van Ginneken 2013/uni00A0included only one). Foreign language reviewers extracted and translated RoB/uni00A0comments/justifications and sent them to a second reviewer in English (withholding/uni00A0their own assessment of risk) so that the second reviewer could then make his or her own judgement. The foreign language reviewer also sent a translated legend of anything in the outcomes tables that was not clear without translation. Occasionally, some papers necessitated more extensive translation (e.g. if the full paper was around costs) so the health economists could extract the data. The foreign language reviewer then reviewed each paper verbally over the phone with the second reviewer to ensure concordance and to check the accuracy of extraction. Time points/uni00A0 We grouped outcomes into three sets of time points to indicate the stability of remission. 1.Post intervention (0 to 1 month a/f_ter intervention) (to detect illness remission =/uni00A0immediate remission/immediate symptom reduction of the/uni00A0intervention). 2.1 month to 6 months post intervention (to detect/uni00A0sustained remission/sustained symptom reduction). 3.7 to 24 months post intervention (which indicates medium- to/uni00A0long-term remission, I.e./uni00A0avoidance of recurrence and chronicity or long- term symptom reduction) (with subgroup for the/uni00A01- to 2-year/uni00A0ones if needed). This diers from the previous review/uni00A0-/uni00A0van Ginneken 2013/uni00A0- 0 to 2 months, 4 to 6 months, and 8 to 12 months - as we wanted to capture better the dierence between post intervention and remission and to include a measure of long-term outcomes too. A recent literature review/uni00A0summarises that/uni00A0the duration criteria for declaring remission and recovery seem unnecessary. Depressive remission can be defined as the asymptomatic state a/f_ter a depressive episode, without any duration criterion applied.

Better health./uni00A0 /uni00A0 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews remission is then relatively low on the first day but increases gradually with duration. The term 'recovery' is then used as a concept that would consist of more than absence of symptoms and would also include better social functioning or subjective well-being, possibly including the absence of significant treatment, as this would better fit the concept of recovery from a patient's perspective (de Zwart 2019)./uni00A0 This review does not attempt to present illness recovery outcomes as one outcome,/uni00A0although individual studies will include some of the information pertaining to illness recovery/uni00A0(such as social functioning). Search methods Electronic databases searched were identical to those searched for the 2013 review, although EPOC search strategies now are not run through/uni00A0Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, ISI Web of Knowledge, as they pick up very little if any new information. LILACS was not searched separately, as it is now included in the WHO Global Health Library search. Trial registries searched this time were the Clinical Trials Register (clinicaltrials.gov) instead of the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, as this latter register has now been pooled with the former. Subgroup analyses In the 2013 review and in the 2019 protocol, we suggested that we would do subgroup analyses (1) by category of health worker/uni00A0(health professionals (PHPs): e.g. doctors, nurses; community non-health professionals (CPs): e.g. social workers, teachers; and non-professionals (LHWs); (2) by type of community intervention/uni00A0(e.g. collaborative versus psychological interventions); and (3) by setting (e.g. government versus non-government). However health worker categories and community interventions became/uni00A0planned as the main analyses of our comparisons due to a suicient number of studies for these groups, and because we believed this would be most relevant to policy makers. We dropped analyses by setting, as it was diicult to disentangle this information within most of the studies. Assessment of risk of bias We simplified the detection bias to consist of just one category, whereas in the 2013 review (van Ginneken 2013), we had/uni00A0added two extra categories for risk of bias assessment (i.e. detection bias that had been divided into assessing subjective and objective outcomes was assessed blindly). In the 2019 protocol (van Ginneken 2019),/uni00A0we had removed blinding of outcome assessment, but at analysis stage, we re-integrated this. We have retained the split of attrition bias that we used in the last review and have kept it divided into how incomplete or not two types of outcomes are: eicacy outcomes and safety outcomes (e.g. adverse events). Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) list criteria: this was adapted in the last review and was retained, with more questions: (1) Was there a comparison between two more groups receiving dierent interventions? (2) Is the perspective/viewpoint** of the analysis explicitly stated? If yes, give details. (3) Are costs measured? If yes, give details of costs measured. (4). Were outcomes measured? If yes, give details of outcomes measured. and (5) Were sensitivity analyses undertaken? If yes, give details on the forms of sensitivity analysis. We included a total of 24 questions (Appendix 2 ). GRADE/uni00A0 Since the 2013 review, Cochrane has/uni00A0requested/uni00A0greater rigour in assessing the certainty of evidence./uni00A0Therefore/uni00A0our GRADE assessments are stricter in this review (most results were low as opposed to moderate in the 2013 review) and apply the more stringent criteria for assessment/uni00A0( Guyatt 2011).
