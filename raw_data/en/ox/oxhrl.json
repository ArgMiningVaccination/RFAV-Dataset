At UT Health San Antonio, we conduct studies called clinical trials. Clinical trials are an important step in research to discover new treatments that help improve the health and well-being of our community. YOU are an important part of this step. Our researchers need YOU to volunteer and help pave the path of discovery. UT Health San Antonio, University Health and Texas Biomedical Research Institute are reporting promising results following a minimally invasive procedure that dissolved abdominal fat in two patients. The goal of the novel procedure is to improve the patients' health and minimize or reverse the adverse health effects of their Type 2 diabetes. To ask about study eligibility, call the Texas Diabetes Institute's research line at 210-358-7200 and ask for Mary Samano. The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, whose faculty see patients at University Health, are recruiting 900 adult COVID-19 survivors from the COVID-19 Outpatient Virtual Infectious Disease Clinic and other care settings for a federally funded study that seeks to understand why some people have prolonged symptoms or develop new or returning symptoms after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The partnership also includes the Laredo Health Department as a clinical partner. For additional information, please call (210-567-5262) or visit the RECOVER: Researching COVID website. Why volunteer? Volunteers are needed in clinical trials to understand how new treatments or interventions affect people. Without you, better treatments for diseases like diabetes, cancer, stroke, and other medical conditions would not exists. Sometimes, clinical trials can be treatment option for people. \u00bfPor que m\u00e9dicas. 7 Questions to ask research teams What is the purpose of this study? How long is the study? What is already known about the treatment in the study? Will I know if I am getting the treatment? Will I be paid for my time? Do I have to pay for any part of the study? Will the results be given to me? \"By 2030, cancer in Latinos is going to increase by 140%. But, we know very little about how new treatments affect this population since they are still underrepresented in clinical trials.\" Amelie G.
