About Our Pr escription Drug Coverage and Medicar e OPM has determined that the Government Employees Health Association, Inc. prescription drug coverage is, on average, expected to pay out as much as the standard Medicare prescription drug coverage will pay for all plan participants and is considered Creditable Coverage. This means you do not need to enroll in Medicare Part D and pay extra for prescription drug coverage. If you decide to enroll in Medicare Part D later , you will not have to pay a penalty for late enrollment as long as you keep your FEHB coverage. However , if you choose to enroll in Medicare Part D, you can keep your FEHB coverage and your FEHB plan will coordinate benefits with Medicare. Remember: If you are an annuitant and you cancel your FEHB coverage, you may not re-enroll in the FEHB Program. Please be advised If you lose or drop your FEHB coverage and go 63 days or longer without prescription drug coverage that' s at least as good as Medicare' s prescription drug coverage, your monthly Medicare Part D premium will go up at least 1% per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go 19 months without Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, your premium will always be at least 19 percent higher than what many other people pay . Y ou will have to pay this higher premium as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you may have to wait until the next Annual Coordinated Election Period (October 15 through December 7) to enroll in Medicare Part D. Medicar e' s Low Income Benefits For people with limited income and resources, extra help paying for a Medicare prescription drug plan is available. Information regarding this program is available through the Social Security Administration (SSA) online at www .socialsecurity .gov , or call the SSA at (800) 772-1213, TTY : (800) 325-0778.

Benefit Plan Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory Stop Health Car e Fraud! Fraud increases the cost of health care for everyone and increases your Federal Employees Health Benefits Program premium. OPM' s Of fice of the Inspector General investigates all allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse in the FEHB Program regardless of the agency that employs you or from which you retired. Pr otect Y ourself Fr om Fraud - Here are some things that you can do to prevent fraud: Do not give your plan identification (ID) number over the telephone or to people you do not know , except for your health care provider , authorized health benefits plan, or OPM representative. Let only the appropriate medical professionals review your medical record or recommend services. A void using health care providers who say that an item or service is not usually covered, but they know how to bill us to get it paid. Carefully review explanations of benefits (EOBs) statements that you receive from us. Periodically review your claims history for accuracy to ensure we have not been billed for services that you did not receive. Do not ask your doctor to make false entries on certificates, bills or records in order to get us to pay for an item or service. If you suspect that a provider has char ged you for services you did not receive, billed you twice for the same service, or misrepresented any information, do the following: - Call the provider and ask for an explanation. There may be an error . - If the provider does not resolve the matter , call us at (800) 821-6136 and explain the situation. - If we do not resolve the issue: CALL - THE HEAL TH CARE FRAUD HOTLINE (877) 499-7295 OR go to www .opm.gov/about-us/our -inspector -general Y ou can also write to: United States Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General Fraud Hotline 1900 E Str eet NW Room 6400 W ashington, DC 20415-1 100 Do not maintain as a family member on your policy: - Y our former spouse after a divorce decree or annulment is final (even if a court order stipulates otherwise); or - Y our child over age 26 (unless he/she was disabled and incapable of self-support prior to age 26). If you have any questions about the eligibility of a dependent, check with your personnel of fice if you are employed, with your retirement of fice (such as OPM) if you are retired, or with the National Finance Center if you are enrolled under T emporary Continuation of Coverage. Fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact is prohibited under the Plan. Y ou can be prosecuted for fraud and your agency may take action against you. Examples of fraud include falsifying a claim to obtain FEHB benefits, trying to or obtaining service or coverage for yourself or for someone else who is not eligible for coverage, or enrolling in the Plan when you are no longer eligible. If your enrollment continues after you are no longer eligible for coverage (i.e., you have separated from Federal service) and premiums are not paid, you will be responsible for all benefits paid during the period in which premiums were not paid. Y ou may be billed by your provider for services received. Y ou may be prosecuted for fraud for knowingly using health insurance benefits for which you have not paid premiums. It is your responsibility to know when you or a family member is no longer eligible to use your health insurance coverage. 4 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc. Benefit Plan Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory Pr eventing Medical Mistakes An influential report from the Institute of Medicine estimates that up to 98,000 Americans die every year from medical mistakes in hospitals alone. That' s about 3,230 preventable deaths in the FEHB Program a year . While death is the most tragic outcome, medical mistakes cause other problems such as permanent disabilities, extended hospital stays, longer recoveries, and even additional treatments. By asking questions, learning more and understanding your risks, you can improve the safety of your own health care, and that of your family members. T ake these simple steps: 1. Ask questions if you have doubts or concerns. Ask questions and make sure you understand the answers. Choose a doctor with whom you feel comfortable talking. T ake a relative or friend with you to help you ask questions and understand answers. 2. Keep and bring a list of all the medicines you take. Bring the actual medicines or give your doctor and pharmacist a list of all the medicines and dosage that you take, including non- prescription (over -the-counter) medicines and nutritional supplements. T ell your doctor and pharmacist about any drug, food, and other aller gies you have, such as latex. Ask about any risks or side ef fects of the medication and what to avoid while taking it. Be sure to write down what your doctor or pharmacist says. Make sure your medicine is what the doctor ordered. Ask the pharmacist about your medicine if it looks dif ferent than you expected. Read the label and patient package insert when you get your medicine, including all warnings and instructions. Know how to use your medicine. Especially note the times and conditions when your medicine should and should not be taken. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. 3. Get the r esults of any test or pr ocedur e. Ask when and how you will get the results of tests or procedures. Don' t assume the results are fine if you do not get them when expected, be it in person, by phone, or by mail. Call your doctor and ask for your results. Ask what the results mean for your care. 4. T alk to your doctor about which hospital is best for your health needs. Ask your doctor about which hospital has the best care and results for your condition if you have more than one hospital to choose from to get the health care you need. Be sure you understand the instructions you get about follow-up care when you leave the hospital. 5. Make sur e you understand what will happen if you need surgery . Make sure you, your doctor , and your sur geon all agree on exactly what will be done during the operation. Ask your doctor , \"Who will manage my care when I am in the hospital?\" Ask your sur geon: - \"Exactly what will you be doing?\" - \"About how long will it take?\" - \"What will happen after sur gery?\" - \"How can I expect to feel during recovery?\" T ell the sur geon, anesthesiologist, and nurses about any aller gies, bad reactions to anesthesia, and any medications or nutritional supplements you are taking. 5 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc. Benefit Plan Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory Patient Safety Links www .ahrq.gov/consumer/ .

Never Events When you enter the hospital for treatment of one medical problem, you don' t expect to leave with additional injuries, infections or other serious conditions that occur during the course of your stay . Although some of these complications may not be avoidable, too often patients suf fer from injuries or illnesses that could have been prevented if the hospital had taken proper precautions. W e have a benefit payment policy that encourages hospitals to reduce the likelihood of avoidable complications and hospital-acquired conditions such as certain infections, severe bedsores and fractures; and reduce medical errors that should never happen called \"Never Events\". When an avoidable complication or \"Never Event\" occurs, neither your FEHB plan nor you will incur cost to correct the medical error . Y ou will not be billed for inpatient services related to treatment of specific hospital acquired conditions or for inpatient services needed to correct \"Never Events\", if you use Aetna Signature Administrators, Coventry Health Care of the Carolinas, Coventry Health Care of Geor gia, Freedom Network, and HealthAmerica Pennsylvania providers. \"Never Event\" is defined by your claims administrator using national standards. Never Events are errors in medical care that are clearly identifiable, preventable and serious in their consequences for patients, and that indicate a real problem in the safety and credibility of a health care facility . This policy helps to protect you from preventable medical errors and improve the quality of care you receive. 6 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc.

This law mandates that you be enrolled for Self and Family coverage in the FEHB Program, if you are an employee subject to a court or administrative order requiring you to provide health benefits for your child(ren). If this law applies to you, you must enroll for Self and Family coverage in a health plan that provides full benefits in the area where your children live or provide documentation to your employing of fice that you have obtained other health benefits coverage for your children. If you do not do so, your employing of fice will enroll you involuntarily as follows: Childr en' s Equity Act 8 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc. Benefit Plan FEHB Facts If you have no FEHB coverage, your employing of fice will enroll you for Self and Family coverage in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan' s Basic Option; If you have a Self Only enrollment in a fee-for -service plan or in an HMO that serves the area where your children live, your employing of fice will change your enrollment to Self and Family in the same option of the same plan; or If you are enrolled in an HMO that does not serve the area where the children live, your employing of fice will change your enrollment to Self and Family in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan' s Basic Option. As long as the court/administrative order is in ef fect, and you have at least one child identified in the order who is still eligible under the FEHB Program, you cannot cancel your enrollment, change to Self Only , or change to a plan that doesn' t serve the area in which your children live, unless you provide documentation that you have other coverage for the children. If the court/administrative order is still in ef fect when you retire, and you have at least one child still eligible for FEHB coverage, you must continue your FEHB coverage into retirement (if eligible) and cannot cancel your coverage, change to Self Only , or change to a plan that doesn' t serve the area in which your children live as long as the court/administrative order is in ef fect. Contact your employing of fice for further information. The benefits in this brochure are ef fective January 1. If you joined this Plan during Open Season, your coverage begins on the first day of your first pay period that starts on or after January 1. If you changed plans or plan options during Open Season and you r eceive car e between January 1 and the effective date of coverage under your new plan or option, your claims will be paid according to the 2015 benefits of your old plan or option. However , if your old plan left the FEHB Program at the end of the year , you are covered under that plan' s 2014 benefits until the ef fective date of your coverage with your new plan. Annuitants' coverage and premiums begin on January 1. If you joined at any other time during the year , your employing of fice will tell you the ef fective date of coverage. If your enrollment continues after you are no longer eligible for coverage, (i.e., you have separated from Federal service) and premiums are not paid, you will be responsible for all benefits paid during the period in which premiums were not paid. Y ou may be billed for services received directly from your provider . Y ou may be prosecuted for fraud for knowingly using health insurance benefits for which you have not paid premiums. It is your responsibility to know when you or a family member are no longer eligible to use your health insurance coverage. When benefits and pr emiums start When you retire, you can usually stay in the FEHB Program. Generally , you must have been enrolled in the FEHB Program for the last five years of your Federal service. If you do not meet this requirement, you may be eligible for other forms of coverage, such as T emporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC). When you r etir e When you lose benefits Y ou will receive an additional 31 days of coverage, for no additional premium, when: Y our enrollment ends, unless you cancel your enrollment, or Y ou are a family member no longer eligible for coverage. Any person covered under the 31 day extension of coverage who is confined in a hospital or other institution for care or treatment on the 31st day of the temporary extension is entitled to continuation of the benefits of the Plan during the continuance of the confinement but not beyond the 60th day after the end of the 31 day temporary extension. When FEHB coverage ends 9 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc. Benefit Plan FEHB Facts Y ou may be eligible for spouse equity coverage or T emporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC). If you are divorced from a Federal employee or annuitant, you may not continue to get benefits under your former spouse' s enrollment. This is the case even when the court has ordered your former spouse to provide health coverage for you. However , you may be eligible for your own FEHB coverage under either the spouse equity law or T emporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC). If you are recently divorced or are anticipating a divorce, contact your ex-spouse' s employing or retirement of fice to get RI 70-5, the Guide to Federal Benefits for T emporary Continuation of Coverage and Former Spouse Enrollees, or other information about your coverage choices.

The Af fordable Care Act (ACA) did not eliminate TCC or change the TCC rules. For example, you can receive TCC if you are not able to continue your FEHB enrollment after you retire, if you lose your Federal or T ribal job, if you are a covered dependent child and you turn age 26, regardless of marital status, etc. Y ou may not elect TCC if you are fired from your Federal or T ribal job due to gross misconduct.

Y ou can choose your own physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers. W e give you a choice of enrollment in a High Option or a Standard Option. W e reimburse you or your provider for your covered services, usually based on a percentage of the amount we allow . The type and extent of covered services, and the amount we allow , may be dif ferent from other plans. Read brochures carefully . This Plan provides preventive services and screenings to you without any cost-sharing; you may choose any available primary care provider for adult and pediatric care, and visits for obstetrical or gynecological care do not require a referral. General featur es of our High and Standard Options W e have a Pr eferr ed Pr ovider Organization (PPO) Our fee-for -service plan of fers services through a PPO. This means that we designate certain hospitals and other health care providers as \"preferred providers.\" W e assign you a \"home network\" based on the state where you live. Y our home network is listed on your GEHA ID card. Please refer to the chart below to determine your home network. Aetna Signatur e Administrators Arizona, California, New Y ork, New Jersey , Nevada, Oregon, and W ashington Coventry Health Car e of the Car olinas, Inc.

The PPO dialysis network for all members is the Preferred Outpatient Dialysis Network. Y ou have access to PPO providers inside and outside your home network. When you use a PPO provider in your home network, you are only responsible for the deductible, copayment, and coinsurance for covered char ges. When you use a PPO provider that is outside your home network (in a GEHA network listed above but not printed on your GEHA ID card), GEHA will pay a PPO benefit based on a contracted rate, negotiated amount or a billed char ge. Y ou are still only responsible for the deductible, copayment, and coinsurance for covered char ges. If you expect that you or a dependent will be residing outside of your home network for a temporary period of time, please contact GEHA for special assistance. 1 1 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc. Benefit Plan Section 1 T o find PPO providers, use the provider search tool on the geha.com website or call GEHA at (800) 296-0776. When you phone for an appointment, please remember to verify that the physician is still a PPO provider . GEHA providers are required to meet licensure and certification standards established by State and Federal authorities, however , inclusion in the network does not represent a guarantee of professional performance nor does it constitute medical advice. Y ou always have the right to choose a PPO provider or a non-PPO provider for medical treatment. When you see a provider not in the GEHA PPO network, GEHA will pay at the non-PPO level and you will pay a higher percentage of the cost. The non-PPO benefits are the standard benefits of this Plan. PPO benefits apply only when you use a PPO provider . Provider networks may be more extensive in some areas than others. W e cannot guarantee the availability of every specialty in all areas. If no PPO provider is available, or you do not use a PPO provider , the standard non-PPO benefits apply . However , if the services are rendered at a PPO hospital, we will pay up to the Plan allowable for services of radiologists, anesthesiologists, emer gency room physicians, hospitalists, neonatologists and pathologists who are not preferred providers at the preferred provider rate. In addition, providers outside the United States will be paid at the PPO level of benefits. Georgia , North Car olina, Pennsylvania and South Car olina W e have entered into an agreement with Coventry Health Care, Inc. Coventry's open access health network will be available to our members. Benefits described above will be the same. Y ou have the right to choose in network or out-of-network providers for your care. By receiving care from an in-network provider , you receive a higher level of benefit coverage. Also, in-network providers will file claims for you and are responsible for obtaining any needed precertifications required by the Plan. Out-of-network providers, unlike your in-network providers, are not obligated to obtain any needed certifications and therefore the member is responsible for obtaining the certification. In the local markets, Coventry is referred to as Coventry Health Care of the Carolinas, Inc., Coventry Health Care of Geor gia and HealthAmerica Pennsylvania or HAP A. Members still call GEHA for all concerns or questions. How we pay pr oviders Fee-for -service plans reimburse you or your provider for covered services. They do not typically provide or arrange for health care. Fee-for - service plans let you choose your own physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. The FFS plan reimburses you for your health care expenses, usually on a percentage basis. These percentages, as well as deductibles, methods for applying deductibles to families and the percentage of coinsurance you must pay vary by plan. W e of fer a preferred provider or ganization (PPO) arrangement. This arrangement with health care providers gives you enhanced benefits or limits your out-of-pocket expenses. W e reserve the right to audit medical expenses to ensure that the provider ' s billed char ges match the services that you received.

Unless we are misled by the information given to us, we won' t change our decision on medical necessity . In most cases, your physician or hospital will take care of requesting precertification. Because you are still responsible for ensuring that your care is precertified, you should always ask your physician or hospital whether they have contacted us.

Y our costs for cover ed services This is what you will pay out-of-pocket for your covered care: Coinsurance is the percentage of our allowance that you must pay for your care. Coinsurance doesn' t begin until you meet your deductible. W e will base this percentage on either the billed char ge or the Plan allowance, whichever is less. Example: Under the High Option, you pay 25% of our allowance for non-PPO of fice visits. Coinsurance A copayment is a fixed amount of money you pay to the provider , facility , pharmacy , etc., when you receive certain services. Example: When you see your PPO physician, under the High Option, you pay a copayment of $20 per visit. Note: If the billed amount or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have agreed to accept as payment in full is less than your copayment, you pay the lower amount. Copayments Cost-sharing is the general term used to refer to your out-of-pocket costs (e.g., deductible, coinsurance, and copayments) for the covered care you receive. Cost-sharing A deductible is a fixed amount of covered expenses you must incur for certain covered services and supplies before we start paying benefits for them. Copayments and coinsurance amounts do not count toward any deductible. When a covered service or supply is subject to a deductible, only the Plan allowance for the service or supply counts toward the deductible. The calendar year deductible is $350 per person under High and Standard Option. After the deductible amount is satisfied for an individual, covered services are payable for that individual. Under a family enrollment, all family members' individual deductibles are considered to be satisfied when the family members' deductibles are combined and reach $700 under High and Standard Option. W e also have separate deductibles for: - A High Option per admission deductible of $100 per person (PPO) and $300 per person (non-PPO) for inpatient hospital services. If the billed amount (or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have agreed to accept as payment in full) is less than the remaining portion of your deductible, you pay the lower amount. Example: If the billed amount is $100, the provider has an agreement with us to accept $80, and you have not paid any amount toward meeting your calendar year deductible, you must pay $80. W e will apply $80 to your deductible. W e will begin paying benefits once the remaining portion of your calendar year deductible ($350 per person under High and Standard Option) has been satisfied. Note: If you change plans during Open Season and the ef fective date of your new plan is after January 1 of the next year , you do not have to start a new deductible under your old plan between January 1 and the ef fective date of your new plan. If you change plans at another time during the year , you must begin a new deductible under your new plan. If you change options in this Plan during the year , we will credit the amount of covered expenses already applied toward the deductible of your old option to the deductible of your new option. Deductible 25 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc. Benefit Plan Section 4 If your provider routinely waives (does not require you to pay) your copayments, deductibles, or coinsurance, the provider is misstating the fee and may be violating the law . In this case, when we calculate our share, we will reduce the provider ' s fee by the amount waived. For example, if your physician ordinarily char ges $100 for a service but routinely waives your 25% coinsurance, the actual char ge is $75. W e will pay $56.25 (75% of the actual char ge of $75). If your pr ovider r outinely waives your cost In some instances, a provider may ask you to sign a \"waiver\" prior to receiving care. This waiver may state that you accept responsibility for the total char ge for any care that is not covered by your health plan. If you sign such a waiver , whether you are responsible for the total char ge depends on the contracts that the Plan has with its providers. If you are asked to sign this type of waiver , please be aware that, if benefits are denied for the services, you could be legally liable for the related expenses. If you would like more information about waivers, please contact us at (800) 821-6136 or write to GEHA, P . O. Box 4665, Independence, MO 64051-4665. W aivers Our \"Plan allowance\" is the amount we use to calculate our payment for covered services. Fee-for -service plans arrive at their allowances in dif ferent ways, so their allowances vary . For more information about how we determine our Plan allowance, see the definition of Plan allowance in Section 10. Often, the provider ' s bill is more than a fee-for -service plan' s allowance. Whether or not you have to pay the dif ference between our allowance and the bill will depend on the provider you use. For more information about out of area services, see W e have a Preferred Provider Or ganization (PPO) in Section 1. PPO pr oviders agree to limit what they will bill you. Because of that, when you use a preferred provider , your share of covered char ges consists only of your deductible and coinsurance or copayment. Here is an example about coinsurance: Y ou see a PPO physician who char ges $150, but our allowance is $100. If you have met your deductible, you are only responsible for your coinsurance. That is, with High Option, you pay just - 10% of our $100 allowance ($10). Because of the agreement, your PPO physician will not bill you for the $50 dif ference between our allowance and his/her bill. Non-PPO pr oviders , on the other hand, have no agreement to limit what they will bill you. When you use a non-PPO provider , you will pay your deductible and coinsurance - plus any dif ference between our allowance and char ges on the bill. Here is an example. Y ou see a non-PPO physician who char ges $150 and our allowance is again $100. Because you've met your deductible, you are responsible for your coinsurance, so with High Option you pay 25% of our $100 allowance ($25). Plus, because there is no agreement between the non-PPO physician and us, the physician can bill you for the $50 dif ference between our allowance and his/her bill. Differ ences between our allowance and the bill The following table illustrates the examples of how much you have to pay out-of-pocket, under the High Option, for services from a PPO physician vs. a non-PPO physician. The table uses our example of a service for which the physician char ges $150 and our allowance is $100. The table shows the amount you pay if you have met your calendar year deductible. EXAMPLE PPO physician Non-PPO physician Physician's char ge $150 $150 Our allowance W e set it at: 100 W e set it at: 100 W e pay 90% of our allowance: 90 75% of our allowance: 75 ou owe: 10% 25% ference up to char ge? No: 0 Y es: 50 T OT AL YOU P A Y $10 $75 26 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc. Benefit Plan Section 4 For High and Standard Option medical and sur gical services with coinsurance, we pay 100% of our allowable amount for the remainder of the calendar year after out-of-pocket expenses for coinsurance exceed: Y our catastr coinsurance, and copayments $5,500 High Option or $6,000 Standard if you use PPO providers. Out-of-pocket expenses from both PPO and non-PPO providers count toward this limit. If you reach this limit, expenses from non-PPO providers must reach the non-PPO out-of-pocket limit before they are paid at 100% of our allowable amount. PPO $7,500 High Option or $8,000 Standard Option if you use non-PPO providers. Any of the above expenses for PPO providers also count toward this limit. Y our eligible out-of-pocket expenses will not exceed this amount whether or not you use PPO providers. Out-of-pocket expenses for PPO and Non-PPO benefits are: The $350 (High and Standard Option) calendar year deductible; The $20 copayment for doctor ' s of fice visits (High Option); or the $15 copayment for primary care physician/$30 specialist of fice visits (Standard Option); The (High Option) $100 (PPO) (non-PPO) per copayment (High Option) or $500 copayment (Standard Option) for Specialty Pharmacy medication not dispensed by our Specialty Pharmacy; The 10% (High Option) or 15% (Standard Option) you pay for PPO char ges under medical services and supplies, sur gical and anesthesia services and hospital, facility , ambulance services and mental health and substance abuse services; The 25% (High Option) or 35% (Standard Option) you pay for non-PPO char ges under medical services and supplies, sur gical and anesthesia services and hospital, facility , ambulance services and mental health and substance abuse services; and Coinsurance and copayments that you make for prescription drugs that we cover . The following cannot be counted toward catastrophic protection out-of-pocket expenses and you must continue to pay them even after your expenses exceed the limits described above: Expenses in excess of our allowable amount or maximum benefit limitations; Expenses, in excess of plan limits, for dental and manipulative therapy; The cost for non-approved step therapy medication and drugs that we exclude; Any amounts you pay because benefits have been reduced for non-compliance with our cost containment requirements (see Section 3); and The dif ference (High Option) between the cost of the generic and brand name medication. Non-PPO If you changed to this Plan during open season from a plan with a catastrophic protection benefit and the ef fective date of the change was after January 1, any expenses that would have applied to that plan' s catastrophic protection benefit during the prior year will be covered by your old plan if they are for care you received in January before your ef fective date of coverage in this Plan. If you have already met your old plan' s catastrophic protection benefit level in full, it will continue to apply until the ef fective date of your coverage in this Plan. If you have not met this expense level in full, your old plan will first apply your covered out-of- pocket expenses until the prior year ' s catastrophic level is reached and then apply the catastrophic protection benefit to covered out-of-pocket expenses incurred from that point until the ef fective date of your coverage in this Plan. Y our old plan will pay these covered expenses according to this year ' s benefits; benefit changes are ef fective January 1. Carryover 27 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc.

What is an accidental injury? An accidental injury is a bodily injury sustained solely through violent, external, and accidental means, such as broken bones, animal bites, and poisonings. What is a medical emergency? A medical emer gency is the sudden and unexpected onset of a condition or an injury that you believe endangers your life or could result in serious injury or disability , and requires immediate medical or sur gical care. Some problems are emer gencies because, if not treated promptly , they might become more serious; examples include deep cuts and broken bones. Others are emer gencies because they are potentially life threatening, such as heart attacks, strokes, poisonings, gunshot wounds, or sudden inability to breathe. There are many other acute conditions that we may determine are medical emer gencies - what they all have in common is the need for quick action.

Benefit Plan High and Standard Option Section 5(f) High and Standard Option High Option - pr escription drug tiers Under the High Option , we divide prescription drugs into categories or tiers: generic, preferred, and non-preferred medications. When an approved generic equivalent is available, that is the drug you will receive, unless you or your physician specifies the prescription must be dispensed as written. When an approved generic equivalent is not available, you will pay the preferred or non-preferred applicable plan coinsurance. If an approved generic equivalent is available, but you or your physician specifies that the prescription must be dispensed as written with the brand name medication, you will pay the generic copayment plus the dif ference between the cost of the generic drug and the brand name drug dispensed. Y our physician may request the brand name drug be approved through a medical necessity review . If your brand name drug is approved as medically necessary , your coinsurance will be the applicable brand name coinsurance. Generic drugs are chemically and therapeutically equivalent to the corresponding brand name drug, but are available at a lower price. Equivalent generic products for brand name medications become available after a patent and other exclusivity rights for the brand name expire. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must approve all generic versions of a drug and assure that they meet strict standards for quality , strength and purity . The FDA requires that generic equivalent medications contain the same active ingredients and be equivalent in strength and dosage to brand name drugs. Pr eferr ed drugs are FDA approved prescription medications included on the Preferred Drug List developed by CVS/caremark. This list developed by an independent panel of doctors and pharmacists who ensure the medications are clinically appropriate and cost-ef fective. Selection criteria sources include but are not limited to: peer -reviewed literature; recognized compendia; consensus documents; nationally sanctioned guidelines and other publications of the National Institutes of Health, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , and other or ganizations or government agencies; drug labeling approved by the FDA; and input from medical specialty practitioners. Non-Pr eferr ed drugs are FDA approved prescription medications that are covered by GEHA, however they are not included on the CVS/caremark Preferred Drug List. Most commonly utilized medications have generic or preferred medications available. High Option Maintenance Choice Maintenance Choice\u00ae lets you choose how to get 90-day supplies of your maintenance medications: through mail service or at a retail CVS/pharmacy . Either way , you pay mail service prices for 90-day supplies. After two retail 30-day prescription fills, members are required to use their mail service benefit. W ith the Maintenance Choice program, members can continue to use retail CVS/pharmacy locations to gain access to 90-day supply while accessing the mail order coinsurance under your plan. Maintenance Choice also allows members the ability to have their prescription transferred from the mail order service, to a retail CVS/pharmacy location if the member wants the experience of talking with pharmacy staf f in person. If a member would like to get started with mail service for the first time, they can call the CVS/caremark Fast Start program and CVS/caremark will work with their physician to acquire a 90-day supply prescription to be filled through either the CVS/caremark Mail Order Pharmacy or their local retail CVS/ pharmacy . The CVS/caremark Fast Start program can be reached at (800) 875-0867 or members can sign in or register at www . caremark.com/faststart once their plan year begins.

Benefit Plan Section 8 Section 9. Coordinating benefits with Medicar e and other coverage Y ou must tell us if you or a covered family member has coverage under any other health plan or has automobile insurance that pays health care expenses without regard to fault. This is called \"double coverage\". When you have double coverage, one plan normally pays its benefits in full as the primary payor and the other plan pays a reduced benefit as the secondary payor . W e, like other insurers, determine which coverage is primary according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) guidelines. For more information on NAIC rules regarding the coordinating of benefits, visit the NAIC website at www .NAIC.or g . When we are the primary payor , we will pay benefits described in this brochure. In certain circumstances when we are secondary , we will also take advantage of any provider discount arrangements your primary plan may have. When the primary plan allowance is less than our allowable, we will only make up the dif ference between the primary' s plan payment and the amount the provider has agreed to accept as payment in full from the primary payor . If your primary payor requires preauthorization or requires you use designated facilities or provider for benefits to be approved, it is your responsibility to comply with these requirements. In addition you must file the claim to your primary payor within the required time period. If you fail to comply with any of these requirements and benefits are denied by the primary payor , we will pay secondary benefits based on an estimate of what the primary carrier would have paid if you followed their requirements. Please see Section 4, Y our costs for covered services, for more information about how we pay claims.

When other Government agencies ar e r esponsible for your car e If GEHA pays benefits for an illness or injury for which you or your dependent are later compensated or reimbursed from another source, you must refund GEHA from any recovery you or your dependent obtain. All GEHA benefit payments in these circumstances are conditional, and remain subject to our contractual benefit limitations, exclusions, and maximums. By accepting these conditional benefits, you agree to the following: The covered person or his/her legal representative must contact GEHA ' s Subrogation Unit at (800) 821-4742 as soon after the incident as possible and provide all requested information, including prompt disclosure of the terms of all settlements, judgments, or reimbursements. The covered person must sign any releases GEHA requires to obtain information about his/ her claim from other sources. Include all benefits paid by GEHA in any claim for compensation you or your dependent assert against any tortfeasor , insurer , or other party for the injury or illness, and assign all proceeds recovered from any party , including your own and/or other insurance, to GEHA for up to the amount of the benefits paid. When benefits are payable under the Plan in relation to the illness or injury , GEHA may , at its option: Subrogate, that is, take over the covered person' s right to receive payments from other parties. The covered person or his/her legal representative will transfer to GEHA any rights he or she may have to take legal action arising from the illness or injury to recover any sums paid on behalf of the covered person; or Enforce its right to seek reimbursement, that is recover from the covered person, or his/her legal representative, any benefits paid from any payment the covered person is entitled to receive from other parties. Y ou must cooperate in doing what is reasonably necessary to assist us, and you must not take any action that may prejudice our rights to recover reimbursement. Reimburse GEHA on a first priority basis, in full up to the amount of benefits paid, out of any settlements, judgments, and/or recoveries that you obtain from any source, no matter how characterized, i.e., as \"pain and suf fering.\" GEHA enforces this right of reimbursement by asserting a lien against any and all recoveries received, including first party Medpay , Personal Injury Protection, No-Fault coverage, Third-Party , and Uninsured and Underinsured coverage. GEHA ' s lien consists of the total benefits paid to diagnose or treat the illness or injury . GEHA ' s lien applies first, regardless of the \"make whole\" and \"common fund\" doctrines. No reduction of GEHA ' s lien can occur without our written consent, including reduction for attorney fees and costs. Sign a Reimbursement Agreement if asked by GEHA to do so. However , a Reimbursement Agreement is not necessary to enforce our lien. W e may delay processing of your claims until we receive a signed Reimbursement Agreement or Assignment of the proceeds of a claim. When others ar e r esponsible for injuries 97 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc. Benefit Plan Section 9 GEHA ' s lien extends to all related expenses incurred prior to the settlement or judgment date, even if those expenses were not submitted to GEHA for payment at the time you reimbursed GEHA. The lien remains the member ' s obligation until it is satisfied in full. Failure to refund GEHA or cooperate with our reimbursement ef forts may result in an overpayment that can be collected from you or any dependent. Some FEHB plans already cover some dental and vision services. When you are covered by more than one vision/dental plan, coverage provided under your FEHB plan remains as your primary coverage. FEDVIP coverage pays secondary to that coverage. When you enroll in a dental and/or vision plan on www .BENEFEDS.com , you will be asked to provide information on your FEHB plan so that your plans can coordinate benefits. Providing your FEHB information may reduce your out-of-pocket cost. When you have Federal Employees Dental and V ision Insurance Plan (FEDVIP) An approved clinical trial includes a phase I, phase II, phase III, or phase IV clinical trial that is conducted in relation to the prevention, detection, or treatment of cancer or other life-threatening disease or condition, and is either Federally-funded; conducted under an investigational new drug application reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); or is a drug trial that is exempt from the requirement of an investigational new drug application. If you are a participant in a clinical trial, this health plan will provide related care as follows, if it is not provided by the clinical trial: Routine care costs - costs for routine services such as doctor visits, lab tests, x-rays and scans, and hospitalizations related to treating the patient' s condition, whether the patient is in a clinical trial or is receiving standard therapy . These costs are covered by this Plan. Extra care costs - costs related to taking part in a clinical trial such as additional tests that a patient may need as part of the trial, but not as part of the patient' s routine care. This Plan does not cover these costs. Research costs - costs related to conducting the clinical trial such as research physician and nurse time, analysis of results, and clinical tests performed only for research purposes. These costs are generally covered by the clinical trials. This Plan does not cover these costs. Clinical trials When you have Medicar e Medicare is a health insurance program for: People 65 years of age or older; Some people with disabilities under 65 years of age; and People with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant). Medicare has four parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance). Most people do not have to pay for Part A. If you or your spouse worked for at least 10 years in Medicare-covered employment, you should be able to qualify for premium-free Part A insurance. (If you were a Federal employee at any time both before and during January 1983, you will receive credit for your Federal employment before January 1983.) Otherwise, if you are age 65 or older , you may be able to buy it. Contact (800) MEDICARE (800) 633-4227, TTY : (877) 486-2048 for more information. Part B (Medical Insurance). Most people pay monthly for Part B. Generally , Part B premiums are withheld from your monthly Social Security check or your retirement check. Part C (Medicare Advantage). Y ou can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan to get your Medicare benefits. W e do not of fer a Medicare Advantage plan. Please review the information on coordinating benefits with Medicare Advantage plans on page 100. What is Medicar e? 98 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc. Benefit Plan Section 9 Part D (Medicare prescription drug coverage). There is a monthly premium for Part D coverage. Before enrolling in Medicare Part D, please review the important disclosure notice from us about the FEHB prescription drug coverage and Medicare. The notice is on the first inside page of this brochure. For people with limited income and resources, extra help in paying for a Medicare prescription drug plan is available. For more information about this extra help, visit the Social Security Administration online at www .socialsecurity .gov , or call them at (800) 772-1213, TTY : (800) 325-0778.

Just call the Social Security Administration toll- free number (800) 772-1213, TTY : (800) 325-0778 to set up an appointment to apply . If you do not apply for one or more Parts of Medicare, you can still be covered under the FEHB Program. If you can get premium-free Part A coverage, we advise you to enroll in it. Most Federal employees and annuitants are entitled to Medicare Part A at age 65 without cost . When you don' t have to pay premiums for Medicare Part A, it makes good sense to obtain the coverage. It can reduce your out-of-pocket expenses as well as costs to the FEHB, which can help keep FEHB premiums down. Everyone is char ged a premium for Medicare Part B coverage. The Social Security Administration can provide you with premium and benefit information. Review the information and decide if it makes sense for you to buy the Medicare Part B coverage. If you do not sign up for Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may be char ged a Medicare Part B late enrollment penalty of a 10 % increase in premium for every 12 months you are not enrolled. If you didn't take Part B at age 65 because you were covered under FEHB as an active employee (or you were covered under your spouse's group health insurance plan and he/she was an active employee), you may sign up for Part B (generally without an increased premium) within 8 months from the time you or your spouse stop working or are no longer covered by the group plan. Y ou also can sign up at any time while you are covered by the group plan. If you are eligible for Medicare, you may have choices in how you get your health care. Medicare Advantage is the term used to describe the various private health plan choices available to Medicare beneficiaries. The information in the next few pages shows how we coordinate benefits with Medicare, depending on whether you are in the Original Medicare Plan or a private Medicare Advantage plan. (Please r efer to page 102 for information about how we pr ovide benefits when you ar e age 65 or older and do not have Medicar e.) Should I enr oll in Medicar e?

Y our physician and hospital must follow Medicare rules and cannot bill you for more than they could bill you if you had Medicare. Y ou and the FEHB benefit from these payment limits. Outpatient hospital care and non-physician based care are not covered by this law; regular Plan benefits apply . The following chart has more information about the limits. If you: are age 65 or over; and do not have Medicare Part A, Part B, or both; and have this Plan as an annuitant or as a former spouse, or as a family member of an annuitant or former spouse; and are not employed in a position that gives FEHB coverage. (Y our employing of fice can tell you if this applies.) Then, for your inpatient hospital car e: The law requires us to base our payment on an amount - the \"equivalent Medicare amount\" - set by Medicare' s rules for what Medicare would pay , not on the actual char ge. Y ou are responsible for your applicable deductibles and coinsurance under this Plan. Y ou are not responsible for any char ges greater than the equivalent Medicare amount; we will show that amount on the explanation of benefits (EOB) form that we send you. The law prohibits a hospital from collecting more than the \"equivalent Medicare amount\". When inpatient claims are paid according to a Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) limit (for instance, for admissions of certain retirees who do not have Medicare), we will pay 30% of the total covered amount as room and board char ges and 70% as other char ges and will apply your coinsurance accordingly . And, for your physician car e, the law requires us to base our payment and your coinsurance on: an amount set by Medicare and called the \"Medicare approved amount,\" or the actual char ge if it is lower than the Medicare approved amount. If your physician: Then you ar e r esponsible for: Participates with Medicare or accepts Medicare assignment for the claim and is a member of our PPO network, your deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. Participates with Medicare and is not in our PPO network, your deductibles, coinsurance, and any balance up to the Medicare approved amount. Does not participate with Medicare, your deductibles, coinsurance, and any balance up to 1 15% of the Medicare approved amount. It is generally to your financial advantage to use a physician who participates with Medicare. Such physicians are permitted to collect only up to the Medicare approved amount. Our explanation of benefits (EOB) form will tell you how much the physician or hospital can collect from you. If your physician or hospital tries to collect more than allowed by law , ask the physician or hospital to reduce the char ges. If you have paid more than allowed, ask for a refund. If you need further assistance, call us. 103 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc.

W e use the Department of V eterans Af fairs (V A) Medicare-equivalent Remittance Advice (MRA) when the statement is submitted to determine our payment for covered services provided to you if Medicare is primary , when Medicare does not pay the V A facility . If you are covered by Medicare Part B and it is primary , your out-of-pocket costs for services that both Medicare Part B and we cover depend on whether your physician accepts Medicare assignment for the claim. If your physician accepts Medicare assignment, then we waive some of your deductibles, copayment and coinsurance for covered char ges. If your physician does not accept Medicare assignment, then you pay the dif ference between the \"limiting char ge\" or the physician' s char ge (whichever is less) and our payment combined with Medicare' s payment. It is important to know that a physician who does not accept Medicare assignment may not bill you for more than 1 15% of the amount Medicare bases its payment on, called the \"limiting char ge.\" The Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) that Medicare will send you will have more information about the limiting char ge.

Observation services are commonly ordered for patients who present to the emer gency department and who then require a significant period of treatment or monitoring in order to make a decision concerning their admission or dischar ge. This Plan uses Milliman Care Guidelines to evaluate the appropriateness of observation services. The Plan provides outpatient hospital benefits for observation care. If you are in the hospital for more than a few hours, confirm with your physician whether your stay is inpatient or outpatient so that you are aware of how your hospital claim will be processed. Observation car e Our Plan allowance is the amount we use to determine our payment and your coinsurance for covered services. Fee-for -service plans determine their allowances in dif ferent ways. W e determine our Plan allowance as follows: PPO pr oviders : Our PPO allowances are negotiated with each provider who participates in the network. PPO allowances may be based on a standard reduction or on a negotiated fee schedule. For these allowances, the PPO provider has agreed to accept the negotiated reduction and you are not responsible for this discounted amount. In these instances, the benefit paid plus your coinsurance equals payment in full. Non-PPO pr oviders: T o determine our non-PPO Plan allowance, we must first be provided an itemized bill that includes your diagnosis, the services or supplies you received, and the provider ' s char ge for each, using the same types of standard codes, descriptions and other information required for processing by public health care plans like Medicare. If we are not provided the itemization of the services or supplies you received, we will assume they were equivalent to the level and extent of services and supplies typically provided by the providers or facilities most commonly used to treat other Plan members with the same principal diagnosis as yours. W e will base these equivalent services on claims submitted to the Plan by providers in the same geographic region or a combination of similar geographic regions across the United States. Based on the itemization of services or supplies you received, we will determine the amount of the maximum non-PPO Plan allowance by applying the following rules, in order: 1. W e consult standard industry guides, such as national databases of prevailing health care char ges from F AIR Health or another identified data source, that are available for our use in a given state or geographic area. After the data supplier removes outliers from the claim data they collect, they group the remaining data by percentiles. W e use the 70th percentile. This means that out of every 100 reports remaining after outliers were removed, 30 char ges billed may be more, but 70 char ges will be the allowed amount or less. Plan allowance 108 2015 Government Employees Health Association, Inc. Benefit Plan Section 10 2. For services or supplies obtained in a state or geographic area where the above data source is unavailable for our use, and also for dialysis centers and outpatient dialysis performed at a hospital our non-PPO Plan allowance is two times the Medicare participating provider allowance for the service or supply in the geographic area in which it was performed or obtained. This Medicare-based allowance is not used for those services where Medicare sets a fixed national payment amount that does not vary geographically (such as blood draws). Medicare fee schedule information for physician services may be obtained at www .cms.hhs. gov/PFSlookup/ . Note: Labs drawn during the week of dialysis treatments and drugs provided on the day of dialysis are part of the bundled dialysis payment. 3. Some Plan allowances may be submitted to medical consultants who recommend allowances based on standard industry relative value guidelines. For services or supplies for which Medicare does not provide an allowance amount, we may use the current fee schedule used by the federal Of fice of W orkers Compensation (OWCP). OWCP fee schedule information may be obtained at www .dol.gov/OWCP/regs/feeschedule/fee.htm . For services or supplies that do not have a value currently established by public health care plans such as Medicare or Medicaid, or for implantable devices and sur gical hardware, we may use medical consultants to determine an appropriate allowance. W e may also conduct independent studies to determine the usual cost of a service or supply in a geographic area, or to establish allowances for services or supplies provided outside the United States. Non-PPO Plan allowance amounts determined according to these guidelines include, but are not limited to, ambulatory sur gery centers, dialysis centers, sur gery , doctor ' s services, physical therapy , occupational therapy , speech therapy , lab testing and X-ray expenses, implantable devices and sur gical hardware; and under the Standard Option, diagnostic and preventive dental services. For more information about the source of the data we are currently using you may call us at (800) 821-6136. Plan allowance for prescription drugs is determined using A verage Wholesale Price or other industry-standard reference price data. Char ges for some Plan allowances are stated in this brochure. These include limited benefits such as manipulative therapy care and routine dental care. If we negotiate a reduced fee amount on an individual claim for services or supplies which is lower than the Plan allowance, covered benefits will be limited to the negotiated amount. Y our coinsurance will be based on the reduced fee amount. If you choose to use a provider other than the one we negotiated a reduction with, you will be responsible for the dif ference in these amounts. T o estimate our maximum Plan allowance for a non-PPO provider before you receive services from them, call us at (800) 821-6136. For more information, see Dif ferences between our allowance and the bill in Section 4. Any claims that are not pre-service claims. In other words, post-service claims are those claims where treatment has been performed and the claims have been sent to us in order to apply for benefits. Post-service claims Those claims (1) that require precertification, prior approval, or a referral and (2) where failure to obtain precertification, prior approval or a referral results in a reduction of benefits.
