ONE MISSION. A Seventh-day Adventist Organization2020Dear Colleagues: Thank you for choosing to be a part of our community of health professionals, scientists, and scholars. It is our privilege to translate the mission of Loma Linda University Health into the educational, research, and service activities of this Seventh -day Adventist Academic Health Sciences Center. We celebrate the centrality of Christ in the mission of Loma Linda University. Building upon the principles of faith, hope, and love, we embrace the values of com passion, integrity, humility, excellence, teamwork, and wholeness . Our motto invites us to give priority to our personal wholeness and to promote competent and compassionate whole person care to both our students and patients. We are enriched by the ethnic and cultural diversity of our students, faculty, staff, and administration, and we promote an environment that reflects and builds respect for the diversit y of humanity . This handbook is intended: * To provide a guide to the University's organization and governance and the various en tities with which it relates. * To furnish information on the University and the communities within which it is located. * To bring together those University policies, regulations, and procedures which apply directly to faculty or are important for the f aculty's understanding of the functioning of the University. The University seeks to foster a collegial, Christian environment for the discussion of issues and resolution of disputes that may arise within the university community. In order to accomplish t his, the University policies provide for a grievance procedure and binding arbitration for any controversy, dispute, or claim. This includes those based upon a statute, tort, or public policy arising out of this handbook or services performed in accordanc e with this handbook, whether with individuals, t he University or other entities. The University reserves the right to modify, supplement, rescind, or review any provision of this handbook as it deems necessary or appropriate in its discretion. Changes i n these policies and procedures are valid only when made and approved in writing by the Board of Trustees or the appropriate University committees which have been delegated that responsibility by the Board of Trustees. The Faculty Handbook is reprinted fro m time to time incorporating current policies and procedures. Thus earlier editions of the handbook should not be used as a reference for current years. Any changes in policies and procedures made prior to publication in the next edition of the Faculty Han dbook are reported by email and in the University's publication TODAY. This Faculty Handbook shares with you the various policies and processes that guide our relationships. While we continually seek to update and improve them, they also represent the com piled wisdom of many years and much thought. You will find both the general University section as well as individual school sections detailing the unique issues in each of our eight professional schools. Please take the time to acquaint yourself with the broad format, enabling easy access to specific policies as they are needed. It is clear in the academic world that the best defense is good anticipatory preparation. Knowing the policies and following them can avoid mistakes and costly corrections after the fact. It is also wise to seek counsel early, from colleagues, deans, and others when you are facing a policy or legal question. Though we all are committed to order and discipline, we are not perfect and issues will arise that raise the concerns of others. You are working at a special place, steeped in a God given history of providence and commitment. Thank you for sharing our journey to bring the teaching and healing ministry of Christ to our students, staff and patients. Whether in the classroom, clinics, wards, labs or community, you are what makes this place so unique in its local and global service. My office and fellow officers of the University are always ready to answer questions and work with you to make your time at Loma Linda University p roductive and fulfilling. Sincerely, Richard H.

Faculty policy development procedure Chapter 1 - Page 4 History of Loma Linda University Early in the twentieth century, through a series of providences, Loma Linda University began as a facility. In addition to emphasizing healthful living as a part of medical care, it was also designated by the Seventh - day Adventist church as a center for ed ucating health professionals. The School of Nursing, which began in 1905, reflected this emphasis. In 1909, the College of Medical Evangelists received its charter as a medical school with the express purpose of preparing physicians who could meet the need s of the whole person. From these small beginnings, it has achieved widespread recognition, having sent more of its graduates into international service than any other U.S. medical school. From 1913 to 1962, the institution operated within health facili ties in two cities: Loma Linda and Los Angeles. In September 1962, all health professional education was consolidated in Loma Linda. In 1967, Loma Linda University Medical Center opened in the tower facilities that have become a landmark; this Center conti nues to expand educational opportunities on the cutting edge of health care for students of the University. In 1990, the Board designated Loma Linda University as a health sciences university. As part of a complex comprised of Loma Linda University Medi cal Center, faculty practice plans, and affiliated institutions, the University entered the twenty -first century as a leader in the field of health -sciences education, research, and service. 1905 School of Nursing 1967 Loma Linda University campus merge d with La Sierra College 1909 School of Medicine named the College of Medical Evangelists 1967 Loma Linda University Medical Center opened and patients moved to new facility 1922 Department of Dietetics 1968 Loma Linda University Medical Center dedicated 1937 School of Medical Technology* 1990 Loma Linda and La Sierra campuses become two separate universities 1941 School of Physical Therapy* 1990 Loma Linda University designated as a health sciences university 1945 Radiologic Technology* 1997 Loma Linda University and Medical Center were corporately linked together through Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center (LLUAHSC) 1948 School of Tropical & Preventive Medicine [Reorganized as School of Public Health, 1967] 2002 School of Pharmacy 1953 School of Dentistry 2003 School of Science and Technology 1954 Graduate School 2005 Graduate School renamed Faculty of Graduate Studies 1959 Dental Hygiene 2005 Centennial celebration 1959 Occupational Therapy* 2007 Faculty of Religion renamed School of Religion 1961 College of Medical Evangelists renamed Loma Linda University 2012 School of Science and Technology renamed as School of Behavioral Health 1963 Medical Records Administration* 2015 LLUAHSC renamed Loma Linda University Health (LLUH) 1966 School of Allied Health Professions incorporates above programs marked with an *. 2020 New LLUMC facility Chapter 1 - Page 5 MOTTO To Make Man Whole MISSION To continue the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ VISION Transforming lives through education, healthcare and research VALUES Compassion Value Definition: Reflects the love of God with respect, mercy, and empathy.

Chapter 1 - Page 8 CHAPTER 1 INSTITUTIONAL ORGANIZATION 1.1.0 Loma Linda University is the academic component of the Loma Linda University Health (LLUH). LLUH effectively blends together the academic pursuits of education and research with the health care enterprise and its integrated delivery network. There are a number of interdigitating components of LLUH. These are mutually interdependent entiti es while at the same time existing as separate legal entities. The core entities of LLUH are: 1.1.1 Loma Linda University (the academic entity) This is composed of eight schools - the Schools of Allied Health Professions, Behavioral Health, Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, Religion, and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The University infrastructure supporting the education and research programs covers student services including programs and housing facilities; learning resources including the library; and financial affairs and the physical plant. 1.1.2 Loma Linda University Medical Center and its affiliated entities (th e major clinical facilities) This encompasses the University Medical Center, the Cancer Center, the Children's Hospital, the East Campus, the Behavioral Medicine Center, and the Surgical Hospital. A comprehensive dental clinic is integrated int o the activities of the LLU School of Dentistry. A Center for Health Promotion is coordinated by faculty in the LLU School of Public Health. The other major teaching facility located in Loma Linda, and considered to be an integrated facility is t he Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center. Within these health care facilities the various clinical faculty practice their specialties while modeling for students competent professionalism combined with whole person care. Further within these facilities patients, from local, regional, national, and international communities, receive comprehensive health care ranging from primary to quaternary care, and preventive, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services. 1.1.3 The Loma Linda University School of Medicine Faculty Corporations (faculty hiring entities) These corporations hire the clinical faculty of the School of Medicine. It is through this mechanism that the clinical departments of the School of Medicine generate revenues that fund much of their operations. Chapter 1 - Page 9 These not -for-profit corporations support educational programs for undergraduate and graduate students as well as for professional peers; and fund various research endeavors, in addition to fulfilling the clinical service responsibilities. 1.1.4 Loma Linda University Health Care (management service organization) This entity is responsible for the management of the physic ian practice component of the Loma Linda University Integrated Delivery Network.

Research - to maintain and enhance excellence in research. Service - to assist in bringing health, healing, and wholeness to humanity. Mission -Focused Themes Spiritual Nurture & Wholeness* - to foster personal wholeness and to provide \"whole person care.\" Diversity - to promote an environment that reflects and builds respect for the diversity of humanity as ordained by God. Outreach - to serve a worldwide community by promoting healthful living, caring for the sick, and sharing the good news of a loving God.

To enable faculty in meeti ng this responsibility, the University expects faculty participation in the governance of the institution in the following areas: Curriculum and instruction . At the departmental or program level, faculty design, implement, and evaluate the curriculum in a reas specific to that department or program. Through departmental, programmatic, or school -wide curriculum committees, they participate in maintaining quality and meeting accreditation standards for those professional programs. Student performance . Facult y, within their respective domains, are to participate in setting admissions standards, selection and admission of students, monitoring student progress, and conducting outcome assessment of student education. Faculty selection and evaluation . Within the department or program, the department chair or program director seeks faculty advice regarding the qualifications for and participation in the selection of faculty for that department or program. Likewise, department chairs or program leaders dialogue wit h faculty about responsibilities, under the guidelines set by the school's workload policy. Faculty are expected to engage in peer evaluation of teaching, service, and research. Faculty are expected to review student evaluations of their peers, and to resp ond positively to areas of concern. Faculty are to participate, through their respective school -wide committees, in evaluation and recommendations for promotion and tenure of their peers, as well as review of productivity through means established within t he department, program, or school.

Chapter 1 - Page 55 1.5.3. Faculty Policy Development Procedure Initiation by faculty, school faculty organization, or school or University administration. Development and testing of proposed new policy or revision of existing policy by UFC, Deans Council, and the University policy committee [UPC]. The UPC may selec t a subcommittee, not necessarily from among UPC members, appropriate to the topic of the policy to perform the necessary research and initial policy development. The policy under development may be sent back through each of these entities for further refinement. Legal counsel may be sought by any of the three entities during this stage upon approval of the office of the president. Faculty holding University appointment review the proposed policy through: Public hearing at Faculty Forum and/or Mail out to faculty The revised draft of the policy is forwarded to the President's Committee. Legal counsel must review the policy during this stage. The President's Committee may send the policy back to the UPC for further revision, if deemed necessary. President's Committee forwards the draft to the Board of Trustees, which may delegate prior review to its Scientific and Academic Affairs Committee. The Board may act on the recommended policy, or send it back for further revision. If the Board rejects, or substantially amends the policy, it should provide an answer to the entities involved in the preparation of this policy. The policy becomes effective upon action by the Board of Trustees, or at a time so specified by the Board.

This statu s is only granted at or after retirement from the regular faculty. In recommending this change of status the school committee on faculty rank and tenure also takes into consideration the recognition of the candidate among faculty colleagues, students and a dministration for his/her satisfactory commitment to teaching and/or research and/or service. 2.3.5 Granting of Emeritus Status Emeritus/Emerita titles are conferred upon individuals who have made significant contributions through long and distinguished service at LLU. The granting of emeritus/emerita status is based on merit. Faculty and senior academic officers are eligible to receive emeritus/emerita status at or shortly after their retirement from LLU. Faculty holding the rank of professor or associate professor, or a honorific title of distinguished professor are eligible; this eligibility applies to faculty from all three tracks as designated by their individua l school policy: educator, research, or clinical. Once the university confers emeritus/emerita title Chapter 2 - Page 14 on an individual, the appointment is considered a continuous appointment. Emeritus/emerita status cannot be conferred posthumously. As a general rule ten (10) years or more of employment in the capacity for which the emeritus title is recommended would be considered long service for faculty. Exceptions to this policy may be considered for an individual who has made outstanding contribu tion to the University during a briefer period of service and who joined the University late in their career, and is recommended by University officers. Emeritus/emerita status may also be granted prior to retirement for those who served the University in an eligible administrative position for at least ten (10) years prior to retirement. Academic administrators who serve five years in an administrative capacity, and who resign such positions to return to the faculty position for at least another five (5) years are eligible for emeritus/emerita status. Persons who are awarded by the designation Emeritus/Emerita status will retain their rank at the time of retirement followed \"Emeritus/Emerita .\" Persons who have been granted emeritus/ emerita status may be reappointed for part -time service after official retirement in accordance with LLU policies and regulations; however, the payroll title for such appointments will be appropriate to the service performed and will not include the term \"emeritus/ emerita.\" a. Privileges and Responsibilities A person granted emeritus status may, in addition to the benefits and privileges of all retired faculty and staff members: (1) be listed separately in the school bulletin and/or University electronic directory, following the listing of the regular faculty and staff in those publications, (2) be invited to University functions in their area of interest; (3) be invited to attend faculty meetings and extended the privileges of the floor, but have no vote, all at the discretion of the dean of the school; and, (4) be granted the use of services and facilities, including the library, Drayson Center, mail, and parking privileges, in accordance with University rules.

Tenure is a pledge of continuous academic appointment as defined by the sponsoring school or academic unit, subject to discontinuance for reasons st ated in policy. (See Discontinuation of Faculty Appointment and Severance of University Employment in Section 2.5.8). An award of tenure indicates the faculty member has priority . An award of tenure indicates the faculty member has priority for retention in time of retrenchment but does not guarantee employment by a sponsoring school or academic unit of the University. 2.5.2 Objectives a. The purpose of tenure is to acknowledge a core of highly qualified faculty who maintain an appropriately high standard of achievement in their disciplines, as well as demonstrate a commitment and continued contribution to the mission of Loma Linda Universi ty. The award of tenure in a school or academic unit of the University recognizes outstanding professional growth by a faculty member during the prior period of University service (usually five to seven years). The period of service may be shorter for fa culty with service to another institution. b. The availability of tenure in a school or academic unit of the University is designed to attract and retain faculty of the highest quality for the academic program of that school. 2.5.3 Eligibility Criteria Full-time academic appointment, as defined in Faculty Appointments (full -time faculty who are employees of the University as designated by FT/U), is required for tenure. This does not include faculty who are employees of University -approved faculty emp loying corporations (F MG), faculty who are employees of the Loma Linda University Medical Center (MC), or the Behavioral Medical Center (BMC), or those who are designated as geographic full -time (GFT), part -time, or voluntary faculty (see Faculty Classifi cation, Rank, Titles, Section 2.1) . Chapter 2 - Page 21 a. The faculty member must be in the regular academic track faculty (see Faculty Classification, Rank, Titles, Section 2.1) in the school of primary appointment which is designated as providing for the award of tenure. E ach school has the right to limit the number of available tenured positions in a department based on the number of tenured positions it designates it can support in time of retrenchment. These tenured faculty may also hold research center appointments. b. The faculty member must have the rank of associate professor or above; however, promotion or appointment to associate professor or above does not include tenure automatically (See Faculty Promotion to a Higher Academic Rank and/or Change to Special Merit R ank Procedures in Section 2.3) c. Faculty having appointments in more than one school will be governed by the policy of the school of the primary appointment. This designation process does not award tenure or guarantee future award of tenure. A faculty m ember may hold tenure in only one school of the University. d. The award of tenure is not automatic for faculty transferring to Loma Linda University who have qualified for tenure at another institution. Prior to appointment, the University Rank and Tenure Committee may consider a request for tenure upon receiving a recommendation from the tenure committee and the dean of the school of primary appointment. In such an instance, the award of tenure will be conditional upon one year of demonstrated productivity and commitment to the mission of Loma Linda University. If questions arise regarding this demonstration, the questions will be adjudicated by the appropriate school's rank and tenure committee. In an exceptional case, when a prospective faculty has had tenure in another institution and has demonstrated a persona l and professional commitment to the mission of Loma Linda University, tenure may be granted at the time of appointment. e. The faculty member must provide evidence of satisfactory contribution to teaching, research and service, as determined by the tenu re committee of the sponsoring school or academic unit and of the University, with excellence in teaching or research and promise for continued professional growth and performance. f. The faculty member must provide a written commitment to the mission state ment of the University. This commitment will be demonstrated through a sustained contribution to the University's mission, such as productive service to wholeness by fostering intellectual, physical, social and spiritual values, a contribution to the dive rsity and equality of people in the University and in the broader community, or fostering service to humanity through local or global outreach activities. Specific criteria for the above are provided by the tenure policy of the sponsoring school or academ ic unit of the primary appointment. 2.5.4 School/Academic Unit Responsibilities Chapter 2 - Page 22 a. The supplemental policies of the school or academic unit shall state whether or not tenure is offered in that entity. If tenure is offered, the supplemental policy shall state clearly and publish for all faculty the following: (1) availability and delineation of tenure and/or non -tenure tracks, (2) eligibility criteria for achieving tenure, (3) process for requesting tenure, (4) tenure cycle within the school and the University, (5) documentation essential to application for tenure, (6) any limitations to tenure slots available within the school or academic unit, (7) options for employment of faculty who are denied tenure, (8) review of tenure, (9) review of process. b. The school or academic unit offering tenure shall appoint a tenure committee, the members of which shall be faculty members with primary appointments in the school or academic unit who are preferably tenured faculty. It may also include faculty external t o the school or academic unit. The tenure committee may be combined with the rank and promotion committee of the school, established as a subcommittee, or as a separate committee. c. The supplemental policies of the school or academic unit shall set fo rth the process by which it will determine if the faculty member applying for tenure meets the criteria. Transmission of a recommendation for tenure to the University Rank and Tenure Committee shall include a statement in writing summarizing the reasons f or recommendation including the evidence that the applicant meets the criteria and the way in which the applicant meets the school's policy. A recommendation for tenure from a school does not need to be unanimous; the school may determine the level of agr eement essential to its policy. The University's tenure cycle normally follows the deadline dates of applications to the school committee no later than November 1, to the University Committee no later than February 1, to the Board of Trustees no later tha n May, with the expected date of decision delivered no later than June 30. d. The school or academic unit must confirm in the application the funding base which, in times of retrenchment, supports its offer of tenure, e.g., an endowment available within a center of the school or academic unit or a designated portion of operating income. e. The policies of the school or academic unit may be more restrictive than specified in the University policy in this section but may not be more lenient. The Univer sity Rank and Tenure Committee will review of the tenure policies of the schools or academic units every five years to ascertain that their tenure fall within University tenure specifications. 2.5.5 Procedure to Initiate Tenure Policy Chapter 2 - Page 23 A request for tenure can be initiated by the faculty member or the faculty member's immediate superior (e.g. department chair) who forwards the application to the office of the dean. That office checks to ascertain that the application is complete, and forwards it to the rank and tenure committee or the equivalent committee of that school or academic unit for its November meeting. It should then be considered at the next meeting of that committee. a. If the tenure committee or equivalent committee of that school does not recommend award of tenure, the faculty member must be provided with a written explanation detailing the reason or reasons that caused tenure to be withheld. If such an explanation is not provided, the request of the faculty member for tenure must be t ransmitted to the dean of the school for consideration and response. b. A recommendation for award of tenure by the tenure committee or equivalent committee of the school is forwarded to the dean, then to the president, for review by the University Rank a nd Tenure Committee. If approved, it is processed through the February President's Committee to the May Board of Trustees meeting. Review and approval or disapproval occurs at each administrative level, and a decision must be stated within nine months fo llowing consideration by the school's rank and tenure committee or equivalent committee. Disagreement at any administrative level with the committee's recommendation for tenure must be followed by a written statement to the chair of the rank and tenure co mmittee or its equivalent committee. The decision of the Board of Trustees to award or not to award tenure is communicated to the faculty member by the president. c. The award of tenure may or may not accompany promotion to Associate or Full Professor. A request for tenure is a separate consideration from that of promotion. Upon initial appointment or promotion, the faculty member shall be notified in writing by the president of the University specifying if the appointment is renewable or tenure -track. (1) A request for tenure is initiated by the faculty member or the faculty member's immediate superior (e.g. department chair) who forwards the application to the office of the dean. That office checks to ascertain that the application is complete, and f orwards it to the rank and tenure committee or the equivalent committee of that school or academic unit for its November meeting. It should then be considered at the next meeting of that committee. (2) If the tenure committee or equivalent committee of that school does not recommend award of tenure, the faculty member must be provided with a written explanation detailing the reason or reasons that caused tenure to be withheld. If such an explanation is not provided, the request of the Chapter 2 - Page 24 faculty member fo r tenure must be transmitted to the dean of the school for consideration and response. (3) A recommendation for award of tenure by the tenure committee or equivalent committee of the school is forwarded to the dean, then to the president, for review by the University Rank and Tenure Committee. If approved, it is processed through the February President's Committee to the May Board of Trustees meeting. Review and approval or disapproval occurs at each administrative level, and a decision must be stated within nine months following consideration by the school's rank and tenure committee or equivalent committee. Disagreement at any administrative level with the committee's recommendation for tenure must be followed by a written statement to the chair of t he rank and tenure committee or its equivalent committee. The decision of the Board of Trustees to award or not to award tenure is communicated to the faculty member by the president. (4) The award of tenure may or may not accompany promotion to Associ ate or Full Professor. A request for tenure is a separate consideration from that of promotion. Upon initial appointment or promotion, the faculty member shall be notified in writing by the president of the University specifying if the appointment is ren ewable or tenure -track. 2.5.6 Review of Tenured Faculty a. The continuous academic appointment provided by the award of tenure carries with it the expectation of continued professional growth and development of the faculty member for the duration of their academic career, as demonstrated by appropriate review of t he faculty member's academic activity. b. Tenured faculty are provided with annual reviews of their academic functions. Criteria and procedures for this evaluation are provided by the school of their primary appointment. The results of this evaluation pr ovides assistance to the department chair in commending and counseling tenured faculty regarding their continued professional growth and development as well as assessing merit salary increases. If a tenured faculty member's annual evaluation shows a subst antial decline in compliance with the requirements for appointment of tenured faculty, or a failure to give evidence of continued support of the mission of the University, the department chair and/or dean may recommend review for possible discontinuation o f tenure. c. At five -year intervals a cumulative assessment of the professional growth and development of the tenured faculty member will be made according to school policy to ensure that he/she continues to meet the tenure requirements recognized at the t ime tenure was originally awarded. Criteria and procedures for this cumulative assessment are provided by the school of primary appointment. The dean of the school will notify the faculty member of the results of the cumulative assessment. If a tenured faculty member's five -year Chapter 2 - Page 25 evaluation does not demonstrate continued cumulative compliance with the requirements for appointment of tenured faculty, the department chair and/or dean may recommend discontinuation of tenure. d. The school of primary appointme nt is responsible for providing detailed procedures relating to assessments of performance by tenured faculty and shall publish the same in their school -specific supplementary policy. e. Implementation: Faculty awarded tenure prior to the approval of the p revious policy by the Board of Trustees (1998) will be reviewed under the policy in effect at the time of award of tenure to them. 2.5.7 Discontinuation of Tenure a. Tenure can be discontinued for failure of the faculty member to perform their assigned a cademic functions, as documented by the processes for review of tenured faculty, or failure to give evidence of continued support of the mission of the University, or loss of funding base. The dean of the school provides the appropriate documentation to th e tenure committee of the school or to an equivalent school committee or to a subcommittee of peers selected according to the school -specific policy on discontinuation of tenure, for review and recommendation regarding possible discontinuation of the facul ty member's tenure (see Section 2.5.8). b. Tenure can be discontinued for the reasons of a disciplinary action against a faculty member (see Section 2.5.8). c. Tenure will be discontinued if a faculty member changes to an ineligible status, i.e., from full -time to part -time, to an ineligible academic track, or appointment to a school that by policy does not offer tenure. Tenure will continue during family and medical leave (as specified in Paid Leave and Sick Leave Provisions for Exempt (Salaried) Staff Employees ); for parental leave, it may extend for a maximum of two years of part -time employment. d. Tenure ceases when a faculty member voluntarily takes a leave of absence without University sa lary and there is written evidence that they are not obliged to return to University employment ( Professional Leaves ). e. The recommendation to discontinue tenure is initiated by the dean, for warded to the president and finally acted on by the Board of Trustees. If the reason for discontinuation of tenure arises from application of the policy of the school on review of tenured faculty, the dean will act on a recommendation from the tenure comm ittee of the school (or equivalent). 2.5.8 Discontinuation of tenured faculty appointment and employment procedure: Chapter 2 - Page 26 a. The Rank and Tenure Committee of the school or an equivalent committee or subcommittee of peers selected according to the school -specific policy on discontinuation of tenure recommends discontinuation of the tenure of the faculty member to the dean, with documentation justifying the action. b. The dean recommends to the president of the University the specific faculty appointment to be discontinued, with documentation justifying the action. c. The president either (a) rejects the termination or (b) concurs and sends to the faculty member by certified mail notification of the University's action and the reason for it, which shall be sent no less than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the proposed termination date. In the same letter, the faculty member is notified of the grievance procedure through which the faculty member may contest the termination. d. While the period of notification commences with the mailing of the notice from the president, the discontinuation is not effective unless it is confirmed by the Board of Trustees. e. Unless the grievance committee determines that dela y in the procedure has been substantially caused by the faculty member, salary and benefits shall continue for the faculty member until the grievance procedure is completed or terminated by the faculty member. f. The Board of Trustees may adjust the terms of this section in the event of declared fiscal exigency of the University, catastrophic emergency, or national financial collapse. g. The faculty member receiving a discontinuation notice is obligated to fulfill the terms of the current appointment. Thi s does not prevent mutual agreements for earlier termination and a negotiated modification of the severance pay schedule where applicable. h. The position of a full -time faculty member employed by the University (FT/U) for five years of more discontinue p ursuant to this section may not be filled by a replacement within two years unless the released faculty member has been offered the reappointment with employment and allowed thirty (30) days to accept or decline it. i. The grievance procedure is available for faculty who wish to contest their discontinuance. 2.5.9 Appeal Chapter 2 - Page 27 A faculty member may appeal the decision made by the tenure committee of the school or by any administrative officer by submitting a written request, with accompanying documentation, to the University Rank and Tenure Committee. In the event that the appea l is regarding an action of the University Rank and Tenure Committee, the appeal will be to the provost to ascertain whether the process occurred according to University policy. No further appeal is available. 2.5.10 Relationship of Administrative Appo intment to Tenure A tenured faculty member who accepts a full -time administrative position in the University normally retains tenure in that school. Subsequently upon leaving the administrative position, he/she would normally return to a position simil ar to that originally held. If tenure is not to be retained, it must be clarified in writing when the administrative position is offered. No tenure is available for an administrative position. 2.6.0 Discontinuation of faculty appointment and severance of University employment 2.6.1 The purpose of this policy is to outline the discontinuance of faculty appointments, management of these appointments including subsequent severance pay. A faculty appointment may be discontinued for the following reasons: 2.6.2 Retirement A full -time faculty member should notify the dean of their school or entity regarding the faculty appointment six (6) months prior to planned retirement. Additionally, they should follow the retirement procedures of their school regarding notification as specified by the employing entity. Information regarding retirement plans may be obtained from the personnel office of the employing entity. 2.6.3 Resignation A full -time faculty member should notify the dean of their school or entity as soon as possible regarding resignation from their faculty appointment. Terms of resignation are set by the employing entity; information regarding these may b e obtained from the personnel office of the employing entity. 2.6.4 Nonrenewal of a fixed -term faculty member by the University shall be as follows: a. Three -month notice is necessary to any full-time faculty member whose appointment is not to be renewed at the end of an initial one -year appointment. No other action is necessary on the part of the University. b. If the faculty member employed by the University has an appointment for more than one year, and has been employed continuously as a faculty for more than one year, the University must give a minimum of six (6) months -notice prior to the date of nonrenewal. While the period of notification commences with the Chapter 2 - Page 28 mailing of the notice from the president, the nonrenewal of the faculty appointment is not effective until it is confirmed by vote of the Board of Trustees. c. In the case of all other faculty (e.g. voluntary, part -time), no advance notice is necessary for nonrenewal of a faculty appointment. 2.6.5 Termination of full -time faculty appointment employed by the University (FT/U) with or without cause a. The faculty appointment of any faculty member, whether tenured or nontenured, may be discontinued under the following circumstances: (1) Substantive curricular changes, reduced enroll ments, financial constraints resulting in a reallocation or redirection of resources, or reduction in academic offerings resulting in no further need for the faculty member's services. (2) Physical or mental inability to perform faculty functions (see Faculty Handbook , Chapter 3: Faculty Functions and Responsibilities) for a period of more than 120 days. (3) As a disciplinary action against a faculty member ( see Discipline and Dismissal Policy in Section 2.7 ). (4) Fiscal exigency declared by the Boar d of Trustees. (5) Closure of the University, a school, or a department. b. Termination of full -time faculty appointment employment by the University (FT/U) for cause (Section 2.6). 2.6.6. Termination of administrative appointment Administrative appointees, such as University officers and deans, serve at the pleasure of the Board of Trustees, and such appointments may be discontinued at any time with or without cause. Depart ment chairs, program directors, associate and assistant deans serve at th e pleasure and sole discretion of the Board of Trustees and may be discontinued, with or without cause, upon the recommendation of the dean of the school in which the administrative appointments are held and the recommendation of the president. Under these circumstances, the supervising administrator would request a formal resignation before the recommendation for discontinuation is processed. 2.6.7. Severance pay for termination, tenured and non -tenured full -time faculty employed by Loma Linda University (FT/U). Chapter 2 - Page 29 a. Severance pay is limited to full -time faculty employed by Loma Linda University (FT/U) and is not available to individuals holding faculty appointments but receiving salary from other sources. b. Severance pay is limited to faculty members who se appointments are discontinued. c. Severance pay is calculated according to Step A of the salary rate for their professional rank at the time of discontinuation only and does not include benefits paid by the employee or on behalf of the employee other t han taxes and other amounts required by law to be withheld by the employer. d. Severance pay is determined as follows: (1) Tenured faculty: (a) Those employed for more than two (2) years will receive six (6) months' salary paid in biweekly installments. The severance pay shall commence in the first pay period following the date of discontinuation, or in the first pay period after the last payment of a late discontinuation settlement, if any. (b) In addition, tenured faculty who are discontinued will receive additional severance pay for a period based upon the length of service employment by the University. The additional severance pay will start after the severance pay has been paid except as specified in 2.6.7, and will continue for a period based up on the following table: Length of employment by the University Additional severance pay 3 - 5 years 1 month Greater than 5 years, less than 10 years 2 months Greater than 10 years, less than 15 years 3 months Greater than 15 years, less than 20 years 4 months Greater than 20 years, less than 25 years 5 months Greater than 25 years 6 months No employee shall receive more than one (1) year's total of severance pay. (2) Nontenured, full -time faculty [FT/U]: (a) employment by the University will receive severance pay at a rate based upon the years of employment by the University. This pay will be paid monthly for a period based upon the following table: Chapter 2 - Page 30 Length of employment by the University Additional severance pay 5 - 6 full years 1 month 7 - 8 full years 2 months 9 - 10 full years 3 months 11 - 12 full years 4 months 13 - 14 full years 5 months (b) Those with fifteen (15) years of continuous full -time employment by the University or twenty -five (25) years full-time total employment by organi zations listed in the Seventh -day Adventist Church Yearbook other than the University, including five (5) years of full -time employment by the University will receive six (6) months' salary paid in biweekly installment s. The severance pay shall commence in the first pay period following the date of discontinuation, or in the first pay period after the last payment of a late discontinuation settlement, if any. (c) No severance pay shall be paid to tenured faculty with less than one year of full -time employment by the University, or nontenured full -time faculty with less than five years of continuous full -time employment by the University, or if the discon tinuance is due to a declaration of fiscal exigency, a closure of the University, or the school where the faculty member held primary appointment, or if the faculty member is dismissed pursuant to the discipline and dismissal policy in Section 2.7. (d) If a discon tinued faculty member receiving severance pay accepts employment or other remunerative relationship(s) at an equal or greater salary than was received in the former University position, the University shall not continue the severance pay. (e) If a discont inued faculty member is employed by an organization listed in the Seventh -day Adventist Church Yearbook , the service for which severance pay was received is not counted as active service time for purposes of future severance pay and benefits. e. A full-time faculty member [FT/U] is entitled to one day of pay for each day that the University is late in giving notification as required by section 5 and section 4. Salary will continue after discontinuation or nonrenewal for a period equal to the time th at notice was late. No other payment or penalty for late notification shall be paid. Severance pay, if any, commences to be paid in the next pay period after the last late notification settlement payment is received. Chapter 2 - Page 31 f. Whenever the term \"notice\" is used in this termination of faculty appointment and severance of employment policy, it shall refer to a written notification which shall be effective when it is personally delivered or five calendar days after mailing by certified mail. 2.7.0 Discipline and d ismissal policy The most desirable concepts of discipline are those exercised by each faculty member and administrator in regulating his/her own life and performance to high standards of ethics, professionalism, and considerate concern for those under hi s/her care. Each person placed under faculty appointment accepts this responsibility for personal discipline. Where this principle governs faculty behavior, most problems will not arise that are covered by the more punitive concepts of discipline described in this policy. The discipline and dismissal policy stated here applies to all individuals who have a faculty appointment with the University. 2.7.1 Conducts that violate the University's expectation for faculty and employees. a. Refusal or neglect of responsibility, failure, or refusal to remediate documented unsatisfactory performance. b. Professional incompetence or unethical professional practice. c. Personal dishonesty, criminal conduct, or engaging in slanderous or libelous activity. d. Indifference to student, patient, or client welfare. e.

Substantial misrepresentation by a faculty member of his/her professional qual ifications, responsibilities, and duties at Loma Linda University. g. Overt disharmony, subversion, or demonstrated disrespect of the philosophy, objectives, and policies of the University and the teachings of the Seventh -day Adventist church. h. Conduct o utside of established governance or grievance procedures that causes or contributes to a major disruption in a program, department, school, or the University. i. A breach of confidentiality as required by law or University policy concerning faculty, staff, student, or patient records or data, research data, or University procedures in which the participants are promised confidentiality. j. Violation of the following policies: Chapter 2 - Page 32 (1) Academic Freedom (section 3.1) (2) Academic Responsibility (section 3.2) (3) Corporate Compliance Program (4) Non -Discrimination and Affirmative Action (5) Use of alcohol, controlled substa nces, and tobacco (6) Conflict of interest (7) Drug -Free Worksite (8) Copying and off -air recording (9) Facility Access Control (10) Facility Usage (11) Research involving humans (12) Research involving animals (13) Research involving radioac tive materials (14) Research misconduct (15) Sexual conduct (16) Sexual harassment (17) University Information Systems (18) Use of University name k. Those which the hearing committee (see Faculty Grievance Policy, in Section 2.8) confirms are good and just causes for discipline and dismissal. 2.7.2 Disciplinary actions up to dismissal (which is defined as termination of any faculty appointment and termina tion of employment for those faculty employed by the University [FT/U]) may include counseling as appropriate, verbal, and written warnings, written censure and a specified period of probation. If, in the judgment of the dean of the school and/or the pr esident, the continued activity of a faculty member is considered undesirable, he/she may be suspended from his/her University duties pending a hearing and the final decision of the Board of Trustees. Such interim suspension is without loss of salary until a final disposition is made by the Board of Trustees. Discipline may be initiated, depending on the circumstances, by a department chair, dean of school or his or her designee, or the president or his or her designee. Advice or counsel may be sought by the administrator from a standing or ad hoc committee of the school. The faculty member must be notified in writing by the initiator of the discipline proposed and given specific reasons for such action. He/she will be allowed to respond orally or in w riting to the administrator responsible for the action. Disciplinary action may be challenged by the faculty member through the grievance process. 2.7.3 Procedure for dismissal of faculty : Chapter 2 - Page 33 a. Recommendations for dismissal must include specific reasons for such action and may be presented by the department chair, the dean, the provost, the vice president for clinical faculty, or the president of the University. b. The dean will initiate the process by calling an informal meeting of the dean, the person providing the documentation, the faculty member subject to dismissal, and one other faculty member of the same school (not holding an administrative appointment) who may be selected by the faculty member who is subject to dismissal. The purpose of the informal meeting is to verify, explain or deny the charge(s) and to either resolve the charge(s) by mutual agreement or result in the dean's finding that the charge(s) lack support, or that the charge(s) are supported. The informal meeting will usually be held within ten working days of receipt of documentation of cause for dismissal. c. If the informal meeting fails to provide resolution, the dean submits the reco mmendation for dismissal to the president. The president will call a predismissal hearing usually within ten (10) working days and provide supporting documentation to a hearing committee as detailed under Faculty Grievance in Section 2.8 . The predismissal hearing will usually be held within ten (10) working days of receipt of the recommendation for dismissal by the president and will follow the same procedures as outlined under the Faculty Grievance Policy. d. After reviewing the supporting documentation, t he predismissal hearing committee may recommend dismissal, discipline, or withdrawal of the dismissal recommendation by the administrator. In the event of disagreement within the predismissal hearing committee, both majority and minority rationales and recommendations may be submitted. The rationale(s) and recommendation(s) of the predismissal hearing committee is/are reviewed by the president, ordinarily within ten (10) working days of receipt of the recommendation. If the recommendation of the predismi ssal hearing committee is for dismissal and the president finds the charge(s) supported, he or she shall send a written notice of recommendation to dismiss to the faculty member, effective as of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board or Executiv e Committee of the Board (\"Board\"). The faculty member shall be suspended from faculty duties until the case has been reviewed and acted upon by the Board. Income provided from the University to the faculty member will continue until Board action is comple ted. If the recommendation of the predismissal hearing committee is for discipline or withdrawal of the administrator's dismissal recommendation, the president and administrator may still determine that the charge(s) warrant dismissal. In this event, th e president will provide the predismissal hearing committee with a written statement of his/her rationale for proceeding with the dismissal contrary Chapter 2 - Page 34 to the recommendation of the committee. The president will ordinarily allow 10 working days for the predism issal hearing committee to respond to his/her rationale for dismissal before sending a written notice of recommendation to dismiss to the faculty member, effective as of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board. The faculty member shall be suspend ed from faculty duties until the case has been reviewed and acted upon by the Board. Income provided from the University to the faculty member will continue until Board action is completed. Irrespective of whether the final recommendations of the heari ng committee and the president are in concurrence regarding dismissal of the faculty member, the written rationales and recommendations of both the predismissal hearing committee and the president will be presented to the Board for final action. The Board also may invite the faculty member under review and/or the chair and/or some other member of the hearing committee to make oral presentation(s) to the full Board or to an ad hoc subcommittee of the Board. The faculty member under review may also make a wri tten appeal to the Board (see 2.8.11). If the predismissal hearing committee recommends discipline rather than dismissal and the president concurs, discipline will be assigned by the administrator who recommended dismissal, in consultation with the president. The faculty member may grieve the a dministratively assigned discipline. In this event, the predismissal hearing committee would usually also serve as the grievance hearing committee. The written rationales and recommendations of both the grievance hearing committee and the president will be presented to the Board if final action by the Board is required. If the predismissal hearing committee recommends withdrawal of the dismissal recommendation by the administrator and the president concurs, the process terminates. If the faculty member d isputes the decision of the Board about his/her dismissal or discipline, the sole procedure for formally resolving such disputes shall be binding arbitration (see Legal Recourse below). 2.7.4 Burden of persuasion The burden of persuading the predismiss al hearing committee that the proposed dismissal is proper rests upon the University and shall be satisfied only by substantial evidence. 2.7.5 Faculty who are dismissed under this policy are not eligible for severance pay. 2.8.0 Faculty Grievance 2.8.1 Definition. As a Christian institution, Loma Linda University is committed to internal resolution of disputes between faculty and administration. A faculty member should initiate the University's grievance procedure for any employment -related event, condition, rule or Chapter 2 - Page 35 practice involving the University which the faculty member believes to be improper or in conflict with the faculty member's civil rights. This procedure covers the full range of employment disputes, including those based on state and federal civil rights' laws, other state and federal statutes, torts and public policies, and those involving terminations. The purpose of the process, however, is not to review such operating decisions as the opening and closing of a school or program, adoption or modification of an academic curriculum, adoption or modification of University policies and practices, which are the proper subject of University governance procedures, or the review of administrative appointments or termination thereof, which appointments are made at the sole discretion of the Board of Trustees and administration. As used in this procedure, the term \"University\" includes all of its schools, related entities, faculty, employees, representatives, agents, trustees, as well as thei r successors and assigns. 2.8.2 Institution of proceedings and definitions a. For full -time or part -time faculty employed by the University. When reason arises for a full -time or part -time faculty member employed by the University, to question whether institutional error has occurred, regarding or relating to that faculty member's appointment or employment by the University, the aggrieved faculty member must file a grievance proceeding if he/she wants the alleged error redressed. b. For full -time or p art-time faculty not employed by the University. In some cases a faculty member, such as a geographic full -time faculty member, may hold a faculty appointment with the University while he/she is employed and compensated pursuant to a contract or employe e relationship with another organization. When reason arises for such a faculty member (not employed by the University) to question whether institutional error has occurred, or is about to occur, regarding or relating to that faculty member's appointment b y the University, the aggrieved faculty member must file a grievance proceeding under this University grievance policy if he/she wants the alleged error redressed. However, any issues relating specifically to the terms and conditions of his/her employment must be addressed through the procedures of the employing organization(s), and may not be addressed pursuant to this policy. In the event that there are issues that relate to both the University and the employing organization, they shall be addressed pursu ant to this University grievance policy and the employing organization shall have the right to participate as a party. c. For faculty employed by the University, who hold administrative positions in the University. Chapter 2 - Page 36 Faculty members, employed by the Uni versity, who hold administrative positions and thus serve in those positions at the pleasure of the Board of Trustees, president, or dean are specifically precluded from using the grievance process for changes in such administrative duties; however, change s in their faculty appointments or relating to their employment are covered by this policy. d. For faculty not employed by the University, but who hold administrative positions in the University. Faculty members, not employed by the University, who h old administrative positions and thus serve in those positions at the pleasure of the Board of Trustees, president, or dean are specifically precluded from using the grievance process for changes in such administrative duties; however, changes in their faculty appointments (but not relating to their employment) are covered by this policy. Any issues relating to the terms and conditions of their employment must be addressed through the procedures of the employing organization(s), and may not be addressed pur suant to this policy. 2.8.3 Filing the letter of intent In order to begin the process that eventually leads to a formal grievance hearing before a group of faculty peers, the faculty member must first file a letter informing the president or designee, with a copy to the dean or the appropriate administrator, of his/her intention to initiate the grievance process . The letter of intent must state the problem at issue, the error believed to have occurred, efforts made to resolve the conflict, and the lowest - ranking administrative officer able to resolve the proble m. To be timely, the letter of intent must be filed no later than 150 days from the date the action alleged to be an institutional error was communicated to the grievant except as extensions may be provided under the provisions of section 2.8.6. 2.8.4 Resolving the grievance prior to a grievance hearing During the period between the filing of the letter of intent and the formal filing of the grievance, the grievant may choose a faculty member to be his/her advisor throughout the rest of the process. M embers of the UFC are not eligible to serve as faculty advisors. All communication with administration, however, must be by the grievant. Both the administration and the grievant are encouraged to mediate the grievance at this stage. This mediation, looki ng toward resolution, shall begin with the lowest -ranking administrative officer and shall proceed successively as needed to higher levels. If requested by the involved parties, the president or designee shall appoint a mediator acceptable to both parties who is a faculty member of the University. Mediation shall consist of informal discussions between the administrator(s), the party, and the mediator with the goal of resolving the grievance. No records shall be kept of the discussion during mediation. If t he grievance is resolved to the satisfaction of the grievant through mediation, the grievant and the administration shall report this fact in writing to the president or designee, thus terminating the intent to file a formal grievance and resolving the gri evance. Chapter 2 - Page 37 If mediation has not led to resolution within a 45 -day period after filing the letter of intent, the grievant shall file the formal grievance with the president or designee. 2.8.5 Initiating the grievance hearing Formal proceedings for faculty grievance shall commence with the filing of a \"Statement of Grievance.\" A full -time faculty member, as defined in 2.1.1 of the Faculty Handbook , must file the grievance by submitting it in writing within 45 days of the submis sion of the letter of intent. The grievance shall be submitted to the president or designee who shall maintain the grievance records in a confidential and secure manner. If the aggrieved faculty member is unable to file the formal grievance within 45 days of filing the letter of intent, the faculty member may request, in writing before the expiration of the 45 -day period, a continuance of the filing date for an additional 30 days in the case of illness as documented to the president or designee. The statem ent of grievance shall specifically state the problem at issue, the error believed to have occurred, the reasons for believing so, the relief to which the grievant claims to be entitled, and the lowest -ranking administrative officer able to resolve the pro blem. The written statement shall contain any factual or other data the grievant deems pertinent to his/her case. All further discussions in the grievance process will relate to this statement. Amendments to this statement may only be made with the permiss ion of a simple majority of the grievance hearing committee. In preparing the statement of grievance, the grievant may find it useful to consult such sources as the following: The University Faculty and Administrative Handbooks Letters of appointment Correspondence Two or more persons with essentially the same grievance may file a single grievance. If an individual files a grievance, and it is later discovered that one or more others are similarly affected, the others may ask to join the original grievant at any stage of the grievance procedure. The faculty grievance panel may also combine the grievances of two or more persons into a single grievance with the assent of the grievants, if the panel finds that the grievances c an be combined without prejudice to the rights of any of the grievants. The president or designee shall forward the grievance to the chair of the faculty grievance panel, indicating that mediation has not been successful and requesting that a grievance he aring be held, that a hearing committee be formed, and that the hearing commence within 30 days. 2.8.6 The grievance panels: make -up and appointment Chapter 2 - Page 38 Two grievance panels exist as follows: faculty grievance panel for all faculty except the School of Me dicine clinical faculty and the School of Medicine clinical faculty grievance panel. The two panels are described below. a. The faculty grievance panel is a standing University body. Its membership is made up of at least 28 full -time faculty members of a ssistant professor rank or higher with a minimum of five years of full -time faculty experience at the University. It shall have at least three representatives each from the School of Allied Health Professions, School of Behavioral Health, School of Dentist ry, School of Medicine, School of Nursing, School of Pharmacy, School of Public Health, School of Religion, two representatives each from the faculty of the library, and six members -at-large chosen from the faculty of the University. An individual otherwis e qualified to serve on the faculty grievance panel shall not be disqualified from serving because he/she is a department chair or section chief. The University Faculty Council (UFC) shall nominate at least two eligible faculty for each vacant position an d the president will appoint the faculty grievance panel from among these nominations. Nominations and appointments shall be at annual intervals for a three -year term with approximately one -third of the members replaced each year. However, the panel member s shall continue to serve until their successors have been appointed. The President's Committee will select a slate of three names from the faculty grievance panel to serve as chair of the panel, from which the president selects the individual whom he/she appoints as chair. The chair will not be eligible to serve on a grievance hearing committee. b. The School of Medicine clinical faculty grievance panel is a standing University body. Its membership is made up of at least 21 full -time clinical faculty mem bers of assistant professor rank or higher with a minimum of five years of full -time faculty experience at the University. It shall have at least three representatives from clinical faculty who hold full -time appointments at the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Ve terans Hospital. This panel shall hear grievances brought by full - time or geographic full -time clinical faculty members of the School of Medicine who are employed by organizations/groups other than Loma Linda University. Nominees (two for each vacant position) on the clinical faculty grievance panel shall be made by the Clinical Science Faculty Advisory Council; the president, in collaboration with the vice president for clinical faculty and the dean of the School of Medicine, will appoint the faculty grievance panel from these nominations. Nominations and appointments shall be at annual intervals for a three -year term with approximately one -third of the members replaced each year. However, the panel members shall continue to serve until their successor s have been appointed. The President's Committee will select a slate of three names from the clinical faculty grievance panel to serve as chair of the panel, from which the president selects the individual whom he/she appoints as chair. The chair will not be eligible to serve on a grievance hearing committee. Chapter 2 - Page 39 c. The grievant may petition the appropriate grievance panel to extend the time limit allowed for filing a letter of intent for a maximum of thirty (30) additional days. Should a two -thirds majority of the grievance panel consider the petition to have merit, the chair will communicate their rationale to the president who will, within ten (10) working days, determine whether the extension shall be granted. The decision of the president shall be final. The chair of the grievance panel shall be responsible for the education of the members of the grievance panel and the grievant about the grievance process. 2.8.7 The hearing committee A grievance hearing committee consists of five members selected f rom the grievance panel. After receiving a request for grievance, the president or designee, in consultation with the grievant, and the chair of the grievance panel, shall set the time and place of the hearing, giving at least 30 days' notice to the involv ed parties and the committee members. The president or designee shall send the grievant a list of a minimum of 10 committee members selected by the grievance panel chair on the basis of lack of conflict of interest and availability to serve on the hearing committee. If possible, at least 2 of the 10 members shall have had prior service on a hearing board and, where possible, 2 shall be from the school where the grievant has a primary faculty appointment. No faculty member may serve on the hearing committee who is in conflict of interest as asserted by any involved party and as determined by the majority vote of the president or designee, the chair of the UFC, and either the chair of the University grievance panel or the chair of the School of Medicine clinic al faculty grievance panel. Examples of committee members who would be in conflict of interest would include those with prior involvement in formal decision making related to the issues of the grievance, personal relationship with the grievant or involved administrators (including being from the same department or being directly related to any of the involved parties), or having a financial relationship with any of the involved parties. The grievant shall designate 3 preferred members, one of which must ha ve a primary appointment in the same school as the grievant's primary appointment. The president or designee shall select 2 from the remaining members and wherever possible 1 of these shall have a primary appointment in the same school as the grievant. The hearing committee chair shall be appointed by the chair of the faculty grievance panel. If a grievant fails to designate, in part or whole, his/her selections for the grievance hearing committee within 14 days, the chair of the relevant grievance panel s hall appoint from among the 10 persons submitted to the grievant sufficient persons to constitute a hearing committee of 5 members. The chair of the hearing committee shall be appointed by the chair of the relevant grievance panel. If any person designated for appointment to a hearing committee by a grievant is unavailable or unwilling to serve, the chair of the relevant grievance panel, in consultation with the grievant, shall designate one of the remaining grievance panel members who does not have a confl ict of interest to serve. Again, in this selection process, wherever possible, 2 of the 5 members shall hold primary appointments in the same school as the grievant. Service as a mediator or member of a grievance hearing committee is within the course and scope of the employment of the Chapter 2 - Page 40 participating faculty member for the purposes of the indemnification provision of Article XIII of the University's corporate bylaws. 2.8.8 Burden of persuasion The burden of persuading the hearing committee that the acti ons or inactions of the University were not proper rests upon the grievant and shall be satisfied only by clear and convincing evidence that the institution was in error. 2.8.9 Order of hearing The grievant and the involved administrator(s) shall each submit a list of witnesses to the hearing committee chair at least seven working days prior to the hearing. The chair shall send a description of the order of the hearing to both the grievant and administrator three working days before the hearing to assi st them in preparation. 2.8.10 Hearing procedure It is the responsibility of the hearing committee chair to have a recording of the hearing made and kept securely. Should the grievant or the administration wish to have a certified shorthand reporter present, the party requesting the reporter will be solely responsible for the expenses associated with such service and shall provide the other parties with a certified copy of the transcript. The hearing committee chair will be responsible to keep the res ulting record secure. During the hearing process, the hearing record is to be made available upon request only to the hearing committee, the involved administrator, and the grievant. The chair of the hearing committee shall have sole discretion for determi ning all procedural issues not specifically discussed herein. Subsequent to the completion of the grievance process, the faculty member or administrator may request a recording of the hearing phase but not of the deliberation phase of the grievance proces s. The grievant, his/her advisor, and the involved administrator(s) shall have the opportunity to be present and participate during all argument and presentation of evidence. Each party shall have the right to confront and question the witnesses of the oth er. Witnesses are to be present only when testifying or responding to questions. Technical rules of evidence are not applicable. However, the grievant and the involved administrator(s) may submit oral, written, or documentary evidence or argument, and may inspect written and documentary evidence offered by either party. The faculty member may make an opening statement followed by an opening statement by the administration. The chair of the hearing committee shall set the order of the presentation of eviden ce and, upon notifying all parties, may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence or argument and at all times shall have final authority to conduct the hearing. The grievant and administration shall each have four hours to present their arguments and question witnesses. If possible, the hearing should be completed in one day. These times may be extended at the sole discretion of a two -thirds majority of the hearing committee. At the conclusion of the hearing, the grievant , followed by the involved administrator, shall be accorded time for a summation. Chapter 2 - Page 41 Cancellation of scheduled hearings shall be available only upon documentation of hardship. Although either party may consult an attorney outside of the grievance process, attorneys are not permitted t o be present at the hearing, to submit written arguments, or to intervene in the process in any manner. Violation of this policy, at the discretion of the hearing committee, may result in termination of the hearings and referral of this information to the president for further processing. The hearing committee shall cooperate to help the grievant obtain relevant, non - proprietary, non -privileged evidence which the committee considers pertinent, or witnesses which the committee considers germane, but the Uni versity has no obligation to incur expenses for this purpose. It is the role and duty of witnesses to testify to the relevant facts which are true of their personal knowledge. All witnesses shall be protected against retaliation for their truthful testimon y and persons interfering with and retaliating against any witnesses shall be subject to University discipline. The hearing committee ordinarily shall complete its hearing within ninety (90) days of the date the hearing is requested by the grievant. There shall be no disclosure by the hearing committee or any of its members of the evidence received during the hearing, nor of the deliberations of the hearing committee except as provided in the next paragraph. 2.8.11 Findings, recommendations, and decision At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing committee shall deliberate privately to reach its findings. As promptly as is consistent with due deliberation, and normally within fourteen (14) days, the hearing committee shall submit its findings in wri ting. The findings of fact by the hearing committee and the decision by the president shall be based solely on evidence in the hearing record which is given probative weight by individuals of reasonable intelligence in the course of everyday affairs, and s hall be directed to the grounds for grievance as defined in the Statement of Grievance. The findings shall summarize the evidence and state whether the burden of persuasion is met as set forth in section 8. The hearing committee shall be a fact -finding committee and its findings shall be advisory only and shall not be binding on the parties or the University president. The findings shall be provided to both parties prior to being submitted to the president. Within seven (7) days, each party may append to the findings a brief statement provided by them to the chair of the hearing committee. Within 10 working days thereafter, a copy of the findings, with the parties' statements attached, together with all documentary evidence, shall be given to the preside nt of the University and to both parties. Any recording of the hearing shall be kept for at least five years, after which it can be erased or destroyed at the discretion of the president. A copy of any recording of the hearing shall be made for either par ty at its request. In addition, with a responsible member of the University present, either party may, at any Chapter 2 - Page 42 time before any recording of the hearing is destroyed, read or listen to the original at a time and place that is set by the president or designee . The president's decision shall be made within 30 days following receipt of the findings. If the president questions the findings of the hearing committee, the president shall consult with the hearing committee regarding those questions and shall provide an opportunity for response by the hearing committee before reaching a final decision. If the president finally decides to reject all or part of the findings of the hearing committee, the president shall state in writing, as part of his/her final decision , reasons for rejecting all or part of the findings and for rendering a different decision. The president's decision shall be made known in writing to the Board of Trustees with notification to the grievant, the administrative officer against whom the grie vance was filed, and the chair of the hearing committee. If the grievant decides to protest the decision of the president of the University, he/she shall, within 14 days of notification of this decision, make a written appeal to the Board of Trustees. The grievant is accorded a hearing by a committee of not less than three trustees appointed by the chair of the Board of Trustees which committee shall report its recommendations to the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees' decision shall be final and bin ding on both the grievant and University. 2.9.0 Legal recourse 2.9.1 Introduction If a faculty member disputes the decision of the Board of Trustees about his/her faculty grievance, arbitration shall be the exclusive remedy for resolving any such arb itrable disputes and the decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on all parties. a. Specifically, arbitrable disputes are those that: (1) had been timely initiated and processed through the University's grievance procedure, and (2) were not resolved through the University's grievance procedure, and (3) arose out of or are related to an employment dispute as defined in Faculty Grievance. b. Any arbitration pursuant to this procedure shall be governed by the arbitration procedure described below, the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") and the Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services (\"JAMS\") Arbitration Rules and Procedures for Employment Disputes in effect at the time. The FAA and JAMS rules are kept on file in the office of the prov ost and the faculty member will be given a copy upon request. Chapter 2 - Page 43 c. The rights of the parties under this procedure are the same as those available to them in a court of competent jurisdiction except to the extent that those rights are contrary to the provis ions of this procedure. d. If the applicable statute of limitations provides a longer period of time in which to initiate a claim, the grievance will be considered timely if the employee initiates the grievance and arbitration procedure within the period of time allowed by that statute of limitations and, thereafter, follows the steps of the procedure in a timely manner. 2.9.2 Binding arbitration procedure a. The arbitration of the grievance shall be conducted before an impartial professional arbitra tor provided: (1) That the grievant requests arbitration in writing within 30 calendar days of date of the Board of Trustee's written decision. (2) Within 21 calendar days of receipt of a written request to arbitrate, the parties shall select an arbi trator. The parties should attempt to agree on any retired judge affiliated with JAMS to serve as an arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree, JAMS will provide a list of three available judges. The employee shall strike one name, then the University shall strike one name, and the remaining judge shall serve as an arbitrator. b. The arbitration hearing shall be held at a time agreed upon by the grievant, the University and the arbitrator but shall commence not later than 60 days after the selection of the arbitrator unless continued for the reason stated in 2d below. The arbitrator shall have the authority to call witnesses and hear relevant testimony under oath. The arbitrator shall render his/her opinion orally at the close of the hearing. This awa rd shall be final and binding as to both the grievant and the University. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award only such remedies as could be awarded by a court under the applicable substantive law. The arbitrator shall not have the authority t o make an opinion or award which has the effect of altering, amending, ignoring, adding to, or subtracting from existing University policies and practices. c. The grievant and the University each may file a pre -hearing statement of facts and position wit h the arbitrator. However, post -hearing briefs shall not be permitted. d. The grievant and/or the University may elect to be represented by legal counsel in the arbitration. The expense of such counsel shall be the sole responsibility of the party engag ing counsel, and shall not be apportioned as provided in paragraph 2e below. A party intending to use legal counsel shall give the other party written notice of the intent to use counsel 15 days before the hearing. The party receiving this notice may also use legal counsel at the hearing. In the event that a party or counsel needs additional time in which to prepare for the hearing, Chapter 2 - Page 44 the party may request the arbitrator to continue the hearing date for a period not to exceed 30 days. e. Arbitration is inte nded to provide a less time -consuming, less expensive, and less complicated means of settling employment -related disputes. Therefore, discovery will be allowed only to the extent that it is necessary and appropriate as determined by the arbitrator. However , under no circumstances, will discovery be permitted that is broader than that which is allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Arbitrator may issue subpoenas to compel the testimony of third party witnesses or the production of documents. At a minimum, each party shall have the right to take one deposition. f. The University and the grievant shall each pay one -half of the arbitrator's fee. Any party desiring a transcript of the hearing or a written opinion shall pay the fee for that servi ce. g. In the event that any paragraph, or provision within a paragraph of this grievance and arbitration procedure is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining paragra phs, or provisions within a paragraph, all of which shall remain in force or effect. 2.10 Prohibiting Sexual Misconduct and Discrimination of the Basis of Sex (Title IX) See separate Title IX policy .

Because of the commitment to the complementary relation of science and scripture, the University is also dedicated to research and dissemination of knowledge in the Christian faith. The Board of Trustees expects that, in thi s pursuit and dissemination of knowledge, faculty and students will respect the current statement of fundamental beliefs of the Seventh -day Adventist church. Loma Linda University subscribes to the following concepts relating to academic freedom: a. Facu lty members have full freedom to pursue study and research germane to their interests, and to that of their academic appointment, and to publish the results of their research (see research policies). b. Faculty members are entitled to freedom in the class room in discussing the subject they have been appointed to teach but should avoid discussing controversial matters as an expert when unqualified. c. Faculty members are advised to consult with the Loma Linda University Research Affairs and inform Loma Linda University Health (LLUH) office of advancement of presentations or publication of results that may have an impact on the public perception of the h ealth -care practices of LLUH. d. When speaking as private citizens, faculty members must make every effort to state that they are not speaking as spokespersons of the University. Society expects restraint and self-discipline from the faculty of a church -related university. The University faculty member enjoys a status and authority among Seventh -day Adventists that demands responsibility in any statement of ideas by the faculty member, especially in issues of controversy and sensitivity that affect the ch urch. A faculty member who believes his/her academic freedom has been violated in a way that has affected the terms of his/her appointment and/or employment has recourse to the grievance procedures (described in Faculty Appointments, Faculty Handbook , Chapter 2). 3.2.0 Academic responsibility Academic responsibility includes honesty, differentiation between evidence and conclusions, willingness to re -examine conclusions, openness to new evidence, and respect for those of differing viewpoints. The grea test breach of academic responsibility is misrepresentation, either by intent or by failure to investigate sufficiently. Additional examples of failure to exercise academic responsibility on the part of a faculty member include: a. Academic or profession al conduct that brings discredit to the institution, to an academic discipline, or to an individual in a manner that is illegal, unethical, or violative of individual or institutional rights and process, as defined in University policy. b. Using position and authority to persuade, rather than presenting convincing evidence. Chapter 3 - Page 7 c. Any action that infringes on the academic freedom of others to teach, to research, to question or to test hypotheses. d. Disregard of the confidentiality of privileged informatio n obtained from patients and their records, students and their records, administrative committees, faculty records, subjects, etc. The University has a responsibility to deal justly, kindly and cautiously when confronted with instances of apparent academic irresponsibility, but also has an obligation to intervene quickly when academic irresponsibility appears to have occurred. 3.3.0 Responsibilities of faculty The faculty member's responsibility encompasses education, assessment, research, and/or service. The faculty member is responsible to the department chair in meeting the needs of the school and the University. The faculty member demonstrates loyalty to the mission, policies, standards, and regulations of his/her department, school, and the University, and follows the administrative policies set up by the University and the individual school. The faculty member participate s in the University's culture of assessment processes including identification, collection, preparation and use of data that can be used to evaluate and improve student learning. Assessment encompasses two purposes: (1) student assessment for an individual improvement, and (2) student assessment for measuring learning efficacy, curriculum changes and program improvements. 3.3.1 Faculty workload Each school shall develop and adopt a faculty workload policy appropriate to its various programs and faculty. Such a policy shall serve as the basis of agreement between faculty members and their respective department chair, division head, or dean as to expected workload. The policy shall make provision for an annual review of faculty jointly with faculty members and department chair, division head, or dean. School faculty workload policies shall take into consideration educational (including clinical and administrative), assessment, research, and service activities. a. Teaching workload consideration shall be given for formal instruction of students, including number of classes taught, lectures given, time for class preparation, development of new courses or lectures, evaluation procedures (grading, examinations, observations). Other activities, including re search advising, supervising directed study, student advisement, student counseling, and recruitment are also to be factored into the educational workload. Clinical education in the care of ambulatory and/or inpatients may also be part of the educational w orkload. Chapter 3 - Page 8 b. Assessment workload consideration will be given for programmatic assessment and review and/or accreditation duties, etc. c. Research and scholarly workload consideration will be given for both basic and applied research and scholarly activit ies. Specific consideration will be given to the amount of time designated to the faculty for research as well as the assignment of institutional resources, including intramural funds, technical assistance, supplies, and laboratory space. Please refer to t he Sabbath policy for the conduct of appropriate Sabbath activities regarding research and scholarly presentations during Sabbath hours. d. Service workload consideration will be given for professional service rendered, specifically the quantity and scop e of the clinical responsibilities and the time allocated for these activities. Institutional service, including committee assignments at the division, department, school, or University level, shall be reckoned as part of the service workload. Assigned adm inistrative responsibilities are also viewed as part of service workload. Community service, consultations, church and international services, are included in this category if administratively assigned. 3.3.2 Educational responsibilities a. Curriculum: Contribute toward curriculum development by keeping informed of changes in their discipline or area of specialization and by communicating their ideas either as a member of their school's curriculum or to their department's representative on that committee .

Internal and external activities resulting from such professional interest are subject to stated limits set by the University to maintain a balance of competing interests. Full -time faculty members (FT/U), after obtaining written ap proval from their dean, may engage in extra income -producing professional activities which do not raise questions of conflict of interest. (See Conflict of Interest policy, section 3.3.11.) a. Responsibility for the application of policies regarding prof essional outside activities and for the integrity and significance of each extramural project rests primarily upon the individual faculty member. Chapter 3 - Page 12 b. Criteria taken into consideration before approval of income -producing professional activities is granted: (1) The outside activity is necessary for recertification, for retention and improvement of clinical skills, or for continuing education requirement s. (2) The outside activity will increase the teaching or scholarly competence of the faculty member or be of service to the larger community. The University encourages activity which is consistent with the faculty member's responsibilities of teaching, academic advisement, and research. (3) The outside activity will be secondary and will not encroach on the faculty member's responsibilities of teaching, academic advisement, and research. (4) The activity undertaken will not detract from the Universit y's prestige nor from the professional standing of the faculty member c. Application is made on the appropriate form to the department chair, whose recommendation is forwarded to the dean. A separate application is required for each extramural activity p roposed. d. An annual report to the dean is made on the appropriate standard form used by all schools of the University. All income -producing professional activities are to be included in the report, such as honoraria for lectures or general speaking appo intments; site visits; consulting services to federal, state, or local government agencies or the Seventh -day Adventist church; number of days spent in the outside activities; any financial interest the faculty member may have in the organization involved, etc. e. A faculty member may not accept an official teaching appointment at another institution without permission of the dean or department chair. f. University stationery and address may only be used for LLU activities. g. University equipment, supplies, or facilities may be used on external income - producing activities only by permission of the dean or department chair. h. A faculty member may serve in another school of the University within the following guidelines: (1) The dean of a school requesting the teaching services of a faculty member employed by another school obtains clearance of the dean from the school where the faculty member is employed and also of the office of the president. Chapter 3 - Page 13 (2) Remuneration, if any, is negotiable and is paid to the school where the faculty member has primary appointment which in turn may reimburse the faculty member if the teaching is above the faculty member's workload and is so approved by the department chair. i. The faculty member may tutor students for pay under the following guidelines: (1) The full -time faculty member may not tutor for pay students from their own classes or from any classes in his/her own department. (2) The full -time faculty member may not tutor for pay any student of the University without the knowledge and consent of the student's department chair and dean. j. During leave of absence or a sabbatical with pay, the faculty is subject to these provisions. k. No approval is necessary for professional outside activities during vacation times in the academic calendar year. l. Employees will be covered by the Loma Linda University Health Plan while doing other paid work if the work is approved by the dean. Injur ies suffered during unusually hazardous activities will be covered only if prior approval is obtained through the travel management approval system (see Risk Management Office ). m. The practice of one's clinical profession will carry no professional liab ility insurance unless formally approved by the dean of the school of primary appointment and by the office of risk management. n. Clinical practice sites other than approved extramural teaching facilities must be formally approved by the dean of the sch ool in which the faculty member holds a primary appointment. o. If a faculty member violates these policies, he/she may be subject to disciplinary action and/or legal action by the University (see Discipline and Dismissal, Faculty Handbook , Chapter 2). 3.3.10 Faculty shall comply with the Corporate Compliance Program 3.3.11 Conflicts of Interest 3.3.12. Disputes between faculty members As a Christian institution, Loma Linda University is committed to internal resolution of disputes between faculty. It is the desire of the University that faculty informally resolve disputes between each other in a collegial and scholarly manner (unless so precluded by other Faculty Handbook policies).In the event that this proves impossible, the following Chapter 3 - Page 14 steps are to be followed: a. Mediation by department chair(s). The department chair(s) attempts to mediat e the dispute informally. If this is not successful then the dispute must be brought to step 12b below. If the dispute involves a department chair and a faculty member or faculty members across schools, the dean of the school(s) attempts to mediate the dis pute informally. If this is not successful then the dean will proceed to step 12b below: b. Review by dean(s). The department chair(s) brings the problem to the attention of the dean(s) of the school(s) in which the faculty members hold their primary appointment(s). The dean(s) of the school(s) may attempt to mediate the dispute informally, including the use of the Employee Assistance Program, as may be appropriate. The decision of the dean shall be final. 3.4.0 Research 3.4.1 Responsibilities of fac ulty toward research A major objective of Loma Linda University Health (LLUH) is to serve the people of the world through basic and applied research in the biomedical, behavioral, and environmental sciences and in other related areas. Faculty members enga ging in research expand the knowledge of their academic disciplines, and thus contribute to advances in technology, medicine, and whole person care. This enhances the general scientific community, as well as the institution's intellectual and professional stature and its reputation for patient care and treatment. Faculty members are expected to view research as complementary to their other professional responsibilities. Faculty involved in research contribute to an atmosphere of intellectual challenge by s haring research results with their colleagues and students. By involving students in research, faculty encourage creativity, provide opportunities to learn experimental techniques, and serve as role models for future investigators. 3.4.2 Research Administ ration / Oversight The vice president for research affairs (VPRA) oversees the institution's research activities, in consultation with the Research Oversight Committee (ROC). The LLUH President chairs the ROC, which provides advice in areas related to fi nancial management, infrastructure, and strategic goals for research at LLUH. The VPRA is responsible for the oversight, promotion, and development of research. Further, the VPRA is responsible for coordinating research through the activities of the Research Affairs Administration, Human Research and Compliance, Industrial Relations , Pre and Post Award, and the Animal Care Facility. The VPRA maintains liaisons with the Office of the General Counsel, Information Services, University Libraries, Public Relations, Philanthropy, and Clinical Trial Center, as they provide resources for r esearch.

(See Handbook for HRPP .) LLUH acknowledges its responsibili ty for protecting the rights and welfare of human subjects in research and grants the Institutional Official (IO) the authority of developing and maintaining a Human Research Protection Program (HRPP). (See Handbook for HRPP .) The IO has the necessary resources to accomplish the responsibilities conferred by institutional policies and as outlined in federal and state laws, regulations and guidance. (See Institutional Official for Human Subject Research .) LLUH grants the Institutional Review Board (IRB) independent author ity to review all human subject research for adherence to ethical, scientific, regulatory, and institutional standards. (See Authority and Independence of the IRB .) The IRB also se rves as the LLUH Privacy Board for the approval of waivers of authorization or other action in accord with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The IRB shall review all human subject research conducted under the jurisdiction of LLUH or utilizing its resources, wheth er supported by outside funds or not. (See Review Level - Initial Submissions of Human Subject Research .) IRB review and approval must be obtained prior to starting such research. An IRB -approved protocol must be in place prior to the use of any drug, biologic, or device in humans that does not have FDA approval for such use with humans. All activities involving human subject research or medical experiments shall follow federal and state requirements. (See Determination of Human Subject Research .) The IRB is composed of members from diverse backgrounds and professions sufficient to promote complete and ad equate review of all human studies. (See IRB Membership .) The conduct of convened IRB meetings is guided by LLUH policy. Chapter 3 - Page 18 The primary responsibility of the IRB is the review of all research activities involving humans to assure that: a. The risks to the subject are outweighed by the possible benefit to the subject or the importance of the knowledge to be gained for humanity. b. The rights and welfare of each subject will be adequately protected. The investigator will make the determination of whether an activity is human subject research at the direction of the institution, in accord with institutiona l procedures. (See Determination of Human Subject Research .) c. Informed consent is obtained by adequate and appropriate means. The authority of the IO and the IRB at LLUH is affirmed in the institution's Federal -Wide Assurance (FWA#00006447) and IRB Registration (IORG #0000226) with the U.S. Office for Human Research Protections. The title of Principal Investigator (PI) designates the person who is responsible for all as pects of a research activity and is held solely responsible for ethical and professional conduct of the research and safety of research personnel and human subjects. Any person holding an appropriate faculty appointment at or above the level of Assista nt Professor or serving as an officer of the institution is eligible to be a PI. For exceptions, see Principal Investigator Eligibility . The Principal Investigator's department c hair shall ensure that the scientific or scholarly validity of all proposed human subject research has been reviewed prior to submission to the IRB. (See Review Level - Initial Subm issions of Human Subject Research .) PIs seeking to conduct clinical trials are assisted by the Clinical Trial Center with Medicare coverage and billing analysis, budget development and Industrial Relations, financial accounting and oversight. CTC will ensure that these and other clinical trial services are coordinated with IRB for review and approval. Other policies and guidance for investigators planning to conduct human subject research are provided under policies and procedures in the Research Affairs website. 3.4.5 Research using ani mals The animal care and use program at LLUH is managed in accord with the Animal Welfare Act (Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations Subchapter A, Animal Welfare Parts 1 - 3), the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The program is fully accredited by the AAALAC International since August 3, 1966. Chapter 3 - Page 19 LLUH has established the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which has the responsibility to revie w modifications and approve all applications to use vertebrate animals by LLUH investigators, or performed in LLUH facilities. (Refer to NIH - Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare .) LLUH places a high priority on the ethical use of animals and expects those who use animals be knowledgeable of applicable laws, regulations, policies, and best practices. The Institutional Official for the animal care and use program is assisted by the IACUC to ensure the responsible cond uct of animal use. (See the Manual for Those Who Use Animals .) The principal investigator (PI) is responsible for submitting the research protocol and making changes to protocol activities. Prior IACUC approval is required for using animals and for all procedures performed on the animals. The PI must refine experiments to minimize pain and distress, reduce the number of animals used to the minimum n ecessary to obtain valid data, and must consider replacing animals with non - animal models or less sentient alternatives. (See Guide for the Care and Us e of Laboratory Animals .) All LLUH personnel shall promptly report any concerns involving the care and use of animals and any suspected non -compliance to the Campus Veterinarian at x44316 or the IACUC Chair at x45307. In addition to the above listed ind ividuals, reporting individuals may anonymously contact the 24 -Hour Research Compliance Hotline at 800 -249-9953. By law, the employer cannot retaliate for \"whistle blowing\" if the employee has probable cause for a concern. (See Animal Welfare Protection: Reporting Concerns .) 3.4.6 Research involving ionizing radiation (radioactive materials, radiation -generating equipment), n on-ionizing radiation (electric fields, magnetic fields, RF, microwaves), or lasers LLUH is guided by the Radiation Safety Committee whose main purpose is to maintain compliance with the state -issued institutional radioactive material license, the State and Federal laws, and to assure safe use of radiation at LLUH. a. Investigators developing protocols involving the use of ionizing radiation, non - ionizing radiation or lasers must contact the Office of Radiation Safety (ORS). ORS will determine if Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) review is required. ORS can also provide information on radiation doses from various types of procedures and appropriate radiation informed consent statements. Questions should be directed to the ORS at (909) 651 -4003 or extension 14 003. b. Members of the Radiation Safety Committee are LLUH faculty and staff appointed by the administration and approved, when appropriate, by the California Department of Public Health -Radiologic Health Branch and the FDA. Chapter 3 - Page 20 3.4.7 Institutional Biosafety Committee The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) must review and approve all projects involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules according to NIH Guidelines, infectious agents, or other potentially biohazardous materials, whether exem pt from federal regulation or not. Projects that involve recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules techniques and/or the use of potentially infectious materials must be reported to the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). The IBC reviews resear ch that includes: Recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules Plasmids and transposons Viruses and viral vectors Human and non -human primate or sheep cells, tissues and fluids Prions Bacteria Yeast Fungi Toxins All pathogens and select agents Gene Editing using CRISPR Nanoparticles Research associated with the use of these materials must comply with the NIH Guidelines and must be reviewed and approved by the IBC regardless of the source of funding. The NIH Guidelines provide information defining the biosafety level of the proposed research based on a clearly delineated classification system. The Principal Investigator of the laboratory is responsible for ensuring compliance with the policies, practices and procedures documented in the federal guidelines. The PI is responsible for ensuring that a safe work environment is maintained and appropriate personnel training is provided prior to initiation of the experiment. IBC applicati on forms are available online and must be submitted and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee prior to initiating the research project. The committee meets monthly. The outcome of the review will be communicated to the PI shortly thereafter b y email. If there is a component of the research project that requires review by several committees, IBC review must be secured prior to obtaining final approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Stem Cell Research Oversight Comm ittee (SCRO) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. The mission of the IBC is to ensure that research is conducted within existing guidelines, which are designed to protect the safety of laboratory staff, the public, and the environment. The IBC r eports directly to the vice president for research affairs. 3.4.8 Embryonic Stem Cell Committee Chapter 3 - Page 21 Human embryonic stem cells possess two unique properties that are distinct from most cells in the human body: they can replicate indefinitely under suitable conditions and they are capable of becoming any type of cell found in the body when stimulated by appropriate biochemical signals. These characteristics suggest that they may be used to repair any tissue or organ that has been damaged. These properties hav e generated considerable scientific interest since the discovery of human embryonic stem cells in 1998. At the same time, they also raise significant ethical concerns: they are usually obtained from early human embryos using procedures that end the viabil ity of the embryos. Consequently, LLUH has adopted guidelines for the creation, study and use of human embryonic stem cells. (See Stem Cell Research .) 3.4.9 Research equipment The purchase of equipment with sponsored funds may be initiated only when the equipment is necessary for a sponsored project and is not reasonably available or accessible elsewhere. At the completion of a project, equipment becomes the property of the institution unless otherwise stated in the award terms and conditions or sponsor regulations. Terms and conditions of the sponsored project must be followed regarding the disposition, loan, sale or transfer of equipment purchased with spon sored project funds. Refer to the LLUH policy on Research Equipment for additional information. 3.4.10 Export Control LLUH is committed to complying with U.S. export control laws and regulations that stipulate the conditions under which certain information, technologies, and commodities may be transmitted to a foreign country, or to a foreign national on U.S. soil.

Additional, individual s chool policies may apply. 3.7.1 Eligibility and Application for advanced education A faculty member, under the following specifications, may be eligible to receive reimbursement for certain expenses incurred in earning the doctoral degree. Chapter 3 - Page 32 a. Eligibi lity (1) The faculty member is a full -time University employee. (2) Ordinarily, a faculty member with rank above instructor does not pursue a degree from Loma Linda University. In unusual circumstances this may be done with the approval of the deans of the schools involved. (3) The processing of an advanced education reimbu rsement agreement form through the dean is required if the leave is for six months or longer. (4) Reimbursement has been approved by the office of the president prior to negotiations for employment by the University. (5) The doctoral degree was earned entirel y at the expense of the faculty member within a reasonable time, as determined by each school, prior to date of employment by the University. (6) Financial support in the form of salary received while doctoral studies were pursued assumes that the faculty me mber did not earn the degree entirely at their own expense and thus the faculty member would be ineligible for further University reimbursement. (7) The dean of a school is responsible for recording in the President's Committee minutes the return from leave or the termination of a program of advanced education. 3.7.2 Reimbursement a. Reimbursement is not made until after the degree has been conferred. b. Reimbursement at the current authorized rate covers educational expenses such as tuition and fees pl us living costs. c. Reimbursement may be made in a single payment, or in 20 percent annual installments over a five -year period. If the reimbursement is made as a single payment, it will be amortized over a five -year period beginning with the date of University employment. Should the recipient leave University employment before the five -year period is completed, the unamortized balance is to be repaid. 3.7.3 Agreements and finances for advanced study This policy applies only to those faculty who are employed by the University (FT/U); faculty employed by other entities are governed by the terms and conditions of their employing entity. Chapter 3 - Page 33 A faculty member or prospective appointee whose study leave is app roved by the Board of Trustees receives as an allowance an amount covering up to a maximum of the following: a. Full salary and regular allowance appropriate to the rank they hold at the time the leave is granted, or if they are without rank, the rank to which they would be entitled within school policy at the time the leave is granted. b. Tuition and travel expenses for him/her to and returning from the college or university in which the study is authorized. The expense of moving household goods is the responsibility of the faculty member or appointee. A faculty or staff member who has been authorized to pursue advanced study at a nearby institution may be reimbursed for mileage to and from the college or university at a reduced rate or a portion of the expenses for a second domicile (70 percent of mileage). c. The actual cost of essential textbooks as approved by the dean of the school. d. Health and compensation insurance for the appointee who is eligible for this. e. Special allowance of up to one-half of the University per diem allowance when separated from her/his family, thus increasing the family's living expense. 3.7.4 Written contract A written contract is entered into with the University by means of an Advanced Education Reimbursement Agreement, in which the faculty member or prospective appointee agrees to subsequently serve the University. Should another institution request their employment prior to the completion of the amortization, it assumes liability for payment of the unamortiz ed balance. Each quarter of full -time study support will be amortized by four quarters of service to the University while each quarter of half -time study support will be amortized by two quarters of service, up to a maximum of five years. Each quarter of s upport for faculty who also continue to work full -time while studying will be amortized by one quarter of service, up to a maximum of five years. The amortization period will be prorated for part -time faculty. Programs for amortization of other levels an d types of support may be approved by the dean of a school in accord with the spirit of the foregoing plans. The faculty member continues in the same scale in rank and salary bracket during the time of their study leave. Arrangements for intramural education (at Loma Linda University) are on the same basis as extramural, including the negotiation of the written Agreement, except that the department or school in which the faculty member enrolls receives credit for tuition a nd fees. 3.7.5 Reimbursements of expense for advanced degrees Chapter 3 - Page 34 The expenses of the advanced education, including salary, less any grants -in-aid, are charged to graduate study accounts receivable. All study leave expenses covered by policy are reported on the regular expense report form, recorded as part of the advanced education reimbursement agreement. When the advanced degree is earned or at such time as the faculty member or prospective appointee declares in writing to the dean of the school that he no longer is a candidate for the degree, the amortization of the receivable will start according to policy. At the conclusion of the study leave, the faculty member or prospective appointee provides an itemized list of expenses incurred during the leave and agrees on a total amount to be amortized. Amortization is at the rate of 20 percent per year or as adjusted by the school administration depending on the amount of indebtedness. (Department budgets should include the amount of amortization.) If a facult y member fails to render service for the full period of amortization, the dean notifies the senior vice president for financial affairs who arranges for payment of the unamortized balanced of the account. Interest is charged after discontinuation at a rate stipulated in the Agreement until the account has been settled. Should the University discontinue for cause the employment of the faculty member or prospective appointee before the total sums advanced have been amortized or change the plan for employmen t in a manner so unacceptable to the person involved as to cause them to resign from the position which has been offered to them, the faculty member or prospective appointee is responsible to reimburse the University for the unamortized balance at a rate s tipulated in the agreement until the account has been settled. 3.7.6 Grants for advanced education If LLU sends a trainee for further education and they receive tuition and/or living stipend from their training institution, LLU is to be notified of sai d support and adjustments will be made to the coverage by LLU. The grant is assessed at the prevailing rate to cover payments to Social Security and to the retirement fund. 3.7.7 Budget provision Plans for advanced education for which budgetary provisi on is needed are included in the general budget of the school for each fiscal year that such expense is to be met, and official approval, as far as possible, is obtained before the beginning of the fiscal year in which the leave is to be effective. Inclusi on in the budget does not in itself constitute official approval of the plan, and no commitments are made to a teacher concerning educational plans until official approval has been obtained. 3.7.8 Retirement service credit a. Service credit, available only to those full -time faculty who are in University employ [FT/U: Group A], toward retirement accumulates during a University supported or nonsupported leave for study. Upon return to the University, credit is given up to a maxi mum of two years. Chapter 3 - Page 35 b. Service credit toward retirement also accumulates for a faculty appointee during a period of study for which reimbursement is paid according to Professional Leaves , section 1. The stipulations of the North American Division working policy apply, including the two -year limitation. 3.8.0 Professional membership and travel allowances 3.8.1 Organization memberships a. The University encourages the membership and participation of faculty and staff members in professional and public service types of community organizations. b. Where such memberships are considered to be advantageous to the University, the school pays dues for personal memberships from funds budg eted for this purpose upon authorization of the dean, within the budget limitations. c. Specific identification of any organization with the University is limited to those organizations in which the University and/or its entities have membership or whic h are of recognized standing in education or the professions. 3.8.2 Travel Policy Administration entities of the University whose faculty and staff are expected to travel on business for the institution budget adequate funds for travel and hold to authorized limits. (See Trav el and Travel Procedures ) a. The University's policy is to pay for necessary and reasonable travel expenses incurred for authorized University business by employees, students and approved no n-employees. The intent of this policy is that such payments be fair and equitable to both the traveler and the University and consistent with federal and state regulations. b. All travel must be approved by completing a travel application form. For gro up trips, a travel application must be approved for each person who will be submitting expenses for reimbursement or cash advances. c. Travel expenses are to be reported and approved in accordance with the Expense Reports and Expense Reports Procedures .

When travel costs will be charged to a sponsored project, the terms of the applicable award may take precedence. Chapter 3 - Page 36 e. The University will pay a standard rate per mile for official travel by private automobile based on the actual driving distance by the most direct route, plus other allowed automobile -related expenses. f. An individual's personal expense for meals shall b e covered through a per diem allowance. Per diem is payable only when travel requires an employee to be away from home overnight. All advance payments (whether paid directly to supplier or to the traveler) and cash advances must be reported on the travel er's expense report. If they are not reported on an expense report submitted in accordance with the Expense Reports policy within 60 days after completion of the travel, advance paym ents and cash advances will be reported as taxable income to the employee, in accordance with Internal Revenue Service guidance. Employees are still responsible for reporting expenses or repaying advance. See Travel and Travel Procedures for details . 3.8.3 Flight by private aircraft University policy regarding flight by administrators, faculty, staff and students on private aircraft, whether owned or rented can be found under Privately Owned Aircraft . 3.8.4 Special travel A person invited to attend the autumn or spring councils, the quinquennial sessions of the General Conference, or other meetings sponsored by the Seventh -day Adventist church secures authorization as above unless they are members of the Ge neral Conference Committee.

Revenue from the publication or sale of such course materials of any kind accrues to t he department of which the author is a member. The policy on royalties applies if the faculty member receives royalty income from the sale of teaching notes (see Intellectual Propert ies and Derived Royalties ). 3.11.0 Copying and off -air recording policy 3.11.1 What is a copyright? A copyright is legal recognition that the original works of an author, artist, or composer are entitled to a limited monopoly. A copyright owner has the right to exploit and copy the work and to prevent others from doing so without paying a royalty. The co pyright protects such works as writing, music, artwork, and computer programs. (The copyright on works created during employment at LLU are covered by the University's Intellectual Property Policy contained in the Faculty Handbook .) 3.11.2 What is the scope of copyright coverage? Works created since January 1, 1978 are protected for the life of the author plus another 70 years. A work made for hire, i.e., a work created by an employee, is protected for 95 years after its publication or 12 0 years after its creation, whichever ends sooner. For works created before 1978 the term varies depending on several factors outlined in chapter 3 of the Copyright Act (title 17 of the United States Code. a. A copyright protects a variety of works: (1) literary works (including, but not limited to, textbooks and journal articles, etc.); (2) musical works, including lyrics; (3) dramatic works, including music; (4) pantomimes and choreographic works; (5) pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; (6) motion pictures, vide os, and slides; (7) sound recordings; Chapter 3 - Page 38 (8) computer software; (9) architecture. All that is required is an original work of authorship. Even a professor's lecture notes could be copyrighted. The work must be tangible; stored in a computer or written, recorded, or drawn. b. The copyright owner holds the right to (1) reproduce the cop ies of the work (2) prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted work (3) distribute copies of the copyrighted work to the public by sale, gift, rental, or lending (4) publicly perform or display the work Copyright protects the expression of an idea, not the idea itself. An idea, procedure, concept, discovery, or fact cannot be copyrighted. A researcher cannot copyright a discovery, but can copyright a journal article after the discovery. Patent laws may protect the discovery. 3.11.3 Permissible us es of copyrighted or other material A person or institution may use or copy a work without the owner's permission in the following cases: (1) works that were not copyrighted; (2) those whose copyrights are expired; or (3) created by the federal government. A legal concept called the Doctr ine of Fair Use allows the copy of works on a limited basis for teaching, scholarship, and criticism. Libraries and archives may make limited copies. Certain performances and displays are allowed for teaching or religious purposes. The fair uses permissibl e within the University without written permission are detailed below along with legal limits on such uses. Ideally, instructors are able to plan ahead for the use of copyrighted materials for personal research and as student learning materials and obta in appropriate written permission. Student learning materials may include lecture notes, classroom or conference or discussion group handouts, or tutorial notes, whether distributed on paper or through electronic media e.g. Web pages on a campus intranet o r on the public internet, E -mail, etc. Copying of such materials includes photocopying, electronic scanning, keyboard entry into computer -based word processing or E -mail programs for electronic distribution. 3.11.4 Copying for classroom and research use Copying of copyrighted materials for student learning and research use without written permission may occur in the following instances: a. Single copying for teachers Chapter 3 - Page 39 Single copies may be made of any of the following by or for teachers at their individual request for scholarly research or use in teaching or preparation to teach a class: (1) One chapter from a book; (2) An article from a periodical, journal, or newspaper; (3) A short story, short essay, or short poem, whether or not from a collective work; (4) A chart, graph, diagram, drawing, cartoon, or picture from a book, periodical, on newspaper. b. Multiple copies for student learning (not to exceed in any event more than one copy per pupil in a course) may be made by or for the teacher giving the course for student learning use or discussion; provided that the following three criteria are met: (1) The copying meets the tests of brevity and spontaneity as defined below; (2) The copying meets the cumulative effect test as defined below; (3) Each copy includes a notice of copyright. An example is \"this material may be protected by Copyright law (title 17, US Code).\" c. Definitions* (1) Brevity (a) Prose: (1) Either a complete article, story or essay of less than 2,500 words, (usually varies 3 -8 pages depending on size of page and type) or (2) an excerpt from any prose work of not more than 1,000 words or 10 percent of the work, whichever is greater. (b) Illustration: One chart, graph, diagram, drawing, cartoon, or picture per book or per periodical issue. (c) Poetry: (1) A complete poem if less than 250 words and if printed on not more than two pages or, (2) from a longer poem, an excerpt of not more than 250 words. (d) \"Special\" works: Certain works in poetry, prose, or in \"poetic prose\" which often combine language with illustrations and which are intended sometimes for children and at other times for a more general audience that fall short of 2,500 words in their entirety. Paragraph \"ii\" above notwithstanding such \"special works\" may not be reproduced in their entirety; however, an excerpt comprising not more than two of the published pages of such special work and containing not more than 10 percent of t he words found in the text thereof, may be reproduced. Chapter 3 - Page 40 (2) Spontaneity (a) The copying is at the instance and inspiration of the individual teacher, and (b) The inspiration and decision to use the work and the moment of its use for maximum teaching effectiveness are so close in time that it would be unreasonable to expect a timely reply to a request for permission. (3) Cumulative effect (a) Copying of t he material is for only one course in the school in which the copies are made. (b) Not more than one short poem, article, story, essay, or two excerpts may be copied from the same author, not more than three from the same collective work or more than th ree from the same collective work or periodical volume during one class term. (c) There shall not be more than nine instances of such multiple copying for one course during one class term. * [The limitations stated in 3. (b) and (c) above shall not a pply to current news periodicals and newspapers and current news sections of other periodicals.] d. Prohibitions as to a. and b. above Notwithstanding any of the above, the following uses are prohibited without written permission from the copyright owner: (1) Use of copying to create or to replace or substitute for anthologies, compilations, or collective work. Such replacement or substitution would be considered so, whether copies of various works or excerpts therefrom are accumul ated or reproduced and used separately. (2) Copying of or from works intended to be \"consumable\" in the course of study or of teaching. These include workbooks, exercises, standardized tests, and test booklets and answer sheets, for example. (3) Use of copyi ng (a) to substitute for the purchase of books, publishers' reprints, or periodicals; (b) which is directed by any level of University administration; (c) which is to be repeated with respect to the same item by the same teacher from term to term; (d) will include a charge to the student only for the actual cost of the copying. Chapter 3 - Page 41 3.11.5 Off-air taping of broadcasts Loma Linda University recognizes the educational benefits of some commercial and noncommercial television programs. Tapes of such broadcasts shown to classes may enhance the quality of instruction. The off -air recording of commercial and noncommercial tele vision broadcasts is strictly controlled by law and violation of that law can result in assessment of damages, attorneys' fees, civil fines, and imprisonment. The University therefore adopts the following guidelines in compliance with the Doctrine of Fair Use. a. A broadcast program may be recorded off -air simultaneously with broadcast transmission (including simultaneous cable retransmission) and retained by the University for a period not to exceed the first forty -five (45) consecutive calendar days after date of recording. Upon conclusion of the retention period, the off -air recording must be erased or destroyed immediately. \"Broadcast programs\" are television programs transmitted by television stations for reception by the general public without charge. Programs on paid television shall not be recorded for use by the University. The University library media center may record news programs off the air and retain them as part of their archives. b. Off-air recordings may be used once by individual teachers i n a course of teaching activities relevant to the subject matter of the recorded program, and use may be repeated only once when instructional reinforcement is necessary, in classrooms and similar places devoted to instruction within a campus, during the f irst ten (10) consecutive school days in the forty -five (45) calendar -day retention period. \"School days\" are school session days - not counting weekends, holidays, vacations, examination periods, or other scheduled interruptions within the forty -five (45) calendar -day retention period. c. Off-air recordings may be made only at the request of and use by individual teachers and may not be recorded in anticipation of request. No broadcast program may be recorded off -air more than once at the request of the sa me teacher, regardless of the number of times the program may be broadcast. d. A limited number of copies may be reproduced from each off -air recording to meet the legitimate needs of teachers under these guidelines. Each such additional copy shall be subj ect to all provisions governing the original recording, including erasures. e. After the first 10 consecutive school days, off -air recordings may be used up to the end of the 45 calendar -day retention period only for teacher evaluation purposes, i.e., to d etermine whether or not to include the broadcast program in the teaching curriculum, and may not be used for student exhibitions, or any other nonevaluation purpose without authorization by the copyright owner. f. Off-air recordings need not be used in thei r entirety, but the recorded programs may not be altered from their original content, i.e., the integrity of the program must remain intact. Off -air recordings may not be physically or electronically Chapter 3 - Page 42 combined or merged to constitute teaching anthologies or compilations. g. All copies of off -air recordings must include copyright notices of the broadcast program as recorded. h. Commercially -produced videos, slides, or computer software may not be copied and used for classroom teaching, other presentations, or personal use without written permission from the copyright owner. 3.11.6 Copying and use of computer programs Comput er software is tangible material and can be copyrighted. The Doctrine of Fair Use applies to computer programs. a. Permissible uses of copyrighted software The following uses of copyrighted software owned by or licensed to the University or its facult y are permissible: (1) copying it by using it in a computer's memory; (2) making one backup or archival copy; (3) making adaptations in order to use a particular machine; (4) lending it; and (5) selling it; in which case the backup or archival copy must be destroyed. b. Prohibited uses of copyrighted software The following uses of copyrighted software are prohibited by law without the permission of the copyright owner: (1) making copies for gift or sale; (2) copying a computer program purchased for use at the Unive rsity in order to use it at home; or (3) copying a computer program purchased for use in one department or school for use in another department or school. A site license should be negotiated to allow multiple uses on campus; 3.11.7 Penalties for copyright violations are severe a. A faculty member, employee, or student who violates the law or this policy is subject to University discipline and disciplinary processes. b. Violation of copyright law can result in a legal action for an inj unction, confiscation, or copyright materials and monetary damages. A person or institution who infringes a registered copyright may also be subject to attorney's fees and costs in enforcement actions. c. Criminal penalties can be imposed for willful viola tions of a copyright for a Chapter 3 - Page 43 financial or commercial nature. d. Various schools of the University are expected to establish the program control procedures to maintain the letter and spirit of the guidelines. 3.11.8 Library reserve guidelines At the request of a faculty member, a library may copy and place on reserve, excerpts from copyrighted words in its collection in accordance with guidelines similar to those governing formal classroom distribution for face -to-face teaching. The University believes that these guidelines apply to the library reserve shelf to the extent it functions as an extension of classroom readings or reflects an individual student's right to copy for their personal scholastic use under the Doctrine of Fair Use. In genera l, a library may copy materials from its collection for reserve room use for the convenience of students both in preparing class assignments and in pursuing informal educational activities which higher education requires, such as advanced independent study and research. Photocopies from a faculty member's personal collection may be placed on library reserve if it otherwise meets the requirements of fair use. If the request calls for only one copy to be placed on reserve, the library may photocopy an enti re article, or an entire chapter from a book or an entire poem. The negotiated safe -harbor guidelines for classroom uses are in many ways inappropriate for the college and university level. \"Brevity\" simply cannot mean the same thing in terms of grade -school readings that it does for more advanced research. Because University professors were not specifically represented in the negotiation of the classroom guidelines, the American Library Association published Model Policy Concerning College and Universi ty Photocopying for Classroom Research and Library Reserve Use (the \"model policy\"). a. Requests for multiple copies on reserve should meet the following guidelines: (1) The amount of material should be reasonable in relation to the total amount of material assigned for one term of a course taking into account the nature of the course, its subject matter and level. (2) The number of copies should be reasonable in light of the number of students enrolled, the difficulty and timing of assignments, a nd the number of other courses which may assign the same material. (3) The material should contain a notice of copyright. The effect of photocopying the material should not be detrimental to the market for the work. (In general, the library should own a t least one copy of the work.) (4) The reserve placement of the copyrighted material must not be repeated every quarter. Chapter 3 - Page 44 b. A faculty member's requests for multiple copies to be placed on reserve should meet the following guidelines: (1) The amount of material should be reasonable, if it's supplemental. (2) The number of copies should be reasonable based on size of the class. (3) The material should contain a notice of copyright and the effect should not be detrimental to the market for the work. Also, in general, the library should own a copy of the work. From: ALA Model Policy for Classroom, Research and Library Reserve Use, 1982. c. Electronic reserves service is an extension of traditional print -based library services and will be provided with application of the same fair use guidelines. Additionally, e -reserves services will observe the following guidelines: (1) Copyright permission needs to be secured before posting. Reposting of the same material for use in a subsequent quarter requires a new permission. (2) License terms and conditions must grant permission to post the copyrighted work in an e -reserves environment. (3) Scanned paper materials to create e -reserves copies must be taken from original, legal copies of the work either purc hased by the institution or instructor. (4) E-reserves are not a substitute for the purchase of textbooks (or coursepacks). (5) Access to the e -reserve content for a particular class will be removed when the term concludes.

All news released for local and national Chapter 3 - Page 54 media are released thro ugh this office. No information about Loma Linda University is to be released to the press without clearance from this office. 3.25.0 Security The department of security exists to promote and enforce a safe environment for everyone on the LLU campus d ay and night. Security officers are on duty 24 hours a day. The extension of the security office is 44319. ( https://one.lluh.org/vip/Departments/LLUSS -Departments/Security ) 3.26.0 Safety management program At LLU we value and respect our employees. Therefore, we are committed to providing a safe environment for all faculty, students, staff, and visitors. In keeping with this commitment, we have established and maintain a University -wide safety management pro gram. An important component of the program is the prevention of illness and injuring among University employees. The safety program, along with University safety policies and department -specific safety policies/procedures in designed to promote active par ticipation by department heads and employees in helping to maintain a strong occupational health and safety environment. The University safety management program exists to promote and enforce a safe environment for everyone on the LLU campus day and nig ht. While all department heads are responsible for safety within their respective areas, three directors have the responsibility and authority to implement and administer the safety program. These functions are performed through the following offices: 3.26.1 The Office of Hazardous Materials Safety (OHMS). This office coordinates everything having to do with hazardous materials - from advice on purchasing to disposal. The office extension is 44913. 3.26.2 The Office of Radiation Safety (ORS). This office deals with safety in areas dealing with radioactive materials and radiation - producing equipment like the proton accelerator and X -ray machines. The office extension is 44913. 3.26.3 The Office of Loss Control/Safety. This office is a part of th e risk management department. The safety office is responsible for general and fire safety, and safety education and training. The office extension is 44917. The directors of safety, OHMS, and ORS -- in conjunction with the University Safety Committee, various other committees and subcommittees, and the University administration -- develop and administer policies and procedures to protect the safety and health of our employees. University personnel are encouraged to cooperate and share ideas and information through the safety coordinators in their departments or areas. Chapter 3 - Page 55 Some aspects of the safety program are the injury and illness prevention program, safety inspections, safety suggestions, training (including new employee orientation and yearly updates), the safety coordinator program, accident investigation, and record -keeping. While recognizing the physical and mental impact of health and safety policies, the University believes an excellent health and safety record also promotes improved productivity. Employees (faculty/staff/students) are the foundation of the University's health and safety policy. It is a condition of employment that each employee shall conduct his/her work in a safe and healthful manner and shall be individually responsible for compliance with all the requirements of the safety management program. This includes, but is not limited to, participating in all required safety training, performing one's jobs in a safe manner, following proper blood -borne pathogen and tuberculosis precautions, observing hazardous materials and radiation safety precaution, wearing personal protective equipment as appropriate; and incorporating sound ergonomics i n performing job requirements. The University safety program is explained in detail in the Safety Management Manual . This manual is available through your school or department. 3.27.0 Care of Children Employees are to refrain from bringing their ch ildren into work areas on a regular basis. When minor children are on University grounds, in waiting rooms, offices, or lobbies, they are to be adequately supervised at all times. Children behaving in a rowdy, unruly manner will be required to leave the p remises. An employee's failure to adequately provide supervision for his/her children on a routine basis may be considered sufficient cause for termination.

Historically, this has been equated with the lecture format. However, any online activity that the instructor of record actively facilitates that is planned with a documented pedagogical purpose counts as direct instruction. The estimated min utes for online direct instruction are to be based on the average expectation for an individual student. a. Lecture : A learning environment in which an informative talk is given; teacher addresses students. b. Graduate seminar : A learning environment in which a group of supervised graduate students are doing research or advanced study on a given topic; students are engaged in presenting their own findings/understanding to the instructor and one another. c. Web-based instruction : A learning environm ent in which all instruction \u2014or any portion\u2014 in the course occurs via the internet with instructor initiated substantive interaction each week of the course. For, specific activities that meet the criteria of direct instruction online, please refer to the Distance Education Instructor Guide . 4.3.3 Glossary of Terms: a. Lecture : A learning discussion or recitation : A learning environment in which there is conversation or discourse that looks at various aspects of the subject under consideration; students engage in conversation with teacher and one another. b. Field Practicum/clinic A learning environment in which students are actively engaged in provision of services to patients or clients and provides students with an opportunity to demonstrate their ability to synthesize and integrate prior learning into real -life settings. It is st ructured differently across the LLU programs and can integrate the clinical education into the classroom coursework c. Field Trip: A learning situation in which students are taken to a specific off campus location for the purpose of illustrating or dem onstrating important concepts presented in lecture. d. Independent Study: Chapter 4 - Page 14 \"A student follows a course of study and works with a faculty member to decide how a student will meet defined course objectives. Both agree on what the student will do (e.g., readings, research, and work products), how the students work will be evaluated, and the timeframe for completion. The student must interact with the faculty member on a regular and substantive basis to assure progress within the course.\" 18 -19 FSA Hand book p. 2-30. e. Laboratory: Courses with limited group instruction where the main focus is on \"hands -on\" experience. 4.3.4 Normal workloads a. A full -time undergraduate student program should normally be 14 to 16 units, and, if full -time, no less than 12 units. b. A full -time graduate program is normally 8 units, not to exceed 12 units. Considerable excess allowed on grounds of student abil ity should be subject to special analysis and approval. 4.3.5 Academic credit for particular experiences Minimum Hours Per Week* Schedule Type Undergraduate Graduate/Professional Direct Instruction 1 1 Discussion or Recitation 2 Laboratory 3 3 Field Practicum/Clinical 3 3 Field Trip 4 4 Independent Study 3 4 *Based on a minimum of 10 weeks or the equivalent (e.g., 2 hours per week for 5 weeks). 4.3.6 Course delivery modes: See Distance Education policy for definitions other than face -to-face. Face -to-face Correspondence Distance education Hybrid correspondence Hybrid distance education Web -enhanced face-to-face 4.3.7 Course numbers Chapter 4 - Page 15 Courses are numbered as follows to indicate the level of the course and the type of credit it carries: 001 - 099 Nondegree -applicable credit 101 - 299 Lower division 301 - 499 Upper division 501 - 599* Graduate 601 - 699 Graduate course seminar, research, thesis or dissertation 701 - 899 Professional and clinical 901 - 999** Continuing education without academic credit * 500 level course work may not apply toward a baccalaureate degree unless it is approved by the instructor and both deans (dean of the school offering the course and the school in which the student is enrolled) giving permission and provided the credit does not apply toward both an undergraduate and graduate degree. Approval i s not needed if the course is part of a coordinated program. **Continuing education courses are further identified by the prefix ending in \"CE\". Undergraduate 900 -level courses are used to satisfy the certificate requirement only and are not applicable toward a degree program at LLU. 4.3.8 Advanced standing for undergraduate seniors A senior in an undergraduate curriculum who otherwise meets all requirements for graduate standing may be allowed to take graduate courses for graduate credit simultan eously with courses that complete bachelor's degree requirements if this does not constitute an overload. In keeping with the Academic Status policy 1.c, no more than a cumulative 1 2 graduate units may be completed prior to awarding of the bachelor's degree. 4.3.9 Credit for instruction not on campus Courses offered in an off -campus or extended campus setting or for an extended degree program that carry the same prefixes as do the regular on -campus courses are fully applicable toward degree requirements. This policy applies to undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate courses. 4.3.10 Enrichment programs Some workshops or courses may not qualify for academic credit, as determined by the school. 4.3.11 Waiver of a required course Chapter 4 - Page 16 A student may request the waiver of a requirement if prior course work or experience fulfills the requirement but does not qualify for transfer of credit. An examination may be required. a. The minimum passing performance must be the equivalent of a C grade for undergraduate and a B for graduate courses. Grades of C - and B -, respectively, are not acceptable. b. Requests to wa ive a requirement are made to the dean of the school offering the course and must be petitioned before the final quarter of residence. c. The maximum amount of course work that may be waived is determined by each school. d. A waiver does not reduce the credit hour or residency requirements. e. A waiver examination does not carry academic credit and may not be repeated. f. A testing fee for a waiver examination is required as specified in the school bulletin. 4.3.12 Credit by examination For certain courses offered by the University, a student in an undergraduate degree program may earn credit by passing an equivalency examination administered by the appropriate school and department. Such an examination is at leas t equal in scope and difficulty to a final examination in the course and may include materials supplied by CLEP or other agencies. A graduate program should be used to acquire new knowledge. Since the purpose of credit by examination is to validate prior knowledge learned, graduate credit may not be earned by examination. If a required course in the degree program is a repeat of pri or learning, a student may request a waiver (see item 7 of this policy) thus making it possible for a student to take elective courses that would increase their knowledge. a. A currently enrolled student in a degree program at LLU desiring credit by equiva lency examination petitions the dean of the school offering the course and, upon approval, pays a testing fee as specified in the bulletin. b. Equivalency examinations may not duplicate credit already earned through course work including courses taken for audit. c. A grade of S (Satisfactory) is given only after the student has completed one quarter or the equivalent at this University, and has earned 12 units of credit with a grade point average of at least 2.0 in undergraduate courses. d. Units earned by equivalency may not be used as part of the enrolled load. Chapter 4 - Page 17 e. Equivalency examinations must be taken before the final quarter of residence. f. The maximum amount of credit that may be earned by examination is determined by each school but may not exceed a max imum of 20% of the units required for the degree. 4.3.13 Validation of non -course program requirements Validation of completion of non -course program requirements such as BCLS, ACLS, etc . is to be submitted using the Non-Course Program Requirement form. Documentation should be current within six months of graduation. No fee will be assessed. 4.3.1 4 Dual or shared credit Academic credit from a course applied to two degrees in a conjoint or combined degrees relationship from this University is defined as dual or shared credit. a. In doctoral and master's degrees in different disciplines and in conjoint or combined relation, dual or shared credit should not exceed 18 units. Amounts greater than this may be granted upon petition. b. In two doc toral programs having conjoint or combined relation, dual or shared credit should not exceed 36 units. Amounts greater than this may be granted upon petition. c. Three units of religion credit may be a part of the shared or dual credit. d. The usual policies related to acceptable grades and grade averages apply to dual or shared credit. e. In bachelor's degrees and graduate degrees involving the same or different disciplines, dual or shared credit should not exceed nine (9) units. Amounts greater than this may be granted upon request. f. The purpose of certificate programs is to provide a special body of knowledge, most often outside the major field. In those instances where an individual certificate may be earned en route to the completion of a degree bearing the same name, all of the courses may count toward one certificate a single time. In no case may a single course be counted toward more than one certificate and degree combination irrespective of the name of the certificate or degree. 4.3.1 5 Directed/Independent study Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent or the department chair and/or the office of the dean of the student's school. The student is responsible for completion of the Directed/Independent Study T itle Request Form in addition to the regular registration. University policy limits directed study to 12 quarter units of undergraduate credit and 8 units of graduate credit in a degree program. Individual Chapter 4 - Page 18 programs may further limit these units. The off ice of the dean of the student's school should be consulted regarding limits on credit earned through independent study. Independent study is to be completed in adequate time before graduation to allow recording in the Office of University Records. Directed/Independent Study is: a. Offered to provide opportunity for a student to have a special academic experience beyond that offered in his/her regular classwork. b. Supervised by one faculty member with expertise in the area of study. c. Evaluated according to specific goals prescribed in a document of agreement, which includes: i a description of the work to be done, ii the basis of grading, iii the number of credits to be awarded, and iv an agreed schedule for student -teacher contacts. Courses appearing in a school's Bulletin shall always be taken under their own course number regardless of class size. 4.3.1 6 Courses taken for audit cannot be repeated for credit. 4.4.0 Transfer Credit 4.4.1 Undergraduate Programs Definitions: Transfer Credit: Academic credit earned at an accredited college or university other than Loma Linda University and applied toward a degree program at Loma Linda University. Extramural credit: Academic credit earned at another accredited co llege or university after matriculating to Loma Linda University, for the purpose of transferring the credit to Loma Linda University to apply toward a degree program. CHEA: Council for Higher Education accreditation - https://www.chea.org/ USDE: United States Department of Education a. Introduction All undergraduate students at Loma Linda University are by design, transfer students. Thus, a conscientious effort has been made to create a student -oriented transfer process. The foremost goal is a policy that provides a strong focus toward serving studen ts. Chapter 4 - Page 19 b. Authority for Policy The Office of University Records is charged with procedural responsibilities for implementing this policy and determines the transferability of all courses and equivalency of non -major courses (e.g., general education c ourses). Individual schools will be responsible for student appeals regarding the appropriateness of the course content as it applies to a specific program. c. Credit Accepted in Transfer The Office of University Records will determine the transferability of courses according to University policy and standard transfer practices of accredited higher education institutions in the United States. The transferring institution's course classification (remedial, undergraduate, graduate of a course and California statewide articulation numbers (C -ID), where available, will be used as a guide. In no case will a higher level of credit be awarded than designated by the issuing institution. Extramural credit is to receive prior approval by the Recor ds to ensure that courses meet transfer standards before the student enrolls in the selected course(s). (See Residency Requirements for LLU Degrees ). Official transcripts documenting the completion of extramural credit is to be received by the University Records no later than 15 business days prior to the end of the term in which the degree is to be awarded. Transfer credit involves at least three considerations:1 (1) Educational quality of the learning experience which the student seeks to transfer; (2) Comparability of the nature, content and level of the learning experience to that offered by LLU; and (3) Appropriateness and applicability of the learning experience to the program offered by LLU in light of the student's learning goals. Accreditation addresses the first consideration. Careful attention is given to courses from U.S. institutions accredited by organizations recognized by the USDE and CHEA. Accreditation does not address questions about comparability of the nature, content and level of potential transfer credit. Courses should be reviewed on their learning outcomes and the existence of valid evaluation measures, including third -party expert review. Based on this criteria: 1 The following draws on the Joint Statement on the Transfer and Award of Credit issued by the American Council on Education (ACE), Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admission Offi cers (AACRAO ), and the Council of Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Chapter 4 - Page 20 d. Generally, credit for comparable courses earned in traditional classroom activities is accepted as transfer. The University may require a written, oral, or practical examination in any course for which transfer cred it is requested. In such cases, an examination fee may be required. e. The purpose of general education requirements is to broaden knowledge beyond what is required in the baccalaureate field of study. For this reason, general education courses are expected to be completed in an institution providing liberal arts versus a career -focused institution in which courses may be taught with emphasis unique to a specific vocation. f. Schools/programs may set time limitations in which a specific discipline is acceptable for transfer. For example, anatomy and physiology must be taken within five years of matriculation into the program. g. No transfer credit is given for a course briefly addressing the chief topics of a broad field of knowledge if taken a fter a more comprehensive course on the topic. For example, a one -quarter survey/introductory physics course taken after general physics sequence or any portion of the sequence. h. A minimum grade of \"C\" (2.0) is required for all courses accepted for t ransfer credit. Grades of \"C -\"or below are not acceptable . Courses taken for pass/fail (S/U) will be accepted if the institution from which it was taken states in their catalog and/or notes on the transcript that a pass is equivalent to grade of \"C\" (2.0) or better. If it is equivalent to a grade of \"C -\", the course will not transfer. i. A maximum of 105 quarter units of lower -division credit will be accepted from junior/community colleges accredited by a USDE - or CHEA -recognized accrediting orga nization. j. Credit is accepted for vocation -specific courses to count toward units required in baccalaureate degree completion programs based on the following criteria: (1) the school/program is recognized by the same programmatic accreditation or ganization that accredits the LLU program in the same discipline, (2) the student has successfully passed the same program -specific licensure required of graduates of the LLU program, (3) the course is substantially equivalent to course work at LLU , (4) the courses are applicable2 to the LLU degree program to which the student is applying/currently enrolled, and must be within the 105 quarter -unit limit accepted from a junior/community college. 2 \"All degrees awarded by the institution are clearly defined in terms of entry -level requirements and levels of student achievement necessary for graduation that represent more than simply an accum ulation of courses or credits.\" WSCUC CFR 2.2 Chapter 4 - Page 21 Units transferred are based on actual units earned as posted on the awarding institution's transcript \u2014for a maximum of 50 quarter units. Only units for didactic courses are transferred \u2014no clinical courses. k. Credit may be given for transfer from U.S. service schools carrying a baccalaureate credit re commendation in the latest Guide to the Evaluation of Education Experiences in the Armed Services provided by the American Council on E ducation (ACE). An official SMART or AARTS transcript must be submitted for evaluation. Credit must be for subject matter relevant2 to the degree program at LLU. Credit may be awarded for physical education activity based on basic training as documented on a SMART/AARTS transcript or physical education activity waived on submission of DD -214. l. Credit is not awarded for extension courses not accepted toward a degree at the offering institution. m. Credit is not granted for the Canadian Senior Matr iculation Examination taken after October 1973. No college credit is given for Ontario Academic Courses (OACs). n. This policy statement is from the Board of Higher Educa tion (BHE) of the General Conference of SDA as well as from the American Assoc iation of Colle - giate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO). o. Credit by examination (also see Academic Credit , section 9) Credit earned in high school does not transfer; however, knowledge gained during high school may receive credit by one or more of the following examinations: (1) Credit is granted for scores of 3, 4, or 5 on Advanced Place ment (AP) examinations taken while enrolled in secon dary school and submitted by the College Entrance Examination Board. The amount of credit assigned AP examinations may not duplicate credit earned in subsequent college courses covering the same or similar content. In such cases, transfer credit will be based on the latest credit earned which would be the college course(s). (2) Credit is granted for scores submitted by the College Board for examina - tions of the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) except for English composition. (a). Credit for courses is granted according t o recommendations by the Americ an Council on Education (ACE). (b) Students are allowed to challenge a given course by examination only once. Chapter 4 - Page 22 (c) Students must complete all CLEP credit within six months after the posting of the initial LLU degree audit online. Credit will not be awarded: (i) if previous coursework at the equivalent or at a more advanced level has been awarded or (ii) for courses that have been attempted and failed. (3) Credit is granted for scores of 5, 6, or 7 earned on International Baccalaureat (IB) Examinations for higher -level subject examinations. General elective credit only is given. In other words, it does not fulfill specific subject requirements. For exampl e, credit in physics may fulfill elective credit in natural sciences, but does not fulfill a requirement for a general physics sequence. No credit is granted for \"standard\" or \"subsidiary\" level subjects. (4) General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (GCE A -Level) examinations administered through British, Caribbean, Hong Kong, Singapore and African country examining boards with a grade of C or higher may be considered for transfer credit on a course -by-course basis. Up to 8 quarter units of cre dit may be granted per subject. A maximum of 4 quarter units may be granted for the first half of English composition for the A -level in English. Examination results must be sent directly from the examining board to LLU. p. Remedial, developmental education, or other non -academic level coursework is not accepted for transfer or cal culated in a student's grade point average. q. Transfer credit does not count toward residency requirements at LLU. r. Institutions from whi ch credit is accepted . (1) Credit earned at U.S. Institutions Transfer credit from degree -granting institutions accredited by a USDE - or CHEA -recognized accrediting agency will be accepted at full value on transfer to the University (e.g., a 3 -unit se mester course will transfer as 4.5 quarter units even if the equivalent course offered at a quarter -based institution is typically 4 units): (a) If earned in a program that is comparable to a program offered by Loma Linda University; or (b) If the U.S. degree -granting institution holds \"candidacy\" status from a recognized accreditation agency. Credit will be given for courses beginning with the first term of the academic year in which the institution was given this status; or Chapter 4 - Page 23 (c) If credit for vocational courses is earned in a college or university that offers degree pro grams that are comparable to programs offered by Loma Linda University and the college or university is accredited by a programmatic accrediting body that accredits the LLU program in the same profession. (2) Credit Earned at International Institutions (a) Credit may be transferred from an international degree -granting institution recognized by the appropriate government agency (e.g., Ministry o f Education) of the country in which the educational institution is located. Systems of awarding credit vary by country, therefore, the value of the units transferred will be determined upon evaluation of the transcript. Content of courses may require a course syllabus. (b) To determine institutions from which LLU will accept postsecondary work, the following references are used as well as other publications recognized by American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers AACRAO. (i) AACRO Edge (E lectronic Database for Global Education) \u2014a web - based database created and maintained by AACRAO (ii) International Handbook of Universities \u2014published by The International Association of Universities (iii) World Higher Education Database (WHED) \u2014published online by The International Association of Universities \u2014 https://whed.net/home.php (iv) World List of Universities \u2014published by The International Association o f India n Universities . Credit for English composition taken at institutions in Canada Great Britain, or Australia may be considered on a course -by-course. Identifiable credit must appear on the student's transcript and a syllabus provided for consideration to be given. (3) Specific Qualifications, Requirements and Limitations Related to Transfer of Credit (a) All credit evaluated for transfer is subject to the following qualifications: (i) Evaluation is based on the review of the primary academic transcripts of record from all institu tions Chapter 4 - Page 24 attended. (In other words, evaluations are not based on another institution's evaluation of transfer credit from a third institution.) (ii) Loma Linda University reserves the right to evalu ate not only the credit as it appears on the trans cript, but also the basis on which the credit was initially awarded by the sending institution \u2014that is, classroom experience, examination, life experi ences, etc. (b) The precise amount of transfer credit which is applicable toward a particular degree will be determined by the specific school and department concerned, but not to exceed limits set in this policy. (c) Transfer students must meet the general education re quire ments that apply to all students for a degree from Loma L inda University. (d) When the course description does not clearly meet a general education (GE) requirement, University Records may require a course syllabus, to include learning outcomes, schedule of topics, textbooks, etc. It is the student's/appli cant's responsibility to provide this information upon request. When a GE designated requirement is defined by the GE Committee (e.g., cultural diversity), University Records may seek clarification/approval from the General Education Committee. (e) Course content is to be evaluated by faculty who teach similar content at LLU or the program director for program prerequisites to determine the applicability of such coursework in satisfying degree requirements. (4) Applicability and Awarding Credi t All undergraduate coursework from other U.S. colleges and universities are entered into t he University's student information system for evaluation. Not all courses eligible for transfer credit may apply toward degree and graduation requirements. Appli cability is determined by the program a student chooses, grades received in the class, number of credits received, and content of the course, among others. (5) Transcripting Credit The total units of transfer courses are included in the LLU transcript summary to acknowledge the use of transfer credit in the awarding of a degree; however, the transfer courses are not listed on the LLU transcript for the following reasons: Chapter 4 - Page 25 (a) All undergraduate level courses are entered in the student information sy stem (see section 8 above); the system does not differentiate between courses applied toward the degree awarded and those that are not. Applied courses are identified only through the degree audit system (b) The LLU transcript should not be used as v alidation of coursework completed elsewhere (6) Appeal Procedure Students who believe this policy was not implemented accurately in the evaluation of their transfer credit may initiate an appeal with their school academic office. Appeal should be initiated within six months of the posting of the initial LLU degree audit online. However, before initiating an appeal, the student must first determine if a simple oversight has occurred and seek clarification of the policy. 4.4.2 Graduate Transfer C redit a. A maximum of 9 units of credit that have been previously applied to another degree program or curriculum may be accepted as transfer credit upon petition. In the case of approved combined or conjoint programs. b. Transfer credit may reduce the minimum requirements of credit units for a degre e earned at Loma Linda University; however, residency requirements are not to be altered. The maximum number of transfer credits toward a master's degree or doctoral degree may not exceed 20 percent of t he minimum credits required for the degree; amounts greater than this may be granted by the President's Committee. c. A minimum grade of \"B\" is required for all courses accepted for transfer credit. Transfer credit is normally not applicable if the course work was completed more than seven years prior to registration at Loma Linda University. d. Transfer -credit courses must be equivalent to courses appropriate to degree requirements as specified in the bulletins of the schools of the University. e. Extension credits earned at another accredited institution are not accepted for transfer credit unless approved by the dean of the school. f. Specific Qualifications, Requirements and Limitations Related Transfer of Credit g. All credi t evaluated for transfer is subject to the following qualifications: h. Evaluation is based on the review of the primary academic transcripts of record from all institutions attended. (In other words, evaluations are not based on another institution's evaluation of transfer credit from a third institution.) Chapter 4 - Page 26 i. Loma Linda University reserves the right to evaluate not only the credit as it appears on the transcript, but also the basis on which the credit was initially awarded by the sending institut ion - that is, classroom experience, examination, life experiences, etc. j. The precise amount of transfer credit which is applicable toward a particular degree will be determined by the specific school and department concerned. k. Transfer students must meet the general education requirements that apply to all students for a degree from Loma Linda University. l. Only credit earned with a grade of C or higher for under -graduate course work and B or higher for graduate course work will be accepted for transfer. Grades of C- and B -, respectively, are not acceptable. m. Appeal Procedure Students who believe that this policy was not implemented accurately in the evaluation of their transfer credit may initiate an appeal with either the General Studies and Transfer Education Subcommittee or the specific school responsible for their program. 4.5.0 Grading 4.5.1 Grades and grade points The following grades and grade points are used in this University. Each course taught in the schools has been approved for either a letter grade or an S/U grade, and deviations from this are not allowed. A 4.0 Outstanding performance A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 Very good performance for undergraduate credit; satisfactory Performance for graduate credit. B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 Satisfactory performance for undergraduate credit. Minimum performance for which credit is granted toward a degree in the School of Nursing, School of Public Health, or School of Allied Health Professions. C- 1.7 Minimum performance for which credit is granted toward a degree in the School of Dentistry or the School of Pharmacy. D+ 1.3 Chapter 4 - Page 27 D 1.0 Minimum performance for which undergraduate credit is granted, except as indicated above. F 0.0 Failure - given for not meeting minimal performance MS none Marginally satisfactory will be assigned to School of Medicine students when the course director judges that the student's performance has met but not exceeded minimum course requirements. Grades of marginally satisfactory must be remediated if: A studen t is required because of grades of \"Fail\" to repeat course work during the subsequent academic year. If a student with a grade of \"Fail\" is permitted by the Academic Review Committee to repeat course work during the summer, the student need not repeat a co urse for which a marginally satisfactory grade was assigned; or The Academic Review Committee judges the student's record of multiple grades of marginally satisfactory to be such that repeating those courses would provide the student with a more certain foundation for future academic and professional success . S none Satisfactory performance - counted toward graduation. Equivalent to a C grade or better in undergraduate courses, or a B grade or better in graduate courses. An S grade is not computed in the grade point average. A student may request a grade of S in onl y a limited amount of course work as determined by the School. This is done by the student's filing with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to 14 calendar days before the final examination week. Once filed, the grade is not subject to change. U none Unsatisfactory performance - given only when performance for an S specified course falls below a C grade level in an undergraduate course or a B grade level in a graduate course. Similar filing procedures as given above are required. The U grade is not com puted in the grade point average. S/N none Satisfactory performance in a clock -hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the S grade given for a credit hour course. U/N none Unsatisfactory performance in a clock -hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the U grade given for a credit hour course. CR none Credit for Credit by Examination. Counted toward graduation/units earned, but not units attem pted. Such credit cannot be counted in enrollment for financial aid or immigration purposes. Chapter 4 - Page 28 NC none No Credit for unsatisfactory performance for a Credit by Examination. Does not count for any purpose. Notations W Withdraw - given for withdrawal from a course prior to 14 calendar days before the final examination week. Withdrawals during the first 14 calendar days of a quarter or the first 7 calendar days of a five -week summer session are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the cut -off date. In the case of nontraditionally scheduled courses, W will be given for withdrawal from a course prior to completion of eighty percent of the course, excluding th e final examination period. Withdrawals during the first 20 percent of a course, excluding the final examination period, are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the date when this 20 percent of the course is completed. UW Unofficial Withdrawal - indicates that the student (a) discontinued class attendance after the close of registration but failed to withdraw officially or (b) did not obtain financial clearance for a continuing registratio n resulting from an \"in progress\" course. I Incomplete - given when the majority of the course work has been completed and circumstances beyond a student's control results in the student being unable to complete the quarter. An I notation may be changed to a grade only by the instructor before the e nd of the following term (excluding the summer sessions for those not in attendance during that term). Incomplete units are not calculated in the grade point average. By the use of the petition form - available online at https://home.llu.edu/campus -and-spiritual -life/student -services/academic - life - the student requests an I notation from the instructor, stating the reason for the request and obtaining the signat ures of the instructor, the department chair, and the dean or designee. The form is left with the instructor. The instructor will then report the I notation on the grade report form, as well as the grade which the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the time limit. The petition form is then filed with the Office of University Records no later than the deadline for grades to be submitted for the quarter. The notation I is not granted as a remedy for overload, failure on final exam ination, absence from final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. IP In Progress - indicates that the course has a duration of more than a single term and will be completed by the student no later than the final term of the course, not to exceed five quarters for independent study and research Chapter 4 - Page 29 courses (original quarter of r egistration plus four additional quarters). The student's final grade is reported on the instructor's grade report at the end of the term in which the course is completed. If the course work is not completed within the five -quarter time limit, a grade of U or F (as appropriate to the grading mode for the course) will be given. AU Audit - indicates registration for attendance only, with 80 percent class attendance considered a requirement. A request to change a credit course to audit or an audit course to credit may be made no later than the 14th calendar day after the beginning of a quarter or the 7th calendar day after the beginning of the five -week summer session. (This does not address short summer courses lasting only a week or two.) AUW Audit With drawal - given for withdrawing from the course or indicating that the 80 percent class attendance requirement was not observed. Recognition Given an undergraduate student who qualifies for the Dean's list and/or other recognition 4.5.2 Reporting of grades a. Course grades are due by 4:00 p.m. three school days after the end of the quarter, for courses on the standard term. Grades for nonstandard term courses are due three school days after the course end date. b. The official report of grades is posted to the web the evening of the due date. Once posted to the web, they are available for viewing by students and advisors. c. It is not the responsibility of the instructor or department to notify a student that a cer tain grade has been earned in a course. d. Courses in which one or more notations of \"Incomplete\" are entered will not be posted until the appropriate completed paper documentation, Petition for Incomplete Grade , has been received by University Records. 4.5.3 Change of grade Faculty members are responsible for evaluating and assigning grades. A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in arriving at or recording a grade. Such changes are acceptable up to the end of the succeeding term. 4.5.4 Repeating a course Once grades have been posted for a course, a student wishing to improve his/her grade must repeat the course. When repeating a course, the student must attend class and laboratory sessions as ordinarily required and take all regularly scheduled examinatio ns. The amount of tuition paid for repeated courses is determined by the school. Both the original and repeat grades will appear on the student's permanent record, but only the repeat grade and credit units are computed in the grade point average and inclu ded in Chapter 4 - Page 30 the total units earned. A student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in a student's degree program . 4.5.5 Transcripts The transcript is the official copy of the student's academic record and includes al l courses attempted and grades earned at the University. (See the University Catalog for more detail) 4.5.6 Retention of grade reports Instructors are responsible for keeping grade books or records for five years after the conclusion of the course. 4.6.0 Student recognition 4.6.1 Terminology: grant, scholarship, award, fellowship, traineeship a. At the undergraduate level, the terms grant and scholarship are applied to awards of substantial amounts which provide support that enables students to be in school: subsistence and/or tuition costs. (1) The term scholarship is reserved for awards tha t require a high level of academic performance as one of the criteria for eligibility. (2) The term grant is used when academic distinction is not a criterion for eligibility, although acceptable scholarship is assumed. b. The term award is used for forms of recognition that honor past performance or accomplishment in scholarship, leadership, etc. Awards are not intended as support for further education. c. At the graduate and professional levels, the term fellowship corresponds to the term schol arship at the undergraduate level. The term traineeship corresponds to the term grant. 4.6.2 President's award a. The president's award is given annually to one student in each school as a tangible demonstration of the University's regard for and e ncouragement of individual accomplishment in excellent scholarship and community service within the framework of commitment to the highest ideals of the University. b. The nominee is recommended by the dean after consultation with the faculty. c. The amount of the award, which is accompanied by a certificate, is $600 for students at the undergraduate level, and $1,000 for students at the graduate or postgraduate level. Chapter 4 - Page 31 d. The recipient is a student who has been in residence at the University f or at least one academic year before receipt of the award. e. In unusual circumstances, several students from a school may share the president's award. 4.6.3 Dean's list and/or other school recognition. The Dean's list is comprised of students wh o have completed at least 12 units of course work during a quarter with a grade point average of at least 3.5, with no grade lower than a B -, and with no Incomplete notation on the grade report. 4.7.0 Professional standards (Principles of Student Conduct) The health - and science -related professions are proud of their traditional reputation for honesty and integrity. These virtues are essential for each member if these professions are to continue to maintain their position of trust within society. The establishment of codes of ethics, peer review committees, ethics committees, and other regulatory and/or advisory groups within the professions indicate a vital and continuing concern with maintaining high standards of integrity. Professional standards provide a means of educating and training future professionals in areas of ethical conduct and are intended to aid in developing an ethical and moral awareness that will help the individual serve in an enlightened manner. In addition , the University seeks to broaden students' ethical perspectives by including a religious perspective not always found in ethical codes. By adding a spiritual foundation to the profession's ethical framework, it is anticipated that the professional's ethic will be a more completely informed ethic \u2014one that not only reflects a proper concern for one's fellow human beings, but one that also reflects an intimate relationship with God, our Creator. Students must conduct themselves at all times in a manner repr esentative of their profession and school. Students share responsibility for maintaining an environment conducive to learning. Any activity that interferes with the learning processes vital to the practice of the chosen profession or that violates the inte grity of the profession as a whole is not acceptable. The following list is illustrative of the type of conduct that violates the University's expectation for student conduct and is cause for discipline up to and including dismissal. It is not an exhaust ive or all -inclusive list but is stated here for purposes of illustration: a. Failure to respect individual rights. This include (1) physically or verbally abusing any person or engaging in conduct that threatens or endangers the health, safety, or w ellbeing of others; (2) obstructing or disrupting the study of others; the performance of official duties by University personnel; teaching, research, disciplinary, administrative, or other functions of the University, or other authorized activities on University premises; and Chapter 4 - Page 32 (3) slander and libel (a) disrespect for individual and University property, including theft and vandalism (b) refusal or failure to remediate documented unsatisfactory performance (c) personal conduct that is in compatible with the standards of morality and propriety of the Seventh -day Adventist Church (d) overt disharmony, subversion, or violation of the philosophy, objectives, and policies of the University \u2014including those delineated in this handbook (e) gambling or betting (f) failure to obey, honor, and sustain civil law (g) arrogance and insubordination (h) patient abuse Professional ethics consistent with the Christian understanding of the value and importance of all persons should be reflected in the relationships students develop with each of their patients. While clinical activities will rightfully be focused on learning, the patient's needs should always be the primary concern. Altruism must be learned and practiced from the e arliest moment of the student's program and reinforced in all aspects of the professional training. Patient abuse will not be tolerated. Patient abuse includes any behavior or act that might jeopardize the health or well -being of a patient. Examples of pa tient mistreatment or abuse include but are not limited to: a. Unsupervised and/or unauthorized treatment of a patient. b. Treating a patient while the student is under the influence of alcohol or drugs c. Failure to comply with clinic policies regarding patient treatment and documentation d. Failure to comply with established protocols for infection control e. Refusal to properly treat any patient for reasons of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, financial status, handicap, or disability f. Patient abandonment g. Any breach of confidentiality, except as required by law or University policy h. Failure to report an observed incident of patient mistreatment or abus e Chapter 4 - Page 33 4.8.0 Dress and appearance guidelines Members of the Loma Linda University community of scholars, including students, must maintain an appearance, at all times, which is consistent with the highest professional standards and Christian principles of cleanliness, modesty, and simplicity. The image projected to the public should be consistent with the mission and philosophy of Loma Linda University. The specifics listed below are examples of what constitutes the professional image as defined by LLU. a. Clothing. Modest casual wear is appropriate on campus and in class. In settings where shorts are acceptable they must be neat and at least mid -thigh in length. Sloppy clothing, tank tops, tight -fitting shorts, clothing that is torn or frayed, and bare midriffs are not considered appropriate. Words, pictures, and/or symbols displayed on clothing should be consistent with an Adventist Christian institution and sensitive to a diverse faculty, staff, and student population. Professional attire includes: s kirts or dresses of modest length or long pants (dress pants are recommended), or as specified b. Hair and grooming. Hair is to be neat, clean, and professional in appearance, and not to impede vision. Extreme or unnatural appearance in style or color shall not be permitted. Head coverings, unless required in the work area or worn for specific religious reasons, are not permitted. (1) Longer hair shall be contained so as not to interfere with patient care, the operation of equipment, or other duties. (2) Facial hair a. Mustaches and beards are to be kept clean, well -groomed, and neatly trimmed. c. Cosmetics (1) The emphasis is on natural appearance (e.g., eyebrows natural looking; eye shadow and mascara used in moderation.) (2) Fingernails must be clean and neat at all times, d. Heavily scented powders, lotions, perfumes, after shaves, etc. are not accep table. e. Jewelry/Accessories (1) If an employee or student chooses to wear jewelry, professional appearance and in compliance with environmental safety is required. Chapter 4 - Page 34 (2) Visible body piercing (except ears) and tattoos are not permitted. f. Clothing/Attire a. Clothes that are compatible with a business -like, professional, and safety -conscious health - care environment are required at all times. Conservative and appropriate dress is required of all employees and students. In general, good p ersonal hygiene and good grooming are required for an overall effect that is pleasant, professional, consistent with consumer expectations, and representative of the values of LLU. g. University ID badge must be worn in a visible location above the wais t at all times while the student is on campus. This includes all LLUH facilities (e.g., Behavioral Health Institute, SBH Department of Social Work and Social Ecology, San Bernardino campus) 4.9.0 Standards of academic conduct The purpose of education, especially Christian education, is to enhance intellectual, social, emotional, physical, and spiritual development of students at the same time that they are learning the skills of a profession. In the classroom, students shall be responsible to and respec tful of their peers by avoiding any behavior that would disrupt the learning environment. Cheating is not tolerated. Cheating robs the student of an opportunity to learn, and undermines relationships among peers as well as students and teachers. Where chea ting is known, but not confronted, it ultimately allows a toleration of dishonesty, that if carried over into professional practice may result in abuse of patients and malpractice problems. For these reasons, cheating will not be tolerated and will be deal t with as a matter of serious discipline. Some types of violations of ethical conduct encountered in educational programs in the health - related professions are of particular concern. The following examples are illustrative but are not intended to be a complete list of concerns. a. Academic dish onesty Academic dishonesty involves a willful perversion of the truth in an academic setting. Examples include, but are not limited to: (1) Cheating on assignments or examinations with unauthorized materials. (2) Copying from peers, or knowingly and willingly permitting or assisting others to copy from examinations, assignments, or lab materials. (3) Using unauthorized aids during examinations and quizzes. (4) Looking at another individual's examination o r quiz in a way that appears that information is being sought. (5) Plagiarizing, which includes the undocumented use of sources or ideas, or either whether quoted or paraphrased, or otherwise presented as one's own. Chapter 4 - Page 35 (6) Fabrication and/or fraudul ent insertion of scholarly materials, not the product of one's own efforts, into assignments or clinical records. (7) Interfering in a harmful way with another's work (e.g., sabotaging laboratory work, or illicit entry or deletion of computer data). (8) Writing a test, or examination, or assignment for another student, or having another person wrongfully write an examination for a third party. (9) Misrepresenting the attendance of self or of another party in a required class, laboratory or as sembly. (10) Altering grades or arranging for others to wrongfully alter grades on tests or examinations, instructors' records, or records of the school or University. b. Forgery Forgery consists of the falsifying of signatures, altering of the content of documents after they have been signed, and may include other forms of lying or intentional misrepresentation. Examples of forgery include but are not limited to: (1) Falsifying instructors' signatures on charts or evaluation forms. (2) Altering patient records, grade forms, evaluation sheets, or other documents after a signature is received. (3) Signing another student's name on a classroom attendance record. (4) Forging a person's signature on clinic records. 4.10.0 MyChart vs. personal medical record It is important to remember NOT to use your electronic medical record system (i.e., LLEAP) sign on to access your personal medical record or that of a family member, classmate, faculty, or other individuals for whom you have no business need or assigned patient care responsibilities. Usage of the electronic medical record system is monitored continuously; and violations not only are reported to the dean's offic e, but they may also lead to serious consequences \u2014 including federal penalties and possible suspension or dismissal from school. You are encouraged to use MyChart to access your personal information. 4.11.0 Academic Integrity Policy Loma Linda University seeks to educate ethical and competent professionals and scholars who are committed to the practice of honesty and the pursuit of truth. This University is committed to the following fundamental core values: compassion, integrity, exc ellence, freedom, justice, purity/self -control, and humility. It is expected and understood that students who apply and are admitted to Loma Linda University will be committed to these values and will choose to support them. Chapter 4 - Page 36 Personal and professional int egrity are essential qualities for students and all members of the university community. Upholding the standards of professional and personal conduct includes acquiring behaviors and attitudes consistent with University values. It includes being accountabl e for one's own conduct as well as assuming responsibility for the professional behavior of one's colleagues. Examples of serious breaches of integrity include, but are not limited to, lying; cheating (including plagiarism); falsifying reports, records, and the results of research. Other examples which may appear to be minor, but which constitute misrepresentations of truth, and are thus also of concern, include such things as signing someone else's name on an attendance sheet (for a required class or mee ting) or signing oneself in as present and then leaving. Assuming responsibility for the professional behavior of one's colleagues means exemplifying integrity oneself, encouraging colleagues to be honest and responsible, and refusing to ignore or cover up serious breaches of integrity such as cheating, stealing, or falsifying records. Society rightfully expects the health care professions and scientific communities to be self -governing and trustworthy. The process of becoming a member of one these truste d professions begins when a student enters the University. 4.11.1 Definitions Loma Linda University defines academic integrity as the commitment of all members of the educational community (administration, faculty, students, and staff involved in learning, teaching, research, patient care, or service) to engage in conduct that reflects honesty, trust, fairness, mutual respect, and responsibility. (Adapted from a statement from The Center for Academic Integrity.) 4.11.2 Academic dishonesty Academic dishonesty is an act of deliberate deceit in the fulfillment of a student's obligations to the academic community. It includes, but is not limited to, the failure to observe rules of fairness in taking exams or writing papers, plagiarism, fabricat ion and cheating. a. Plagiarism is the act of presenting the work of another as if it were one's own. It includes quoting, paraphrasing, summarizing or utilizing material from the Internet or from books, articles in periodicals, magazines and newspape rs without appropriate citation. However, any unacknowledged use of another's ideas constitutes plagiarism, including the use of papers written by other students, interviews, radio or TV broadcasts, and any published or unpublished materials (e.g. letters, pamphlets, leaflets, notes or documents). b. Fabrication is the act of contriving or making up material, data or other information (e.g. research data, patient test results) and submitting this as fact. c. Cheating is the act of deceiving, which includes such acts as looking at another's exam during any form of testing, using unauthorized aids (e.g. notes, electronic Chapter 4 - Page 37 equipment) to retrieve or communicate information during exams, or whatever else is deemed contrary to the rules of fairness, inclu ding violation of specific rules designated by the instructor of the course. d. Facilitation of academic dishonesty is the act of attempting to help someone engage in plagiarism, fabrication, cheating or any other type of academic dishonesty. 4.11.3 Procedures a. If any faculty member, employee or student of the University has reason to believe that academic dishonesty or unethical conduct may have occurred, he or she shall report the incident to the appropriate instructor, course director, student affairs or academic administrator of the school. Failure to report breaches of integrity is considered a failure of academic and/or professional responsibility \u2014 and thus, may be subject to disciplinary action by the University. b. When allegati ons of misconduct are made, the faculty member or school administrator is responsible to ensure that a preliminary inquiry is made to determine if the concerns/allegations are substantive. If there appears to be substantive evidence of misconduct the matte r must be reported to the dean or the dean's designee. This central reporting system allows patterns of behavior to be considered in determining the course of action. A discussion with the accused student will take place before further action is taken. The student will be informed if records of alleged incidents are to be filed and will have the opportunity to submit a written response. c. the dean or dean's designee determines that further action should be taken and/or that the matter should be referred to the school's designated academic committee, the student shall be informed in writing. Some schools may have additional procedures/proce sses for arriving at formal action. In such cases, the school policy will apply d. The action will be reported to the involved student by the dean or dean's designee. Where schools do not have other specific policies governing these issues, the followi ng process will be used for an appeal: e. Appeal of Dismissal (1) The student, after the actions and recommendations of the designated academic committee, may appeal to the Dean of the School who may uphold or modify the sanction(s) recommended by the hearing committee. In all cases, the action of the Dean is final. (2) The Dean, in sole discretion, shall determine whether the student is suspended pending the final decision of the appeal or if the student may continue to attend classes and/ or conduct clinical activities. Chapter 4 - Page 38 4.12.0 Nondiscrimination and affirmative action policy Loma Linda University affirms that Christian principles are not compatible with various forms of discrimination that have divided societies. Loma Linda University further affirms that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and that they should be so regarded by all of His people. Moreover, this nation was founded upon the ideals of equal worth of all persons and equal opportunity for each individual to r ealize his or her fullest potential. Therefore, the University is committed to teaching and observing the biblical principles of equality. The law does not require Loma Linda University to have a written program of affirmative action; but, in the spirit of the law, the University has issued this program as a guide to its employees, supporters, and students to enlighten and assist in implementing a policy of affirmative action throughout the University. The University reserves the right to express disagr eement from time to time with reference to specific remedies and regulations that may be proposed to eradicate discrimination. A delicate balance must be found between affirmatively seeking to assist those in a discriminated class and providing equal oppor tunity for all individuals, whether or not in such discriminated class. The University is committed to going the second mile and beyond to try to strike this delicate balance. The task is impossible if the only resources are legislation and litigation, but it is possible in an atmosphere of cooperation and understanding among all concerned. The free exercise of religion guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States includes the right to establish and maintain religious educational institutions. Loma Linda University is incorporated as a California religious nonprofit corporation, owned and operated by the Seventh - day Adventist Church as an integral part of the church's teaching and healing ministries. Federal and state guidelines clearly recognize the right of religious institutions to seek personnel and students who support the goals of the institution, including the right to give preference in employment of faculty and staff and admission of students to members of the church that sponsors the inst itution. The University is committed to equal education and employment opportunities for men and women. While Loma Linda University (LLU) gives preference in its selection processes to students and employees who are aligned with the faith -based mission of the University and the Seventh -day Adventist Church, LLU does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, medical condition, physical handicap, mental condition, veteran's status, or age in the provision of any of its services. Further, LLU is committed to providing a work environment that is free of unlawful discrimination and harassment . In keeping with this commitment, LLU strictly prohibits all forms of harassment, including but not limited to sexual harassment and harassment based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, medical condition, physical handicap, mental condition, veteran's status, or age. Also prohibited is retaliation of any kind against individuals who file complaints in good faith or who assist in an LLU investigation. These policies apply to admissions, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or any University - administered program Chapter 4 - Page 39 4.13.0 Pornography Pornography is destructive, demeaning, desensitizing, and exploitative. It is a systematic practice of exploitation and subordination based on sex that harms its victims and subjects. It promotes injury and degradation such as rape, battery, a nd prostitution; and inhibits just enforcement of laws against these acts. It damages relationships and undermines individuals' equal exercise of civil rights and educational and work opportunities. As such, it has no place in the employment or learning en vironment of any LLUH entity. a. Definition For purposes of this policy, the term \"pornography\" shall include, but not be limited to, presentation or depiction of individuals \u2014whether in pictures or in words \u2014in a context that objectifies them as sex objects in scenarios of degradation, injury, or tor ture, in a context that makes these conditions sexual. All LLUH entities a. prohibit the possession, viewing, downloading, and exchange, transmission, storing, copying, or reading of pornography in the workplace or place of learning or on any equipment that uses or accesses LLUH academic or patient systems. NOTE: This list is not intended to be inclusive of all prohibited activity. b. All persons in supervisory and administrative positions are required to be trained regarding their reporting and disci plinary responsibilities in the discovery of pornography in the workplace. NOTE: Such training may be presented in conjunction with sexual harassment - prevention training. c. LLU prohibit all employees or students from conducting research on pornography issues unless they obtain written authorization from their vice president or dean to conduct such research. d. All violations of these policies shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment or student expulsion. e. All suspected or alleged violations of this policy shall be reported immediately to: (1) the assistant vice president or manager of employee relations in the Human Resources Management (HRM) Department \u2014whether the violation involves physicians, students, or employees. (2) the designated vice president of the entity, if an employee is involved . (3) the vice president for student experience , if a student is involved. f. At the discretion of the vice president, the Employee (EAP)/Student Assistance Program (SAP) may be notified and/or consulted. Employees or students may also be referred to the EAP/SAP for evaluation and/or referral. Chapter 4 - Page 40 g. All discoveries of involvement in child pornography shall be reported to the local police department by the entity employing the involved individual. The violation shall also be reported to: (1) the assistant vice president or manager of employee relations in the HRM Department \u2014whether the violation involves physicians, students, or employees. (2) the dean of the academic school, if University personnel are involved. (3) the LLU vice president for student experience , if students are involved. h. No supervisor or administrator s hall impede or inhibit the reporting duties required under the California Penal Code Section 11165 et seq. Persons making such a report shall not be subject to any sanction for making the report. i. Students shall be required to adhere to the provisions of this policy and, more specifically, to the requirements in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook . 4.14.0 Disability accommodation policy Introduction Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act o f 1973 states that: \"No otherwise qualified person with a disability in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of ... disability, be denied the benefits of, or be excluded from participation in, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or act ivity receiving federal financial assistance.\" Loma Linda University supports the integration of all qualified individuals into the programs of the University and is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal opportunity for all students with a documented disability. At LLU, students, faculty, deans or dean's designee, department chairs, and the Appeals Committee for Students with Disabilities (chaired by the vice president for student services) all play a joint role in ensuring equal acce ss to campus facilities and programs. Definitions a. An \"individual with a disability\" is someone with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more \"major life activities.\" Physical or mental impairments include, for example, specific learning disabilities, emotional or mental illnes s, visual impairments, deafness and hearing impairments, mobility impairments, and some chronic illnesses. b. \"Major life activity\" means functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, worki ng, and learning. A person is Student Handbook 63 considered to be an individual with a disability and protected by the law if he/she has the disability, has a record of having the disability, or is regarded as having the disability. c. A \"qualified per son with a disability\" means an individual who, with reasonable modifications or \"accommodations\" (if necessary) to rules, policies or practices, the Chapter 4 - Page 41 removal of barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services meets the eligibility requirements fo r receipt of services and participation in programs or activities. d. \"Accommodation\" refers to a change in the status quo. A \"reasonable accommodation\" in the student setting is a modification or adjustment to a course, program, activity, or building t hat allows the person with a disability to participate as fully as possible in the programs and activities offered by the University. 4.14.1 Students Oversee students with disabilities are required to meet the same academic standards as other students at the University. Services that may be provided students with disabilities include, but are not limited to, advocacy and disability advising, classroom and testing accommodations, sign language interpreting, housing accommodations, taped/scanned books, a ssistive technology training, referral for testing or additional services, and an orientation workshop on services for incoming students. At LLU, the dean's office of the school in which the student is enrolled is responsible for evaluating and maintainin g all disability records for students with disabilities. The dean's office arranges for determining eligibility for services and provides verification of the disability based on the evaluation that the student may use to acquire a needed accommodation for specific courses. Students identify themselves to the dean's office at the individual school to request services or accommodations. Documentation of a disability is required. All information regarding a disability is considered confidential. A student is responsible for making arrangements for accommodations by providing his or her instructors with a letter from the dean's office requesting the approved accommodations. Faculty members are responsible for implementing accommodations as outlined in the Dean 's Letter. (See \"Accommodation Requests\") School deans and department chairs ensure that faculty and students are informed about Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which states: \"No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the Unit ed States... shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance and that faculty fulfill t heir roles in assisting with approved accommodations.\" Only deans or their designees have the right to waive, substitute, or adjust course or degree requirements. The vice president for enrollment management and student services resolves conflicts in the provision of reasonable accommodations or denial of accommodations by the dean's office. Students requesting an accommodation should first contact the associate dean for student affairs in the school, who will assist the student in obtaining appropriate documentation with recommendations for accommodation. 4.14.2 Grievance Chapter 4 - Page 42 Each school shall have a grievance committee appointed and charged with reviewing the student's complaints regarding disability policies and procedures. The members of the grievance committee shall be appointed by the vice president for enrollment manageme nt and student services. Members of the grievance committee shall be comprised of faculty, staff, and administrators in a variety of specialized areas \u2014 including but not limited to health care, counseling and educational psychology, educational assessment a nd measurement, disability issues, and student advisement from the school in which the student is enrolled. The committee shall primarily comprise faculty and staff from the school in which the student is enrolled. (See Student Handbook for more details) 4.15.0 Sexual standards policy Faculty, staff, students, administrators, and trustees of Loma Linda University Health are expected to respect and honor Christian sexual standards as held by the Seventh -day Adventist Church. We believe that God's ideal fo r sexuality is achieved when premarital and extramarital sexual expression and conduct are chaste and behaviors that suggest otherwise are avoided. All forms of sexual abuse and exploitation will not be tolerated and will result in disciplinary action. a. Romantic relationships and dating The University wishes to promote the ethical and efficient operation of its academic programs and business. In this setting, the University wishes to avoid misunderstandings; complaints of favoritism; romantic relatio nship issues pertaining to supervision, security, and morale; as well as possible claims of sex discrimination and sexual misconduct among its students, staff, and faculty. For these reasons: (1) A faculty member is prohibited from pursuing a romantic relationship with or dating a student who is registered in any course or program or who is involved in any other academic activity in which the faculty member is responsible as an instructor, coordinator, mentor, or committee member for the duration of suc h course, program, or other academic activity. (2) A staff member is prohibited from pursuing a romantic relationship with or dating a student who is registered in any course or program or who is involved in any other academic activity in which the staf f member participates in any direct supporting role for the duration of such course, program, or other academic activity. (3) A University administrator or supervisor is prohibited from pursuing a romantic relationship with or dating any employee of th e University whom he/she supervises for the duration of the supervision. For purposes of this policy, \"romantic relationship\" is defined as a mutually desired courting activity between two individuals. \"Dating\" is defined as a romantic social engagement arranged by personal invitation between the two individuals involved or arranged by a third party. Chapter 4 - Page 43 Faculty, staff, and administrators who violate these guidelines will be subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment and/or loss of faculty appointment. Students who participate in the violation of these guidelines will be subject to discipline up to and including discontinuance as a student at LLU.

These virtues are essential for each member if these professions are to continue to maintain their position of trust within society. The establ ishment of codes of ethics, peer review committees, ethics committees, and other regulatory and/or advisory groups within the professions indicate a vital and continuing concern with maintaining high standards of integrity. Professional standards provide a means of educating and training future professionals in areas of ethical conduct and are intended to aid in developing an ethical and moral awareness that will help the individual serve in an enlightened manner. In addition, the University seeks to broad en students' ethical perspectives by including a religious perspective . By adding a spiritual foundation to the profession's ethical framework, it is anticipated that the professional's ethic life will be one that not only reflects a proper concern for fe llow human beings, but one that also reflects an intimate relationship with God, our Creator. Students must conduct themselves at all times in a manner representative of their profession and school. Students share responsibility for maintaining an enviro nment conducive to learning. Any activity that interferes with the learning processes or that violates the integrity of the profession as a whole is not acceptable. The following list is illustrative of the type of conduct that violates the University's expectation for student conduct and is cause for discipline up to and including dismissal. It is not an exhaustive or all -inclusive list but is stated here for purposes of illustration: 5.1.1 Failure to respect individual rights This includes: a. Physically or verbally abusing any person or eng aging in conduct that threatens or endangers the health, safety, or wellbeing of others; b.

Slander and libel (1) disrespect for individual and University property, including theft and vandalism , (2) refusal or failure to remediate documented u nsatisfactory performance (3) personal conduct that is incompatible with the standards of morality and propriety of the Seventh -day Adventist Church , (4) overt disharmony, subversion, or violation of the philosophy, objectives, and policies of the Univers ity, (5) gambling or betting , (6) failure to obey, honor, and sustain civil law , (7) arrogance and insubordination , (8) patient abuse . Chapter 5 - Page 4 5.1.2 Professional ethics in the clinical setting Professional ethics consistent with the Christian understanding of the value and importance of all persons should be reflected in relationships with patients. While clinical activities will rightfully be focused on learning, the patient's needs should always be the primary co ncern. Altruism must be learned and practiced from the earliest moment of the student's program and reinforced in all aspects of the professional training. Patient abuse will not be tolerated. Patient abuse includes any behavior or act that might jeopard ize the health or well -being of a patient. Examples of patient mistreatment or abuse include but are not limited to: a. unsupervised and/or unauthorized treatment of a patient b. treating a patient while under the influence of alcohol or drugs c. failure to comply with clinic policies regarding patient treatment and documentation d. failure to comply with established protocols for infection control e. refusal to properly treat any patient for reasons of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, financial status, handicap, or disability f. patient abandonment g. any breach of confidentiality, except as required by law or University policy h. failure to report an observed incident of patient mistreatment or abuse 5.2.0 Political activity 5.2.1 General Guidelines a. The University does not engage in partisan politics in any form. b. The University does not give approval or endorse an individual running for public office. \"Political Activities\" Limitation of Internal Revenue Code #501(c)(3) states \"not participate in or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements) any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office.\" c. Those who in their official capacity frequently speak for the University should undertake to make clear whe n expressing individual views that they are not stating a University position. Chapter 5 - Page 5 d. Every member of the University has a right to participate or not, as they see fit, in the election process.

(See LLUH Policies and Student Handbook for more detail ) 5.3.0 Lifestyle Loma Linda University, a Seventh -day Adventist health -science university, in harmony with its heritage, fosters a lifestyle among its faculty, students, and administrators that contributes to health and a joyous Christian experience. Faculty are called upo n to model behavior which students will follow in the practice of their professions and in their personal lives. This section sets forth policies in some of the areas of lifestyle which are of special concern. The over -arching moral principles of the Bible serve, in the broader context, as the ultimate guide for Christian living to which Loma Linda University is commi tted. 5.3.1 University image. Loma Linda employs and trains health professionals, scientists, and scholars. As representatives of the University, it is essential that the appearance of faculty members reflect the institution's commitment to excellence , health and safety, and conservative corporate values. An appropriate, clean and professional appearance becomes a matter of considerable importance, especially when the faculty member is teaching, serving Chapter 5 - Page 6 patients, or meeting the public as a representati ve of the University. Department chairs and deans are responsible for: a. orientation of faculty and faculty applicants to this standard b. responding to any questions which may arise c. handling any areas of noncompliance which may occur. 5.3.2 Drug -free worksite policy and procedures Loma Linda University is dedicated to its motto, \"To Make Man Whole.\" As such, it is committed to provide a learning environment contributive to the fullest possible development. The University adopts the temperan ce practices and health principles espoused by the Seventh -day Adventist Church. This means that all faculty, employees, and students are expected to refrain from the use of alcohol, controlled substances, or tobacco while enrolled or employed at the Unive rsity. Violation of this policy is subject to review and action pursuant to faculty, employee, and student disciplinary and severance policies and the University's Drug -Free Worksite Policy. In compliance with the Drug -free Workplace Act of 1988 and in harmony with the laws of the land, Loma Linda University prohibits the unlawful use, possession, distribution, dispensing, or manufacture of controlled substances by its employees, which include s faculty, staff, or students. Further, the University expects any person employed by the University who receives federal funding as an individual to certify that he or she will not engage in the unlawful use, possession, distribution, dispensing, or manuf acture of a controlled substance while associated with the University. Failure to comply with these policies will result in discipline up to and including expulsion or termination and, if appropriate, notification of law enforcement agencies for prosecutio n. The University provides an active educational program for its faculty, administrators, staff, and students to help them develop an awareness of the risks involved in alcohol, tobacco, and drug use and to promote the benefits of a lifestyle free of tho se substances. The University may, in its discretion, provide therapeutic assistance for employees and students, who, because of abuse of these substances, have impaired function within the University community. Components of a drug -free workplace: a. Prevention. (1) The policy of a drug -free workplace for faculty, staff, and students is included in the \"Faculty, Student, and Staff Handbooks \". Faculty, staff, and students are notified of the policy at the time of employment or appointment and on an annual basis . Students are notified on acceptance into educational programs of the various schools within the University. Each school will publish in its bulletin the manner in which it addresses drug and alcohol counseling, treatment, and rehabilitation programs and discipline, using the guidelines set forth in this document. Chapter 5 - Page 7 (2) Faculty and staff are provided training in drug awareness, observing for impairment possibly due to drug use, the dangers of drug use and abuse, and early intervention and ref erral techniques.

The University will use current scientific information and procedures to ensure that the environm ent, which includes patient care equipment, is safe for human use; to educate individuals about their responsibility to reduce the risk of communicable disease transmission by using accepted infection control measures; to provide appropriate protective equ ipment in certain patient care situations; and to ensure that providers of care comply with immunization requirements. The University will comply with state and federal regulations on communicable disease transmission prevention and will maintain high lega l and ethical standards to protect the confidentiality of individuals with communicable diseases and to protect their right for compassionate care regardless of disease condition 5.5.1 Immunization requirements As an academic health science university, Loma Linda is dedicated to the health and welfare of our students, professors, healthcare workers and community members. Because of this, it is necessary for students to have immunizations against certain infectiou s diseases. Loma Linda University is committed to preventing communicable disease transmission among its faculty, staff, students, and the patients they serve through a program that includes education, immunizations, safe environments, and provision for special protective measures where scientific literature identifies a risk of transmission . This policy meets a high ethical standard as well as the legal requirements to : a. protect students, faculty, staff, and patients from communicable disease transmiss ion; b. maintain the confidentiality of infected persons; and c. protect the right of every individual for compassionate care regardless of disease condition. The University shall maintain a standing communicable disease committee, including representatives from Loma Linda University Medical Center (with infectious disease and epidemiology expertise) and Student Health Service. Its members will utilize CDC recom mendations to develop regulatory guidelines, procedures, and educational modules that apply throughout the University and include all students, faculty, and staff.
