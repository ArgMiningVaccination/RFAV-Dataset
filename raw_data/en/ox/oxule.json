Specifically created to help you tap into the potent power of scent, we recommend pairing it with your favourite MELIS perfume to create desirable moments and cultivate feelings of positive intent. I'm sure you will feel the love, intention and power of this collaboration as you listen and journey within. With love, Karen Jones, creator and voice of MELIS meditation Creators of the MELIS meditation Our bespoke MELIS meditation was inspired by the bee's way of conscious being and created by the transcendent Karen Jones from Awakened Ones. Its music was channelled by local sound artist Sheleah Nahshon and is reminiscent of nature, our light and divine frequency. Music producer Simon Walsh recorded and produced the meditation. All are dear friends of MELIS and generously weaved their magic to collaborate and bring this beautiful meditation to life. Why use scent with your meditation? Unlike the other senses, scent has the unique ability to bypass the brain's thalamus, travelling straight to the olfactory bulb which is directly linked to the brain's limbic system and comprised of the hippocampus (related to memory) and amygdala (processes emotions). Scent is therefore able to influence our emotions and memory and can be used to imprint desired emotions into the subconscious mind replacing unhelpful stored emotions and belief systems. We invite you to tap into the potent power of scent by pairing our meditation with a MELIS perfume. Try [Imperium ](https://melisperfumery.com/product/imperium/)for empowerment or [Amandi](https://melisperfumery.com/product/amandi/) for self-compassion or allow your intuition to guide your selection. How to use MELIS to enhance your mood The following technique harnesses the power of the high vibrational plant matter within MELIS and its scent to positively influence emotion through stimulation of your body's electromagnetic field and olfactory processing system. It is a powerful technique that can either take a few moments or be extended into a meditation. Repetition is recommended. After sufficient repetitions and application, your chosen scent affirms the memorised feeling to your brain and energy system so that every time you smell that particular scent the desired feeling will be evoked within your systems. Five simple steps... 1. Select your natural scent by allowing your intuition to guide you. 2. Ground your energy by connecting to a point within the earth ~30cm below the centre of your feet and then take a moment to reflect on how you want to feel eg: calm, safe, loving, compassionate, patient. 3. Apply your chosen MELIS scent to your neck and temples. Hold the perfume near your nose and take three deep breaths. 4. As you take your breaths remember a specific time, place, event where you felt your desired feeling eg: calm, safe, loving, compassionate, patient. Visualise this memory and feel into your body exactly how it felt at that point in time. 5. Once you have taken your breaths and felt the memory, verbalise your chosen affirmation - out loud or in your head - whilst seeing yourself experiencing the feeling in the future. Remember to feel into the feeling of this emotion as this is the key to this technique's success. Here are some examples of affirmations that can be used: \"I am safe and loved\" \"I am calm and relaxed\" \"I am patient and kind\" \"I have clarity with my decision making\" \"I am worthy of success\" Sources for five simple steps technique: Leonie Gully, Moonhaven Clinical Aromatherapist "}
