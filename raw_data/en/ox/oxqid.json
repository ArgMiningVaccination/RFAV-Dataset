Academic Department and Program Abbreviations11 Santa Clara University Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Santa Clara University is a comprehen - sive Jesuit, Catholic university with more than 8,800 students. Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, California's oldest operating higher education institution offers a rigorous undergraduate curriculum in arts and sciences, business, and engineering, plus nationally recognized graduate and professional programs in business, law, engineering, education, counseling psychology, and pastoral ministries. The University boasts a diverse community of scholars offering a values-oriented curriculum characterized by small class sizes and a dedication to educating students for competence, conscience, and compassion. The tradi - tions of Jesuit education\u2014educating the whole person for a life of service\u2014run deep in all of its curricular and co-curricular programs. Santa Clara University is perennially ranked among the top comprehensive universities by U.S. News & World Report and has one of the highest graduation rates for undergraduate students among all comprehensive universities. The University has a national reputation for its undergraduate program that features a distinctive core curriculum, an integrated learning environment, and research opportunities for undergraduate students. The University was established as Santa Clara College on the site of the Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds, the eighth of the original 21 California missions. The college originally operated as a preparatory school and did not offer collegiate courses until 1853. Following the Civil War, enrollment increased, and by 1875 the size of the student body was 275. One-third of the students were enrolled in the collegiate division; the remainder attended the college's preparatory and high school departments. Santa Clara experienced slow and steady growth during its first 60 years, becoming the University of Santa Clara in 1912, when the schools of engineering and law were added. In 1925, the high school was separated from the University and took the name of Bellarmine College Preparatory in 1928. The Leavey School of Business opened in 1926, and within a decade, became one of the first business schools in the country to receive national accreditation. For 110 years, Santa Clara was an all-male school. In the fall of 1961, women were accepted as undergraduates, and Santa Clara became the first coeducational Catholic university in California. The decision resulted in an admissions explosion\u2014from 1,500 students to more than 5,000. The size of the faculty tripled, and the University began the largest building program in school history, building eight residence halls, a student union, and an athletic stadium. In the early 1970s, the Board of T rustees voted to limit the size of the undergraduate population, an action that was intended to preserve the character and ensure the quality of the University for generations to come. In 1985, the University adopted \"Santa Clara University\" as its official name.2 SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY VISION, MISSION, AND FUNDAMENTAL VALUES Santa Clara University has adopted three directional statements to describe the kind of university it aspires to become (Strategic Vision), its core purpose and the constituencies it serves (University Mission), and the beliefs that guide its actions (Fundamental Values). Strategic Vision Santa Clara University will educate citizens and leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion and cultivate knowledge and faith to build a more humane, just, and sustainable world. University Mission The University pursues its vision by creating an academic community that educates the whole person within the Jesuit, Catholic tradition, making student learning our central focus, continuously improving our curriculum and co-curriculum, strengthening our schol - arship and creative work, and serving the communities of which we are a part in Silicon Valley and around the world. Student learning takes place at the undergraduate and graduate level in an educational environment that integrates rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. As an academic community, we expand the boundaries of knowledge and insight through teaching, research, artistic expression, and other forms of scholarship. It is primarily through discovering, communicating, and applying knowledge that we exercise our institu - tional responsibility as a voice of reason and conscience in society. We offer challenging academic programs and demonstrate a commitment to the devel - opment of: Undergraduate students who seek an education with a strong humanistic orienta - tion in a primarily residential setting Graduate students, many of them working professionals in Silicon Valley, who seek advanced degree programs that prepare them to make significant contributions to their fields In addition to these core programs, we also provide a variety of continuing education and professional development opportunities for nonmatriculated students. Fundamental Values The University is committed to these core values, which guide us in carrying out our mission and realizing our vision: Academic Excellence . We seek an uncompromising standard of excellence in teaching, learning, creativity, and scholarship within and across disciplines. Search for Truth, Goodness, and Beauty . We prize scholarship and creative work that advance human understanding, improve teaching and learning, and add to the betterment of society by illuminating the most significant problems of the day and exploring the endur - ing mysteries of life. In this search, our commitment to academic freedom is unwavering. Engaged Learning . We strive to integrate academic reflection and direct experience in the classroom and the community, especially to understand and improve the lives of those with the least education, power, and wealth. Commitment to Students . As teachers and scholars, mentors and facilitators, we endeavor to educate the whole person. We nurture and challenge students\u2014intellectually, spiritually, SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 3 aesthetically, morally, socially, and physically\u2014preparing them for leadership and service to the common good in their professional, civic, and personal lives. Service to Others . We promote throughout the University a culture of service\u2014service not only to those who study and work at Santa Clara but also to society in general and to its most disadvantaged members as we work with and for others to build a more humane, just, faith-filled, and sustainable world. Community and Diversity . We cherish our diverse and inclusive community of students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni, a community that is enriched by people of differ - ent backgrounds, respectful of the dignity of all its members, enlivened by open communi - cation, and caring and just toward others. Jesuit Distinctiveness . We treasure our Jesuit heritage and tradition, which incorporates all of these core values. This tradition gives expression to our Jesuit educational mission and Catholic identity while also welcoming and respecting other religious and philosophical traditions, promoting the dialogue between faith and culture, and valuing opportunities to deepen religious beliefs.

The Department of Education offers credential programs in teacher preparation (i.e., California preliminary multiple-subject and single-subject teach - ing credentials and California Clear credential) focusing on preparing teachers for public and Catholic schools; programs in educational administrator preparation (i.e., programs for the Preliminary California Administrative Services credential and the California Clear Administrative Services credential, and a certificate program in Catholic School Leadership); and Master of Arts programs in Educational Administration and in Interdisciplinary Education (with emphasis options in Science, Technology, Environmental Education, and Mathematics (STEEM); Curriculum and Instruction; and Catholic Education). The Department of Counseling Psychology offers two degree programs: Masters of Arts in Counseling Psychology and Masters of Arts in Counseling. The Masters of Arts in Counseling Psychology can lead to state licensure for marriage and family therapists and/or licensed professional clinical counselors. The department includes emphasis programs in health, career, correctional, and Latino counseling. On July 1, 2009, the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley became the Jesuit School of Theology of Santa Clara University. The Jesuit School of Theology is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the United States operated by the Society of Jesus, as the order of Catholic priests is known. Additionally, it is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the country that offer three ecclesiastical degrees qualified by the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education, and it also offers four additional advanced theological degrees, as well as sabbatical and certificate programs for clergy, religious, and lay people. CENTERS OF DISTINCTION Santa Clara University has three Centers of Distinction that serve as major points of interaction between the University and society. Each center focuses on a theme that is central to Santa Clara's distinctive mission as a Jesuit university and offers an educational environment integrating rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. Each center engages faculty and students from different disciplines, as well as experts and leaders from the community through speakers, conferences, workshops, and experiential learning opportunities. Center for Science, Technology, and Society The Center for Science, Technology, and Society (CSTS) promotes the use of science and technology for the common good. CSTS unites a range of stakeholders to enhance civic understanding, business decisions, and public policy on the social impacts of innovation through selected programming including workshops, forums, international conferences and awards, and educational programs. With strong partnerships in the Silicon Valley, CSTS also conducts and sponsors cross-disciplinary research and curriculum development that address the societal and organizational consequences of technological advances. Com - plementing this outreach, CSTS also seeks to shape well-rounded citizens of tomorrow through an interdisciplinary minor that analyzes the social, political, and environmental consequences of innovation. Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education The Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education is dedicated to preserving and enhancing the Jesuit and Catholic mission and identity of Santa Clara University through the exploration of the Ignatian vision, the educational and spiritual legacy of St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 5 of the Society of Jesus. Following the Jesuit ideal of being \"contemplatives in action,\" the Ignatian Center seeks to integrate faith and justice in a scholarly way and combine Ignatian reflection with active community engagement. The Pedro Arrupe, S.J., Partnerships for Community-Based Learning educates students and the University as a whole in the realities of the lives of the marginalized and the poor through community placements in Santa Clara County. The Bannan Institute for Jesuit Educational Mission assists the University in keeping its Catholic and Jesuit character at the center of the educational enterprise by encouraging all members of the campus community to reflect on, discuss, and creatively explore Catholic and Jesuit ideals. The Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, S.J., Solidarity Program offers students, faculty, staff, and alumni immersion experiences in the reality of our globalizing world. Markkula Center for Applied Ethics The Markkula Center for Applied Ethics is one of the preeminent centers for research and dialogue on ethical issues in critical areas of American life. The center works with fac - ulty, staff, students, community leaders, and the public to address ethical issues more effec - tively in teaching, research, and action. The center's focus areas are business, health care and biotechnology, character education, government, global leadership, technology, and emerg - ing issues in ethics. Articles, cases, briefings, and dialogue in all fields of applied ethics are available through the center. FACULTY Santa Clara University's emphasis on a community of scholars and integrated education attracts faculty members who are as committed to students' intellectual and moral develop - ment as they are to pursuing their own scholarship. The University's 461 full-time faculty members include Fulbright professors, nationally recognized authors and poets, ground - breaking scientists, and distinguished economic theorists. STUDENT BODY Santa Clara University has a student population of 8,800, with about 5,200 undergradu - ate students and 3,600 graduate students.

CAMPUS The University is located on a 106-acre campus in the city of Santa Clara near the southern end of the San Francisco Bay in one of the world's great cultural centers and in the heart of the Silicon Valley. At the campus center is the Mission Church, restored in 1928 and sur - rounded by the roses and palm and olive trees of the historic Mission Gardens. The adjacent Adobe Lodge is the oldest building on campus, having been restored in 1981 to its 1822 decor. There are more than 50 buildings on campus housing 15 student residences, a main library and a law library, two student centers, the de Saisset Museum, the Center of Performing Arts, extensive athletic facilities, and a recreation and fitness center. Computer and telecommunications technology is an integral part of the life and learning at Santa Clara University. All residence hall rooms and most classrooms are connected to high-speed Internet access and campus email, and most of the campus is covered by a wireless network. The Joanne E. Harrington Learning Commons, Sobrato Family Technology Center, and Orradre Library, which opened in 2008, provides facilities for both individual and group study in an inviting, light-filled, and open environment. The building contains both wired and wireless networks throughout the facility, and two third-floor terraces provide outdoor workspaces with a view. At the \"Start Here\" desk on the first floor, librarians pro - vide assistance in identifying, evaluating, and retrieving information at the library, and Information Technology (IT) staff provide tech support for basic issues and referrals to the IT Service Center on the third floor for more complicated issues. A notable feature of the building is the Automated Retrieval System (ARS), a high-density storage area where up to 900,000 volumes can be stored by size in more than 11,000 bins and retrieved using robotic-assisted technology. The ARS can be viewed by the public from both inside the building (from a second-floor viewing area) and outside the building (from the south side). Other features of the building include the two-level Information Commons; a multimedia lab; several drop-in computer labs; the Saint Clare Room, which can be used for quiet study, small lectures, book events, and other public gatherings; and the third floor gallery, which features a regular schedule of exhibits. The Robert F . Benson Memorial Center serves as the hub of campus life. The Benson Center is the home for a variety of services for students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests of the University and provides an environment for the education of the whole person that continues outside the classroom. The Benson Center offers dining services, houses the cam - pus bookstore and the campus post office, and provides meeting rooms and assistance with event planning. Offices of undergraduate student publications, the Multicultural Center, the Learning Resources Center, and the Writing Center are located in the Benson Center. The Paul L. Locatelli, S.J., Student Activity Center is home to the student government office, the student programming board, student volunteer service, and the Center for Student Leadership. The first new building in more than 40 years designed specifically with student activities in mind, the Locatelli Student Activity Center includes a 6,000 square-foot gathering hall with a high ceiling that can accommodate dances, concerts, as well as pre- and post-game activities. Designed with environmental sensitivity, the new building is energy efficient and has daytime lighting controls and motion sensors to maximize use of natural light.SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 7 The de Saisset Museum on the Santa Clara campus serves as caretaker of the University's California History Collection, which is on permanent view. The museum presents between six and 12 temporary exhibitions every year that showcase the diversity of art and history, exploring the work of local contemporary artists, providing enriching experiences, and addressing issues of contemporary society. Opportunities are available for undergraduate students to serve as museum docents. The Center of Performing Arts includes the Louis B. Mayer Theatre, the Fess Parker Studio Theatre, and the Recital Hall. Mayer Theatre is Santa Clara University's premier theatrical venue, housing 500 intimate seats in either a flexible proscenium or thrust stage setting. The Fess Parker Studio Theatre has no fixed stage or seating and with its black-box design, complete with movable catwalks, provides superb flexibility in an experimental set - ting. The 250-seat Recital Hall provides a contemporary setting where students, faculty, and guest artists offer a variety of performances. The Pat Malley Fitness and Recreation Center features a 9,500-square-foot weight train - ing and cardiovascular exercise room, three basketball courts, a swimming pool, and other facilities to support the recreational and fitness needs of the campus community. The University's intercollegiate athletic teams compete in the Leavey Center, Sullivan Aquatic Center, Stephen Schott Stadium, Buck Shaw Stadium, Degheri Tennis Center, and Marsalli Park.82 The Santa Clara Undergraduate Program Santa Clara University is committed to the education of the whole person in the Jesuit and Catholic tradition with a vision of developing men and women to be leaders of compe - tence, conscience, and compassion. The Santa Clara undergraduate program is designed for students who seek an integrated education with a strong humanistic orientation in a pri - marily residential setting. An integrated education is one that encourages students to seek connections between differing ways of knowing and being in the world, between different forms of knowledge within established disciplines, and between new knowledge and that which preceded it. Santa Clara's concept of the \"whole person\" inevitably embraces our social nature. When he inaugurated Santa Clara's sesquicentennial year, Father Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, then superior general of the Society of Jesus, noted that \"Tomorrow's 'whole person' cannot be whole without an educated awareness of society and culture with which to contribute socially, generously, in the real world.\" Calling for a new Jesuit educational standard, \"to educate the whole person of solidarity in the real world,\" he explained: \"Students, in the course of their formation, must let the gritty reality of this world into their lives, so they can learn to feel it, think about it critically, respond to its suffering, and engage in it construc - tively. They should learn to perceive, think, judge, choose, and act for the rights of others, especially the disadvantaged and the oppressed.\" The Santa Clara undergraduate program offers a curriculum and other learning experi - ences whose content and pattern combine the acquisition and creation of knowledge with the quest for meaning and purpose. The learning environment encourages students to make connections across the Core Curriculum, the academic major, and elective courses. It helps students relate their classroom learning with out-of-classroom learning through commu - nity-based education, Residential Learning Communities, student organizations, athletics and recreation, and other experiences. In a more general way, the undergraduate program nurtures students' ability to knit the intellectual, social, moral, spiritual, creative, and behav - ioral aspects of life into a coherent and meaningful whole. Santa Clara University offers undergraduate degrees leading to the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Science in Commerce with majors in 51 fields. The College of Arts and Sciences offers majors in ancient studies, anthropology, art history, biochemistry, biology, chemistry, classical languages and literatures (Greek and/or Latin), classical studies, communication, computer science, economics, engineering physics, English, environmental science, environmental studies, ethnic studies, French and Francophone studies, German studies, history, individual studies, Italian studies, liberal studies, mathematics, music, philosophy, physics, political science, psychology, public health science, religious studies, sociology, Spanish studies, studio art, theatre arts, and women's and gender studies. The college also houses the graduate program in Pastoral Ministries, through which it offers the Master of Arts degree in catechetics, pastoral liturgy, spirituality, and liturgical music.

A wide range of departmental and school minors, emphases in majors, and concentra - tions in degree programs are available to enhance the major field of study for students. Consistent with the commitment to an integrated educational experience, interdisciplinary minors are offered in Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern studies; Asian studies; bioengi - neering; biotechnology; and society; international business; international studies; Latin American studies, Medieval and Renaissance studies; musical theatre; retail studies; science, technology, and society; and urban education. THE SANTA CLARA CORE CURRICULUM A university expresses its most basic values in its Core Curriculum, that part of an undergraduate education required of all students. Santa Clara's Core Curriculum explicitly integrates three traditions of higher education. As a Catholic university, it is rooted in the tradition of pursuing an understanding of God through the free exercise of reason. As a Jesuit university, it promotes a humanistic education that leads toward an ethical engagement with the world. As a comprehensive American university committed to liberal education, Santa Clara seeks to prepare its students for intelligent, responsible and creative citizenship. Reflecting these traditions, the Core Curriculum provides every undergraduate with the common learning that all students need to become leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion. The distinctiveness of a Santa Clara education emerges in the Core Curriculum, both in its sense of purpose rooted in the University's traditions and in its commitment to a breadth of learning that complements and supports all majors. The Core Curriculum opens students to the study and practice of the arts, humanities, mathematics, technology, natural sciences, and social sciences. It educates students for ethically informed participation in civic life. Opportunities for experiential learning foster the development of compassion and atten - tion to the ways human suffering can be alleviated. Reflecting the University's founding mission, the Core Curriculum includes a disciplined and critical reflection on the religious dimensions of human existence. In addition, because the Core Curriculum continually highlights the critical and compelling questions facing individuals and communities, the Core Curriculum supports students both in making professional career choices and in discerning their larger vocation\u2014their life's purpose in the world. Learning Goals: What will students learn in the Core Curriculum? Because a liberal education in the Jesuit tradition is oriented toward particular ends, the Core Curriculum affirms a set of central learning goals. These goals are divided among three broad categories\u2014Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with the World. Knowledge To be prepared for well-informed engagement in society, students must comprehend the forces that have shaped the world they have inherited and the ways the world is interpreted and understood. They must also understand how they might transform the world for the 10 THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM better. The Core Curriculum deepens students' knowledge of the ideas and ways of knowing that emerge from the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences. Global Cultures : The intertwined development of global ideas, institutions, religions, and cultures, including Western cultures. Arts and Humanities : The production, interpretation, and social influence of the fine and performing arts, history, languages, literatures, philosophy, and religion Scientific Inquiry : The principles of scientific inquiry and how they are applied in the natural and social sciences Science and Technology : The formative influences, dynamics, social impacts, and ethical consequences of scientific and technological development Diversity : Diverse human experiences, identities, and cultures within local and global soci - eties, especially as formed by relations of power and privilege Civic Life : The roles, rights, and responsibilities of citizens and institutions in societies and in the world Habits of Mind and Heart To contribute to a rapidly changing, complex, and interdependent world, students must develop ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that allow them to educate themselves for the rest of their lives with passion and purpose. By attending to the cognitive and affective dimensions of human experience, the Core Curriculum enables students to think more deeply, imagine more freely, and communicate more clearly. Critical Thinking : The ability to identify, reflect upon, evaluate, integrate, and apply dif - ferent types of information and knowledge to form independent judgments Mathematics and Quantitative Reasoning : Analytical and logical thinking and the habit of drawing conclusions based on quantitative information Complexity : An approach to understanding the world that appreciates ambiguity and nuance as well as clarity and precision Ethical Reasoning : Drawing on ethical traditions to assess the consequences of individual and institutional decisions Religious Reflection : Questioning and clarifying beliefs through critical inquiry into faith and the religious dimensions of human existence Communication : Interacting effectively with different audiences, especially through writing, speech, and a second language Engagement with the World To engage with the world in meaningful ways, students need opportunities to explore and refine self-knowledge in relation to others. The Core Curriculum enhances students' understanding of the integrity of their own lives and the dignity inherent in the lives of others, especially the impoverished, suffering, and marginalized. Perspective : Seeking out the experience of different cultures and people, striving to view the world through their eyes Collaboration : The capacity to collaborate intellectually and creatively with diverse people Social Justice : Developing a disciplined sensibility toward the causes of human suffering and misery, and a sense of responsibility for addressing them Civic Engagement : Addressing major contemporary social issues, including environmental sustainability and peaceful resolution of conflict, by participating actively as an informed citizen of society and the worldTHE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 11 The Curriculum: What courses will students take in the Core Curriculum? Each course in the Core Curriculum addresses at least three of the learning goals listed above. Students have multiple opportunities to encounter, practice, and master each learn - ing goal. In addition, specific learning objectives for each area of the Core Curriculum have been developed by faculty Core Curriculum committees. These learning objectives are asso - ciated with particular learning goals and describe the knowledge, skills, and values students will be able to demonstrate after completing the courses in the Core Curriculum. The learn - ing objectives are posted on the Core Curriculum website and published annually in the Core Curriculum Guide. The structure of the Core features two phases of coursework designed to foster develop - mental learning and curricular coherence. The first phase, Foundations , consists of courses normally taken in the first year, introducing students to the processes and expectations for university-level education: Critical Thinking and Writing, Cultures and Ideas, a second language, mathematics, and the first course in the Religion, Theology, and Culture sequence. This phase helps students begin to set their own goals for learning, preparing them to make thoughtful choices in the Core Curriculum, their majors, and co-curricular activities. The second phase, Explorations , includes courses that expand students' understanding of a broad range of knowledge and abilities needed for effective participation in contempo - rary life. Each student will take courses in ethics, civic engagement, diversity, arts, social science, natural science, and science, technology and society, and they will take additional courses in the Cultures and Ideas, and Religion, Theology, and Culture sequences. Many Explorations courses overlap with courses in students' majors. The Core Curriculum also includes Integrations that help students make connections among courses in the Core Curriculum and between the Core Curriculum and their majors. Integrations usually are not additional courses. Rather, they are components of other courses. One Integrations course includes an experiential learning element oriented toward issues of social justice. One course involves an advanced writing component. Students also link a set of Core Curriculum, major, and/or elective courses into an interdisciplinary Pathway. Pathways foster integrative, intentional learning, providing opportunities for undergraduate research, complementing the majors, and encouraging the application of knowledge in the world. Pathways focus on a wide range of themes including American studies; applied ethics; beauty; children, family, and society; cinema studies; democracy; design thinking; the digital age; food, hunger, poverty and the environment; gender, sexual - ity and the body; global health; human rights in a global world; Islamic studies; justice and the arts; law and social justice; leading people, organizations and social change; paradigm shifts; politics and religion; public policy; race, place and social inequalities; sustainability; values in science and technology; and vocation. Student progress through the structure of the Core Curriculum is not strictly sequential, from Foundations through Explorations to Integrations . While some courses (e.g., Critical Thinking and Writing 1 and 2; Cultures and Ideas 1, 2, and 3; and Religion, Theology, and Culture 1, 2, and 3) must be taken in sequence, all students have the opportunity to dis - cover other sequences that are best for their individual undergraduate experience. At the same time, all students engage in coursework designed to help them achieve the shared set of learning objectives for each component of the Core Curriculum. Furthermore, the E xperiential Learning for Social Justice, Advanced Writing, and Pathways components of the Core Curriculum help students experience requirements not only as individual courses but as related educational activities that help structure and integrate their entire experience of university study.12 THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM The 2011-12 Core Curriculum Guide provides more detailed information about each component of the Core Curriculum, the learning goals and objectives associated with each component, and the courses from which students may choose. An online version is available at www.scu.edu/core. The Core Curriculum and the College of Arts and Sciences Students in the College of Arts and Sciences should consult Chapter 3 for the require - ments for their majors. There are no additional college-wide requirements beyond the requirements for the Undergraduate Core Curriculum. The Core Curriculum and the Leavey School of Business Leavey School of Business requirements determine how students in the business school satisfy some Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements\u2014some Core Curriculum requirements must be fulfilled with specific courses. Students in the Leavey School of Busi - ness should consult Chapter 4 for the complete list of requirements for the majors and the school. The Core Curriculum Guide provides additional information. The Core Curriculum and the School of Engineering Students in the School of Engineering satisfy their mathematics and natural science requirement with courses required by their majors; their second language requirement is met by Santa Clara's entrance requirements. Some sections of Core courses in Diversity, Cultures and Ideas 3, and Religion, Theology, and Culture 2 and 3 will allow engineering students to satisfy two requirements with one course, with the understanding that other coursework for their majors will complete the acquisition of knowledge and skills required in the Core. Engineering students will complete their Pathways with three courses. Core Curriculum Policies A single course may satisfy only one Core requirement, with the following exceptions: Some students satisfy some requirements with more than one course, each of which par - tially completes the requirement. Those courses are identified in Courseavail as \"xxxPAR\" because they \"partially\" fulfill a requirement. Engineering students may satisfy more than one requirement with one course when the course has been approved for those Core require - ments. All students may satisfy major requirements with Core courses when the courses are approved for both the major and the Core. All students may satisfy multiple Integrations requirements with courses that satisfy other Core and major requirements when the courses are approved for the Integrations requirements as well as for the other Core and major requirements. Many courses offered through the study abroad program are pre-approved to fulfill Core Curriculum requirements. Neither the first nor third level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology, and Culture can be fulfilled with a study abroad course. T ransfer students entering the University in fall 2011 normally follow the Core Curricu - lum described above. Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 7 and 8 as well as the chapters relevant to their school or college. T ransfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology, and Culture courses in the required sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any Advanced Placement or Interna - tional Baccalaureate test credit, must complete two courses from any two of the following three categories: Religion, Theology, and Culture 1, 2, or 3.THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 13 RESIDENTIAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES The Residential Learning Communities were established to further the goal of fostering integrated education within a community of scholars. By creating a culture in which stu - dents connect their academic experiences with their social and residential ones, the learning communities enhance the education of the whole person and deepen the connection between learning and living as responsible members of a community. All entering first-year students, whether or not they live on campus, become members of one of eight theme-based Residential Learning Communities. Nonresident first-year students are given access to the residence hall in which their learning community is located so that they can participate fully in its programs. Students take at least one course in common with others in their learning community, enriching coursework and promoting the formation of study groups. Students also interact directly with faculty and staff and participate in theme- based co-curricular and extracurricular activities both on and off campus. The Residential Learning Communities are primarily two-year communities, but some offer the opportu - nity for students to remain throughout their undergraduate careers. UNIVERSITY HONORS PROGRAM The University Honors Program provides a learning experience appropriate to students of exceptional academic talent and imagination. The program offers small seminar-style classes, especially in courses fulfilling the University Core Curriculum requirements. Admis - sion to the University Honors Program is by invitation or application and considers the student's academic record, standardized test scores, recommendations, and any other infor - mation the student might provide about interests, goals, or experiences. The program is organized as two distinct but related levels open to undergraduate stu - dents from arts and sciences, business, and engineering. Level I of the program accepts first-year students for a curriculum organized around courses that satisfy University Core Curriculum requirements applying to students in every field. The University Honors Pro - gram requires that all participants maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher, and Level I participants must successfully complete a minimum of six program courses within the first six quarters of enrollment. Most participants complete Level I dur - ing their first year. Unless exempted by the director, Level I participants must fulfill specific Foundations courses in the Core Curriculum\u2014Critical Thinking and Writing, Cultures and Ideas, and Religion, Theology, and Culture\u2014through special class sections arranged by the program. Participants are also strongly urged to satisfy Core Curriculum requirements such as mathematics, ethics, social sciences, natural sciences, advanced writing, and advanced Religion, Theology, and Culture with Honors Program sections. Participants in Level I normally continue to Level II, in which they complete a mini - mum of four additional program courses including a senior thesis or project. Students who have completed 32 or more units but not more than 88 units at Santa Clara may apply to enter Level II by contacting the Honors Program Office. Students joining the program at Level II complete six program courses including the thesis or senior project. Some Level II courses, while not limited to program participants, offer academic opportunities especially suitable for them. For both continuing and new participants, the thesis usually grows out of a regular or independent study course taken in conjunction with the participant's major or Pathway. Successful completion of the program at Level II becomes part of a student's per - manent record and appears on academic transcripts issued by the University.14 THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Honors Program students have the opportunity to participate in the Honors Advisory Council. The University Honors Program is allied with the Office of Student Fellowships, which helps prepare students to compete for nationally competitive graduate fellowships such as Rhodes, Marshall, Fulbright, Mitchell, Goldwater, Udall, Jack Kent Cooke, and Gates Cambridge. A competitive annual award permits one Honors Program student to spend his or her junior year at Mansfield College, Oxford University. Courses offered through the University Honors Program can be found in Chapter 6 under Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study. LEAD SCHOLARS PROGRAM The LEAD (Leadership, Excellence, and Academic Development) Scholars Program provides, for selected first-generation University students, a smooth transition to life at Santa Clara. Participation in the program is by invitation. LEAD scholars are selected from among those awarded a grant or scholarship by Santa Clara University. The LEAD Scholars Program forms a community of undergraduate peers and faculty dedicated to rigorous academic achievement and student leadership. The program involves support as well as challenge throughout the four years, with a special emphasis on the first-year experience. The LEAD Scholars Program is committed to fostering an atmosphere of successful schol - arship, community engagement, and service. Social and academic programs include semi - nars, academic advising and support, peer mentoring, team building, and outreach to families. All LEAD Scholars participate in LEAD Week, which is scheduled for the week immediately preceding the beginning of the fall term. INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS Santa Clara University aspires to create a learning community that promotes compe - tence, conscience, and compassion among students with a mandate to pursue scholarly understanding and constructive engagement with the world. As the principal University- wide organization focusing on international, intercultural, and global subjects, Interna - tional Programs provides a variety of academic settings and learning opportunities around the world through study abroad offerings. Academically the approach is both interdisciplin - ary and multidisciplinary and recognizes that learning takes place in the classroom, in the field, in the community, and in service to others. International Programs appreciates that intercultural competence and knowledge of the global environment should not be limited to the humanities or social sciences, but is relevant to business, engineering, and the natural sciences as well. While International Programs' mission is informed by a variety of disci - plines and viewpoints, it is inspired by the challenge offered by martyred Salvadoran Jesuit Ignacio Ellacuria: We, as an intellectual community, must analyze causes; use imag - ination and creativity together to discover remedies; communicate to our public a consciousness that inspires the freedom of self- determination; educate professionals with a conscience, who will be immediate instruments of transformation; and continually hone an educational institution that is academically excellent and ethically oriented.THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM 15 Undergraduate students can choose from a variety of study abroad programs in over 100 locations, including Santa Clara's own programs, several direct exchange programs, and a number of programs affiliated with other universities and study centers. Credits earned from all approved study abroad programs are accepted as degree credit at Santa Clara, and some coursework can fulfill Undergraduate Core Curriculum, major, and minor require - ments subject to appropriate approval. Courses offered through International Programs can be found in Chapter 6 under Interdisciplinary Minors and Other Programs of Study. DOMESTIC PUBLIC SECTOR STUDY PROGRAMS The Public Sector Studies Program at Santa Clara University offers an introduction to the areas traditionally known as public policy, public administration, public affairs, and urban planning, and is designed to provide a closer look at the creation, implementation, and analysis of public policies, and the operation of governments and public organizations. The program also provides an excellent foundation for those who would like to pursue graduate studies in public policy or public administration and an alternative perspective for students who wish to pursue public law. Opportunities for Firsthand Study Through the Public Sector Studies program in the Department of Political Science, students have the opportunity to participate in public sector internships, the Washington Semester Program, and the Panetta Institute's Congressional Internship program. These programs offer preparation and training for students interested in working at the city, county, state, or federal level of government, in a public agency or nonprofit organization, or considering graduate-level studies in related fields. Internships Perhaps the best way to understand is by doing\u2014students participating in public sector internships not only see what happens in the \"real world,\" but they are able to take part as well, gaining invaluable experience and knowledge. Placements in public sector internships have included the San Jose mayor's office, district offices of members of Congress and the California Legislature, government relations departments of high-tech corporations, public law offices, political campaigns, and nonprofit organizations. Many students end their internships with excellent employment prospects. The Washington Semester Program In the Washington Semester Program, students combine coursework taken at American University with hands-on experience via internships. In the past, SCU students have interned at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI, interest groups, Fox News, various nonprofit organizations, and offices of members of the U.S. House of Representa - tives. The Washington Semester Program offers students the opportunity to live, study, and work in our nation's capital for one semester along with other students from throughout the country, as well as from abroad. Numerous programs of study are available, including American Politics, Public Law, U.S. Foreign Policy, International Environment and Development, Economic Policy, Journalism, International Business and T rade, Peace and Conflict Resolution, and Contemporary Islam. Students participating in the Washington 16 THE SANTA CLARA UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM Semester Program earn 22.5 to 24 quarter credits for one semester of study. Grades and units received at American University will count toward the student's SCU GPA and course requirements for the department and the University when appropriate. The Panetta Institute's Congressional Internship Program The Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University\u2014 Monterey Bay, founded by Santa Clara political science alumnus and adjunct faculty mem - ber Leon Panetta, offers an opportunity for students to gain an inside look at the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government and Washington politics. This Congressional intern - ship begins with a two-week course at California State University\u2014Monterey Bay, where students work directly with seasoned veterans examining the legislative process and its func - tions. The remaining two and a half months of the internship are spent in Washington, D.C. working on Capital Hill in the office of a member of the California Congressional delegation. One exceptional Santa Clara University student is chosen each year for this fully subsidized internship. Eligibility To be eligible to participate in a Public Sector Studies Program, students must have completed at least 88 quarter units of credit by the date that the program of study begins, must not be on academic or disciplinary probation, and must be in good financial standing with the University. Students must also meet grade point average and other eligibility requirements for the specific program.

CENTERS, INSTITUTES, AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS Center of Performing Arts The Center of Performing Arts consists of Santa Clara University students, faculty, and staff working in music, theatre, and dance who, with the resources of their academic depart - ments, serve the University and local community by providing a rich season of performance events. Promoting the performing arts through a variety of programs, the Center encour - ages the interdisciplinary exploration of performance as a way of encountering, knowing, and acting in the world. The Center also encourages and supports the creative expression of Silicon Valley artists by providing performance space for local arts organizations.UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES 19 Justice and the Arts Initiative The development of competence, conscience, and compassion in our future artist- scholars is an integral, vital dimension of campus life. The Justice and the Arts Initiative (JAI) serves as an incubator for the arts and social justice on campus and in the community. The Initiative allows for the development of an intellectual frame of reference for examining and fostering artistic processes that are critically bound to issues of justice. The programs of the JAI instigate and enliven a climate of inquiry, support practical experimentation and production, and create models for interdisciplinary projects across the University. Artists increasingly use their skills across professional boundaries, effecting change and fostering dialogue as citizens of their nations and the world. The Justice and the Arts Initiative helps student-artists develop a conscience of being \"persons for others\" through programming that features artist-activists from around the globe; mentoring of local and international projects in music, theatre, dance, visual, and the literary arts; immersion opportunities; connecting to research opportunities and graduate programs; vocational discernment; internships; and seminar courses. Environmental Studies Institute The Environmental Studies Institute is an interdisciplinary community of scholars\u2014 composed of faculty, staff, and students\u2014dedicated to understanding the interactions between humans and the natural world. The Institute serves local and global communities by addressing environmental issues through education, research, and leadership. The Insti - tute's faculty members involve undergraduates in interdisciplinary research, give lectures to enhance public understanding of environmental issues, and serve as experts on environ - mental advisory panels. The bachelor-level degrees in Environmental Science and Environ - mental Studies challenge undergraduates to integrate knowledge and research in the natural and social sciences with ethics, service, and leadership to promote a sustainable world. The Institute provides a variety of campus and community programs including seminars, intern - ships, and opportunities for research, service, and study abroad. The Future Teachers Project The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innovative outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an immediate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and once at SCU are considered for the FTP scholarship, which contributes to undergraduate stud - ies and the credential program. The FTP is administered by the Liberal Studies Program.20 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY Professors: Mary Elaine Hegland, George D. Westermark Associate Bezanson, Gregory S. Gullette, Lee Panich The Department of Anthropology offers a degree program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Anthropology. A solid undergraduate foundation in anthropology secures the analytical skills needed to undertake professional degrees in anthropology, business, law, public health, social services, or provides a foundation for embarking on a number of other professional careers. The department also offers a minor, as well as several emphases and an honors thesis option. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling the University Core Curriculum requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree, students majoring in anthropology must complete the following depart - mental requirements: ANTH 1, 2, 3 SOCI 1 ANTH 50 or ENVS 50 or POLI 50 ANTH 110, 112, 114, 198 Five upper-division courses selected from the following four categories: biological (ANTH regional (ANTH 180-189). At least three of the four categories must be repre - sented in the student's selection. An introductory statistics course Four anthropology seminars Emphasis Programs in Anthropology Anthropology majors have the option of completing a special emphasis program to complement their majors. The emphasis is not a narrow specialization but reflects compe - tence in subfields of the discipline. Completion of a special emphasis program will be noted on student transcripts with the approval of the department chair. The emphasis in applied anthropology prepares students to use anthropological knowl - edge to address pressing human problems in careers outside the University. Through course - work and related internships, students will gain a better understanding of how anthropological knowledge and skills can be used in occupations related to health and medicine, interna - tional development, environment, government, business, education, immigration, and pov - erty. The emphasis in archaeology focuses on a deeper understanding of the human past and how it is studied. This is a possible course of study for majors with an interest in employment in cultural resource management or graduate study in archaeology. The emphasis in biological provides in-depth training in the field of anthropology. Students will acquire a strong understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of anthropology and the biological and cultural interactions that have influenced human evolution and diversity.ANTHROPOLOGY 21 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in anthropology: ANTH 1 or 2 ANTH 3 One additional lower-division anthropology course ANTH 110 Two approved upper-division anthropology courses Four anthropology seminars LOWER-DIVISION COURSES 1.

Hernandez Associate Professors: Katherine Aoki, Blake de Maria, Kathleen Maxwell, Andrea Pappas Assistant Professors: Karen Fraser, Don Fritz, Katherine L. Morris, Ryan Reynolds The Department of Art and Art History offers a degree program leading to the Bachelor of Arts in two undergraduate majors, art history and studio art, with courses in both disci - plines fostering a thorough understanding of the history and practice of art. Department faculty encourages interdisciplinary connections with the Santa Clara com - munity through course offerings that fulfill a wide range of College and University Core Curriculum requirements, as well as courses through the University Honors Program. ART HISTORY The art history major at Santa Clara is distinguished by excellent teaching and mentor - ing, challenging coursework, and opportunities for study abroad, peer educating, and stu - dent internships at local and Bay Area institutions. Moreover, we support, in conjunction with our fully accredited campus museum, Explore with Me, a docent-training program for our students. Advanced art history majors are encouraged to participate in our annual Art History Symposium and the Art History Research Paper Competition. The art history major features numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth to understand better the meanings and purposes of the visual arts, including their historic development, ART AND ART HISTORY 27 their roles in society, and their relationships to other fields in the humanities. Students learn to think critically and communicate clearly about works of art. The art history major devel - ops the following skills: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, analysis of visual and tex - tual sources, advanced research and writing skills, and sophisticated oral presentations. These intellectual skills enable art history majors to pursue a diversity of interests in a wide spectrum of fields and professions, including graduate work in art history. STUDIO ART Studio art majors develop comprehensive skills that help prepare them for graduate study or careers in either the fine or commercial arts. Faculty members emphasize the devel - opment of conceptual and technical competence, as well as critical analysis of the student's own work and that of others. By graduation, every student develops a body of original art - work to be exhibited in a senior show in the department gallery. Students are required to articulate an artist's statement reflecting their own engagement with the creative process, in conjunction with their senior show. Studio art majors take three sections of art history and are encouraged to take one or more courses in 20th-century or contemporary art. The studio seminar is highly recommended for all studio art majors and should be taken in the third year when possible. At the end of each year, students are encouraged to submit their work to the Annual Student Art Exhibit, which is judged by an outside professional in the field of art. The department also oversees merit-based scholarships, which are usually given to outstanding students with junior status.

Pfeiffer Associate Professor Emeritus: Michael A. Sweeney Professors: Michael R. Carrasco, John C. Gilbert ( Department Chair ), Patrick E. Hoggard ( Fletcher Jones Professor ), W. Atom Yee Associate Professors: Linda S. Brunauer, Brian J. McNelis, Amy E. Wheeler Senior Lecturer: Steven L. Fedder The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers three baccalaureate degrees: the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, the Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, and the Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry. The curriculum is accredited by the American Chemical Society (ACS), the professional organization for chemistry. The program prepares students for further work in chemistry or biochemistry, either in graduate school or as professional chemists. In addition, a chemistry or biochemistry degree is excellent preparation for careers in medicine, dentistry, law, engineering, business, and teaching. A minor in chemistry is also available. All Bachelor of Science degrees provide graduates with the background necessary to begin a career in chemistry or biochemistry at industrial and governmental laboratories, for admission to institutions offering graduate degrees in chemistry and biochemistry, and for admission to medical and dental schools as well as other professional programs in the health professions. The chemistry major provides equal training in all the disciplines in chemistry, and the biochemistry major combines training in chemistry with additional coursework in cell and molecular biology. The Bachelor of Science-ACS certified degrees meet all recom - mended standards for chemists and biochemists as mandated by the ACS. The Bachelor of Arts degree allows students the most freedom in choosing electives, and therefore is an excellent program for pre-medical or pre-teaching students. Students with a strong interest in the liberal arts or who wish to pursue subjects outside the standard science curriculum will benefit from this degree. The Bachelor of Arts degree can be effectively combined with a pre-law or business curriculum to provide excellent preparation for law or business careers in the technology sector. Undergraduate research is a critical component of our degrees and most of our majors conduct research in collaboration with faculty mentors. Research in the department has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund, the Dreyfus Foundation, and the Research Corporation. Majors in chemistry, bio - chemistry, biology, and public health science participate in faculty research projects through CHEM 182, 183, and 184. In addition, advanced students have opportunities for part- time employment assisting faculty in laboratory and related teaching activities. The chemistry and biochemistry curricula are designed to be flexible in the sequence of upper-division coursework so as to allow students to participate in study abroad programs. Students interested in study abroad should meet with a faculty advisor to plan the junior and senior year courses as early as possible in their academic careers.50 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling University Core Curriculum requirements for the Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degrees, students majoring in chemistry and biochemistry must complete the following departmental requirements for each degree option: Bachelor of Science in Chemistry CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 102, 111, 141, 151, 152, 154 Three upper-division chemistry electives, not including CHEM 182 Four quarters of CHEM 115 MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 11, 12, 13 or PHYS 31, 32, 33 Bachelor of Science in Chemistry\u2014ACS Certified CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 102, 111, 141, 150, 151, 152, 154 CHEM 183, 184 Two upper-division chemistry electives, not including CHEM 182 Four quarters of CHEM 115 MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 31, 32, 33 Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 101, 111, 141, 142, 143, 150, 151 or 152 Two additional upper-division chemistry electives, not including CHEM 182; BIOL 110, 113, 174, or 176 may be taken to satisfy one of these two electives Four quarters of CHEM 115 MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 11, 12, 13 or PHYS 31, 32, 33 BIOL 21, 24, 25, 175 Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry\u2014ACS Certified CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 101, 111, 141, 142, 143, 150, 151 or 152, 154 CHEM 183, 184 Two additional upper-division chemistry electives; BIOL 110, 113, 174, or 176 may be taken to satisfy one of these two electives Four quarters of CHEM 115 MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 31, 32, 33 BIOL 21, 24, 25, 175CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMISTRY 51 Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 101 or 102, 111, 141, 150, 151 or 152 Two additional upper-division chemistry electives, not including CHEM 182 Upper-division lab requirement: 30 hours, which can be satisfied by CHEM 102, 143, 154, or one unit of CHEM 182 Four quarters of CHEM 115 MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 11, 12, 13 or PHYS 31, 32, 33 Electives for all degrees can be fulfilled by taking any upper-division chemistry or bio - chemistry class of three units or more, including CHEM 183 and 184.

Most courses in the department are open to any interested student. Classics courses, such as Mythology, Classical T ragedy, Ancient Greek Religion, and Women in Antiquity, require no knowledge of an ancient language. Latin or Greek may be taken to satisfy the secondary language requirement. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the field, clas - sics provides an ideal liberal arts curriculum that is an excellent background for careers in many areas.CLASSICS 55 Majors and minors are available in several programs in the Department of Classics: ancient studies, classical studies, and classical languages and literatures (Latin or Greek). There is a major, but no minor, in Latin and Greek. Students may fulfill their foreign language Core Curriculum requirement by successfully completing a proficiency examination in Latin or Greek at the level required for their program of study. Contact the department chair to make arrangements.

Lee, Yahia Mahamdi, Charles H. ( Justin P . Boren Senior Lecturer: Barbara Kelley The Department of Communication offers a program of studies leading to a Bachelor of Arts in Communication. The major prepares students for various graduate and professional studies and for careers in the communication industry. An academic minor also is available. Communication majors focus on the communication process in interpersonal, mass media, and computer-based contexts. They explore the theory, research methodologies, responsibilities , institutional structures, and effects of mass and interpersonal communication. The depart - ment gives special consideration to new and developing communication technologies. The major also integrates theory with practice. It allows students to apply their knowl - edge of the communication process to the study and creation of communication products (speeches, television programs, newspaper stories, websites, etc.). Particular attention is given to developing students' concerns for ethics and the common good. Because the communication field requires students to have a broad liberal arts education, students work closely with a department faculty advisor to plan a cohesive academic pro - gram that combines courses in the Department of Communication with courses in other departments. Often students complete a minor or take a number of courses in related disci - plines, such as marketing, theatre arts, psychology, or political science. The communication curriculum provides nonmajors with the opportunity to acquire a critical understanding of the communication process and contemporary media, to improve oral and written skills, and to heighten visual awareness. All students are encouraged to participate in one of the student-run campus media. Special credit practica for such work may be included in the student's academic program. All junior and senior students are encouraged to complete an internship at an off-campus media organization or other communication-related institution. The department maintains a list of potential internships that may be completed for credit as COMM 198. The Department of Communication will accept no more than two study abroad courses (lower-division, upper-division, or a combination) toward completion of the communica - tion course requirements. Courses taken abroad will be accepted on a case-by-case basis as completing specific communication lower-division requirements. Upper-division courses taken abroad will be accepted only as communication upper-division elective credit. Courses taken abroad will not be accepted as completing the required List A, List B, research meth - ods, or thesis/capstone requirements. Whenever possible, the chair of the department will COMMUNICATION 63 determine equivalency credit based upon the course description in the literature from the foreign university. Study abroad programs run by Santa Clara may fulfill some communica - tion requirements subject to approval by the chair of the department. One of the oldest forensic programs in continuous operation on the West Coast, Santa Clara Debate provides a challenging and rigorous co-curricular activity designed to develop public speaking skills, critical thinking, and public policy analysis. The program is open to all majors and years regardless of previous speech or debate experience. The schedule offers national-level competition in both policy team debate and in parliamentary team debate along with numerous on-campus activities related to competitive speech, including hosting high school invitationals. Students may receive academic credit, and policy debate partici - pants are eligible to apply for merit scholarships. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling University Core Curriculum requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree, students majoring in communication must complete the following departmen - tal requirements: COMM 1 COMM 2 COMM 40 or COMM 40EL Two upper-division communication theory courses (signified by the letter \"A\" in the course number) One upper-division communication applied course (signified by the letter \"B\" in the course number) Two additional approved elective upper-division communication courses COMM 111 or COMM 111G COMM 196 or COMM 197 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in communication: COMM 1 or COMM 2 Two approved upper-division communication courses Three additional approved communication courses (any combination of upper- division or lower-division courses)64 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES LOWER-DIVISION COURSES 1.

The companion major in environmental studies is offered as a secondary major; students majoring in environmental studies also must complete the requirements for a primary major. The environmental studies major works well with a wide variety of pri - mary majors, including anthropology, communication, political science, and economics. A minor in environmental studies and a special version of the environmental studies minor for engineering majors also are available. Both the environmental studies and environmental science programs provide students with the intellectual and ethical foundations they will need in addressing crucial environmental challenges of the 21st century: e.g., human popu - lation growth, urban sprawl, deforestation, global climate change, waste disposal, the need for renewable energy, air and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Environmental studies programs are enriched by colloquia, including biweekly semi - nars, featuring presentations on environmental subjects by journalists, politicians, business people, scientists, and other scholars. Majors in environmental science and environmental studies are expected to apply their knowledge outside the classroom by completing an approved internship or research experience, culminating in ENVS 198, Environmental Proseminar.ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES 93 Environmental studies students are encouraged to study abroad in programs approved by the department. Courses such as Natural History of Baja include one week of immersion travel during University breaks. Environmental studies faculty occasionally offer summer courses in Costa Rica or in T rinidad and Tobago. In addition, many summer and academic year courses taken through the International Programs Office readily transfer for credit toward environmental studies majors and minors. Each student works with an environmental studies faculty advisor, who helps integrate the classroom curriculum with the student's plans for future study and/or work in environ - mental fields.

How do we restore it? And how do we know if we're finished? Emphasis on reading and writing scientific papers, working with data, and critically judging the success of res - toration projects in meeting goals of biodi - versity and ecosystem function. Laboratory and field work 30 hours. Also listed as BIOL 151. Prerequisite: BIOL 23. (5 units) 152. Faith, Ethics and Biodiversity Introduces sociocultural, historical, econom - ic, political, and environmental dimensions of green city planning, with an emphasis on citizen participation, public-private partner - ships and the rising role of NPOs. Topics include land use, urban renovation, infrastruc - ture, resource management, public landscapes, and green architecture. Students will discuss ethical issues and practice emerging methods in community research, participatory plan - ning, and collaborative design. (5 units) 153. Conservation Science Conservation is a scientific enterprise and a social movement that seeks to protect na - ture, including Earth's animals, plants, and ecosystems. Conservation science applies principles from ecology, population genetics, economics, political science, and other natu - ral and social sciences to manage and protect the natural world. Conservation is all too often seen as being at odds with human well- being and economic development. This course explores the scientific foundations of conser - vation while highlighting strategies to better connect conservation with the needs of a growing human population. We will exam - ine whether conservation can protect nature, not from people, but for people. Prerequisite: ENVS 11 or ENVS 13 or BIOL 23. (5 units) 155. Environmental and Food Justice This course unites two vibrant fields for aca - demic study and arenas for social, political, and ecological action. Environmental Justice (EJ) as a principle affirms the right of all people to healthy livable communities. Envi - ronmental injustice occurs when environ - mental benefits and burdens are unevenly distributed along the lines of identity, in - cluding race, class, and/or nationality. Food justice research addresses inequalities in food access and studies the patterns, causes, and solutions associated with increasing hunger and obesity among eaters and the accumula - tion of environmental costs in agricultural landscapes. After reviewing several seminal studies in environmental and food justice, this class delves into case studies in Califor - nia and Central America. Learners will con - duct a major research project, participate in team-based collaborations, and engage local communities as part of this course. (5 units) 156. General Ecology L&L Quantitative study of the interrelationships of organisms with their biotic and abiotic environments.

Dicochea The Ethnic Studies Program provides a critical analysis of historical and contemporary formations of race, ethnicity, class, and gender. In the pursuit of social justice, it challenges dominant views of racial and ethnic groups that lead to inequalities. Ethnic studies focuses on the roles and experiences of African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islander Americans, Latinas/Latinos, Native Americans, and other people of color within the framework of the United States and within transnational frameworks. As an academic program, ethnic studies fosters interdisciplinary inquiry. The faculty comprise a community of scholars of critical race and ethnic studies, while serving as teach - ers, mentors, and role models for undergraduate students. Ethnic studies strives to make connections between University learning, racial and ethnic communities, and social change, and encourages a reflective engagement with society and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. The Ethnic Studies Program serves as a resource for students, faculty, and staff across the University who are interested in issues of race and ethnicity. The program offers both a minor and a companion major in ethnic studies: a student must declare a primary major in another discipline as well as companion major in ethnic studies. The companion major is designed to complement a student's primary major by broadening the field of study to include an academic focus on race/ethnicity. It enhances a student's employment opportunities in business, education, law, medicine, social work, and govern - ment. The minor provides a foundation for graduate studies for students who plan to become university professors and researchers with a specialization in ethnic studies. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling University Core Curriculum and primary major requirements, students with a companion major in ethnic studies must complete the following requirements: ETHN 5 Two courses from ETHN 10, 20, 30, 40 One of the following breadth electives: ANTH 86, ANTH 90, ENGL 14, THTR 65 Four upper-division courses from ETHN 112, 120, 121, 122, 125, 129, 130, 132, 134, 141, 142, 150, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 159, 199 Three upper-division courses from: ANTH 146, ARTH THTR 189104 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES Capstone requirement including two courses: - A methods course in the primary major - ETHN 198 or 199, a community internship, creative project, or directed reading in which the student simultaneously works on a research paper or project under the direction of an Ethnic Studies core or affiliated faculty.

The origins and goals of the Black Power movement, the Chicano/a movement, the Asian American movement, and the Native American movement will be focused on during the quarter. Each of these movements embodies similar and different trails with regard to their respective group's quest for political power and elected repre - sentation. Due to contemporary immigra - tion trends, Latinos and Asian Americans have challenged the black-white paradigm that has traditionally defined U.S. racial politics in local- and state-level politics. The result, in some instances, has been interracial competition and conflict at these levels. The necessary elements needed to build and to sustain multiracial coalitions along with what the political future holds for these mi - nority groups will be addressed. (4 units) 60.

Using film and text, we will read, discuss, and write about paradigms that lead to inequity and injustice. Specifi - cally, we will examine the intersection of gender, race, and class, and note how these dynamics are illustrated in the cinema of Af - rican Americans. We will also understand how African American filmmakers were able to rise above adversity, hone and sustain their art, while confronting their myriad oppres - sions. (4 units)ETHNIC STUDIES 107 96. Race, Class, and Culture Through Film Explores how filmmakers who are concerned about racism portray the politics, history, and culture of people of African descent. Ex - amines how this medium can humanize sub - jects who are often objectified and exploited and give voice to communities whose per - spectives and opinions have been historically excluded from mainstream discourses. Con - siders how films can interrogate the physical, cultural, and, sometimes, psychological bru -tality of racist practices as well as the ways that racism intersects with other forms of marginalization related to class, gender, sex - uality, and citizenship. The content, produc - tion, and distribution of these cinematic portraits illuminate the political philoso - phies, hybrid cultures, and emancipating collective action of black communities. Inte - grates students in faculty research by involv - ing students in a documentary film project about the relationship between the social movements for African liberation and black power.

Race and World War II World War II stands as one of the most ex - plosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the post-war world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of struc - tural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a com - posite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropo - logical and biological sciences just preceding the war.

Urdan, Eleanor W. Willemsen ( Professor: Carol Ann Gittens Assistant Professor: Brett Johnson Solomon The Liberal Studies Program offers a degree program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Liberal Studies. The liberal studies major is designed for undergraduates interested in a career working with children or students seeking a broad background in the liberal arts and sciences. There are two emphases available within Liberal Studies, each of them leading to a B.S. degree in Liberal Studies. Emphasis 1 is a pre-teaching program and provides the broad liberal arts background related to elementary school curriculum, as well as a set of courses designed to introduce future teachers to the research foundation of best practices in education, child development, and issues and policies related to the schools. Emphasis 2 is designed for students interested in careers focusing on children, social work, counseling, directing childcare programs, speech and language pathology, occupational therapy, or leading nonprofit agencies that provide community services to children and families. Students with a B.S. in Liberal Studies are expected to go on to post-graduate studies related to their career goals: teacher credential programs (Emphasis 1), or master's degree programs in psychology, social work, or other fields (Emphasis 2). Advisors in Liberal Studies can provide information about teaching credential programs (Emphasis 1) or other graduate study programs (Emphasis 2). Note: The pre-teaching emphasis focuses more on the school as a context for successful devel - opment, while the advocacy for children emphasis focuses more on the family, neighborhood, and various community organizations that serve children, youth, and families.LIBERAL STUDIES 125 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling University Core Curriculum requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree, students majoring in liberal studies must complete the following program requirements: Lower-Division Courses Required for Both Emphases: MATH 8, ANTH 3 or SOCI 1, POLI 1, PSYC 2, EDUC 70, LBST 75 Lower-Division Course Required for Emphasis 1: MATH 44, MATH 45, PHYS 2, 3, 9, or 19, BIOL 19 or ENVS 131, CHEM 19, HIST 96A or HIST 96B, LBST 70 Lower-Division Courses Required for Emphasis 2: PSYC 65 or 166; choose two sciences and the listed course(s) from the PHYS, BIOL, CHEM courses listed for Emphasis 1; SOCI 30 Courses Required for Both PSYC Required Emphasis 1: HIST 104, HIST 105, 106, COURSES LBST 70.

Honors programs are available for French and German majors. In addi - tion, the department offers minors in French and Francophone studies, German studies, Italian studies, Japanese studies, and Spanish studies. The courses are designed to help stu - dents achieve proficiency in both the oral and written language and to provide them with an understanding of the experiences, values, and traditions of those peoples whose lan - guages are studied. Courses range from beginning language to linguistics, from an introduc - tion to literary texts to advanced courses in literature and culture. All courses are open to any student with the requisite preparation. A few courses in literature and culture offered by the department are taught in English and are open to all students. Some of these courses may be used as credit toward a major or minor in French and Francophone studies, a major or minor in German studies, or a minor in Japanese studies. However, these courses in English will not fulfill the University Core Curriculum foreign language requirement. Students may fulfill their second language Core Curriculum requirement by successfully completing a proficiency examination in a modern foreign language at the level for their program of study. Students who have never studied the language in which they wish to enroll, or who have studied that language for one year in high school, should register for Elementary Language 1. Those who wish to continue in a language that they have studied for two years in high school should enter Elementary Language 2. Students with three or more years of study in a single language, those who wish to continue language study beyond the second language requirement, or those who feel following the formula would place them in a higher- or lower-level course than their background warrants should consult a member of the appro - priate language faculty for placement advice. Students having the necessary proficiency, as demonstrated by an interview with a member of the language faculty, may enroll in higher- numbered courses than those of the placement formula. Once proficiency has been estab - lished, lower-division students may enroll in upper-division courses with the permission of the instructor. Such courses will be counted as fulfilling major or minor requirements. Courses numbered 1 through 102 are not open to challenge; for courses numbered above 102, consult the individual listing. For more information about placement and/or proficiency, please visit the department's website. Study abroad is a valuable enhancement of the undergraduate experience and is particularly recommended for students pursuing a major or minor in a foreign language. Both the Office of International Programs and the student's foreign language advisor should be consulted to ensure appropriate integration of the work done abroad into the student's program of study.MODERN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES 139 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS In addition to fulfilling University Core Curriculum requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree, students majoring in modern languages and literatures must complete the following departmental requirements for their specific major: Major in French and Francophone Studies FREN 100 and 101 or department-approved substitutes At least one course in French or Francophone literature Remaining electives in French or Francophone studies to total 40 quarter upper- division units chosen with the approval of the student's major advisor.

DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY Professor Emeritus: James W. Felt, S.J. Professors: Philip J. Kain ( Department Chair ), Michael Meyer, William J. Prior Associate Professors: Christopher B. Kulp, Scott LaBarge, Lawrence Nelson, William A. Parent, Mark A. Ravizza, S.J. Assistant Professors: Michael W. Hickson, Shannon Vallor The Department of Philosophy offers a degree program leading to the Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. Philosophy inquires directly into the relation of human beings to the world: what we are, how we know, what values are, how we live. Worth pursuing for its own sake, philosophical inquiry also promotes analytical thinking and precise expression and, thus, is excellent undergraduate preparation for a number of professional careers, such as law, gov - ernment, writing, social work, and computer programming. To qualify for honors in phi - losophy, the major ordinarily must have a 3.5 grade point average in philosophy courses and complete PHIL 197 with a grade of A- or better.PHILOSOPHY 167 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling University Core Curriculum requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree, students majoring in philosophy must complete the following departmental requirements: Two lower-division courses from PHIL 2-10, 11A, 12A, 60-89 PHIL 25 or 27, 50, 51, 52, 53 Two courses from different historical periods: PHIL 131 (ancient), PHIL 132 (Medieval), PHIL 133 (modern), and PHIL 135, 136, 137, 139 (contemporary), or PHIL 134, 139 One course from PHIL 120-129 One course from PHIL 125 or 140-149 Four additional upper-division courses from PHIL 109-199 Emphasis in Pre-Law The pre-law emphasis in philosophy is intended to help provide the skills of analytic reasoning and conceptual investigation necessary for the study of law. Philosophical research hones the techniques of careful argumentation and logically disciplined reasoning essential to the legal analysis of cases and statutes. Also, emphasis on ethics courses will help prepare students for the study and analysis of normative issues. The pre-law emphasis may be taken as part of a philosophy major or minor. Requirements for the pre-law emphasis include: One course from PHIL 25, 27, 29, or 152 One course from PHIL 111, 113, 114, or 154 One course from PHIL 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 80, 109, 110, 112, 115, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 129, 136, or 142 Two additional courses from those in the three lists above Emphasis in Ethics The ethics emphasis in philosophy is intended to provide students with a broad under - standing of ethical theory and the conceptual analysis of moral problems, including matters of social justice central to the Jesuit educational mission, and thus with the ability to reflect on their own ethical decisions and on their role as morally responsible members of the human community. The ethics emphasis may be taken as part of the philosophy major or minor. Requirements for the ethics emphasis include: One lower-division ethics class from PHIL 2-10 Two ethical theory courses from PHIL 120-129 Two courses from the following: PHIL 109-119, PHIL 154.

After all, politi - cal science is the closest of all majors to the institutions and values with which law deals. The primary study of law is the state, and so too for political science. Additionally, the demands of political science courses (reading of complex texts, independent research, frequent class presentations, and demanding writing assignments) strengthen the analytical and commu - nications skills that the practice of law requires. Requirements for the pre-law emphasis include a variety of courses from both inside and outside of the political science department. At most, six courses are required: three within the political science department and three from outside the political science department, although many of these courses fulfill other Core and political science major requirements.

The program also offers a minor degree in public health, and manages the Global Health Pathway of the University Core. The public health science (PHS) major is an interdisciplinary degree providing students with a strong scientific foundation in biology and chemistry to understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease. The PHS major further addresses the complex influences of environmental and social factors on human health through relevant course - work in the social sciences and humanities. Courses for the major are drawn from numerous departments but are connected through required and elective public health courses. Through the senior capstone and a mandatory internship, PHS majors engage in health- focused service and research projects integrating learning across disciplines and apply their education to real-world public health problems. Students are encouraged to study abroad to gain perspective on global health issues. The Public Health Program is evolving and stu - dents are encouraged to petition the Director of the Public Health Program to consider new relevant courses developed at Santa Clara and partner institutions abroad in addition to the electives described below. Public health science majors will be well-prepared for careers, graduate education, or professional training in health-related professions, including medicine and nursing. There are many professional options in the field of public health, including healthcare administra - tion, planning, and public policy; epidemiology and disease surveillance; clinical research and clinical trials management; health-related education and social work; health and science communication; and basic research. Students intending to pursue a medical degree, or post-graduate training in other health- related professions, should contact the University pre-health advisor to discuss prerequisites for admission to such programs.

Associate Professors: Aldo Billingslea, Jerald R. ), David J. Popalisky, Assistant Kimberly M. Hill Senior Lecturers: Derek Duarte, Kristin Kusanovich, David Sword The Department of Theatre and Dance celebrates creativity of the human spirit, offering a well-rounded education leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theatre Arts with an emphasis in either theatre or dance. This study involves both academic disciplines and cre - ative processes. These include practice and analysis of skills required in the performing arts; critical evaluation of literature, history, and theory of drama and dance; collaboration in production and public presentation of performance. The department also offers minors in theatre and dance as well as an interdisciplinary minor in musical theatre in cooperation with the Department of Music. Theatre and dance are distinct but related areas of emphasis. While each has its own set of requirements, students in either emphasis share common courses. Through lectures, stu - dio courses, labs, and productions, students work closely with faculty and staff mentors. The theatre program offers coordinated courses in acting, design, technical production, directing, dramatic literature, and theatre history. Students within the theatre emphasis will have a well-rounded foundation but may focus their study on any of the above areas. The dance program emphasizes modern dance and choreography, with additional train - ing in jazz and ballet. In these areas, students have many opportunities for performance and production; majors have the option of a senior recital, directing project, design assignment, or a senior thesis. Majors must fulfill the University Core Curriculum and College of Arts and Sciences requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree and the department requirements in their emphasis area, theatre or dance. A degree in theatre arts provides preparation for many career options. Some students continue on to graduate school, perfecting skills in acting, dance, design, directing, or his - torical studies. Graduates in theatre and dance have successfully pursued careers in profes - sional theatre and dance companies, film, television, arts administration, and teaching. In addition, many have applied their skills in careers outside of theatre\u2014in medicine, law, management, marketing, development, and religion. A strong liberal arts education is inherent in the study of theatre and dance. Students are encouraged to work with their advisors planning a program that includes courses within their focus area and courses in other departments with related disciplines. Programs that partner well with theatre and dance include: English, music, communication, studio art, psychology, political science, and marketing. Students may combine theatre with various education waiver programs. Courses in theatre and dance can provide students of any major with experience in collaborative work, critical thinking, management, and communication skills. The theatre season usually includes at least four faculty-directed plays, three dance concerts, and student-directed plays and recitals. Participation in departmental productions is open to all members of the University community: students, faculty, and staff. Guest productions by professional dance and theatre companies occasionally form part of the season, and guest art - ists periodically direct, design, choreograph, or perform in shows with Santa Clara students. The University also offers an interdisciplinary minor in musical theatre.

Areas of inquiry include the participation of women in social and cultural production; the construction of gender and its role as a constitu - tive element of social, political, economic, and legal structures; feminist theory, and the devel - opment of ideas about femininities, masculinities, and sexualities. Gender is examined as it intersects with class, sexuality, ethnicity, disability, age, and nationality. The program organizes several public events throughout the year focused on gender issues, including lectures, symposia, films, and informal gatherings. Many of these programs are produced in collaboration with other academic departments, student groups, and the University's centers of distinction. The Women's and Gender Studies Program provides an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to understanding the social and cultural constructions of gender that shape the experiences of women and men in society. The curriculum offers a solid foundation in women's and gender studies, facilitating graduate study and careers involving gender justice concerns and preparing students for leadership roles in diverse workplaces and communi - ties. Women's and Gender Studies offers a minor and a companion major; a student must declare a primary major in another discipline (e.g., history, biology, or English) and a second companion major in women's and gender studies.242 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling University Core Curriculum and primary major requirements, students with a companion major in women's and gender studies must complete the follow - ing requirements: WGST 101 or WGST 163 (advised in the junior year) WGST 102 (advised in the junior year) WGST 190 (senior year) WGST 197 (senior year) One WGST course from each of the following breadth areas: - Race/Ethnicity in the U.S.: WGST 14, 15, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115 - Transnational/Global: WGST 11A/12A, 21, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128 - Sexuality: WGST 33, 34, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139 - Religious Studies: WGST 45, 46, 47, 48, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151 - Elective: WGST 1A/2A, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 76, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 62/162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183 Three courses in an emphasis area using one of three options: student's primary major, thematic emphasis (e.g., ethnic studies, sexuality studies, performance/visual culture studies), or a traditional discipline outside student's primary major At least eight of the 12 courses must be upper-division courses Courses taken to satisfy the University Core Curriculum or primary major require - ments may also count toward the major Attend two events per year sponsored or co-sponsored by the Women's and Gender Studies Program and prepare a one- to two-page reflective analysis of each event, due in the program office within a week of the event REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in women's and gender studies: WGST 101 or WGST 163 (advised in the junior year) WGST 190 (senior year) One course from at least three breadth areas plus any two additional WGST courses At least four of the seven courses must be upper-division courses Courses taken to satisfy the University Core Curriculum or primary major require - ments may also count toward the minor Attend two events per year sponsored or co-sponsored by the Women's and Gender Studies Program and prepare a one- to two-page reflective analysis of each event, due in the program office within a week of the eventWOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES 243 LOWER-DIVISION COURSES 1A. and 2A.

Skaggs Co-Chair ), Edward Sarangee, Acting Professor: Wei Shi Associate Professor Emerita: Karen F . A. Fox Marketing operates at the cutting edge of a well-managed organization. Development of decision-making and managerial skills are the major objectives of the Department of Marketing program, with special emphases in innovation, high technology, retailing, and consumer products. Marketing is the function that links a business to its markets and cus - tomers. Marketing acts as the eyes and the ears for a firm, helping managers identify market opportunities and listen to customer needs and wants. It is also the firm's voice, handling communications with customers and deciding on advertising and sales messages. Finally, strategic marketing addresses competitive threats and opportunities, guiding a firm's efforts to deliver superior value. Because customer analysis and competitive advantage are so crucial to business success, a degree in marketing provides a solid foundation for a general management career leading to executive responsibilities. It can also provide the basis for a more focused career in such areas as advertising, retailing, sales, brand management, and market research.

COMBINED BACHELOR OF SCIENCE AND MASTER OF SCIENCE PROGRAM The Department of Electrical Engineering offers a combined degree program leading to the Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science open to electrical engineering majors with an approved grade point average in electrical engineering, mathematics, and physics courses. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master's degree before completing the requirements for the bachelor's degree and typically completes the requirements for a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering within a year of obtaining the bachelor's degree. Undergraduate students admitted to the combined degree program are required to enroll in the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the stan - dard undergraduate degree requirements. To earn the master's degree, students must fulfill all the requirements for the degree, including the completion of 45 units of coursework beyond that applied to their bachelor's degree. No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree. Completion of 10 or more units of coursework in electrical engineering taken for the master's degree satisfies the Professional Development requirement of the undergraduate program. The program of studies for the master's degree may include up to 20 units of elective coursework from ELEN 112, 116, 117, 118, 127, 130, 133, 134, 141, 144, 152, 153, 156, 160, 161, 162, 164, 200, and above. These undergraduate units can count toward a master's degree only if a grade of B or better is earned. Students who do not complete the combined degree program within six years of entering the University will automatically be transferred to the regular master's degree program. Although six years is the maximum timeframe for completing the combined degree, full-time students enrolling in February of their junior year normally complete both degrees within five years.310 SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORIES The ASIC T esting Laboratory supports research conducted by graduate students from the departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering.

Undergraduate students admitted to the combined degree program begin taking gradu - ate classes during their senior year. They are required to enroll in the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the standard undergraduate degree require - ments. To earn the master's degree, students must fulfill all the requirements for the degree, including the completion of 45 units of coursework beyond that applied to their bachelor's degree and completion of the master's thesis. No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree.

For many business majors, broad business theories will develop deeper meaning as they are applied specifically to the retail industry. The innova - tions in Internet retailing and supply chain management provide great opportunities for OMIS majors and students interested in computer science. Retailing is at the forefront of trends in current culture and communication patterns. This provides a fertile ground for arts and science students to leverage their unique background. One of the most valuable and unique aspects of the retail studies minor is participation in an internship during the summer after the junior year. This immersion experience gives students insight into the retail industry and potential careers that are available. Students acquire experience through a full-time, 10-week paid or nonpaid internship at internationally recognized retailers such as the Gap, HUGO BOSS, Williams-Sonoma, Phillips-Van Heusen, and Nordstrom. A wide variety of internships meet diverse student interests and needs. The minor is composed of a set of core courses and either a multi-channel or Internet retailing option based on the interests of the individual student. The core courses include a multi-channel retailing class in the spring quarter of their junior year and a two-quarter advanced retail seminar in the fall and winter quarters of their senior year. The core classes cover topics such as branding, product development, merchandise management, negotia - tion, store operations, team building, information systems, supply chain management, e-commerce, and pricing and promotion analysis. Nonbusiness majors are encouraged to apply for admission to the program during their freshman or sophomore year to allow time to integrate their course of study in retailing with the requirements in their major field. Business students who have completed the lower- division requirements can enter the program as late as their junior year. The number of students admitted into the minor may be restricted in some years by the number of quali - fied internships available. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in retail studies: COMM 20 or MGMT 171 ARTS 70 or COMM or OMIS 34, or SOCI 49/149 ECON 1 OMIS 40 or COMM 110 or PSYC 40, or MATH 8 MKTG 181 MKTG 165 Summer Internship: BUSN 198 or other approved internship MKTG 168 and 169INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 341 Students must select one of the following two options: Multi-Channel Option ACTG 11 OMIS 17 MGMT 160 Internet Retailing Option ARTS 74 or ARTS 174 ARTS 75 or ARTS 175 MKTG 175 or ARTS 177 or OMIS 111, or OMIS 113 SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SOCIETY Executive Director: Thane Kreiner Society is shaped by science and technology to such a profound degree that to be an effective leader or citizen one must understand, engage, and shape social, scientific, and technical forces. Yet many people compartmentalize science, technology and society as if they were three separate and distinct domains of human experience, rather than under - standing them as mutually interpenetrating and reciprocally shaping each other. The Sci - ence, Technology, and Society minor seeks to cultivate a richer understanding of these three domains to foster scientific and technological leadership and citizenship in our contempo - rary world. Students are required to select one of three emphasis areas: information technol - ogy and society, science and technology for the common good, or science communication. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in science, technology, and society: Four classes in one of the three emphasis areas Three additional classes approved as undergraduate science, technology, and society courses The three emphasis areas are: Information Technology and Society Emphasis These classes address the role of computers, the Internet, and information technologies in modern society, and the transformative mutual influences in the relationships between society and these technologies. ACTG 134 COMM 12, OTHER OF STUDY MUSC 115 MGMT 177 OMIS 34 SOCI 49, 120, 149 Science and Technology for the Common Good Emphasis These classes examine how science and technology can contribute to social benefit, espe - cially the well-being of underserved communities. They investigate the factors internal to the development of science and technology, as well as the societal factors (e.g., cultural, political, economic) that favor their development and application of science and technology to enhance the well-being of all.

URBAN EDUCATION Director: Carol Ann Gittens The minor in urban education provides Santa Clara undergraduate students seeking to become elementary or secondary teachers with the basics in educational theory, urban school observation and reflective experiences, Constitutional history of the United States, and the sociological and psychological foundations of education. The urban education minor has two distinctive components. First, the minor contains foundational courses necessary for a career in education. Second, the minor focuses on societal problems such as poverty, crime, and prejudice, and how these issues impact today's youth and families. Through the urban education minor, students will critically evaluate the modern social challenges facing teach - ers and policymakers who struggle daily with how to strengthen the educational experience for children. This minor is recommended for students from diverse majors who are inter - ested in careers that involve working directly with children and families from multicultural and multifaceted backgrounds. Students majoring in liberal studies may not minor in urban education. Selected courses in the minor may be applied toward requirements for the California regular education teaching credential programs at Santa Clara University.

MINOR IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES The minor in international studies is designed for students who wish to concentrate coursework beyond their majors on selected nations, regions, or topics of international sig - nificance. Students can choose between an area studies emphasis with a focus on Africa, Europe, or Latin America or a thematic emphasis with a focus on a topic, such as poverty and development, international human rights, or peace studies. The area studies emphasis on Africa offers an introduction to the cultures, languages, politics, and global challenges facing the continent of Africa and its people spread across the planet through colonialism, slavery, and globalization. The area studies emphasis on Europe offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the cultures, languages, politics, and global chal - lenges facing the continent. The area studies emphasis on Latin America offers an interdis - ciplinary introduction to the cultures, languages, politics, and global challenges facing the region. The thematic emphasis offers students the opportunity to examine broad international issues that transcend a single nation or geographic area. Subjects such as international orga - nization, poverty and development, cultural interdependence, diplomacy, and law are by their very nature international. Such subjects require systematic approaches distinct from the examination of single-nation or area studies. Students develop their own themes and present a detailed proposal to the International Studies Committee for approval usually no later than the first quarter of their junior year. Students planning an off-campus program for their junior year should obtain this approval prior to their departure. Area Studies Emphasis Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in international studies with an area studies emphasis: Foreign Language Two upper-division courses in a foreign language: - Africa: French or Arabic - Latin America: Portuguese or Spanish - Europe: French, German, Italian, or Spanish The foreign language requirement may be fulfilled by examination through the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures348 INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY Social Science One course from POLI 2, POLI 25, or ANTH 3 Geography One course in anthropology, sociology, or political science Capstone Course A minimum of 20 hours in a class, internship, or community volunteer activity over- seas with academic or other appropriate oversight and assessment.

Enrollment limited to students in the Casa de la Solidaridad Program . (5 units) PHIL 151. Philosophy of Suffering and Solidarity How ought we to live in a world marked by suffering and injustice? How should we in - terpret the chance meetings and intercon - nections that shape our lives? Can such moments help reveal what life is calling us to do and be? What role does a religious imagi - nation play in our postmodern world, espe - cially when we are faced with pain, violence, and disappointment? This course will begin to address these questions by exploring how we try to find meaning in a world filled with contingency and injustice. Using a variety of sources including theological and philo - sophical essays, film, and literature, we will examine how one critically engages experi - ences of interconnection, solidarity, and suf - fering, and uses such experiences to discern one's vocation and calling.

Tao ( Director ) Assistant Professor: Major Jason Cullinane The Military Science Program offers classes open to all Santa Clara students and the Bronco Battalion, an Army Reserve Officer T raining Corps (ROTC) battalion of cadets from Santa Clara University, Stanford University, and San Jose State University. The mili - tary science program is designed to develop management skills and leadership abilities for successful careers in both the corporate world and the military. Students who complete the ROTC program are eligible for appointment and commissioning as officers in the Army Reserve. Reserve commissions are tendered in all basic branches of the Army. A board of officers determines the branch in which students are commissioned based on their prefer - ence, leadership potential, academic background, and the needs of the service. The military science core curriculum consists of six lower-division classes in the ROTC Basic Course and seven upper-division courses in the ROTC Advanced Course. Cadets may take a summer course (MILS 24) in lieu of the six lower-division courses. The professional military education of ROTC cadets consists of two components: a baccalaureate degree from Santa Clara University (or one of the cross-enrolled universities) and at least one undergraduate course from each of five designated fields of study. Prior to commissioning, cadets must take at least one course in military history. The curriculum is divided into ROTC Basic Course requirements and ROTC Advanced Course requirements. To proceed to the ROTC Advanced Course classes, students must complete either the six required ROTC Basic Course classes or attend a summer class at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The director of the military science program must approve exceptions to this progression. ROTC Basic Course Requirements The ROTC Basic Course, Fundamentals of Leadership and Management, includes the first- year and second-year courses (MILS 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, and 23) designed for beginning stu - dents who want to qualify for entry into the ROTC Advanced Course and for those students who may want to try military science without obligations. A student can also qualify for entry in the ROTC Advanced Course by completing the summer training camp (MILS 24). ROTC Advanced Course Requirements The ROTC Advanced Course, Advanced Leadership and Management, consists of the third-year and fourth-year courses (MILS 131, 132, 133, 134, 141, 142, and 143) open to students who have completed or earned placement credit for the ROTC Basic Course. Students must complete all courses numbered greater than MILS 130, to include MILS 134, a six-week Leader Development and Assessment Course during the summer, in sequence, unless otherwise approved by the professor of military science. The ROTC Advanced Course qualifies students for commissions as officers in the U.S. Army. Students who do not desire to compete for a commission as an officer in the Army may take these courses for academic credit with approval by the professor of military science. Leadership Laboratories Leadership laboratories, held weekly for three hours, are required of all students. Perfor - mance during lab periods is reflected in the student's course grade.

(3 units) PRE-HEALTH SCIENCES Advisor: Steven L. Fedder Santa Clara University has an excellent reputation for preparing students for careers in the health sciences. Most incoming students tend to be focused on either allopathic medi - cine or dentistry, but a much broader spectrum of careers can be equally or more attractive, including osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, public health professional, and others. A Santa Clara education provides ample opportunity to acquire the academic foundations in natural science required by med - ical schools, and its broad liberal arts Core Curriculum also serves to develop the commu - nication, personal interaction, and analytical skills needed both during medical school and in one's subsequent medical practice.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 365 Although Santa Clara does not have a pre-med major, the courses prescribed by the Council of Education of the American Medical Association can be incorporated into several academic majors. Most medical schools require: One year of general chemistry (CHEM 11, 12, and 13) One year of organic chemistry (CHEM 31, 32, and 33) One year of biology (BIOL 21, 24, and 25) One year of physics (PHYS 11, 12, and 13 or PHYS 31, 32, and 33) One year of mathematics, typically calculus (MATH 11 and 12), and a statistics course In addition, many students become more skilled and competitive by enrolling in two or three upper-division science courses, often but not exclusively in biochemistry, genetics, and human physiology, that are helpful in preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The choice of academic major is much less important than completing the coursework above; however, many pre-health students select a natural science major such as biology, biochemistry, chemistry, or public health science. Students should thoroughly examine the pre-health website at www.scu.edu/cas/prehealth, and should maintain regular contact with the pre-health sciences advisor throughout the undergraduate years for assis - tance with adjustment to college academic rigor and social life; an appreciation of the wide array of available health care careers; assistance with the balance between academics, social life, work, health community volunteering, and internships; and assistance with the relevant entrance examinations and application to graduate health science programs. PRE-LAW Advisors: Lawrence Nelson, Terri Peretti Santa Clara University provides a wide range of opportunities for undergraduates inter - ested in attending law school to build a strong pre-law foundation. Early in their under - graduate program, pre-law students should consult not only with their major advisor but also with one of the designated pre-law advisors to formulate a program designed for their specific needs and career goals. There is no specific major or curriculum required to qualify for law school admission. Successful law school applicants come from majors as diverse as anthropology, philosophy, communication, political science, physics, English, history, biol - ogy, and economics. Law school admissions officers recommend undergraduate preparation in a major that demands discipline, analytical ability, research skills, and precision in written and oral work. The departments of Philosophy and Political Science offer a pre-law empha - sis within the major (in Philosophy, it is also available within the minor). Elective courses also provide valuable training and breadth of academic and analytical experience. Some elective courses strengthen specific abilities, while others provide perspective on legal issues and topics. Possible electives include, but are not limited to, the following: COMMUNICATION COURSES COMM 20. Public Speaking COMM 170A. Communication Law and Responsibility ECONOMICS COURSES ECON 126.

Sociology of Criminal Justice Systems PRE-TEACHING Director: Carol Ann Gittens Santa Clara University is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Creden - tialing to offer professional preparation for prospective elementary school, middle school, and senior high school teachers. The Department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offers graduate programs for the multiple-subject credential for elementary grades and the single-subject credential for secondary grades, both with a cross- cultural language and academic development emphasis. The preliminary teaching creden - tial can be initiated during the four-year undergraduate program through the undergraduate Accelerated Teaching Credential Program or during a fifth year of graduate study. Students interested in teaching should consider completing a minor in urban education offered through the Liberal Studies Program.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 367 The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area, who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innovative outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an immediate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and once at SCU, are considered for the FTP scholarship, which contributes to undergraduate studies and the credential program. The FTP is managed through the Liberal Studies Program. Preparation for Multiple-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in elementary school teaching should fulfill the require - ments of the liberal studies major in the College of Arts and Sciences. Those requirements can be found in Chapter 3, College of Arts and Sciences. Students must demonstrate the subject matter competency component for the multiple-subject credential by passing the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET) for Multiple Subjects. While students may sit for the examination whether or not they majored in liberal studies, both the exami - nation and the liberal studies degree requirements are closely aligned with the state of Cali - fornia's elementary curriculum framework. Therefore, Santa Clara strongly recommends that students interested in being elementary school teachers major in liberal studies. An undergraduate minor in urban education is also recommended. Students must also demon - strate basic educational skills by completing the Writing Skills exam that can be added to the CSET or by passing the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST). Preparation for Single-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in secondary school teaching in a particular subject matter area should fulfill the requirements of the academic major of their intended teaching spe - cialization. California teaching credentials are available in the following subject areas: agri - culture, art, business, English, health science, home economics, industrial and technology education, mathematics, modern languages, music, physical education, science, and social science. Those requirements can be found in each department in Chapter 3, College of Arts and Sciences and Chapter 4, Leavey School of Business. Students must demonstrate specific subject matter competency by passing the CSET in the subject area they desire to teach. An undergraduate minor in urban education is also recommended. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills by passing the CBEST. Selected California state credential coursework may be waived by successful completion of specific undergraduate courses: A course in community health education by EDUC 70 A course in teaching children with exceptional needs in the regular classroom by EDUC 138 A course in educational policy, social foundations of education, and applied intern - ship by EDUC 198 A course in the psychological foundations of education by PSYC 134 Coursework on the provisions and principles of the United States Constitution by POLI 1 or HIST 96A368 INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY Requirements for Multiple-Subject and Single-Subject Credentials The minimum requirements for the multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential include: A bachelor's degree in a subject area from an accredited institution Demonstrated knowledge of the United States Constitution by completion of under - graduate coursework or passage of an approved examination Demonstrated basic educational skills (see sections above for specific program requirements) Completion of an approved program of professional education, including field expe- rience achieved through student teaching or internship Completion of a state-approved subject matter preparation program or passage of the CSET, a subject-area competency examination, in the area one plans to teach For multiple-subject only: Demonstrated knowledge of the various methods of teach - ing reading by passing the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA) examination Accelerated Teaching Credential Program The multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential program can be pursued at Santa Clara in conjunction with the student's undergraduate program. Undergraduate pre- teaching students can apply to either the multiple-subject or single-subject credential pro - gram in education during the winter of their junior year. Upon acceptance, students in the accelerated credential program are eligible to begin the credential coursework during the summer between their junior and senior years. The curriculum of the undergraduate Accel - erated Teaching Credential Program is identical to the curriculum of the graduate program. Undergraduates are able to take University-based credential coursework prior to the com - pletion of the baccalaureate degree, but must complete the bachelor's degree before initiat - ing their field-based directed teaching. In addition to the bachelor's degree, students must demonstrate basic educational skills via the CBEST or the CSET Writing Skills exam (option available to multiple-subject candidates only) and demonstrate subject matter com - petency via the CSET or completion of an approved subject matter preparation program before beginning the directed teaching portion of the credential. Any 200 or 300 upper- division level courses taken for the credential are not counted toward the student's under - graduate degree unit requirement. Fifth-Year Teaching Credential Program The multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential program can be completed as a fifth year of study following the bachelor's degree and qualifies the student for a prelimi - nary teaching credential. This 50-quarter-unit program includes graduate coursework in educational foundations, curriculum design, teaching methods, and supervised student teaching. Students seeking additional information regarding the multiple-subject or single- subject teaching credential program should contact the graduate department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology.3697 Admission of Undergraduate Students Santa Clara University is a selective admission university that admits new students based on potential for academic performance and contribution to the campus community consis - tent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. Applicants are admitted as full- time, degree-seeking students. Santa Clara does not have a part-time undergraduate program option and does not enroll non-degree students except under the limited condi - tions outlined in Chapter 8, Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations. Entering freshmen and transfer students are admitted for fall and winter terms. Students are admitted for spring term only by special exception with the approval of the dean of admission. Entering freshmen are admitted to the University and to a specific school based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schools may apply for a transfer at the end of their first year of attendance. ADMISSION OF ENTERING FRESHMEN Admission of applicants to Santa Clara University as entering freshmen is based on their academic record in high school including course rigor, results on standardized tests, and other criteria outlined below. While Santa Clara University does not have a specific high school grade point or standardized test score requirement, potential for successful academic performance in the rigorous undergraduate program at Santa Clara is highly correlated with academic performance in high school in challenging courses and the results on standardized tests. Santa Clara also bases admission on demonstrated potential for contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. Applications for admission as an entering freshman are evaluated using the following criteria: Overall quality of high school courses and appropriately challenging coursework Academic performance in high school, including the cumulative grade point average from the first year of high school through the junior year of high school (grades from the first term of the senior year may also be included) Results of standardized tests (SAT I or ACT) One teacher evaluation Involvement in school and community activities The basic subject recommendations for admission as an entering freshman include: History and Social Science: 3 years English: 4 years Mathematics: 3 years required; 4 years recommended Laboratory Science: 2 years required; 3 years recommended370 ADMISSION OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS Language Other Than English: 2 years required; 3 years recommended; 4 years preferred Visual and Performing Arts: 1 year recommended College Preparatory Electives: 1 year Admission to freshman standing at Santa Clara depends on a continued high level of performance during the remainder of the applicant's senior year in high school and upon receipt of a high school diploma. If a significant change occurs in the applicant's academic performance during the senior year, his or her admissions status may be reevaluated by the University. EARLY ACTION PROGRAM Applicants to the Early Action Program must submit their applications by November 1 of their senior year. Early Action applicants are notified of the admissions decision by the end of December. Santa Clara's Early Action Program is nonbinding; consequently, stu - dents admitted under the Early Action Program are not required to withdraw other college applications and have until May 1 to confirm enrollment at Santa Clara. Some Early Action applicants who are competitive but not clearly admissible will be deferred and evaluated with other applicants under the Regular Decision Program. REGULAR DECISION PROGRAM Applicants to the Regular Decision Program must submit their applications by January 7 of their senior year. Regular Decision applicants are notified of the admissions decision by the first week of April and have until May 1 to confirm enrollment at Santa Clara. APPLICATION PROCEDURE Prospective freshman students must submit the following application materials to be considered for admission to Santa Clara: The Common Application The Santa Clara supplement to the Common Application An application fee One teacher evaluation The Secondary School Report Official high school transcript Official SAT I or ACT scores Mid-Year Report (Regular Decision applicants) ADMISSION OF TRANSFER STUDENTS Santa Clara University admits a limited number of transfer students for fall and winter quarter enrollment, principally at the sophomore and junior levels, based on potential for academic success and contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. Admission of applicants to Santa Clara University as entering transfer students is based on their academic record at other colleges or universities in conjunction with evaluation of an official high school transcript and other criteria out - lined below. While Santa Clara University does not have a specific grade point requirement, ADMISSION OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS 371 potential for successful academic performance in the rigorous undergraduate program at Santa Clara is highly correlated with prior academic performance in challenging courses. Santa Clara also bases admission on demonstrated potential for contribution to the campus community consistent with the mission and Jesuit tradition of the University. T ransfer applicants for fall term are notified of the admissions decision on a rolling basis. Applicants for admission to Santa Clara University as entering transfer students must have completed at least 12 semester or 18 quarter transferable units at an accredited college or university. Applicants with fewer than 12 semester or 18 quarter transferable units should follow the application procedure for entering freshmen. Note that if a transfer applicant has not completed 30 semester or 45 quarter transferable units, he or she will be required to submit an official SAT I or ACT score report. Applicants for admission as an entering transfer student generally must have a \"B\" average in prior college courses to be considered for admission. Only courses that are transferable to Santa Clara are considered in the grade point average calculation. Course selection and consistency of performance by the applicant are also considered. Applicants on aca - demic or disciplinary probation or suspension at another institution are not considered for admission. RECOMMENDED COURSES FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS Applicants for admission to Santa Clara University as entering transfer students enhance their chances for admission by completing as many courses that fulfill the Santa Clara Core Curriculum requirements as possible before transferring. Preference will be given to students who have completed the following courses: College of Arts and Sciences English Composition (2 semesters or 2 quarters) College-level Mathematics (2 semesters or 2 quarters) Natural Science with a Lab (1 semester or 1 quarter) Leavey School of Business English Composition (2 semesters or 2 quarters) Calculus and Analytic Geometry (2 semesters or 2 quarters) Accounting (2 semesters or 3 quarters) Microeconomics and Macroeconomics School of Engineering English Composition (2 semesters or 2 quarters) Calculus and Analytic Geometry (2 semesters or 3 quarters) Chemistry (1 semester or 1 quarter) Physics (2 semesters or 3 quarters)372 ADMISSION OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS TRANSFER CREDIT Entering transfer students generally receive credit after admission for courses from other colleges and universities that are similar to courses offered at Santa Clara University. Courses from accredited institutions are generally transferable if they are similar in nature to courses listed in the Santa Clara University Undergraduate Bulletin. Courses from California community colleges are also generally transferable under the same conditions and if designated as transferable to the University of California. Courses from colleges not accredited, trade schools, extension programs, or corre - spondence programs do not transfer. T ransfer credit is awarded only for courses in which the student earned a grade of \"C\" or better. Courses taken on a pass/no pass or credit/no credit basis are not eligible for transfer. Students may transfer a maximum of 58 semester or 87.5 quarter units to the College of Arts and Sciences or the Leavey School of Business. The School of Engineering will grant credit for up to one-half of the degree requirements toward the major.

Students whose first degree is from Santa Clara and who are interested in pursuing a second bachelor's degree concurrently or without interruption must have an academic record showing a strong probability of success and a proposed program of study for the second degree that fulfills the degree requirements in effect at their original date of matriculation. At least half of the units for the second degree must be in addition to those required for the first degree and must be completed through a Santa Clara program. Approval to pursue a second bachelor's degree must be granted by the Dean of Academic Support Services and filed with the Office of the Registrar. If a student is returning to the University after an absence, he or she must meet the criteria outlined above, but is subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of re-entry. Approval from the Dean of Academic Support Services is required to resume studies for a second degree after an absence. Students whose first degree is from an institution other than Santa Clara must submit formal application for admission to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Students admitted for a second bachelor's degree are subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of admission. At least half the units required for the second bachelor's degree must be earned through a Santa Clara program. Graduation with Honors Candidates for a bachelor's degree with a grade point average between 3.50 and 3.69 graduate cum laude (with honors); candidates with a grade point average between 3.70 and 3.89 graduate magna cum laude (with high honors); and candidates with a grade point average of 3.90 or higher graduate summa cum laude (with highest honors). Awarding of honors is based on all graded undergraduate courses attempted at Santa Clara University and courses taken elsewhere that are counted toward the fulfillment of a student's degree. Honors will not be awarded above those merited by the student's record at Santa Clara. An indication of honors at graduation contained in the commencement program is unof - ficial. The final determination will be made after a review of all completed undergraduate courses counted toward the degree. Participation in Commencement To participate in commencement, candidates for a bachelor's degree must have com - pleted all degree requirements (or must have 10 or fewer units to complete) and a minimum overall grade point average of 2.0 as well as in all courses in their academic major(s) and academic minor(s).

Also, must and have completed and submitted a Candidacy Petition for the Bachelor's Degree form to the Office of the Registrar. ACADEMIC PROGRAM POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Course Numbering and Course Credits Lower-division courses are numbered 1 through 99, and upper-division courses are numbered 100 through 199. In the College of Arts and Sciences and the Leavey School of Business, most lower-division courses carry four units of academic credit and most upper- division courses carry five units of academic credit. In the School of Engineering, unit values for courses vary according to the number of hours in class per week.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 377 Change of Academic Major A change of major within the same school or college requires the approval of the relevant department chair or program director. Students wishing to change their academic major within a school must submit a Program Petition Form to the Drahmann Center. Change of School Entering freshmen are admitted to the University and to a specific school based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schools within the University may not apply for such a change until the end of their first year of attendance. Changes between schools may be limited by the availability of space within the school and the specific academic major. Students wishing to change schools must meet the admit - tance criteria of the school and complete the application process specified by that school. Upon acceptance by the school, the student must submit a completed Program Petition Form to the Drahmann Center. Repetition of Courses Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than \"C-.\" In such cases, the grades of both the original and the repeated course are included in the calculation of the student's grade point average, but units are awarded toward graduation only once for each course passed. Certain courses, such as special topics courses and perfor - mance courses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful completion. Students should consult the chair of the department in which the course is offered to confirm that a given course may be repeated for credit. Independent Study Students may pursue independent study through directed reading, directed research, internships, practica, or cooperative education. To qualify, a student must have demon - strated a sufficient knowledge of the academic discipline involved to make independent study both possible and beneficial. No more than 20 units of independent study may be used to satisfy graduation requirements, and no more than 5 units of independent study may be taken per term. Students must enroll for the term in which the independent study occurs. Directed reading and directed research are limited to upper-division students who undertake a research project or other well-defined study beyond the scope of a regular course under the supervision of a faculty member. Such work should be comparable to that required for courses of equivalent unit value. Students can obtain practical learning experience through internships, cooperative edu - cation, and practica. Internships and cooperative education are approved work experiences in a non-classroom environment in industry, government, or other setting, generally avail - able only to upper-division students. Students who enroll in an internship or cooperative education experience for academic credit must fulfill specified academic requirements in addition to the responsibilities expected by the organization hosting the internship or coop - erative education experience. Practica provide practical experience in a discipline-specific field experience or an approved University program activity, such as participation on the school newspaper. Practica are generally available only to upper-division students, but some practicum experiences are available to lower-division students who meet specified eligibility criteria. Students wishing to enroll in an independent study course must initiate the request for independent study with the appropriate faculty member, or with the Career Center for 378 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS cooperative education experiences. The appropriate form, with the required materials and other approvals, must be submitted to the Drahmann Center for final approval prior to registering for the course. Challenging Courses Students may challenge certain courses to satisfy specific subject requirements for gradu - ation. A student may petition to challenge any course listed in the Undergraduate Bulletin except those involving laboratory, studio, or specialized group work and those whose descriptions in the catalog are followed by the letters NCX. No more than one course may be challenged each term. Although course requirements may be fulfilled by challenging a course, a successful challenge neither earns units toward the total needed for graduation nor contributes to the fulfillment of the residency requirements. In order to be eligible to challenge a course, a student must have completed at least one term at Santa Clara, have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.3, and receive per - mission of the faculty member and the chair of the department in which the course is offered. Only currently enrolled students are eligible to challenge a course. To challenge a course, the student takes a special examination on the material covered by that course and meets any additional requirements specified by the department chair. Challenge examinations are arranged by the department chair, after the student files a Peti - tion for Credit by Examination with the Office of the Registrar and pays the applicable fee. Course Requirements and Attendance Students are responsible for completing all course requirements as set forth by the instructor. Class attendance expectations and consequences for absences from class are left to the discretion of individual instructors. Students are accountable for all course assign - ments, whether or not the assignments were announced during an absence. Final Examinations A cumulative final examination, if given in a course, must be given on the date and time scheduled by the Office of the Registrar. If the final examination is a take-home exam, it may not be due before the scheduled final examination time. Exceptions to this policy require approval of the department chair and dean. REGISTRATION POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Enrollment and Registration for Classes Students must be officially registered for all classes in accordance with the regulations, procedures, and dates in the Schedule of Classes. Registration is subject to full payment of tuition, room and board charges, and other fees associated with enrollment. The University reserves the right to deny registration to any student for reasonable cause. A student's eligi - bility to register for classes is subject to the clearance of any holds on the student's record for academic, financial, student conduct, or other reasons. Santa Clara students may not be concurrently enrolled at another college or university except for extraordinary reasons with the approval of the Drahmann Center. Students register for classes via University eCampus during the time assigned by the Office of the Registrar. Students who do not complete registration during the initial registration period may do so during the published late registration period for the term. Initial registration for a term or class additions are not accepted after the last day of the late registration period.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 379 During the first week of each term, students may change their original registration schedule by adding and dropping classes in accordance with the procedures established by the Office of the Registrar. During the second, third, and fourth weeks of the term, a stu - dent may drop a class without receiving a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. From the fifth week to the end of the seventh week of the term, a student may drop a class and receive a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. Students may not drop classes after the last day of the seventh week of the term. Students who do not com - plete a course and do not drop the class in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in the class. Students who have not earned 44 units, including transfer credit, may not enroll in upper-division courses without the written approval of the instructor and the chair of the department offering the course. This restriction does not apply to upper-division foreign language courses for which a student has demonstrated sufficient proficiency or to engineer - ing courses in the major program. Students may not sit in a class without formally enrolling in the class. Sitting in a class or obtaining an instructor's signature on an add form does not constitute enrollment. Registration must be completed in accordance with the regulations, procedures, and dates in the Schedule of Classes. Students who do not attend the first day of a class are subject to administrative cancella - tion of their enrollment in that class in order to make space available to other students. A student who must miss the first day of a class and wishes to remain in the course should contact the instructor in advance. No student who misses the first day of a class should assume that they have been dropped from the course. Students are responsible for checking the status of their enrollment in all courses prior to the end of the late registration period. Unit Overload Students may enroll for no more than 19 units unless they are in the University Honors Program, their cumulative grade point average at Santa Clara is at least 3.3, or they have upper-division status and obtain approval from the Drahmann Center. One 2-unit course or two 1-unit courses are not counted as overload units. Students who meet the criteria above will not be permitted to register for more than 25 units without approval of the Dean of Academic Support Services. Students may register for courses that result in overload units only during the late registration period. See the website of the Office of the Registrar for registration schedules. Auditing Courses Students admitted to degree status at Santa Clara may audit one course in addition to their regular course load in a term. A maximum of three courses may be audited during a student's academic career. Permission to audit a course will be given only at the end of the late registration period and only if space is available in the class. No credit is assigned for an audited course, but the successful completion of an audit will be indicated on a student's transcript by the notation \"AUD.\" Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment Students who enroll in a course for which they are not eligible are subject to administra - tive cancellation of their enrollment in that course. Prior to the end of the late registration period, an instructor may notify the University registrar to drop freshmen who registered in upper-division courses, to drop students who have not satisfied the prerequisites for the course, or to drop students lacking the instructor permission required for certain courses.380 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Withdrawal from the University Students who wish to withdraw from the University during a quarter or at the conclu - sion of any quarter must complete a withdrawal survey, appropriate forms, and an exit interview in the Drahmann Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student's registration will be canceled without further academic penalty. Students who leave the University during a quarter without withdrawing in accordance with the required pro - cedures will receive an appropriate grade in all courses in which they were registered and are not eligible for a refund of tuition or other fees. Students who withdraw from the University are responsible for any outstanding finan - cial obligations with the University. Students who used deferred payment plans or student loans during their attendance at the University must clear their financial obligations with the Financial Aid Office and the Bursar's Office. Students who have unpaid bills or other unsettled financial obligations with the University will not receive academic transcripts or be eligible for re-enrollment until they have cleared all such obligations. Withdrawal for Health Reasons Students may experience an illness, injury, or psychological condition that significantly impairs their ability to function successfully or safely in their role as students. In these instances, time away from the University for treatment and recovery can restore functioning to a level that will enable them to return to the University. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the procedures for student withdrawals from the University for reasons of health and/or safety. The University has designated four categories relating to withdrawal. They differ according to who initiates the action, whether it is voluntary or not, and the re-enrollment procedures. The vice provost for student life or designee, in consultation with the appropriate mental and medical health professionals and other staff as deemed necessary, is responsible for the implementation of this policy as stated in the Student Handbook. Re-enrollment at the University A student who withdrew from the University is eligible to re-enroll without special permission under the following conditions: The student left the University in good academic standing The student has no outstanding financial obligations with the University The student plans to return to the same college or school at the University The student is returning within five years of the date of their withdrawal Students who do not meet the conditions above must seek permission to re-enroll from the Dean of Academic Support Services. Re-enrolling students are subject to degree and curriculum requirements in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect at the time of re-entry. Students wishing to re-enroll must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing of their intent to return using the Returning Student Form and should consult with a University advisor in the Drahmann Center to review their academic plans. Students on leave who have attended another college or university are only permitted to transfer in a maximum of 10 units of elective credit and are required to forward to the Office of the Registrar an offi - cial transcript of all work completed during their absence.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 381 GRADING POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Grading Grades are assigned by the instructor to reflect the quality of a student's work. The University uses the following grades: A: Excellent B: Good C: Adequate D: Barely Passing F: Not Passing P: Pass NP: No Pass The grades A, B, C, and D may be modified by (+) or (-) suffixes, except that the grade of A may not be modified by a (+) suffix. Grade point values per unit are assigned as follows: A = 4.0 A- = 3.7 B+ = 3.3 B = 3.0 B- = 2.7 C+ = 2.3 C = 2.0 C- = 1.7 D+ = 1.3 D = 1.0 D- = 0.7 F = 0 Unit credit, but not grade point credit, is awarded when the grade of \"P\" is assigned. Unit credit is not awarded when the grade of \"NP\" is assigned. The University also uses the following marks for which no unit credit or grade point value is granted: I: Incomplete N: Continuing work NS: No Show AUD: Audit W: Withdrawn382 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Pass/No Pass (P/NP) A grade of \"P\" signifies that the quality of work done is equivalent to a letter grade of \"C\" or higher, while a grade of \"NP\" denotes work at the level of \"C-\" or lower. A maximum of six courses taken under the pass/no pass option in which the student receives a mark of \"P\" can be used to fulfill the unit requirements for graduation. Some courses are offered only on a pass/no pass basis. If a graded option is not available, a course can satisfy Core, major, and/or minor requirements. A student with junior or senior standing and a declared major may choose to take an elective course on a pass/no pass basis. Students may enroll in only one elective course on a pass/no pass basis per quarter. Students may choose the pass/no pass option for a class through the end of the fourth week of classes, but may not change the grading option after that date. Incomplete (I) The mark of \"I\" (incomplete) may be assigned by the instructor when a student does not complete some essential portion of the assigned work in a class because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control. The unfinished work must be completed and given to the course instructor within three weeks of the beginning of classes in the next scheduled term (not the student's next term of enrollment), excluding summer session, unless extraordinary circumstances require an extension. A request for an extension must be submitted in writing by the instructor and approved by the University registrar within the original three-week period. Extensions shall not be for longer than two academic quarters after the mark of \"I\" was assigned, excluding summer session. An incomplete that has not been completed within the specified deadline or has not received an approved extension will be converted to a grade of \"F .\" Continuing Work (N) The mark of \"N\" (continuing work) may be assigned by an instructor when course requirements span more than one term. When the course requirements are completed, the instructor assigns a standard grade. A student may not graduate and receive a degree with a mark of \"N\" on their academic record. No Show (NS) The mark of \"NS\" (No Show) may be assigned by an instructor when a student never attends a class and does not drop the class. A mark of \"NS\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark after it is assigned by the instructor. A mark of \"NS\" is included in the stu - dent's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student's grade point average. No adjustment in tuition will result from the awarding of a mark of \"NS\" in a class. Audit (AUD) The mark of \"AUD\" is assigned when a student enrolls in a class on an audit basis. A mark of \"AUD\" cannot be changed to any other grade. Withdrawn (W) The mark of \"W\" is assigned by the Office of the Registrar when a student completes the formal requirements for dropping a class or withdrawing from the University. A mark of \"W\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark. A mark of \"W\" is included in the student's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included the calculation of the student's grade point average.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 383 Grade Point Average A student's grade point average is determined by multiplying each grade point value by the number of quarter units assigned to the course, adding these grade point units from all courses taken, and dividing this sum by the total number of quarter units for which letter grades were reported. Grade reports are posted at the end of each quarter and indicate both the grade point average earned by the student during the quarter and the cumulative grade point average earned by the student for all courses completed to that point. Grades earned in courses in SCU-operated or SCU-affiliated study abroad or domestic study programs are included in the calculation of a student's grade point average. Grades earned in courses at other institutions accepted for transfer credit are not included in the calculation of a student's grade point average, but will be considered when determining honors at graduation. Evaluation of Progress Grades are available at the end of the term via University e-campus. Faculty members are expected to apprise students of their course progress at reasonable intervals. Some measure - ments of progress should take place in time to enable students to make reasonable decisions with respect to the fourth-week and seventh-week withdrawal deadlines. Change of Grade Only the faculty member responsible for a course may assign grades. All grades become final when they have been assigned and reported to the Office of the Registrar. A faculty member may report a correction of a final grade to the Office of the Registrar only if a cleri - cal or procedural error was made in assigning, transmitting, or recording the original grade. A grade may not be changed as a result of re-evaluation, re-examination, or the submission of additional work after the term ends. Any grade change must have the approval of the department chair and the associate dean of the student's school or college. No grade may be changed after one year. Student Appeals of Grades Grades are not negotiable. There should be no questioning of a faculty member's aca - demic judgment on a grade. In registering for a class, students implicitly agree to allow the faculty member to make a qualitative judgment of their command of the subject matter, which will be expressed as a letter grade. Any questioning or appeal of a grade should there - fore be limited to procedure, e.g., to computational errors or failures to follow grading policies set forth in the syllabi. Any system of grade-appeal should protect the rights of faculty members as well as the rights of students. The results of any system of grade-appeal should not be binding upon the faculty member. Any decision to initiate a change of grade should remain the faculty mem - ber's. Any procedural complaint regarding a change of grade must be initiated within four weeks of the beginning of the next scheduled term, not including summer session. A student with a complaint must first discuss the matter with the faculty member. If the matter is not resolved at this level, the student may then take the matter to the chairperson of the department involved. The chairperson will discuss the case with the faculty member and may recommend that the faculty member review the grade. Upon the request of the student, the dean will proceed in similar fashion. Should the student request it, the dean will pass the matter on to the provost. This process of review gives the chairperson, dean, and provost the right to discuss the matter with the faculty member, and if they think it appropriate, request that the faculty 384 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS member review the grade. Any recommendations made will not be binding upon the fac - ulty member against whom the complaint is lodged. The decision to change a grade remains with the faculty member. ACADEMIC STANDING AND STUDENT CLASSIFICATION Student Classification The University only admits students to its undergraduate degree programs on a full-time basis. Students who have not been admitted to degree status at the University may register for classes in accordance with the policies and regulations outlined in the section of this chapter covering non-degree students. The classification of students is determined by the number of quarter units completed with passing grades. Lower-division students are considered freshmen if they have com - pleted fewer than 44 units and sophomores when they have completed at least 44 units but fewer than 88 units. Upper-division students are considered juniors when they have com - pleted at least 88 units but fewer than 131 units and seniors when they have completed at least 131 units. If a student is enrolled for 12 or more units in a given term, they have full-time status for academic purposes. Students enrolled for less than 12 units have part-time status for that term and may not qualify for all University activities and benefits, such as eligibility for financial aid, on-campus housing, and intercollegiate athletic competition. Continuing enrollment at the University in part-time status requires approval by the Dean of Academic Support Services. Academic Standing To be in good academic standing at the University, a student must normally be enrolled for 12 or more units, must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara, and must have completed at least a minimum number of units as specified below. Failure to meet these requirements may result in academic proba - tion or disqualification from future registration at the University. Students in their last term of enrollment before completing a degree may be classified as a full-time student when enrolled for less than 12 units. Academic Probation Students who have completed at least three quarters of academic work at Santa Clara or elsewhere are subject to academic probation if their cumulative grade point average is lower than 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara. Students who have not yet completed three quarters of academic work at Santa Clara or elsewhere normally are not subject to academic probation as long as their cumulative grade point average is at least 1.6 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara. Students are also subject to academic probation if they fail to make satisfactory progress toward their degree as defined below: Completing at least 36 quarter units in the previous three quarters of residency OR Completing at least 36 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing at least 76 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing at least 115 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing at least 160 quarter units by the end of the twelfth quarter of residencyACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 385 Academic Disqualification Students are subject to disqualification from further registration at the University for any of the following: Remaining on academic probation for more than two consecutive quarters without improvement Failing to maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 OR Completing fewer than 30 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing fewer than 64 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing fewer than 100 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing fewer than 150 quarter units by the end of the twelfth quarter of residency Reinstatement to the University Reinstatement to the University after disqualification is rarely permitted and requires favorable action by the Dean of Academic Support Services in consultation with the dean of the student's college or school. Requests for reinstatement are made to the Dean of Aca - demic Support Services and must include a description of any activities during the period of disqualification that would indicate that an improved academic performance can be expected in the future. A student generally may not apply for reinstatement within a year of the date of disqualification. The request for reinstatement will be considered only if the student's academic deficiencies can be corrected within a reasonable time. ACADEMIC CREDIT EVALUATION Santa Clara awards credit based on the Advanced Placement Program, the International Baccalaureate Program, courses completed at other colleges and universities, and courses completed in University-approved study abroad and domestic study programs using the criteria outlined herein. Students may not take a course for credit for which they have received advanced placement, International Baccalaureate, or transfer credit. Credit is not awarded for the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP). Advanced Placement Credit Santa Clara participates in the Advanced Placement Program to recognize college-level academic achievement prior to matriculation and to encourage students to pursue advanced studies in their areas of interest. Credit or placement is determined by the appropriate department based on review of the student's advanced placement scores, sometimes in the context of supplemental departmental examinations. Students will be notified of advanced placement credit upon matriculation at the University. The following chart indicates the subject examination, required scores, and Santa Clara credit granted through the Advanced Placement (AP) tests. Courses waived will always satisfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. How - ever, only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum. Courses waived by AP test scores, when relevant, may satisfy Second Language, Mathe - matics, Natural Science, and Social Science requirements in the Core Curriculum. No other undergraduate Core requirement can be satisfied with AP test scores. Final decisions on academic credit for some AP scores are made individually by the appropriate academic department in consultation with the University Registrar.386 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Exam SubjectRequired ScoreSCU Unit Credit SCU Equivalent Core AP Art History 4, 5 4 Art History 21, 22, or 23 No Core Credit AP Biology 4, 5 4 Elective Credit* No Core Credit AP Calculus AB 4, 5 8 MATH 11 & 12; or MATH 30 & 31Mathematics AP Calculus BC 3 4 MATH 11 or MATH 30 Mathematics AP Calculus BC 4, 5 12 MATH 11 & 12 & 13 or MATH 30 & 31 & 13Mathematics AP Chemistry 3 5 CHEM 11 Natural Science AP Chemistry 4 10 CHEM 11 & 12 Natural Science AP Chemistry 5 10-14 CHEM 11 & 12 (credit for CHEM 13 granted after completing CHEM 99)Natural Science AP Chinese Language & Culture 4, 5 4 CHIN 21 Second Language AP Comparative Government & Politics4, 5 4 POLI 2 Social Science AP Computer Science A 4, 5 4 COEN 11 or CSCI 10 No Core Credit AP English Language 4, 5 4 Elective Credit No Core Credit AP English Literature 4, 5 4 Elective Credit No Core Credit AP Environmental Science 4, 5 4 ENVS 11 Natural Science AP European History 4, 5 4 HIST 23 No Core Credit AP French Language 4, 5 4 FREN 21 Second Language AP German Language 4, 5 4 GERM 21 Second Language AP Human Geography 4, 5 4 ANTH 50 or ENVS 50 or POLI 50No Core Credit AP Japanese Language & Culture 4, 5 4 JAPN 21 Second Language AP Latin Vergil 4, 5 4 Elective Credit* No Core Credit AP Macroeconomics 4, 5 4 ECON 2 Social Science AP Microeconomics 4, 5 4 ECON 1 Social Science AP Music: Theory 4, 5 4-8 MUSC 1 or MUSC 1 & 1A*No Core Credit AP Physics B 4, 5 4 PHYS 11 No Core Credit AP Physics C: Mechanics 4, 5 4 PHYS 31 No Core Credit AP Physics C: Electricity & Magnetism4, 5 5 PHYS 33 Natural Science AP Psychology 4, 5 4 PSYC 2 Social Science AP Spanish Language 4, 5 4 SPAN 21 Second Language AP Spanish Literature 4, 5 4 SPAN 22 Second Language AP Statistics 4, 5 4 MATH 8 or OMIS 40 Mathematics AP U.S. Government & Politics 4, 5 4 POLI 1 No Core Credit AP U.S. History 4, 5 4 HIST 96A or 96B No Core Credit AP World History 4, 5 4 Elective Credit* No Core Credit *See department chair for evaluation of credit toward major or minor.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 387 International Baccalaureate Santa Clara University recognizes the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program for admis - sion and advanced placement.

Courses from accredited institutions are generally transferable if they are similar in nature to courses listed in the Santa Clara University Undergraduate Bulletin. Courses from California community colleges are also generally transferable under the same conditions and if designated as transferable to the University of California. Courses of a trade or technical nature do not transfer. Courses from colleges not accredited, trade schools, extension programs, or correspondence programs do not transfer. Students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities prior to matriculation at Santa Clara for no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for the specific Santa Clara degree. After enrolling at Santa Clara, students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities for no more than 10 quarter units of free electives, subject to the limitation that no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for a Santa Clara degree can be earned at another institu - tion. T ransfer credit earned after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill University Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or program requirements. T ransfer credit for all coursework completed at other colleges and universities requires approval from the Drahmann Center and the chair of the department offering the equiva - lent Santa Clara course. The student must have earned a grade of \"C\" or better in a course for transfer credit to be granted. Courses taken on a pass/no pass or credit/no credit basis are not accepted as transfer credit. Grades for units earned at other institutions are not included in a student's Santa Clara academic history or in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. Study Abroad and Domestic Study Programs Units and grades earned for coursework in University-operated study abroad programs, University-affiliated study abroad programs, University study abroad exchange programs, and University-affiliated domestic study programs are included in a student's Santa Clara academic history. Units earned in approved study abroad and domestic study programs may be used to fulfill University Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or program requirements subject to prior approval by the appropriate dean's office, department chair, or program director. However, such units do not satisfy the University residency requirement. Grades earned in approved study abroad and domestic study programs are included in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. Units earned for coursework in study abroad and domestic study programs not operated by or affiliated with the University are accepted only as transfer credit and are subject to the policies governing units taken at other institutions. The second-level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology, and Culture can be fulfilled with a pre-approved study abroad course. The third-level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology, and Culture cannot be fulfilled with a study abroad course. NON-DEGREE STUDENTS The Santa Clara University undergraduate program is designed primarily for full-time, degree-seeking students. To maintain the University's commitment to its primary under - graduate constituency of degree students, non-degree students are permitted to register in accordance with the following policies subject to space availability in classes.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 389 Santa Clara Alumni Santa Clara alumni who have been awarded a degree from Santa Clara University may enroll in undergraduate classes on a for-credit basis or may audit undergraduate classes. Alumni may enroll for no more than 10 units per term on a for-credit basis, or they may audit one course per term. They are certified for enrollment by the Office of the Registrar and register for classes during the late registration period of the term. University Employees University employees who are students at another accredited college or university may enroll in undergraduate classes at Santa Clara if they are in good standing and have a cumu - lative grade point average of \"C\" or better at their home institution. They may not enroll concurrently at Santa Clara and another college or university. University employees who are not currently admitted to degree status are certified for enrollment by the Office of the Registrar and may audit one course per term. Students from Other Colleges and Universities Students from another accredited college or university may enroll in undergraduate classes at Santa Clara if they are in good standing and have a cumulative grade point average of \"C\" or better at their home institution. They may not be enrolled concurrently at Santa Clara and another college or university. Students from other colleges and universities may enroll for no more than three quarters, not including summer session and are not eligible to audit classes. Students from other colleges and universities are certified for enrollment by the Drahmann Center and the Office of the Registrar and register for classes during the late registration period of the term. Students from Other Colleges and Universities Participating in SCU Exchange Programs Students from other colleges and universities participating in SCU exchange programs may enroll in undergraduate classes at Santa Clara if they are in good standing and have a cumulative grade point average of \"C\" or better at their home institution. They are not eligible to audit classes. Students from other colleges and universities participating in exchange programs are certified for enrollment by the International Programs Office and the Office of the Registrar. Students from Other Institutions Enrolling in SCU Study Abroad Programs Students from other colleges and universities who meet the applicable eligibility require - ments for SCU study abroad programs may enroll in undergraduate classes at Santa Clara if they are in good standing and have a cumulative grade point average of \"C\" or better at their home institution. They are not eligible to audit classes. Students from other colleges and universities enrolled in SCU study abroad programs are certified for enrollment by the International Programs Office and the Office of the Registrar. Young Scholars High school students who meet the applicable eligibility requirements for the Young Scholars program may enroll in undergraduate classes. Young Scholars may enroll for no more than 10 units per term and are not eligible to audit classes. Young Scholars are certified for enrollment by the appropriate Dean's Office and the Office of the Registrar after receiv - ing permission of the faculty member to enroll in a specific class.390 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The University is committed to academic excellence and integrity. Students are expected to do their own work and to cite any sources they use. A student who is guilty of a dishonest act in an examination, paper, or other work required for a course, or who assists others in such an act, may, at the discretion of the instructor, receive a grade of \"F\" for the course. In addition, a student found guilty of a dishonest act may be subject to sanctions, up to and including dismissal from the University, as a result of the student judicial process as described in the Student Handbook. A student who violates copyright laws, including those covering the copying of software programs, or who knowingly alters official academic records from this or any other institution is subject to similar disciplinary action. Academic Integrity Protocol Allegations within the Context of a Course These procedures are intended to protect the integrity of the instructional program and of student academic achievement. Any member of the Santa Clara University community with a suspicion or evidence of academic dishonesty of some kind as described in the Student Conduct Code (e.g., plagiarism, falsification of data, misrepresentation of research, or the use of prohibited materials during an examination, and other acts generally under - stood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context) may initiate an allega - tion of student academic dishonesty. The following describes procedures for resolution by due process. If the allegation arises within the context of a course or academic assignment, its resolu - tion begins with the instructor responsible for that course or assignment, who informs the student of the suspicion. If the instructor judges on the basis of available evidence that an academic violation has occurred, the instructor applies an academic sanction and notifies the student of the reason for the academic sanction. The instructor decides on the severity of the academic sanction (e.g., refusal to accept an assignment, \"F\" on the particular assign - ment, or \"F\" for the entire course). The instructor will report in writing to the department chair and the Office of Student Life what violation of academic integrity has occurred and what academic sanction has been applied. The Office of Student Life will pursue the matter as a violation of the Student Conduct Code through the University judicial process. This process is not intended to limit academic freedom. Appeal Process for Academic Sanctions If, after discussion with the instructor concerning the academic sanction applied, the student wants to challenge the instructor's decision, the student will contact the chair of the department in which the course is offered. If the instructor is the department chair, then the appeal is made to the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered or his/her designate, and the dean or designate refers the case to the chair of a closely related department. The department chair hearing the appeal has the option to convene an ad hoc panel if he or she believes that the complexity of the case warrants doing so. The student suspected of committing academic dishonesty has the right to bring a support person whose only role is to accompany the student to the hearing. The panel will include two full-time faculty members from the department in which the course was offered, one full-time faculty mem - ber from a closely related department, and two students who are trained student judicial board members. Staff in the Office of Student Life will arrange for the participation of the ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 391 student panel members. The charge of the panel is to study all previously considered and newly developed evidence, review statements of all parties concerned, interview all parties concerned, and make a recommendation to the department chair. The parties involved have the right to file an objection to the appointment of a particular faculty member or student to the ad hoc panel. This objection must be based upon a belief that the named faculty member or student is unable to conduct an impartial evaluation and therefore will not review the case in an impartial manner. The objection is filed with the chair hearing the appeal who will make a ruling on this objection. If necessary, the chair will then appoint a different faculty member or student. After reviewing all relevant materials and information, including the recommendation of the ad hoc panel when one is convened, the department chair will consider all evidence available, confer with all parties concerned, inform all parties of her or his recommendation regarding the alleged violation, and report the recommendation to the student and the Office of Student Life. However, final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course. Decisions may only be appealed to one level above the instructor. All proceedings are intended to be confidential. If the student wishes to withdraw from the course but the instructor's signature is required for the withdrawal process, the instructor may refuse to sign an approval of the withdrawal. University Judicial Process When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the assistant dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether further judicial sanctions are applied or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain on file in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student's enrollment at Santa Clara University. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files. If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the severity of the circumstances, including the student's judicial history and previous academic integ - rity violations. Allegations Outside a Course If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The assistant dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University Judicial Process. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved. PATENT POLICY For information on the University's Patent Policy, contact the Office of Research Initiatives at www.scu.edu/provost/research/.392 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS CLERY ACT In accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, Santa Clara University annually collects information about campus crimes and other reportable incidents as defined by the law. Information presented in com - pliance with this act is made available to assist current and potential students and employees in making informed decisions regarding their attendance or employment at the University. These reports and other information about the law are available on the Campus Safety website. It is the policy of Santa Clara University that the campus community will be informed on a timely basis of all reports of crime and other information affecting the secu - rity of our campus and the personal safety of our students, faculty, staff, and guests. COMMUNICATION BY THE UNIVERSITY TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS The University will communicate with undergraduate students through a variety of for - mats. Information that is sent to undergraduate students from the University via their cam - pus mailbox, local address, or their Santa Clara email address is considered official communication and should be treated as such. Students are asked to check their campus mailbox and their Santa Clara email account on a daily basis, and are responsible for reading and responding to the information they receive from the University. The University urges undergraduate students to use their Santa Clara email address as their primary email; students who will not be checking that address regularly should forward their email to their preferred email account. CONSENSUAL RELATIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS In addition to prohibiting sexual harassment under the Policy on Unlawful Harassment and Unlawful Discrimination, the University prohibits any consensual dating, romantic, or sexual relationship between an employee and a student over whom that employee has any instructional, supervisory, advising, or evaluative responsibility. Such a relationship is fraught with problems, including the potential for exploitation, favoritism, and conflict of interest. The appearance of impropriety or unfairness may also adversely affect the learning and work environment for other students and employees. This policy applies to faculty, staff, and student employees. Employees who violate this policy are subject to sanctions for misconduct under the policies of the Faculty Handbook, Staff Policy Manual, or Student Employment Handbook, as appropriate to their employment status. Employees or students with questions about this policy should contact the Office of Affirmative Action or the Department of Human Resources. DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE AND SCHOOL PROGRAM It is the goal of Santa Clara University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Santa Clara University campus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the University's activi - ties. This includes the unlawful use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace even if it does not result in impaired job performance or in unacceptable conduct.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 393 The unlawful presence of any controlled substance or alcohol in the workplace and campus itself is prohibited. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Santa Clara premises where the activities of the University are conducted. Violations will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employ - ment for faculty and staff or expulsion of students. A disciplinary action may also include the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. The program information is distributed on an annual basis to all faculty, staff, and stu - dents. New staff employees are given a copy at New Employee Orientation. New faculty employees are given a copy at New Faculty Orientation. The program is reviewed at least biennially by the Office of Student Life, Affirmative Action Office, and the Department of Human Resources. STUDENT RECORDS AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects the confiden - tiality of the University records of Santa Clara University students. A student is any person who attends or has attended class which includes courses taken through videoconference, satellite, Internet, or other electronic and telecommunication technologies and for whom the institution maintains education records. The University is authorized under provisions of the Act to release directory information to any person on request, unless a student explic - itly requests in writing that the University not do so and keep directory information confidential. A student's directory information is designated as follows: Student's name Address: Campus post office box, local, and permanent addresses (residence hall and room numbers are not disclosed) Telephone number Email address Photograph Date and place of birth Major field of study Classification level/academic standing Dates of attendance (defined as academic year or quarter) Participation in officially recognized activities and sports Weight and height of members of athletic teams Degrees (including expected or actual degree date), honors and awards received, and dates Most recent educational agency or institution attended During the registration period and throughout the academic year, students may request in writing through the Office of the Registrar that directory information be kept confiden - tial. Once filed, the request remains in effect until the beginning of the next academic year or a shorter period if designated by the student.

Students who are placed on disciplinary probation a second time within two years of the date the first probation was imposed will lose eligibility for Santa Clara financial aid effective the date the second probation is imposed. Students who are suspended from the University are not eligible to receive financial aid. If a student is placed on disciplinary probation or deferred suspension or is involved in other significant disciplinary matters, his or her eligibility for financial aid is subject to review by the Office of Student Life and the Financial Aid Office. Study Abroad and Domestic Public Sector Study Programs Santa Clara University students participating in study abroad and domestic public sector study programs operated by or affiliated with the University are eligible for SCU financial aid and tuition remission as well as federal and state aid consistent with the policies and practices applicable to students enrolled for on-campus classes. T uition and room and board rates associated with the specific program will be factored into the determination of the financial aid award consistent with applicable policies and practices. The total amount of tuition remission for the academic year cannot exceed the annual tuition rate for that year. Students with private scholarships should contact the donor for prior approval to use funds for study abroad or domestic study programs. Students from other colleges and universities enrolled in SCU study abroad programs are not eligible for SCU financial aid. Veterans and Veterans' Dependents Assistance Santa Clara University has been certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs as qualified to enroll students under applicable federal legislation and regulations, including Chapter 35 (child of a deceased or 100 percent disabled veteran, widow of any person who died in the service or died of a service-connected disability, or wife of a veteran with a 100 percent service-connected disability), Chapter 31 (rehabilitation), Chapter 30/1606 (active duty Montgomery G.I. Bill), and Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill). Individuals interested in attending under any of the veteran's assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University Office of the Registrar. CANCELLATION OF FINANCIAL AID AND RETURN OF FUNDS Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are subject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulations assume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal financial aid funds governed under Title IV other than those earned under the college work-study program. Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student remains enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned. A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges owed by the student play no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled.TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 409 All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to state or University financial aid programs or to the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received Federal Title IV assistance: Unsubsidized William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Federal Direct PLUS Loan Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant Subsidized William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Federal Perkins Loan Other federal and state financial aid, private grants, and scholarships Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grant University grants and scholarships Federal Pell Grant STUDENT VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION The United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students and their families submit as a basis for the award of aid. Santa Clara University complies with this requirement by participating in the Federal Quality Assurance Program. Each year, a percentage of stu - dents receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the infor - mation on which their awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar information for verification purposes for any student awarded aid and to verify the atten - dance of other children in college. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds. BILLING AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES STUDENT ACCOUNTS AND BILLING Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrollment at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures. Students may designate a third party (e.g., parent, spouse) to be an authorized payer for their student account. That individual is authorized to access the student's billing state - ments and to make payments on the student's behalf. However, it is still the student's responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the published dead - lines. Once authorization is arranged, the authorized payer will be notified via the email address provided by the student. Authorized payers do not have access to any other student account information via this website. Students receive monthly bills electronically via a third-party vendor that are accessible through University e-campus. A billing notification will be sent to the student's University email address and to the email address of any payer authorized by the student. Students may also forward their student account statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remittance. Information on a student's account cannot be provided to any 410 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID third party payer unless a completed Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act form authorizing its release by the student is on file with the University. Students are obligated to pay the applicable tuition and fees associated with their enroll - ment status by the published payment deadline. Registered students who do not withdraw formally from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their account as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees. PAYMENT METHODS Santa Clara University offers a variety of payment methods to students and their parents to assist with their financial obligations. Payment by Electronic Check A student or authorized payer may make online payments by authorizing a fund transfer directly from their personal checking or savings account through a third-party website accessible via the University e-campus system. The payer is able to make electronic check payments online without incurring a transaction fee. Payment by Mail Payments for student account charges are accepted by mail utilizing the University's cash management service lockbox. The payer should download a copy of the student's billing statement, enclose it with a personal or cashier's check payable to: Santa Clara University, and mail both to Santa Clara University Bursar's Office, P .O. Box 60000, File 72662, San Francisco, CA 94160-2662. Payment in Person Payments for student account charges may be made in person by cash or check at the Bursar's Office in the Walsh Administration Building. The Bursar's Office is not able to accept any electronic form of payment, including debit or credit cards. However, there are computer kiosks located in the Walsh Administration Building for the convenience of students and their payers who wish to make electronic payments. EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTIONS For students and their families wishing to spread payments over a period of time, the University offers various extended payment plans through a third-party vendor. There is a modest fixed fee to enroll in these plans, but no interest is charged during the payment term. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar's Office webpage. DELINQUENT PAYMENTS If all charges on a student's account have not been cleared by payment, financial aid, or loan disbursement, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student's account and a hold will be placed on the student's record. A hold on a student's record prevents the release of transcripts or diplomas, prevents access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval are subject to dismissal from the University. All unpaid balances will accrue 10 percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default in accordance with California state law.TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 411 Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recov - ering the debt owed to the University. The student is responsible for all costs incurred to collect outstanding debt, including but not limited to accrued interest, late fees, court costs, collection fees, and attorney fees. All outstanding bills and costs of collection incurred by the University must be paid in full prior to a student re-enrolling at the University. BILLING DISPUTES If a student believes there is an error on his or her billing statement, a written explanation should be forwarded to: Santa Clara University, Bursar's Office, 500 El Camino Real, Santa Clara, CA 95053-0615. The Bursar's Office must receive written correspondence within 60 days from the billing statement date on which the error appeared. Communication can be made by telephone, but doing so will not preserve the student's rights. Communication should include the student's name, SCU identification number, the amount in question, and a brief explanation. Payment for the amount in question is not required while the investigation is in progress. An adjustment will be made on the student's account for any incorrect charges. If the amount in question is found to be valid, payment must be submitted to the Bursar's Office immediately upon notification. REFUND PAYMENTS Refunds will be granted only for student accounts reflecting a credit balance. A refund will not be granted based on anticipated aid. All financial aid must be disbursed into a stu - dent's account before a refund is processed. It is the student's responsibility to make sure that all necessary documentation is completed and submitted to the Financial Aid Office so that aid can be disbursed properly and in a timely fashion. Payment received by personal check will have a 21-day hold before a refund can be issued; a 5-day hold for electronic check payments. TUITION INSURANCE PROTECTION Students and their families may protect themselves against financial loss due to an unex - pected withdrawal from the University for medical reasons by purchasing tuition insurance coverage. The University has identified an insurance company, Dewar, Inc., to provide an optional tuition insurance protection plan. This plan is designed to protect from loss of funds paid for tuition should it be necessary to withdraw completely from the University during the term for medical reasons. Information on the tuition insurance plan is available from the Bursar's Office and on its website. EDUCATIONAL TAX CREDITS Students may be eligible for a higher education tax credit designed to help students and their parents finance the cost of education. Tax credits are based on the amount of qualified tuition and fees, less grants and other tax-free educational assistance, and the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Students enrolled in an eligible degree program may qualify for a Hope Scholarship Credit or Lifetime Learning Tax Credit. Specific information is available from the Internal Revenue Service.41210 University Honor Societies and Awards HONOR SOCIETIES Santa Clara University is proud to host 24 prestigious national honor societies in the liberal arts, sciences, business administration, and engineering.
