The results of the study, conducted by Dr Hugh MacPherson and colleagues, from the University of York, UK, found that within a primary care setting, combining acupuncture or counselling with usual care had some benefits after 3 months of treatment to patients with recurring depression. The study was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme. Many patients with depression are interested in receiving non-drug therapies, however, there is limited evidence to support the use of acupuncture or counselling for depression in a primary care setting. In this pragmatic randomised controlled trial conducted in the north of England, the authors randomised patients with depression to receive 12 weekly sessions of acupuncture plus usual care (302 patients), or 12 weekly sessions of counselling plus usual care (302 patients), or usual care alone (151 patients). Compared to usual care alone, there was a significant reduction in average depression scores at 3 months for both the acupuncture and counselling interventions, but there was no significant difference in depression scores between the acupuncture and counselling groups. At 9 months and 12 months, because of improvements in the depression scores in the usual care group, acupuncture and counselling were no longer significantly better than usual care. Although these findings are encouraging, this study does not identify which aspects of acupuncture and counselling are likely to be most beneficial to patients, nor does it provide information about the effectiveness of acupuncture or counselling, compared to usual care, for patients with mild depression. The authors say: \"To our knowledge, our study is the first to rigorously evaluate the clinical and economic impact of acupuncture and counselling for patients in primary care who are representative of those who continue to experience depression in primary care.\" They continue: \"We have provided evidence that acupuncture versus usual care and counselling versus usual care are both associated with a significant reduction in symptoms of depression in the short to medium term, and are not associated with serious adverse events. \" Funding: This article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) under its Programme Grants for Applied Research Programme (RP-PG-0707-10186).

The results of this study, led by Daniel Feikin, Matthew Moore, and their colleagues from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA, are important as they suggest rapid and sustained reductions in pneumococcal disease after vaccine introduction. The study does show that serotypes causing IPD covered by PCV-7 have been partially replaced by types not covered by PCV-7 (a phenomenon referred to as serotype replacement), which has implications for the surveillance of newer pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, such as PCV10 and PCV13, which cover more serotypes. The authors combined IPD surveillance information from multiple countries to estimate changes in IPD rates before and after PCV7 introduction. For children aged under 5 years, the authors found that the overall number of observed cases of IPD in the first year after the introduction of PCV7 was about half the expected number; this reduction in the number of IPD cases remained relatively stable over 7 years. Among adults, the authors observed smaller, more variable decreases in overall IPD. Notably, the rate of IPD caused by vaccine serotypes decreased every year, but the rate of IPD caused by non-vaccine serotypes increased annually, which was likely to be the result of serotype replacement. However, these findings have several limitations: PCV7 is no longer made and so extrapolation of these results to newer PCV10 and PCV13 formulations should be done cautiously. Moreover, because the surveillance data used in this study mainly came from high-income countries, these findings may not be generalizable to low-income countries, in which pneumococcal disease is a major problem. The authors say: \"The most important public health implication of our analysis was that decreases in overall IPD rates in children\u2014 the group targeted for PCV7 vaccination\u2014 occurred quickly and were sustained after vaccine introduction despite increases in [non-vaccine serotype] rates.\" They continue: \"Optimizing surveillance data that allows for valid interpretations of the vaccine effect on disease is essential for sound policy decisions.\" Funding: The study was supported by grant ID# OPP1020720 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ( [http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx)).

She highlights some of the papers published by PLOS Medicine that have contributed to that disruption across a diverse range of topics including lethal injection as a method for execution and the role of \"big\" industries - pharma, tobacco, alcohol - in health. She notes some key issues for medical journals to address in the future, including open access, and journals' relationship with the pharmaceutical industry. She concludes \"Medical publishing, like publishing in general, still has many issues to address, and how these play out over next few years will, I believe, determine the place journals have in the wider dissemination of medical knowledge and, more importantly, its translation into practice and policy.\" Funding: VB is paid a salary by the Public Library of Science, and she wrote this editorial during her salaried time.

Based on their comparison of current practices in the EU, the US, China, and Japan, the authors call for greater system transparency, regular reexamination of the safety and effectiveness of select devices, and improved balance of central and local control. The authors say: \"Broader use of these strategies could preserve patients' access to new technologies while protecting them as well as possible from devices that later turn out to be unsafe or ineffective.\" Funding: This study was supported by funding from the Medical Device Initiative from the Pew Charitable Trusts.
