The building will support a full continuum of clinical services ranging from effective medication management and psychotherapies to state-of-the art neuromodulation treatments, medical and surgical care for individuals with medical and behavioral health disorders. The building will also become the home for an interdisciplinary training and workforce development program that is focused on preparing and supporting the next generation of behavioral health providers for Washington State. The design vision for the new building is to create a non- institutional setting that promotes well-being, healing, and learning for patients, staff, visitors and trainees in a welcoming and safe environment. The 6-story building will offer campus and visitor amenities with an active ground floor level featuring campus food service for patients, staff and visitors, conference rooms and state-of-the art neuromodulation services. Above, two floors of med/surg beds will be designed to treat patients with acute or chronic medical problems such as patients with mental health or substance use disorders who are hospitalized for their medical needs and need a safe environment for hospital inpatient medical/surgical care. The top 3 floors of the new facility will feature highly flexible behavioral health inpatient units with standardized configurations designed to respond to a variety of client needs ranging from highly structured programs to programs that promote independent functioning and transition to the community. Open-concept social and dining spaces on these units will create a residential atmosphere promoting serenity and comfort. Smaller semi- private adjacent spaces will provide opportunities for patient choice and areas of respite and quiet. The new building will also feature dedicated on-unit outdoor patient terraces to allow access to fresh air and nature as well as a larger shared outdoor therapy/recreation space to support physical activity and exercise. Every opportunity will be explored to maximize access to daylight and views while assuring patient privacy, dignity, and safety. The mission of this new facility, its commitment to both healing and training, and its respectful integration into the community as a resource for mental health advocacy, will be reflected in the look and feel of this new building. Attention to scale, articulation, openness, and warmth will reinforce the vision of a new benchmark for behavioral health. The design will also prioritize the needs of delivering safe, quality patient care in a cost-effective and efficient manner recognizing that this new building is an expansion of the existing hospital and needs to operate as such. BASE SCOPE In alignment with the expectations set out in House Bill 1593, and the associated capital appropriation, this facility will become a center for behavioral health and integration. Serving the dual purposes of treating patients with behavioral health needs and training an integrated behavioral health workforce, the 191,000 gross square foot facility will include 150 inpatient beds with associated support, a Neuromodulation suite serving both inpatient and outpatient needs, consultation rooms to provide state-wide telepsychiatry consultation, a complement of offices and workrooms to support graduate medical education, multi-use conference space to accommodate community and provider education, and food services including a kitchen, servery and dining spaces for the UWMC Northwest campus. The BHTF will be located on the current site of D Wing, which will be demolished in advance of building construction. This site is on the east side of the UWMC Northwest campus, adjacent to the existing Main Hospital A-Wing Building tower and across the campus loop road from the existing Medical Office Building. A new patient drop-off will allow vehicles to safely queue, while a separate exterior patient arrival area (sallyport) near the existing ED ambulance bay will support arrival via ambulance or other transport to enter the building in a discreet and secure manner. A new pedestrian bridge at Level 2 will connect to the existing A-Wing to accommodate the movement of patients, staff, materials and food across the campus. The slope of the bridge will be a maximum 1:40 slope or a 2.5% slope. This will allow ease of transport of beds, patients, and service carts. A new public connection for visitors is adjacent to this service connector. A new 4-bay loading dock on the northeast corner of the building will accommodate food and linen deliveries. The new BHTF will include the following functions: LEVEL 1 Main entry plaza and Lobby Conference rooms Campus kitchen, servery, indoor and outdoor dining Inpatient and Outpatient Neuromodulation Facilities management and building support spaces Loading dock Exterior sallyport LEVEL 2 25 Medical / Surgical beds capable of caring for patients with behavioral health and medical / surgical needs Shelled space for Observation unit Provider offices Connection to A-Wing LEVEL 3 25 Medical / Surgical beds capable of caring for patients with behavioral health and medical / surgical needs Outdoor patient therapy and activity spaces Tele-psychiatric consultation rooms Postgraduate Medical Education offices LEVEL 4 36 Behavioral Health beds, split into two 18-bed units Each unit has 4 double patient rooms to accommodate Geropsychiatric patient population Patient activity and support spaces Shared clinical and staff support spaces LEVEL 5 34 behavioral health beds, split into two 17-bed units Each unit has 2 double patient rooms to serve patient population Patient activity and support spaces Shared clinical and staff support spaces LEVEL 6 30 Behavioral health beds, split into two 15-bed units Patient activity and support spaces Shared clinical and staff support spaces The building will also include a mechanical penthouse. At 103' tall, this facility will fit within the Major Institution Master Plan 105' height restrictions. The typical 14'-6\" floor to floor height, allows the building to be under the high-rise limit of 75' as measured 72.5' from Level 1 to the floor height of Level 6. Executive Summary 2 UW Behavioral Health Teaching Facility / Project Definition Report SITE IMPROVEMENTS The site of the new BHTF will connect the new and existing campus with accessible walking paths, planted streetscapes, clear wayfinding, welcoming arrival experiences, additional parking, outdoor dining and meandering gardens. From the new patient drop-off, the landscape will connect to the lobby and dining terrace. The landscape will extend vertically to the Behavioral Health roof terraces, where patients, doctors, clinicians, and staff can find respite outdoors. The landscape seeks to destigmatize behavioral health disorders while offering healing spaces for all who visit the facility. This \"connective tissue\" will be durable, provide seasonal interest, offer ecological value and be reasonable to maintain. Beyond our immediate site, improvements will include: Street improvement on 120th ADA access pathway to right of way at the campus entrance on 115th Reconfiguration of Parking Lots C/D to add approximately 40 parking stalls Improvements to the campus eastern landscape buffer and overall campus landscape with 2:1 tree replacement to those removed GENERAL PERFORMANCE The University of Washington is a leader in sustainability and committed to implementing best practices in environmentally responsible construction for new buildings and major capital renovations. Systems will support these goals while also providing the hospital flexibility and redundancy: Targeting minimum LEED Gold v4 (BD+C: Healthcare) Four elevators, two passenger elevators and two service elevators Two new Seattle City Light services providing flexibility and redundancy of normal power Two backup diesel generators with sound-attenuating enclosures located exterior to the building, sized for Essential Power needs of BHTF: life safety, patient care, security systems, telecommunications and a majority of the mechanical equipment A Nurse Call system will be provided throughout all patient care areas. Telecommunications Equipment Room (previously known as MDF) will be provided for BHTF with Telecommunication Distribution Rooms (TDRs previously known as IDFs) on each floor. BHTF will not include space for the Modular Data Center (campus MDF) Anti-ligature as required, per the UWMC risk assessment, for all behavior health and med-surg units. BUDGET The Project Benchmark of $1,175/SF puts the overall target budget at $224,500,000. The base target value budget is 2.5% over budget and anticipates finishing in budget with the strategic release of $3.5M in Project contingency and $1.5M in Owner contingency around the start of construction in 2021 to meet the base scope. Should either the project or owner contingency not be available, and to ensure budgetary success, the base scope, project value adds, and any program at risk will be continually monitored and adjusted for project optimization (see Program Validation Alternatives Analysis in Appendix). Additional contingency release, if available, would be slated for 2022 with a goal to add additional value add scope described below. Through collaborative innovation, budget refinement and strategic risk management, the team is confident the project will complete within budget. We anticipate trending slightly over budget for the next several months, with the goal of getting to budget as design concludes. SCHEDULE Substantial completion is slated for August 31st, 2023. The schedule includes 35 days of contingency to address risks outlined in the Schedule Risk Register. The team is committed to mitigating schedule risks and improving upon the substantial completion date. This latest anticipated owner occupancy is the end of December 2023. VALUE ADD SCOPE While the project has identified a strategic contingency release strategy to drive to project budget, scope below of around $2.3 million has been identified as the priority valuable scope to be added as the budget allows. Design and build out of the Observation Units Modifications to the existing MOB skybridge and loop road to accommodate WB-40 and WB-50 semi-trucks for deliveries to the BHTF loading dock.

To address this problem, the Washington State legislature partnered with the University of Washington School of Medicine (UWSOM) to pass House Bill 1593, establishing a Behavioral Health Teaching Facility (BHTF) to improve behavioral health services and training to better serve the state's needs. Siting and design for the new facility accounts for local community needs and resources in close coordination with existing local, regional, and state resources. Due to the critical need for additional behavioral health services, thoughtful expediency to open the facility is required. The state has allocated $33.25 million to initiate the design and building of the new teaching facility during the current legislative biennium. It has also earmarked a total of $224.5 million for the completion of the project over the next four years. This new facility will focus on inpatient and outpatient care for individuals with behavioral health needs and will be the training site of the next generation of health and behavioral healthcare providers, fundamentally changing the way behavioral health is offered in Washington State. PROJECT SUMMARY UW Medicine offers medical services across three hospital campuses around Seattle: Harborview Medical Center, University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) - Montlake Campus, and University of Washington Medical Center - Northwest (UWMC - Northwest). UWMC - Northwest is the best fit for this project's purpose and community need. Formerly known as the Northwest Hospital & Medical Center, UWMC - Northwest currently contains 281 patient beds and more than 2000 employees. The campus currently houses existing behavioral health services, and multiple sites were available on the campus for this facility. The Predesign team considered many alternative site options within the campus, and determined that the new BHTF is to be located on Site 8, which is the current location of the D-Wing Building on the east side of the UWMC - Northwest Campus. The D-Wing Site was selected due in part to its proximity to the Main Hospital A-Wing Building tower and Emergency Department. The D-Wing Building is centrally located on the campus and borders the Emergency Department (ED) Entrance on the west and is surrounded by the Campus Loop Road on the south and east sides. The estimated size for the facility is 190,685 SF . Based on the requirements outlined in House Bill 1593, this facility shall include state-of-the-art evidence-based and effective clinical care, high-quality education, patient safety, leadership, innovative programs, and a sense of community. This building will also house the main kitchen and dining room for UWMC - Northwest, supporting the entire campus and forming the symbolic heart of the campus. Ultimately, this project team is committed to designing a facility to support the University of Washington in providing community-based service to treat a range of behavioral health acuity in a caring and treatment-based facility, while working to train the next generation of care providers for the region.
