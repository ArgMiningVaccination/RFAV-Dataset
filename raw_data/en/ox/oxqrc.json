The only thing I was disappointed in was the DIM was over a year old on one of the bottles. I told them about it and was reassured it was not too old. Sill it bothered me. They just sent a refund for that bottle. Was pleased that they stood behind their product. My skin is finally healing after four weeks of pain, scabbing over twice and then the healing itch. I would definitely recommend this product! [ Holistic Skin Health Duo ](/products/holistic-skin-health-duo#judgeme_product_reviews) I used this on a cat scratch to help the mending process.

I recommend this lip cream it works [ Lip Sore Cream 0.34 Fl Oz ](/products/lip-sore-cream#judgeme_product_reviews) I made the first order on January 1, 2022. Today, February 27, 2022 I have been itch free for 2 days. And I can sleep, shower and live without itching. I literally have my life back. Prior to using Manuka Skin Saver and Self Heal together my life had become impossible. My entire life was lived around finding a solution to the result of contact dermatitis from a WASHED piece of clothing. I had used literally more than 18 plant/oil based products to no avail. I am so grateful to you and your company who actually care and also have the best customer service I have ever had from an online company. Helene S., Tucson, AZ [ Holistic Skin Health Duo ](/products/holistic-skin-health-duo#judgeme_product_reviews) I had a cut that scabbed over and I would pick at the scab and it would bleed a little again...never seems to heal....that until I decided to try the salve since it was still on my bathroom counter. Put a little on the wound and the next morning it was gone.. in fact I had a hard time finding where it was...I also used the skin saver as a moisterizer for my lower arms that seem to dry out more in the California weather and it seems to help on my brown spots ...too soon to tell on those if they will fade. Thank you so much....I am a believer!! [ Holistic Skin Health Duo ](/products/holistic-skin-health-duo#judgeme_product_reviews) I used this product to help on mosquito bites, cuts and hang nails. It really doesn't take much. i applied the self heal save to my mosquito bite once a day at night and I noticed the salve tingles and then the itching stops. I had no problem my bug bite just went away. I carry it with me always.

[ Lip Sore Cream 0.34 Fl Oz ](/products/lip-sore-cream#judgeme_product_reviews) Love natural products, love this product, I am very happy with this balm [ 'Self Heal' Salve 1 Fl Oz ](/products/self-heal-salve#judgeme_product_reviews) I always get a small heat rash during the hotter months. Before bed I have applied this product lightly on my skin. I have noticed a difference! Thank you! [ Manuka Skin Saver 1.69 Fl Oz ](/products/manuka-skin-saver#judgeme_product_reviews) I really like self heal, it is a saver for bug bites. [ 'Self Heal' Salve 1 Fl Oz ](/products/self-heal-salve#judgeme_product_reviews) I bought this for my mom who has Psoriasis prone skin. She has said it stopped the thick, sore flaking and helps reduce itching significantly. She can wear flip flops now! She did note that the more she uses it, the better it works and her skin looks. She has now started using it on her neck where she has red, inflamed, sensitive skin and sees positive results there also. I borrowed it and used on razor burn on my legs and in one application the appearance was dramatically improved, almost back to normal! Highly recommend!
