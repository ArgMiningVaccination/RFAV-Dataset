Dr. Clark Research Association, a California company and Dr. Clark Behandlungszentrum GMbH, doing business as Dr. Clark Zentrum, sold a variety of dietary supplements and devices that they alleged cured advanced and terminal cancers, AIDS, and other serious diseases. The FTC alleged that the defendants made unsubstantiated health or safety claims. In its complaint, the FTC alleged that the defendants advertised, among other things, that: - The \"Zapper\" (sold as the \"Super-Zapper Deluxe\") is a device that purportedly kills disease-causing parasites in the body with electricity and is effective in treating serious and chronic diseases like cancer and AIDS; - The \"Syncrometer\" is a device that purportedly can detect substances within the body and diagnose diseases; - \"Dr. Clark's New 21 Day Program for Advanced Cancers,\" a regimen that includes dietary supplements, purportedly cures advanced cases of cancer and, when used with the \"Super-Zapper Deluxe,\" renders surgery and chemotherapy unnecessary; and - The \"Complete Herbal Parasite Program\"\u2014also called the Herbal Parasite Cleanse\u2014is effective to treat serious diseases when used with the Zapper. The FTC charged that the defendants did not have a reasonable basis to substantiate the claims made in the ads. To settle the FTC's charges, the final order prohibits the defendants from making unsubstantiated health or safety claims for any food, drug, dietary supplement, or device. The order also requires the defendants to notify U.S. consumers that they are entitled to full refunds. In addition, the settlement contains various recordkeeping provisions to assist the FTC in monitoring the defendants' compliance.

Doctor's Corner __________________________________ John P. Cooke Vascular Medicine Stanford University School of Medicine Stanford, CA A Nutritional Approach to a Healthy Endothelium: Case Histories I have been studying the endothelium for the better part of two decades, first at Mayo where I was trained, then as an Assistant Professor at Harvard, and now as Associate Professor and Director of the NIH-funded Vascular Medicine Program at Stanford. ... The HeartBar\u00ae has now been tested in rigorous, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and has been shown to improve exercise tolerance and reduce pain in patients with coronary and peripheral arterial disease. Although these clinical trials are very gratifying, what I find even more satisfying are the positive results that I have observed in my own clinic. Here are a few representative anecdotes: * * * * A 78 y/o male with intermittent claudication L. M. is a vigorous 78 year old man who looks younger than his stated age. As an alpine biologist, one of his classes each year involved a month of hiking over the heights of Yosemite and King's Canyon. Now, in retirement he is still an outdoorsman, and enjoys outdoor activities with his son. For the last few years though, he had noticed cramping in his legs after walking up a hill. The discomfort would subside if he stood still for a moment, and then he could go on. But about two years ago, the cramping became a real disability for him. He was tightening up after walking a half-mile, and he could only go that far if he walked slowly. The great outdoors was getting farther away for LM. He came to my Vascular Medicine clinic at Stanford in the spring of 1999. I prescribed Trental 400 tid. He returned to me 6 weeks later with little improvement. At that point I stopped the Trental and introduced him to the HeartBar. LM began taking two bars daily. It wasn't long before he noticed an improvement, and over time, he continued to improve. At the time of this writing, LM is able to walk faster, without pain, and considers himself unlimited. He is even able to jog a quarter of a mile before he needs to slow down. He's back to the hills, and enjoying the outdoors again with his son. I hope that you found these anecdotes interesting. I welcome you to send in your own anecdotes regarding your experience with this nutritional therapy. With warmest regards, John P.

Through the means described in Paragraph 4, respondents have represented, expressly or by implication, that: A. HeartBar substantially decreases leg pain for people with cardiovascular disease; B. HeartBar reverses damage or disease to the heart caused by high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, or estrogen deficiency; C. HeartBar prevents age-related vascular problems, including \"hardening of the arteries\" and plaque formation, and reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease; D. HeartBar reduces or eliminates the need for surgery, such as a coronary bypass or angioplasty, and medications, such as nitroglycerin, in patients with cardiovascular disease; and E. HeartBar Sport improves endurance and energy for the general population. 6. Through the means described in Paragraph 4, respondents have represented, expressly or by implication, that they possessed and relied upon a reasonable basis that substantiated the representations set forth in Paragraph 5, at the time the representations were made. 7. In truth and in fact, respondents did not possess and rely upon a reasonable basis that substantiated the representations set forth in Paragraph 5, at the time the representations were made. Several of the representations are not supported by any clinical studies on humans. Other representations are based on results reported in studies that suffer from various flaws, including the failure to account for the placebo effect and extremely small sample sizes, such that the experience of a single or a few subjects account for the benefits purportedly experienced by the active group as a whole. Therefore, the representation set forth in Paragraph 6 was, and is, false or misleading. 8. Through the means described in Paragraph 4, respondents have represented, expressly or by implication, that clinical studies, research, and/or trials show that: A. HeartBar decreases angina pain, including by as much as 70% within two weeks; B. HeartBar decreases leg pain while walking or exercising, including by as much as 66% within two weeks, for people with peripheral artery disease; C. HeartBar reverses the effects of high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and estrogen deficiency on the heart; and D. HeartBar Sport improves endurance and energy for the general population. 9. In truth and in fact, clinical studies, research, and/or trials do not show that: A. HeartBar decreases angina pain, including by as much as 70% within two weeks; B. HeartBar decreases leg pain while walking or exercising, including by as much as 66% within two weeks, for people with peripheral artery disease; C. HeartBar reverses the effects of high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and estrogen deficiency on the heart; or D. HeartBar Sport improves endurance and energy for the general population. Therefore, respondents' representations set forth in Paragraph 8, above, were, and are, false or misleading. 10. The acts and practices of respondents as alleged in this complaint constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and the making of false advertisements, in or affecting commerce in violation of Sections 5(a) and 12 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.

Scientologist David Amrein has settled FTC charges that he made false claims for devices and an herbal program for treating cancer. Amrein is closely associated with Hulda Clark, an unlicensed naturopath who falsely claims that all cancers are caused by parasites and can be cured with a low-voltage electrical device and various herbs. In January 2003, the FTC charged the Dr. Clark Association (a nonprofit organization in California), Behandlungzentrum GMbH (a Swiss company), and Amrein (a Swiss citizen who is the sole officer and director of both) with making unsubstantiated claims for several products that Clark recommends. The [settlement](http://www.casewatch.net/ftc/enforcements/amrein/consent.shtml) enables customers to obtain refunds and bars the defendants from making 10 types of unsubstantiated claims. In 2001, the FTC obtained a consent agreement with another advertiser of products based on Clark's theories. Clark, who writes books and operates a Mexican clinic, was not charged in these cases because her claims for the products do not constitute advertising.

Edelson and his Atlanta-based Edelson Center for Environmental and Preventive Medicine are facing another lawsuit in connection with his mistreatment of an autistic boy. The suit charges that: - The child's parents consulted Edelson when the child was four years old. Edelson told them (falsely) that autism has a toxic basis and that everybody who undergoes his treatments gets better, but if treatment were not begun right away, the autism would become \"permanent\" when the child turned six. - Edelson had tests performed on 20 tubes of blood and reported that the child's body had been \"damaged immensely by poisons\" and needed \"biodetoxification,\" chelation, and nutritional therapies beginning with seven weeks of daily treatments. Although it represented a financial hardship, the family paid $43,700 in advance for these treatments. - The treatments were difficult and painful, involving multiple intravenous treatment (chelation therapy) with frequent needle changes due to technician errors. The nutritional regimen included about 50 pills and capsules a day, which often caused the boy to vomit. - During the 7-weeks of treatment, the boy's condition worsened, he lost much weight, and he reversed gains previously made through behavioral and educational therapy. However, Edelson did not personally monitor the child's progress. Two similar suits within the past few years have been settled out of court with substantial payment. [Barrett S.

I did not abandon iridology and much of \"alternative medicine\" lightly. It was a decision that I struggled with, but my conscience forced me to make the fateful choice. When I abandoned the field I lost my income and my identity. It was a difficult choice, to say the least. How did I get involved with \"alternative medicine\", and what prompted my decision to forsake a field that was such an important part of my life? Let's Start At the Very Beginning I was born into a family that had a natural interest in \"alternative medicine\". When I was around the age of seven my parents stumbled onto the practice of iridology in their quest to find a cure for my mother's cancer. The practice fascinated me and as my father began to research iridology I learned all I could from him. I eventually received my own certificate from an iridology-training program. As early as age nine I had read Jim Jenks' book \"The Eyes Have It\" and was attempting to tackle Dr. Bernard Jensen's various works on iridology. I learned to look into the iris, the colored part of the eye, and determine an individual's health needs. The theory is that the iris contains nerve fibers connected to various parts of the body through a previously unknown nerve pathway in the cranial nerves. Ignatz Von Peczely, a 19th century Hungarian, reportedly began the study of iridology after noticing changes in patients' irises. Proponents claim: - The information from each organ of the body is relayed to the iris via the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III). - The health value of each organ and organ area is determined by examining the color, lightness/darkness, shape, and depth of the fibers of the iris. - Generally the lighter color of the fibers, the more activity, and possibly, sensation (such pain) there is supposed to be at the tissue level of that organ. - Generally the darker an area or fiber, the less the activity in that area. For example, a bright white fiber in the lower back area would likely represent back pain currently being experienced by the owner of the eye, whereas a black area in the lower back would suggest severe back injury that has disrupted the nerve activity from that area. In my practice I subscribed to the Bernard Jensen methods of iridology and found them quite successful. I enjoyed having skeptical clients come into my office and become believers as I told them things about themselves that they didn't think anyone could know. I constantly researched methods to make my practice more precise and read every book I could find written by Bernard Jensen on iridology. [An Example of Bernard Jensen's Eye Chart](http://web.archive.org/web/20021113163311/http://www.mather.infomedia.com/reality/irischart.gif) As is usually the case, my practice in alternative medicine was not limited to simply iridology. I was certified in three forms of applied kinesiology, was taught how to prescribe herbal therapies, used homeopathy, suggested diet changes, and engaged in emotional/spiritual counseling. I also took a strong stand against drug prescriptions, most vaccinations, and most elective surgeries. I firmly believed that medical doctors were trained in how to destroy the body while I had learned methods that really had benefit by building the body from the inside. I personally felt, and taught, that the only benefit of conventional medicine was found in severe emergencies, such as trauma. I believed that the human body was some sort of remarkable collection of intelligent organs and systems that worked together almost magically to create a healthy unit. I believed that illness was the result of poor communication and imbalance between organ systems. I thought that herbal treatments fed the organ systems so that they could work out their kinks and create health from disease. It was my understanding that pharmaceutical treatments only tweaked the organs within a system to cover up the symptoms of a disease. For example I felt that treating a fever from a viral infection with Tylenol only covered up the infection and allowed the virus to return when the host was too weak to protect himself in the future. I felt that the best way to treat a fever was to let it run its course. I thought that the body would best treat itself if we fed it right and that herbs only provided the necessary compounds to treat the body so that it could work its \"magic\". The Beginning of a Change I was a staunch supporter of alternative health care when I decided that a balanced approach to health care should include an understanding of conventional medicine. To that end I decided on a program provided by the Medical Training Institute of America that trained health care consultants. The basic idea of the program appealed to me in that it involved studying directly under practicing physicians in a clinical atmosphere. My hope was that the knowledge I could gain would allow me to better integrate conventional and alternative medicine. One of the requirements for entry in the program was interview by a panel of five doctors. When these men learned of my past training in alternative medicine they balked. After some negotiation we came to an agreement and I breathed a sigh of relief as they agreed to let me in the program. I expected more resistance as I began studying with the doctors assigned to my training. To my surprise many of the physicians were interested in alternative medicine. Once they learned of my past experience and that of my father they asked quite a few questions on various treatments we used. They would describe a sticky point in their treatment of a specific condition and then ask if we had good results with our treatment. When I answered in the affirmative they usually responded with increased interest that would deflate as I explained my answer. I soon learned that alternative and conventional medicine had different levels of evidence and verification of treatment success. As I would explain a treatment that I thought was successful the doctors would ask questions like \"What kind of studies supported this?\" Or \"Is that documented with blood tests?\" I began taking notes on how I could document our results better as well as studies that we needed to look for or instigate. In addition to working in a clinical setting, the health care consultant program included studies in advanced anatomy and physiology, pharmacology, biochemistry, microbiology, and histology. The study of these sciences matured my understanding of alternative medicine. For example, I now understood herbs as biochemical compounds that intervened in bodily functions in much the same way as pharmaceuticals. I returned home from my three years of training with excitement and many new ideas on how to treat and evaluate several conditions. Though I had performed occasional iridology exams on a few individuals prior to the completion of the health care consultant program, my return home marked the beginning of what I had hoped would be a long and successful career as a naturopathic practitioner, and I officially joined my practice with my mentor's successful practice. So Many Imperfections When I began working with iridology, I looked into the iris with a penlight and loupe, marking my findings on a photocopied version of Jensen's eye chart. Eventually I began using a video camera and a monitor to record and examine irises. The video camera was large step in keeping track of changes in the iris and it also allowed me to examine an iris without getting into the patient's face ourselves (reducing the risk of being coughed on and smelling too much bad breath). The use of the camera to record and review past visits refined my ability to see changes in the iris. When using the chart to record iris signs I found that my ability to detail exact proportions of iris signs from visit to visit was extremely variable, and left too much up to my fallible memory. The use of the video record allowed me to measure signs and detail any change. It soon became apparent to me that the video camera had some major limitations as well. Before I explain the flaws, let me describe how we used the video camera to record the iris. The video camera itself was fastened to a device that had a cup for the patient's chin to rest in and essentially remain stationary. The camera was affixed to a platform on the device that would allow the camera to be rolled in two planes- forward to back, and side to side. The camera was fitted with a macro lens that allowed an enlarged picture of the iris to fill the entire video screen. Each eye was recorded singly; the right being the first, with a penlight illuminating from the outside and the eyes focused on a stationary object. Each eye was recorded for 10-15 seconds with the penlight moving between two points to allow the iridologist to view parts of the iris that would otherwise be obscured by the glare of the penlight (the glare would appear as a bright white dot about 1cm in diameter). I soon found that structure \"changes\" could be created on the video record by changing the angle of the light to the eye. Areas that I thought were dark would suddenly show healing lines when the position of the light changed. Thick white lines would change to thin gray lines when the light moved. More than once during this period an eminent iridologist would call me to his office and show me a change he had recorded in patient's iris minutes after doing a spinal adjustment. After closely examining his recordings, it became obvious to me that his light position and the angle of the camera to the eye had varied from time to time causing the appearance of a change in the iris. Not only did the light placement affect the appearance of structures; the slow draining of the batteries in the penlight changed the appearance of the eye color. If the iris was recorded using two-week-old batteries it would have a slightly yellow tint. If the iris was recorded with newly opened batteries, the iris colors would almost be washed out. The lighting in the room also had an effect on the recorded color due to the contrast the camera measured. The variables were so great that I began to entirely distrust any changes that I found in the iris while using the camera. A New Opportunity The solution came to me while reading another iridologist's site. He described a specialized camera that has an excellent method of defining the ideal placement for the camera to photograph the eye. I passed the information on to my friend, who purchased the camera and allowed me to use it for my clients when I was working in his office. I was ecstatic with the opportunities the new camera presented. The camera used the same flash every time which meant the lighting would keep the color constant. The flash was always in the same place, reducing the possibility of changes in shadow placement. The camera used two intersecting lines projected on the target to indicate correct placement, thus guaranteeing that the iris would always be the same size in every picture. The film was highly refined so as to show every fiber well defined. It was most certainly a superior method of recording the iris, and I was set to have strong proof of iris changes. I was thrilled with my first \"documented\" iris change until I set out to measure the fibers in the iris that showed change. It soon became apparent that the changes were actually due to changes in the angle of the camera to the eye. When I corrected for this, I found very few changes in the iris, and no changes in the actual structure. The changes I found in a few irises were actually in the color. When I experimented with changes in angles, I found that the angle of light going into the eye, and the level of lighting in the room, had an effect on pupil size. Pupil size had a direct link to fiber size, and fiber size seemed, in some cases, to be related to colors that appeared in the iris. This was more obvious in someone who had more than one color present in his or her iris. I, for example, have brown, green, yellow, and blue appearing in my iris. In different degrees of lighting my eyes have a different appearance. It is for this reason that different people have told me that my eyes are entirely brown, green, or blue. In a smaller way pupil size affects the appearance of color in a magnified iris. Not only does light have influence on pupil size, but the autonomic nervous system also has an influence on the pupil size, thus a person's degree of fear or alarm can change pupil size. An iridologist purports to be capable of telling a great deal about a person based on the color of single fiber. This variable became quite important for that reason. When I corrected for all these variables, I found very few iris changes. More importantly, I found very few iris changes in people who had significant health changes in the prior months. In many of the cases where the iris seemed to have changed, it had changed inappropriate to the physical changes that had been known to occur. In other words, I discovered that the iris did not reflect the level of health in the body. But What About All Those Incredible Findings? I have been queried by those who have read my site as to how their iridologist was able to provide information that the patient thought no one else could know. One answer is coincidence. A small percentage of iris signs that seem obvious actually do correlate to actual health conditions. When one of these correlations is found it feeds the iridologist's sense of success and provides a believing patient. The chance for coincidence is increased by the fact that one can have multiple signs in one organ area and that most people who seek health help have commonly occuring illnesses. Another answer is the fact that the iridologist's best tool is general questions. As an iridology student it was drilled into me that iridology cannot diagnose disease. From the holistic (alternative medicine) view this is iridology's strength. Alternative medicine holds that diagnosis is only a method of looking at symptoms and putting a name to them. Iridologists teach that symptoms are late signs of disease and that iridology allows them to catch imbalance in the body before it causes disease. An iridology website states that \"Iridology DOES NOT DIAGNOSE DISEASE, it merely reveals tissue weaknesses, inflammation or toxicity in organs or tissues.\" http://www.herbsbylisa.com/iridology.htm (Lisa Ayala, Last modified: April 22, 2001 and accessed 10/11/02) The beauty of not having to provide a diagnosis from the eye is that the practitioner simply uses the iris to create leading questions. Suppose I had a patient who had a mark in his lung area. My first question would be \"Have you ever had a problem with your lungs? Something like asthma, pneumonia, or emphysema?\" If the patient could remember something like that I was considered a genius, but if there was nothing obvious I would question further. \"Perhaps you have had a cold recently?\" If the answer was no and there wasn't anything obvious the next step would be to look at the bowel, which is theorized to cause lung weakness. The bowel is represented in the eye as the area directly around the pupil and is usually darker than the rest of the iris. If the bowel was dark then the obvious answer was that the patient had an unknown lung weakness resultant from the bowel. If there was no bowel problem, the last answer was that there was a genetic lung weakness that needed to be treated to prevent future problems. Does this process prove iridology? No, in fact, it condemns iridology. If the exam brings up a past history of lung problems, it simply identifies iridology as a cumbersome method of gathering a medical history and does not prove iridology's ability to diagnose since the iris cannot identify the nature of the problem. If the exam shows a connection to the bowel it illustrates the fact that iridology flies in the face of recognized science and medicine for the lung-bowel connection has been investigated fruitlessly in true science. Suppose the lung weakness seen is suspected to be a genetic weakness that has not manifested. The iridologist congratulates the patient for coming in when he did. If other tests do not indicate the suspected lung weakness, the iridologist replies with the statement that iridology can pick up weaknesses before they even grow to the point that they are discernable to other methods of examination. If the patient follows the iridologist's treatment guidelines and never develops a lung problem, the patient is congratulated for avoiding a future problem. If the patient refuses treatment for his lung problem and never develops a problem with the lung the iridologist considers it a problem that is hanging over the head of the patient. If the patient ever develops any lung problem of any kind it is attributed to the weakness found in the lung. The question that is brought to my mind is how do we know that the iris is indicating properly a lung weakness if the sign cannot be substantiated by any other method? Furthermore, how did that sign ever come to mean lung weakness if no reliable method was able to prove it? I believe that in the final analysis, iridology is very suspect and cannot fall into the category of science. Iridology is fraught with observations that are either unsubstantiated by reliable methods or simply based on questionable anecdotal evidence. Even good scientific studies have failed in their attempts to prove the potential of iridology to pick up on signs indicating known health conditions in patients. (which should be glaring in the iris) Is There Science in Iridology? As my inquiry of iridology proceeded, the issue of science did come up. How could I prove to someone else that the iris was anatomically and physiologically equipped to indicate what I was taught to believe it could? Early in my iridology training I was taught that nerve impulses reach the brain from the tissues in the body and are routed to the iris through the optic nerve. When the nerve information reached the iris fibers it caused a restructuring in the iris to reflect the condition of the tissues of the body. As my training went on, my teachers came across the sad fact that the iris and optic nerve have little influence on each other. The theory then changed to state that the information reached the iris via the oculomotor nerve. What evidence indicates that the iris can change fiber structure based on the information it receives via the oculomotor nerve? One iridologist has claimed, \"We know from research using electron microscopes, that each fiber in the iris is actually a nerve sheath containing over 20,000 nerve fibers. Each of the nerve fibers travels through the central nervous system to every organ, system and area of the human body. As such, each region of the iris represents an area of the body.\" (eGuide on iridology) Is there correlation for this evidence? A histology text states, \"The anterior (front) surface of the iris is irregular and rough, with grooves and ridges. It is formed by a discontinuous layer of pigment cells and fibroblasts. Beneath this layer is a poorly vascularized (blood fed) connective tissue with few fibers and many fibroblasts and melanocytes (color cells). The next area is rich in blood vessels embedded in loose connective tissue.\" [Taken from page 456 of Basic Histology 8th edition by L. Carlos Junquerira, Jose Carneiro, Robert O. Kelley ISBN: 0-8385-0567-8] In other words, the iris fibers are not bundles of nerve fibers, but strands of cells that are similar to the ones in cartilage. With this \"microanatomy\" in mind, where is the scientific support for the idea of a structural change to the iris via the nervous system? Unless other evidence is presented, there is no support for this idea. The whole issue of presenting an anatomic, histologic, and physiologic basis for iridology is crucially important. Up to the point that I was finally willing to question the basic ideas of iridology, my previous studies presented only a shadow of doubt. Up to this point, I was able to question the validity and value of my conclusions against iridology because other iridologists had opposite conclusions or found nothing wrong with conclusions similar to mine. It was hard to believe that something I trusted most of my life was wrong. Support For Color Changes? Looking back it is amazing to me that I thought iridology had any chance scientifically. Once I took a look at the basic anatomy of the eye and nervous system I knew it was impossible to make a change structurally, but what about color? Perhaps the iris did not change itself structurally, but perhaps color changes would be possible to support scientifically. I knew, as stated above, that without special equipment it would be difficult to prove or disprove meaningful color changes in the iris. The question was if anyone had done such observation and if it was found to mean anything. In order to understand any observations on iris color change one must understand the process of developing color in the iris of the eye. The base color of the iris is made up of very dark pigmented cells that are at the underside of the iris which reflect back visual blue light, thus giving the appearance of a blue eye. In albinos, the lack of pigment allows light to reflect off the blood vessels giving a pink reflection. It is the level of pigment in the upper (exterior) levels of the iris that give variation on eye colors from blue-green to dark brown. Just as genes are influential on the level of pigmentation of the skin, so genes have influence on eye color, and the structure of the iris. I was taught as a young iridology student that various colors in the iris were deposits of chemicals. For example, a rust spot in the iris was a small spot of an injected chemical from a vaccine, or a brilliant yellow spot was the result of a sulfur deposit in the eye from the ingestion of a sulpha drug. The fact is that these spots are collections of melanin; similar to the substance that causes freckles in the skin. Eminent iridologists have written in their works that these spots were found to contain metals and other substances in autopsies. Unless metals or other substances were injected directly in the iris this cannot be true. Based on the fact that iridology does not reflect true anatomy, physiology, or histology of the iris, and based on the fact that iris colors are not determined by nerve input, it became ludicrous for me to believe that iris color is any indication of health in remote organs. Some iridologists suggest that eye color and fiber structure are unchanging and are useful to indicate certain predisposition to mental and physical disorders. These iridologists once again use generalities and other useless methods to describe the usefulness of their method. They unfortunately fail in their attempts at using logic and science correctly. What is My Next Step? Based on what I now know I can find no argument that could persuade me to return to practicing iridology. Sadly, my interactions with practicing iridologists have failed to dissuade them from practicing what I feel is a deceptive and damaging practice. Why don't any other iridologists see the light? I am not able to answer that question accurately, but I can state that every iridologist I have gotten to know thoroughly believes that iridology is one of the best methods available for ascertaining the health of one's body. I am sure that there are some who practice iridology simply to dupe people and make money. Plenty of income can be made with iridology, but many, if not most, iridologists charge a relatively small fee for their services. These people honestly believe that they are helping people. Despite the pure motives of those who practice iridology, one is forced to wonder how an iridologist can practice despite all the evidence against iridology. Several reasons come into play, and the list is much longer than can be enumerated here. When I was fully persuaded of the value of iridology, I was constantly confronted with evidence against iridology. I was not dissuaded from the practice by this evidence because I had believed the illogical answers I had been given by my own teachers. To this day I cannot explain how the spell was finally broken. I do not understand fully what made the difference, but I do know that being trained in true science was a part of the equation. I have been asked by many if my rejection of iridology translates into a rejection of all of alternative medicine. I would answer no. Iridology fits into a category of disproved alternative health care practices. These practices have no basis in real anatomy and physiology and have failed well-done trials and studies. Practices that fall into this category include applied kinesiology, reflexology, therapeutic touch, homeopathy, and the Hulda Clark cure for all diseases (zapper, etc.). There are other aspects of alternative medicine that I cannot dismiss without more comment. These may have some scientific support, but are misused or over-used in alternative medicine. Some examples in this category are herbs and supplements. I feel that herbs are actually the same as pharmaceuticals and should be treated with the same respect. I disagree with the motto \"I use herbs instead\" because herbs act the same way inside the body as their counterparts behind the prescription counter. One of my biggest problems with so-called \"natural medicine\" is that many practitioners advise herbs without any training of any kind in the science of pharmacology. I was counted as one of these. Master herbalists suggest herbs based on historic use, personal experience, patient reports of benefits, and some sketchy information from clinical trials. Few herb studies even exist to indicate interactions in the delicate systems of the kidneys and liver. Despite these limitations herbalists, iridologists, applied kinesiologists and others advise patients on the use of multiple herbs though there is little information in their libraries as to the effectiveness, benefit, and safety of these substances. On top of this, these poorly trained practitioners are confidently advising their clients to take herbs along with the prescription medicine suggested by their bona fide physicians. Many of these individuals advising herb use don't know the meaning of cytochrome p-450 let alone how the system works. I am willing to bet that many would think the term to mean some new dietary supplement. My own practice of alternative medicine became very uncomfortable to me as I learned how little I had actually been taught. I began suggesting fewer and fewer supplements, trying to keep to those that I knew were documented as safe. I eventually became so uncomfortable that I felt physically ill and drained when I completed my sessions with patients. I ultimately decided to abandon my practice and begin the process of furthering my education. That is where I am now. My goal is to be a practioner of true health care\u2014a medical doctor. To be honest, I am sure that our conventional Western medicine is not a perfect, flawless system, but my experience in alternative medicine convinces me that conventional, evidence-based medicine is a big step up compared to the alternative.

It summarizes scientific Web site evaluations; recommended and nonrecommended books; and other information relevant to consumer protection and consumer decision-making. FTC hits major weight-loss scammers. The Federal Trade Commission has charged a Utah-based company, five related corporations, and three individuals with making many false and unsubstantiated claims for weight-loss and fat-loss gels and supplements. The complaint focuses on six heavily promoted products: Dermalin, Cutting Gel, and Tummy Flattening Gel (topical fat-loss gels with the same active ingredient); Leptoprin and Anorex weight-loss supplements for \"significantly overweight\" people which contained ephedrine, caffeine, aspirin, calcium and an additional patented ingredient); and PediaLean (a glucomannan weight-loss supplement for children). The defendants are Basic Research, Waterhouse, Ph.D., also doing business as American Phytotherapy Research Laboratory; and Mitchell K. Friedlander, all operating from the same Salt Lake City facility. The corporations operate as a common enterprise. Leptoprin has been heavily advertised through short-form infomercials; the topical gels have been promoted through newspapers and national magazines, such as Cosmopolitan, and Muscle and Fitness; and PediaLean has been advertised in magazines such as Redbook. Dermalin, Cutting Gel, and Tummy Flattening Gel all contain the active ingredient aminophylline in a lecithin base. Dermalin and Tummy Flattening Gel are sold under the trade names Klein-Becker USA and Sovage and are advertised primarily to women interested in thinning their figures. Cutting Gel, sold under the Nutrasport trade name, is primarily advertised to male bodybuilders who want to eliminate areas of fat that obscure their muscle definition. The challenged claims include: - Dermalin, Cutting Gel, and Tummy Flattening Gel cause rapid and visibly obvious fat loss in areas of the body to which they are applied. - Published, clinical testing proves that Cutting Gel and Tummy Flattening Gel cause rapid and visibly obvious fat loss in areas of the body to which they are applied. - Leptoprin and Anorex cause weight loss of more than 20 pounds in significantly overweight users and that those products cause loss of substantial, excess fat in significantly overweight users. - Clinical testing proves that Leptoprin causes weight loss of more than 20 pounds, including as much as 50, 60, or 147 pounds, in significantly overweight users. - Clinical testing proves that Leptoprin causes loss of substantial, excess fat in significantly overweight users. - PediaLean causes substantial weight loss in overweight or obese children, and that clinical testing proves such claims. - Mowrey is a medical doctor. A notice order issued with the complaint prohibits the defendants from making unsubstantiated claims about health or weight-loss benefits, performance, safety, or efficacy of any service, program, dietary supplement, food, drug, or device. The order also prohibits misrepresentations about tests or the profession, expertise, training, education, experience or qualifications of Mowrey or any other endorser.

FTC challenges claims for children's weight-loss pill and women's sex aid. The FTC has charged three Florida-based companies and their principals with making false and unsubstantiated claims that \"Pedia Loss\" is an appetite suppressant for children 6 and older that slows the absorption of fat and safely burn[s] fat. The Commission's administrative complaint names Dynamic Health of LLC; Chhabra Group LLC; DBS Laboratories, LLC; Vincent Jonathan Pedia Loss was advertised through www.pedialoss.com, www.dynamichealthproducts.com, and www.dbslabs.com, and in Cosmopolitan magazine. The complaint also challenges advertising disseminated by respondents for Fabulously Feminine, a supplement purportedly designed to enhance female sexuality. The defendants advertised Fabulously Feminine on www.usaprescription.com, www.dbslabs.com, and www.medprescribe.com, and in print ads in various newspapers. The complaint alleges that their claims that Fabulously Feminine will increase a woman's libido, sexual desire, and sexual satisfaction by stimulating blood flow and increasing sensitivity. The FTC also disputes the claim that clinical testing proves that Fabulously Feminine enhances a woman's satisfaction with her sex life and level of sexual desire is false.

Appeals court upholds license revocation of \"biological dentist.\" A Florida Court of Appeals has upheld the Florida Board of Dentistry order revoking the license of Douglas J. Phillips, D.D.S., of West Palm Beach, Florida. In 2001, the Board concuded that Phillips had (a) failed to keep adequate records, (b) failed to maintain malpractice insurance, and (c) practiced below the standard of care. The substandard practice included Autonomic Response Testing (ART), a variation of [applied kinesiology](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/ak.html) in which muscle tests are used to diagnose health problems throughout the patient's body. According to the judge's report, Phillips's dental assistant held the patient's hand with one hand while Phillips pulled down on the assistant's other arm. When the assistant's shoulder muscle tested weak after the patient was exposed to a stimulus, Phillips concluded that the area of the patient's body corresponding to the stimulus was not healthy. If the assistant's shoulder remained strong, Phillips concluded that the tested area was healthy. The various stimuli included touching the patient's individual teeth and placing heavy metals, bacteria from root canal teeth, and homeopathic remedies on the patient's lap. Phillips alleged that these tests enabled him to determine the condition of the patient's internal organs, evaluate her dental problems, and identify the homeopathic remedies that would best promote healing. Based on the results, he concluded that the patient's tonsils, heart, spleen, pancreas, liver, gall bladder, large intestines, and pubic area were compromised and that two of the patient's teeth with root canals were toxic. In addition to the revocation, the Board assessed $151,181.24 for administrative costs. Phillips appealed the Board's decision through the court system and obtained a temporary stay that enabled him to continue practicing. However, in April 2004, [the appeals court concluded](http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/phillips.pdf): Where the Board faced public policy issues concerning a dentist's continued use of practices one of its members described as \"bogus\" and \"quackery,\" its determination that revocation was appropriate is especially entitled to deference and will not easily be disturbed. It may seem unfortunate for this dentist that the Board has made him an example of the type of dentistry the Board has decided to discourage. But the Board is given precisely that power. Indeed, its very purpose is to regulate competency in the dental profession.

Immunization has not been isolated as a risk factor for SIDS and, in fact, babies who receive their scheduled shots are less likely to die of SIDS.

While we are aware that serious adverse outcomes such as high fever, seizures, convulsions and even death\u2014though rare\u2014may occur in a very few children, the risk of leaving a child unprotected against such dangerous diseases as tetanus or whooping cough is thousands of times greater than any risk posed by using the vaccines.

It summarizes scientific Web site evaluations; recommended and nonrecommended books; and other information relevant to consumer protection and consumer decision-making. Chiropractic board attacks physical therapist unfairly. The Arkansas State Board of Chiropractic Examiners has fined physical therapist Michael Teston, of Little Rock, Arkansas, $10,000 for allegedly practicing chiropractic without a license. The action was based on the claim that he had manipulated a patient's spine. The Arkansas Board of Physical Therapists has ruled that Teston's treatment was mobilization, not manipulation, and was therefore within the lawful scope of physical therapy. However, the chiropractic board concluded that because his treatment caused an audible \"popping\" sound, it was manipulation, which is reserved for licensed chiropractors and physicians. The chiropractic board's ruling is part of a longstanding chiropractic campaign intended to stop physical therapists from doing what chiropractors consider uniquely theirs. About two years ago, the American Chiropractic Association sought (unsuccessfully) to prevent Medicare from paying for manipulation performed by physical therapists. Teston has appealed the ruling to the Circuit Court and and would appreciate help with his legal costs. Contributions should be sent to ArPTA fund for Michael Teston, c/o Jennifer Coleman, 9 Shackleford Plaza, Suite 1, Little Rock, AR 72211.

[Some Notes on Lorraine Day](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/day.html). Quackwatch, revised Sept 28, 2003] Spam opponent wins $250,000 judgment. Anti-spam activist Nigel Featherston has won a $250,000 default judgment in the Superior Court of Washington State for King County against a spam organization known for sending millions of spam emails ranging from multilevel schemes to diet pills. The judgment was against Charles F. Childs and Linda Jean Lightfoot, Ohio spammers doing business as Universal Direct, Mega Direct and Ultra-Trim, among others. An engineer and former Microsoft developer, Featherston began fighting spam in 1998 when he was deluged with unwanted emails that required him to change his email address. He filed numerous complaints, often getting the senders' web sites shut down. In March 2002, in retribution, spammers used his email address in spam sent to others, which resulted in thousands of bounced back emails coming to Featherston's address and overwhelming his system. Washington's anti-spam law statute permits asking for $500 per spam. In this case, Featherston could have sued for $29 million, but decided that a $250,000 request would be sufficient. The court concluded that he had sufficient evidence that he had received approximately 58,000 illegal e-mails due to the defendants' actions. [ [Washington State resident wins $250,000 spam e-mail case](http://ec-magic.com/NewsRelease.htm).

FTC news release, April 2, 2002] Dr. Clark Research Association signs stipulation. The Dr. Clark Research Association (a nonprofit organization in California), Behandlungzentrum GMbH (a Swiss company), and Scientologist David Amrein (a Swiss citizen who is the sole officer and director of both entities) have agreed to abide by temporary order that would prohibit them from making unsubstantiated product-related claims that: - Use of the Super-Zapper Deluxe is effective to kill bacteria, viruses and parasites in the human body. - Use of the Super-Zapper Deluxe is effective against chronic infections, cancer and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). - The Super-Zapper Deluxe and the Complete Herbal Parasite Program are effective to cure all forms of cancer in humans. - Dr. Clark's New 21 Day Program for Advanced Cancers is effective to cure all forms of cancer in humans. - Dr. Clark's New 21 Day Program for Advanced Cancers has cured numerous people with advanced cases of cancer. - The Syncrometer device is more accurate than the best testing methods at diagnosing all forms of disease. - The Syncrometer device can detect the presence of any substance at specific points in the human body. - The Super-Zapper Deluxe, used together with the Complete Herbal Parasite Program, is effective to cure AIDS. - The Super-Zapper Deluxe, used together with the complete Herbal Parasite Program and avoidance of pollutants, is effective to cure diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, endometriosis, asthma, and many other diseases. - Dr. Clark's New 21 Day Program for Advanced Cancers and Super-Zapper Deluxe, when used by persons with cancer, make surgery and chemotherapy unnecessary. The agreement, which is awaiting court approval, would remain in effect until an October 30th hearing at which the court will consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction. The above-mentioned claims are based on the notions of Hulda Clark, an unlicensed naturopath who obtained her \"degree\" from a nonaccredited correspondence school. In 2001, the FTC obtained a consent agreement with another company selling Clark-recommended products.

Washington Attorney General sues another quack device operator. The Attorney General of Washington has accused Monte Kline and Pacific Health Centers of misrepresenting the significance of Kline's credentials and misrepresenting the diagnostic capabilities of electrodermal testing (EDT). The Attorney General believes that Pacific Health Center has administered this test to at least 3,000 consumers over the past two years, typically charging $395 for an initial test and $99 for a follow-up test one month later. The Consumer Protection Act authorizes a penalty of up to $2,000 per violation. The state is asking the court to order Pacific Health Center to discontinue electrodermal testing, provide restitution, and pay civil penalties and attorney's costs and fees.

The libel suit involving Stephen Barrett, M.D., and a physician who disseminated a libelous message about him has been settled amicably. The defendant is an osteopathic physician who practices family medicine in Schaumburg, Illinois, and operates a heavily trafficked Web site. The suit arose after the defendant posted an article by Patrick \"Tim\" Bolen which falsely stated that Barrett (a) was de-licensed, (b) had committed extortion, and (c) had been disqualified as an expert in a malpractice suit. In settling the case, the defendant acknowledged that he had investigated these allegations and concluded that he could not substantiate them. The settlement also included payment of $50,000 to Barrett for legal expenses.

A U.S. District Court Judge has dismissed a lawsuit which charged that Trigon Healthcare had set \"unconscionably inadequate reimbursements\" and conspired in various ways to restrict payments for chiropractic services.\" [The suit](http://www.chirobase.org/08Legal/trigon1.pdf), filed in August 2000, charged that Trigon, which is Virginia's largest managed-care company, had unfairly (a) issued clinical practice guidelines; (b) maintained a $500 reimbursement cap on spinal manipulations; (c) reduced payment rates for other services; leveled payments for manipulating multiple regions of the spine; and (d) avoided negotiating with chiropractors about their payment terms. The judge concluded that Trigon's efforts to control its costs had been appropriate and that the company had done nothing illegal. [Jones JP. [Opinion. American Chiropractic Association et al v.

An Australian federal court has ordered [The Buyers Group Pty Ltd](http://www.buyersgroup.com.au/) to make AU$1.2 million available for refunds to people who bought its the Feminique Slimming System between October 1999 to August 2001. The product, an electronic muscle stimulation (EMS) device, had been marketed with false claims that it could (a) exercise, tone, firm or pull back into shape any part of the user's body without effort by the user; (b) burn up fat; (c) flatten the stomach without any effort by the user; and (d) result in the user losing three kilograms in weight and reducing the user's waist measurements by three centimeters in four weeks; and (e) that it is ideal for those who want to see effective and immediate results. The court ordered that corrective advertisements be broadcast for two weeks on Network Ten's Good Morning Australia (which had broadcast advertorials) and on the company's Web site. Consumers who believe they have been misled have 28 days from the conclusion of the advertisements to apply for a refund. The court also found that The Buyers Group's sole director, Josephus Schoonenberg, and an employee, Marianne Schoonenberg, were knowingly responsible for the misconduct.

Here are several passages from \"The Last Days of the Quackbusters\" that show why Bolen should not be regarded as trustworthy. |What Bolen Said||The Facts| |The \"Quackbuster\" operation is a conspiracy. It is a propaganda enterprise, one part crackpot, two parts evil. It has declared war on reality.||A conspiracy is a an agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act. None of the people who are fighting quackery are acting illegally, and the information we distribute is accurate.| |The conspirators are acting in the interests of, and are being paid, directly and indirectly, by the \"conventional\" medical-industrial complex.||Our consumer-protection activities are done as a public service and not for personal gain.| |The \"Quackbuster Conspiracy\" was started shortly after the American Medical Association (AMA) lost the court battle to the Chiropractors in Federal court in 1976. The Federal judge ordered the AMA's covert operation shut down - and leave the Chiropractors alone. | Barrett, and his minions, had the common sense to stay away from criticizing Chiropractors until (I believe) the Federal Judge died. Federal judges have a way of enforcing their decisions using shackles, Federal Marshals, the federal prison facilities, asset seizure, etc... Even Barrett, in all his incredible arrogance, isn't dumb enough to match wills with a Federal Judge. |In 1976, various chiropractors began a series of civil suits against the AMA, other professional organizations, and several individual critics, charging that they had conspired to destroy chiropractic and to illegally deprive chiropractors of access to laboratory, x-ray, and hospital facilities. Most of the defendant groups agreed in out-of-court settlements that their physician members were free to decide for themselves how to deal with chiropractors. | In 1987\u2014not 1976 as stated by Bolen\u2014federal court judge Susan Getzendanner concluded that during the 1960s \"there was a lot of material available to the AMA Committee on Quackery that supported its belief that all chiropractic was unscientific and deleterious.\" The judge also noted that chiropractors still took too many x-rays. However, she ruled that the AMA had engaged in an illegal boycott. She concluded that the dominant reason for the AMA's antichiropractic campaign was the belief that chiropractic was not in the best interest of patients. But she ruled that this did not justify attempting to contain and eliminate an entire licensed profession without first demonstrating that a less restrictive campaign could not succeed in protecting the public. The case was decided on narrow legal grounds (restraint of trade) and was not an evaluation of chiropractic methods. The judge enjoined the AMA from doing certain things that it had stopped doing several years previously. The AMA was not enjoined from issuing justifiable criticisms. The I was not a party to the suit but, even if I had been, the judge's order would not apply to anything that I do. Bolen's notion that the judge died many years ago shows how carelessly he \"investigates.\" It took me less than a minute with a search engine to find that she was practicing law with the firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Chicago. |The AMA files, library, etc., ended up in Stephen Barrett's 1,800 square foot basement in Allentown, PA.||I don't have the AMA's health fraud files. If they still exist, they would be either in the AMA library or in storage facilities controlled by the AMA. | Sal D'Onofrio, through his attorney, hired us, at day 43 in solitary confinement in the Orange County Jail. He was in \"solitary\" because that's what they do with sex criminals. He was in jail because the judge had set bail at $500,000, an amount his supporters couldn't raise. Barrett's minions were ruining D'Onofrio's life in the press. We organized a bail hearing for day 48 of incarceration. . . . The judge let D'Onofrio out on his own recognizance. Seven weeks later the prosecutor dropped the charges. Bolen subsequently claimed to have copies of police reports and a summary of a telephone interview of me by a police investigator. The documents, which we obtained through the discovery process, indicate that in 1996, a police investigator questioned me about the [American College of Nutripathy](https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/reams.html), a nonaccredited correspondence school from which D'Onofrio had obtained three \"degrees\" during a 21-month period. I have no recollection of his name being mentioned during the interview, and nothing in the police report indicates that it was. At a deposition, Bolen also produced a newspaper article indicating that D'Onofrio's arrest was triggered by a woman who had complained to the police that she had been inappropriately fondled during an examination in D'Onofrio's home. The article also stated that at least ten other women had made similar complaints after the arrest was made public.

[Feskanich D and others. Vitamin A intake and hip fractures among postmenopausal women. JAMA 287:47-54, 2002] The increase was attributable to dietary intake of retinol (preformed vitamin A) rather than beta-carotene (which the body converts into vitamin A). The data were derived from a total of 72,337 women aged 34 to 77 years who were followed for up to 18 years. The authors concluded that \"long-term intake of a diet high in retinol may promote the development of osteoporotic hip fractures on women\" and that \"the amounts of retinol in fortified foods and vitamin supplements may need to be reassessed since these add significantly to total retinol consumption in the United States.\" The most significant food sources of retinol in the United States are animal liver, milk, butter, margarine, fortified breakfast cereals, and meal-replacement beverages.

On December 19, the The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a [letter asking doctors to review their cases of liver toxicity](http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/SAFETY/2001/kava.htm) to determine whether any may be related to the use of kava-containing herbal products and to report such cases to MedWatch. The request was made because products containing extracts of kava have been implicated in Europe in at least 25 cases of serious liver toxicity, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. In addition, the FDA has received several reports of serious injury allegedly associated with the use of kava-containing products, with at least one report of liver failure requiring liver transplantation in a previously healthy young woman. Health care costs rising sharply. The Center for Studying Health System Change has concluded that health-care costs rose sharply in 2000, the largest increase in a decade. Despite the recent focus on increased spending for prescription drugs, the upward trend was largely attributable to rising hospital spending. The likely causes for are the retreat from tightly managed care (which may have raised the level of use of hospital services), increased leverage on the part of hospitals to demand higher payments from insurers, and labor shortages. Total health care costs in 2000 rose 7.2%, with inpatient and outpatient care accounting for 47% of the increase. Prescription drug spending, while still high, dropped to a 14.5% increase in 2000, down from an 18.4% increase in 1999. Spending for physician services decreased from 5.7% in 1999 to 4.8% in 2000. If these trends continue, in light of a slowing economy and shrinking corporate profits, employers could respond by raising their employees' out-of-pocket costs, and the number of uninsured persons could grow.

Hearing on Swindlers, Hucksters and Snake Oil Salesmen: The Hype and Hope of Marketing Anti-Aging Products to Seniors September 10, 2001A Written Response to the Statement of the Honorable Dan Burton (R-IN), Chairman, House Committee on Government ReformBy Timothy N. Gorski, M.D., F.A.C.O.G. Assistant Clinical Professor, University of North Texas Health Science Center President, Dallas/Fort Worth Council Against Health Fraud Board Member, National Council Against Health Fraud Associate Editor, Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine Introduction The Honorable Congressman Dan Burton's forceful objections to the Senate Special Committee's hearing and his accusations directed at me and my testimony are serious and deserve a response. I appreciate the opportunity of doing so, though it is without benefit of a paid research staff. In addition, I am under considerable pressure of time while caring for my patients in my full-time practice of obstetrics and gynecology as well as meeting my family obligations. Although I prefer to be brief, the nature of these objections limits that intention. The Nature and Purpose of the Hearing To begin with, Chairman Breaux and the Senate Special Committee on Aging are to be commended, not condemned, for considering the very serious problem of fraud in the dietary supplement industry and, in particular, its impact on older Americans. This problem has received very little attention since the 1984 Pepper Report [1], and it is absolutely clear that current law and enforcement resources have been and remain insufficient to address it. Senator Breaux made it very clear in his opening remarks that the focus of the hearing was on the \"bad actors\" in the multibillion dollar dietary supplement industry. The activities of Mr. A. Glenn Braswell were considered in detail and it was brought out that current penalties for fraud in this business are insufficient to stop or deter it. Mr. Braswell and Mr. Tepper, appearing under subpoena, repeatedly exercised their Fifth Amendment privileges. Additional witnesses, including myself, presented evidence, including many examples, showing that Mr. Braswell's misbehavior is far from unique and must be considered in its context to be understood. It was clearly and emphatically not the purpose of the hearing to indiscriminately discount the benefit of all vitamin, mineral or other supplementation of the diet or to condemn all manufacturers of such products. No evidence was presented that would argue for such a conclusion. Nor was the purpose of the hearing to take issue with well-established facts concerning the health benefits of diet, exercise, or the use of vitamin and mineral supplementation generally or in the management of specific health problems. On the contrary, evidence was presented by myself showing that perpetrators of fraud take advantage of the deliberate blurring of distinctions between the rational and the irrational engaged in by advocates of the latter. It was also not the purpose of the hearing to consider the many ways in which the nation's medical care system as a whole might be improved, or even what improvement might consist of. But the Honorable Congressman Burton took the opportunity to assert that, \"Many of our nation's seniors are subjected to treatments in 'conventional medicine' that are not necessary, cost more and are more dangerous than equally effective alternatives.\" There are simply no facts to support this claim. As I pointed out in my testimony, there is widespread recognition and a wealth of examples to prove that the standards of medical science \u2014 falsely labeled \"conventional,\" and sometimes \"traditional\" or \"orthodox\" \u2014 are in continual flux in response to evidence. Treatments of any kind that are clearly shown to be superior have always quickly supplanted previous methods without need of legislative mandates. This is the essence of scientific progress. Congressman Burton expresses outrage that I would question the conclusions of a report \"published after peer-review in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.\" Yet it is a fact that the findings of the article in question [2] have been systematically misrepresented by its lead author and by other advocates of irrational and aberrant methods including the NCCAM. The facts related to this deception have been documented in another peer-reviewed journal [3]. This is the way of science. The literature is not sacred scripture, but dialogue in which facts are presented, considered, critiqued, and conclusions reached, rejected or modified. But this process should be governed by facts and reason and not by political, ideological or emotional considerations. DSHEA [Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act] Several witnesses identified the 1994 DSHEA legislation, however well-intended it may have been at the time, as a principal contributor to the problem of fraud in the dietary supplement industry. This assessment has also been made by others [4-8], including former FDA Commissioner David Kessler [9] and the editors of The New England Journal of Medicine [10]. As the FDA's own website advises consumers, \"there is no provision under any law or regulation that FDA enforces that requires a firm to disclose to FDA or consumers the information they have about the safety or purported benefits of their dietary supplement products.\" [11] The FDA cannot take action against supplements that are worthless or merely suspected of being harmful, as it can \u2014 and has \u2014 in the case of both prescription and over-the-counter medications. Evidence presented at the hearing showed that the FDA has been unable to remove even dangerous supplements from the marketplace, not even ephedrine products which have injured thousands of people. When enforcement actions are taken, the FDA has no authority to inflict financial penalties, so that perpetrators of fraud bear no net financial cost from their predations. There is not even a requirement that the FDA be notified about the sale of a \"dietary supplement\" or of the identity and whereabouts of its manufacturer and promoters. In essence, the provisions of DSHEA established an enormous and unprecedented \"honor system\" for substances promoted as having drug benefits. Evidence presented at the hearing \u2014 which represented merely a small sampling \u2014 showed that many in the industry are simply not honorable. Nor will the promulgation of good manufacturing practices adequately address the problem. So great has the problem become that polling data now show that \"a majority of Americans surveyed supported the following: to require that the Food and Drug Administration review the safety of new dietary supplements prior to their sale; to provide increased authority to remove from sale those products shown to be unsafe; and to increase government regulation to ensure that advertising claims about the health benefits of dietary supplements are true.\" [12] Evidence was presented at the hearing that the FTC has stepped up its enforcement actions in the regulatory vacuum created by DHSEA. This it has been able to do by relying on its authority to take action against advertising that lacks a competent scientific basis. But Congressman Burton would remove even this means of recourse against fraud in the dietary supplement industry. In the 106th Congress he introduced the so-called \"Dietary Supplement Fairness in Labeling and Advertising Act,\" H.R. 3305, which would have amended the Federal Trade Commission Act in order to render the FTC as ineffectual as the FDA. [13] I am very grateful that the Honorable Congressman Burton raised the matter of red yeast rice as an alternative to prescription \"statin\" drugs. This is yet another excellent example of how DSHEA has corrupted the law and, with it, the understanding of Americans with respect to products promoted as having health benefits. For on the one hand was the \"drug\" lovastatin, sold under the trade name Mevacor\u00ae, which the FDA requires be proven safe and effective for its intended purpose before marketing. On the other hand was the \"dietary supplement\" lovastatin, sold under the trade name Cholestin\u00ae (since reformulated), which was not subject to such strictures. Both contained the same active ingredient possessing the same pharmacologic activity and therefore the same potential for beneficial as well as adverse effects. If the \"drug\" is not safe without its use being prescribed and monitored by a physician, why should the \"dietary supplement\" be so considered? And if the \"dietary supplement\" is safe to use without medical supervision, why not the \"drug\" as well? The same potential for confusion and contradiction exists whenever a substance is found to exist naturally somewhere in the universe and, at the same time, happens to be a prescription medication. Because of the fact that many medications are derived from animal or botanical sources, this situation can be expected to arise frequently. Another current example is that of vinpocetine, sold in Europe as a prescription drug to treat dementia at the same time it is promoted in the US \u2014 probably fraudulently [14] \u2014 as a dietary supplement to improve memory and concentration. Congressman Burton laments the fact that the FDA eventually won its case in the matter of Cholestin\u00ae, but the fact is that if cerivastatin could be found in a plant extract, it could be marketed as a dietary supplement under DSHEA. UNTHSC Clinical Faculty Appointment In addressing the Honorable Congressman Burton's personal attack on me, I would like to begin by thanking his staff for discovering an oversight concerning my clinical faculty appointment to the University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC). Unfortunately, a proper investigation was not conducted with the result that the accusations of intentional misrepresentation or concealed wrongdoing of any kind is absolutely and utterly false, offensive and represents a grotesque smear of both myself and UNTHSC. The facts are very simple. In late 1987 I joined the medical staff of the Dallas-Fort Worth Medical Center in Grand Prairie, Texas, a teaching hospital utilized by what was then the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, later renamed UNTHSC. As a consequence, and much to my satisfaction, I was thereafter continuously involved with the teaching and training of medical students and resident physicians of UNTHSC. In 1991, without my having taken action of any kind, I was notified that I had been appointed to the assistant clinical faculty of the school's department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Though unasked for, I was gratified at this simple recognition of the many freely volunteered unpaid hours of effort that I devoted towards educating future physicians. Other members of the medical staff at the hospital were undoubtedly so recognized as well. But as to those details I have no information. In any case, I continued to have direct involvement with the medical education program at the hospital, including the evaluation of medical students and house staff performance until the hospital's closure on November 7, 2000 as a result of federal budget cuts. At no time did I receive any request from UNTHSC for any credentials verification, a function that was, in any case, carried out routinely by the hospital's medical staff office. Had I received such a request I would have been glad to comply with it. It is outrageous for anyone to assert the contrary: that I could not or would not. It is perhaps even more concerning that it would be assumed that an institution as outstanding and reputable as the UNTHSC would permit uncredentialed or unqualified individuals to teach and supervise its medical students and residents in the difficult, complex, and, at times, hazardous discipline of Obstetrics and Gynecology. I am justly proud of my association with UNTHSC and take spirited exception to its being unjustly slurred. I am in receipt of a letter dated October 10, 2001, from Ronald R. Blanck, DO, President of UNTHSC, a copy of which I have forwarded to the US Senate Special Committee on Aging. Dr. Blanck stated: I have learned that we did appoint you as clinical faculty in 1991, and it was never rescinded. Although you were in an inactive status since 1995, your position as Clinical Assistant Professor in the Department of OB/GYN remains valid. You have received a letter from the Acting Chairman of the Department of OB/GYN, Dr. Gary Meyer, requesting additional information so we may update our files and continue your appointment. But, I repeat since you received no notification of termination, and in fact none was sent, your appointment at the health science center remains in force. I hope this lays to rest any and all doubts in this matter. Office Of Alternative Medicine (OAM) / National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) I did not address the very different and much larger subject of the problems with the OAM/NCCAM in my testimony. My intention was only to put the subject of fraud in the dietary supplement industry into context and to highlight how far government policies of the last decade have departed from the findings of the 1984 Pepper report. But as Congressman Burton characterizes my criticisms of the OAM/NCCAM and the White House Commission on Alternative and Complementary Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP) as unfair or reckless attacks on careful and discerning scientists of world-class abilities and renown, it is necessary for me to cite additional facts to show that this is very far from the truth. The OAM/NCCAM is widely considered \"the brainchild of Iowa Senator Tom Harkin,\" a creature of politics inspired by his personal experience with the use of bee pollen for hayfever symptoms. It was never established that there was any \"unmet research need\" to be met. Given the fact that funds available for medical research are limited, the most important consideration is to address the most pressing problems and to do so in a way that maximizes the likelihood of useful results. These principles have not been followed at the OAM/NCCAM. Numerous professional scientists, many of whom have earned legitimate stature for their work, have objected on just these grounds [16]. The NCCAM is the only division of the NIH that is oriented toward a particular class of therapeutic methods, as vague and confused a concept as \"CAM\" may be. As such, it is the only center that is oriented primarily to the needs, desires and inclinations of practitioners \u2014 whether of acupuncture, homeopathy, \"energy medicine\" or some other belief system \u2014 instead of the needs, problems and circumstances of patients. Wallace Sampson, MD, Editor of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine and Clinical Professor of Medicine at Stanford University who taught a course there on \"alternative medicine\" for 22 years, has called the NCCAM \"a full employment program for pseudoscientists and poor quality physicians.\" [17] Funding decisions at the NCCAM reflect these assessments, as I will shortly show. There is no doubt that the NIH did not welcome the imposition on it of the OAM in November of 1991. But the response among advocates of unproven, disproven and irrational medical claims and methods was euphoric. The first acting director of the office was Stephen C. Groft, D.Pharm, whose \"friendliness towards the initiative was palpable\" according to one enthusiastic advocate [18]. But the peculiar political pedigree of the OAM soon led to problems when this advocate and others on the OAM's Ad Hoc Advisory Committee \"were never consulted\" about the appointment of its first director, Joseph Jacobs MD. To them he seemed \"too conventional in his medical orientation\" and, worse, had no proven track record of practicing or promoting aberrant methods [19]. Within a year of his appointment, Dr. Jacobs was called before a special review hearing by Senator Harkin. At this meeting on June 24, 1993, Senator Harkin's friend Berkley Bedell spoke for unhappy advocates, complaining that all the OAM had to do was to conduct \"field studies\" consisting of compiling anecdotal reports. \"When it was Jacobs' turn to testify,\" according to a report in Science magazine, Senator Harkin \"raked him over the coals\" and made it clear that the purpose of OAM was to \"investigate and validate\" irrational and aberrant therapies. Jacobs was quoted as saying that he considered these marching orders \"very na\u00efve\" as well as \"professionally insulting.\" The article observed that CAM advocates were \"eager to have the imprimatur of an NIH review\" but \"may not want the rigor.\" Dr. Jacobs responded by saying that \"As a taxpayer, I wouldn't trust what comes out of my office under a system like that.\" [20] After announcing his resignation but before actually leaving, Dr. Jacobs was faced with an additional demand in January of 1994 to put four \"alternative medicine\" activists, hand-picked by Senator Harkin, on an OAM advisory panel. According to one account the lawmaker threatened to hold up the entire NIH budget until the individuals were added [21]. These were: - Berkley Bedell, former Iowa Congressman and multimillionaire fishing tackle manufacturer, who claimed that the quack cancer remedy \"714X\" cured his prostate cancer and that a whey treatment devised by a Minnesota farmer cured his Lyme disease [22]. A friend of Senator Harkin, it was Mr. Bedell who first prevailed on the Senator to try bee pollen. - Ralph Moss, who was fired as assistant director of Public Affairs at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for failing \"to properly discharge his most basic job responsibilities.\" [23] He subsequently wrote The Moss Reports, The Cancer Chronicles and several books that attack science-based medicine and extol unproven cancer treatments including those of Stanislaw Burzynski and others. He is still on the Cancer Advisory Panel of the NCCAM and has said that \"There is nothing inherently 'ludicrous' about guided imagery, yoga, massage, homeopathy and therapeutic touch\" in curing serious disease [24]. - Gar Hildebrand, president of the Gerson Research Organization (GRO) in San Diego which promotes the irrational \"Gerson Method\" of cancer treatment. GRO runs a Tijuana cancer clinic at which patients have been charged $9000 for a two week course of unproven care while Mr. Hildebrand lectures them, emphasizing his ties to the NIH [25]. Mr. Hildebrand says that women with ovarian cancer should not receive chemotherapy but should instead \"detoxify the body\" with dietary measures including \"oodles of plant chemicals.\" Once this is done, he says, \"these patients' immune systems become intelligent again. They stop making excess stupid white cells, and create more lymphocytes interested in more types of challenges.\" [26] Hildebrand also promotes coffee enemas, hyperbaric oxygen and other nonsensical treatments for cancer. - Frank Wiewel, head of People Against Cancer (PAC), formerly the Immunoaugmentative Therapy Patients Association. PAC is a referral organization for cancer patients that promotes irrational treatments including the discredited \"Immunoaugmentative Therapy\" devised by zoologist Lawrence Burton, PhD. PAC also promotes the ideas of Hulda Clark and other notorious cancer quacks [27]. The organization's website states that \"you are never told the truth about cancer,\" [28] a detestable falsehood designed to drive a wedge between frightened and desperate cancer victims and their doctors in order to exploit the sick. Wayne Jonas MD assumed leadership at the OAM in July of 1995, almost a year after the departure of Dr. Jacobs. Dr. Jonas is a homeopath, a believer in a discredited 18th Century mystical prescientific theory of medicine that asserts the truth of preposterous \"laws.\" One of these, \"The Law of Similars,\" from which homeopathy takes its name, asserts that substances that cause certain symptoms are effective in treating those same symptoms. Another, \"The Law of Infinitesimals,\" states that diluting a substance makes it more potent. Thus, homeopathic \"medicine\" consists of substances diluted to fantastic proportions, to the point where no molecules of the substance remain. Dr. Jonas was enamored of homeopathy as a medical student at the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in North Carolina. After suggesting that a patient with severe pneumonia be treated with homeopathy, his supervisors asked him to repeat his rotation in medicine. But even as a medical student Dr. Jonas was impervious to reason. As OAM Director he told an interviewer that \"Just as the discovery of infectious agents revolutionized our ability to care for many diseases at the turn of the century, the discovery of what happens when a homeopathic preparation is made and how it impacts the body might revolutionize our understanding of chemistry, biology and medicine.\" [29] Dr Jonas co-authored a book on homeopathy in which he makes it clear that he is certain of its effectiveness but is only doubtful about its mechanism. The pattern of nonexistent molecules \"must be stored in some way in the diluted water/alcohol mixture\" he wrote, suggesting that all manner of occult energies, imaginary \"biophotons\" or New Age quantum effects could be involved [30]. Of late, Dr. Jonas has become frustrated with homeopathy research, perhaps because of the obvious truth in one medical scientist's observation that such research is nothing more than \"a game of chance between two placebos.\" [31] Dr. Jonas has suggested that validating homeopathy \"may require a theory that incorporates subjective variables,\" [32] which is to say, how the thoughts of patients, doctors, and perhaps their next-door neighbors might influence the effects of a homeopathic remedy. This is in line with mystical beliefs in \"nonlocal effects\" caused by \"intentionality,\" or, in other words, psychic powers. This is also entirely consistent with Dr. Jonas' new position on the Scientific Advisory Committee of the paranormalism-oriented Institute for Noetic Sciences (IONS). According to IONS, Dr. Jonas \"envisions the development of protocols using gene-array procedures to examine possible genetic expression arising from CAM signals in distant healing.\" He considers it wrongheaded and obsolete that \"the current view of the body is grounded in molecular biology.\" He prefers to think that \"bodily parts [can] communicate over long distances almost instantaneously\" by means of \"nonlocal characteristics in the biological process, with widely separated parts interacting in ways that don't have obvious physical carriers.\" [33] In June of 2001 Dr. Jonas was on the Program Committee of a conference in San Diego touting the reality of UFO's, paranormalism, Qigong, Orgone Energy and other pseudoscientific claims [34]. His preoccupation with aberrant methods appears to be thoroughly ideological if not religious. At one of the hearings of the WHCCAMP, of which he is an appointed member, he stated: \" a number of groups are now getting into this field from the orthodox community, because there has been some money available. How can we go about sorting through which ones are truly going to capture the spirit of whole person health or how many are looking really at the bottom line, which is getting redder and redder by the year?\" [35] Dr. Jonas left the OAM at the end of 1998 some two months after its conversion to the NCCAM. By that time many eminent and accomplished scientists had called for its defunding, including former presidential science advisor D. Allan Bromley [36-38]. Especially shameful was the allocation about that time of $1.4 million to the work of Nicholas Gonzalez and his bizarre coffee enema and psychic hair analysis cancer treatments. Even Barrie Cassileth, PhD, Chief of the Integrative Medicine Service at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, called Gonzalez' claims and methods \"voodoo magic silly Not scientific. Worse than not scientific. This is pure ridiculousness.\" [39] When Stephen Strauss MD became director of the NCCAM in October of 1999, many supposed that matters could hardly get any worse. Indeed, Dr. Straus' reputation was such that some dared to hope for improvement. But the new director quickly began defending the funding devoted to the work of Dr. Gonzalez [40]. It is true that under Dr. Strauss the NCCAM has also undertaken large-scale multi-center research trials on Saint John's Wort, Ginkgo and glucosamine, the results of which will likely be trustworthy. Sadly, these are unlikely to be clinically useful for reasons that I pointed out in my testimony at the September 10 hearing. Indeed, after almost ten years and hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars spent, nothing has yet come out of the OAM/NCCAM that has been shown to be clinically important. Even a definitive study to determine the effectiveness of the bee pollen that Senator Tom Harkin believes cured his hayfever has not been undertaken. But Dr. Strauss' leadership at the NCCAM is disturbing for other reasons. There is clear evidence either that he lacks scientific judgment or that ideological advocates remain firmly in control at the NCCAM. It may be a contributing factor that, as a virologist, he has no expertise in evaluating aberrant and irrational medical methods. Among dozens of smaller NCCAM research grants, for example, have been many that are wasteful, inappropriate and utterly bizarre. In 2000, for example, three grants were awarded for obvious paranormalism research into \"psychic one person to another: - 1-R01-AT-485-1 Distant Healing Efforts for AIDS by Nurses and 'Healers' Targ, Elisabeth F. [41], California Pacific Medical Center -Pacific Campus. This is a three year grant awarded on July 1, 2000 totaling nearly $663,000 [42]. - 1-R01-AT-644-1 Efficacy of Distant Healing in Glioblastoma Treatment Targ, Elisabeth F., California Pacific Medical Center-Pacific Campus. This is a four-year grant totaling nearly $823,000 [43]. - 1-R21-AT-287-1 Transfer of Neural Energy Between Human Subjects Standish, Leanna J. Bastyr University. (Dollar figures unknown) Elisabeth Targ MD, who with the first two of these grant awards scooped up nearly $1.5 million of taxpayer dollars, is head of the Complementary Medicine Research Institute of California Pacifica Medical Center in San Francisco. She is a third generation psychic believer continuing a long tradition of pursuing absurd and discredited paranormal claims. This is a tradition distinguished chiefly by fraud and self-deception [44,45]. Her father, Russell Targ, earned notoriety in the 1970's for bilking the U.S. Department of Defense on promises that \"remote viewers\" could be trained to provide on-site details of Russian military facilities by visiting them \"psychically.\" According to her father, Elisabeth was trained on a psychic power teaching machine as a young girl and was able to predict the winners of horse races and presidential elections [46]. Distinguished science writer Martin Gardner recently provided additional details about the Targs, their eccentric beliefs and NCCAM funding of them [47]. Janet Quinn, RN PhD, a Therapeutic Touch (TT) practitioner and a former student of TT's founder Dolores Krieger, is a paid consultant to Dr. Targ on the AIDS work and is recruiting additional TT practitioners to act as a \"control group\" against the main group of psi-powered \"healers.\" $500 honorariums are being paid to perform this \"work\" with a total of $20,834 allocated for it through the February 28th, 2001 budget period. TT is a mystical \"healing\" method, the premise of which was falsified by an elementary school science project [48]. The most recent exploits of its founder, Dolores Krieger, are of \"doing healing at distance\" of those killed in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, \"calling upon the help of the angels of compassion to help the person through the terror of dying so suddenly and so horribly. working together with whatever beneficent forces I think of or who present themselves at this time.\" [49] Understandably worried about the reaction of more sensible people to her NCCAM-funded studies, Dr. Targ has announced her determination to either get positive results or leave the door open to wasting more of the taxpayers' dollars on her work with psychic powers. At a parapsychology conference entitled \"Subtle Energies and Uncharted Realms of the Mind,\" at the New Age oriented Esalen Institute in July 2000, it was reported that: Targ discussed the difficulties of doing a clinical research study on distant healing. Since the mainstream medical community is highly skeptical of Targ's research, she must be meticulous at every step in the process. In addition, she must also guard against showing a negative result, because the mainstream will take those results and attempt to discredit what Targ is trying to show. [50] Current NCCAM advisor Marilyn Schlitz, PhD, and former NCCAM advisor Beverly Rubik, as well as Dr. Targ's father Russell were among the other featured speakers at the event [51]. Dr Strauss is fully aware of and supportive of these grants to Dr. Targ. In his annual director's report given at a February 5, 2001 NCCAM Advisory Committee meeting, Dr. Straus said: Dr. Targ at the California Pacific Medical Center is studying distance healing for glioblastoma, trying to move this research forward from small trials. The study has 150 patients in a double blind RCT in which healers pray for patient recovery. Endpoints include symptoms and functional status. [52] The third grant was awarded to one of the NCCAM's own advisory board members, Leanna J. Standish: 1-R21-AT-287-1, Transfer of Neural Energy Between Human Subjects, Bastyr University. Bastyr University is an official NCCAM research center. Its website indicates that Dr. Standish, who is the school's research co-director, is joined in her psychic investigations by fellow NCCAM advisor Marilyn Schlitz PhD. [53]. Dr. Schlitz is also on the board of IONS and directs its research programs [54]. With IONS Fellow Dr. Targ, Dr. Schlitz has been conducting her own psi research at California Pacific Medical Center [55]. In addition, Dr. Schlitz is herself an astral voyager \"remote viewer\" who was praised by Russell Targ for having \"achieved the greatest statistical significance of any remote-viewing experiment so far conducted\" in exploring tourist sites in Rome from her home in Detroit MI [56]. Standish, a \"naturopathic doctor,\" is, in turn, listed as a co-researcher with Dr. Targ on grant #1-R01-AT-485-1. Another NCCAM advisor, Michael F. Cantwell MD, works with Dr. Targ as lead physician in the Health and Healing Clinic at California Pacific Medical Center. Dr. Cantwell was to be the Principal Investigator for a proposed study of Russian psychics healing children with Cerebral Palsy sponsored by the Monterey Institute for the Study of Alternative Healing Arts which the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation declined to fund [57]. These activities, and doubtless others obscured with more pedestrian titles, fly in the face of an exhaustive study of parapsychology by the National Research Council (NRC) conducted in the late 1980's and early 1990's. The NRC concluded that there is \"no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years for the existence of parapsychological phenomena.\" [58] Although clearly supported by Dr. Strauss, it is only fair to say that the NCCAM's interest in parapsychological research had begun earlier. These forays into mysticism disguised as science were suggested in a report issued by the OAM's Mind-Body Panel when it was cochaired MD, Jungian \"transpersonal psychologist\" Jeanne Achterberg and James S. Gordon MD who is now Chair of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy. This report falsely asserted that: There exist many published reports of experiments in which persons were able to influence a variety of cellular and other biological systems through mental means. The target systems for these investigations have included bacteria, yeast, fungi, mobile algae, plants, protozoa, larvae, insects, chicks, mice, rats, gerbils, cats, and dogs, as well as cellular preparations (blood cells, neurons, cancer cells) and enzyme activities. In human \"target persons,\" eye movements, muscular movements, electrodermal activity, plethysmographic activity, respiration, and brain rhythms have been affected through direct mental influence. [59] All of this alleged evidence was considered and rejected by the NRC's review. Yet it is continually pointed to by dishonest promoters of paranormalism. But it may very well be that Dr. Strauss, in his heart of hearts, would agree that these and many other NCCAM-funded activities are absurd and unscientific. It may very well be that, as one journalist wrote last year: [P]rinciples aside, Straus also has to follow the mandate of Congress - and some of its, well, less-than-scientific members. NCCAM is stuck funding a 5-year, $1.4 million trial of an unusual protocol designed to treat terminal pancreatic cancer by physician Nicolas Gonzalez. The so-called Gonzalez Protocol \u2014 a hodgepodge of pancreatic enzymes, coffee enemas, and up to 150 dietary supplements a day \u2014 caught the attention of Representative Dan Burton (R-IN), who in 1998 encouraged the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to study it. Even though Straus considers the evidence just an \"aggregate of interesting anecdotes,\" he defends the trial \u2014 albeit lukewarmly. \"I'm more comfortable and find it easier to approach and fund things that already make a lot more sense to me,\" he admits. \"But the mandate here is ... to be willing to take more risks for things that are novel.\" [60] Yet the sad fact remains that these \"things that are novel,\" especially when they are given the imprimatur of the NIH, ultimately put the public at risk for the kinds of harm that I outlined in my testimony on September 10. Perhaps the most egregious example is that of Dr. Gonzalez, who had already been found guilty of medical malpractice and ordered to pay more than $2 million in 1997. Another case was then underway involving a death in which Dr. Gonzalez was ultimately found guilty again \u2014 in April of 2000 \u2014 and ordered to pay $282,000 to the husband of a woman who died under his care [61]. Yet at the urging of Congressman Burton, the NCCAM ignored these considerations and made the preposterous decision that there was good reason to suppose that Gonzalez's methods had merit. Indeed, it is exceedingly puzzling that Congressman Burton trusts American citizens to make their own medical choices when he cannot trust the professional judgments of NIH and NCI research scientists. White House Commission on Alternative and Complementary Medicine Policy (WHCCAMP) The situation with respect to the WHCCAMP is even worse. Established by President Clinton on March 7th of 2000 by Executive Order 13147 and subsequently amended, the group is charged with providing a report \"on legislative and administrative recommendations for assuring that public policy maximizes the benefits to Americans of complementary and alternative medicine.\" The commission's report is due in March of 2002, but there is little doubt that it will recommend expanded federal spending and other policy initiatives to foster irrational and aberrant methods. The WHCCAMP Chair is James S. Gordon, MD, a Georgetown University psychiatrist who has said that he found \"a whole other system of medicine operating under completely different laws\" in the1960's when he began studying traditional Chinese medicine. Then, while receiving his training in psychiatry, Dr. Gordon said, he decided that schizophrenia and other disorders \"did not seem like diseases to me [but] instead like different ways of being.\" It was at this time that he became a student of the radical British psychiatrist R. D. Laing whose \"Insanity is Sanity\" philosophy achieved great popularity in the 1960s drug counterculture [62]. Dr. Gordon appears to have become enamored of these ideas at the very time that Kingsley Hall, Laing's London \"therapeutic community\" in which the mentally ill and their therapists lived together and \u2014 among other things \u2014 indulged in LSD, was forced to close under a cloud of scandal and public complaint [63]. His thinking distorted by long-term LSD use [64], Laing himself went on to become involved in \"Primal Scream\" and \"rebirthing psychodrama\" [65] of the kind that killed a young girl in Colorado in May of 2000 and sent two therapists to jail [66]. Dr. Gordon was a follower of the late Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, the Indian mystic who amassed wealth and influence enough to take over the small town of Antelope, Oregon in the 1980's before being deported by the authorities for fraud. Dr. Gordon wrote a sympathetic book about the cult, The Golden Guru, in which he offered excuses for the Bhagwan's erratic behavior and the violence connected with the cult. Dr. Gordon also describes his own \"rebirthing\" experience at the hands of one of the Bhagwan's therapists [67]. In 1984, some followers of the Bhagwan cult were involved in deliberate poisonings of hundreds of people in Oregon [68]. In recent years, Dr. Gordon has been a collaborator of parapsychologists and Jungian mystics within the Transpersonal Psychology movement [69]. He has also become a leading advocate of alien abduction therapy and research, serving on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Program for Extraordinary Experience Research (PEER), an organization established explicitly by Harvard psychiatrist John Mack, MD, to research alien abductions [70]. Inexplicably, Dr. Gordon also involved himself in the Oklahoma bombing trial of Terry Nichols. As a psychiatrist for the defense, he submitted a letter to the court stating that Nichols was not violent and should not receive a long prison term. Dr. Gordon's opinion was apparently based entirely on letters received from Nichols [71]. Dr. Gordon is a fellow of the John E. Fetzer Institute, which funded the dishonest 1993 report published in The New England Journal of Medicine by David Eisenberg and others that claimed that a third of Americans were using \"alternative\" methods by including such categories as relaxation, imagery, massage, commercial weight loss and self-help groups. One of Gordon's many books, Manifesto For A New Medicine, is in the millenarian genre of others that predict the transformation of medical care along New Age lines. In 1994, Dr. Gordon was appointed the very first chairman of the Office of Alternative Medicine's Program Advisory Council and was a co-director of OAM's Mind-Body Panel. Through his Center for Mind-Body Medicine, which has also been funded by the Fetzer Institute, Dr. Gordon has organized a series of Comprehensive Cancer Care Conferences that have gathered together dozens of questionable practitioners as an effective lobbying force for aberrant cancer care [72]. Dr. Gordon has previous experience as a Presidential advisor, having directed a nationwide study of alternative mental health services for President Carter's Commission on Mental Health in the 1970s. In his brief 1978 report, in addition to noncontroversial mental health programs such as rape support and runaway programs, Gordon recommends the spiritual midwifery practices of \"The Farm,\" a psychedelic commune, reiterates his support for R. D. Laing's and Carl Jung's theory of psychosis as creativity (R. D. Laing is directly quoted referring to schizophrenia as \"a voyage into self of a potentially revolutionary nature\") and offers praise for the then budding holistic medicine industry [73]. Other members of the White House Commission include Dr. Jonas, whose exploits have already been considered and: - George M. Bernier, Jr. MD is the only prominent academic on the Commission. He is the former Dean of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, left that position in 1995 to accept the positions of Dean and Vice President for academic affairs at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas. He currently is the Vice President of Education at UTMB. Since his arrival, UTMB's program in Alternative and Integrative Healthcare has blossomed, offering mystical and paranormal healing techniques including Therapeutic Touch and recommending to the public the mystical writings of Deepak Chopra, Andrew Weil, Larry Dossey and Carolyn Myss [74]. The program is directed by Victor S. Sierpina, MD, a nationally prominent CAM activist [75]. and includes a faculty member, Mary Anne Hanley, RN, who is a former student of Theosophist mystic Dolores Krieger, the founder of TT [76]. Dr. Bernier was instrumental in establishing a \"Spirituality in Clinical Care\" course of study for medical and nursing students funded by the National Institute for Healthcare Research (NIHR), an evangelical Christian group associated with the John Templeton Foundation [77]. The course bibliography features not only the writings of NIHR head David B. Larson but also Healing Words by Larry Dossey MD [78], in which it is claimed that paranormal effects have been demonstrated on bacteria, sweetpeas and mice as well as humans. - Effie Poy Yew Chow, PhD, is an acupuncturist, \"Qigong Grandmaster\" and founder of the East-West Academy of Healing Arts in San Francisco [79]. Her PhD is in Education. She has connections with the NCCAM going back to the OAM when she was appointed to its first Ad Hoc Advisory Committee [80]. \"Qi\" is the traditional Chinese counterpart to psychic \"life energy,\" the \"flow\" of which is said to be modified by acupuncture and which advocates claim can be \"absorbed\" and \"emitted.\" Chow claims to cure illness and boost the psychic powers of individuals by transmitting \"qi\" to them by telephone [81]. She employs typical stage magic tricks to \"prove\" the existence of \"qi\" energy. At the Commission's September 8, 2000 meeting in San Francisco, she said that \"what we're here for\" is \"recommending policies to making a big change in the system.\" [82] Transcripts of the Commission's work show that she has a long relationship with fellow Commissioner David Bresler and with its chair Dr. Gordon [83]. - \"Dr.\" David Bresler is also an acupuncturist. Like Chow, he is not a physician but holds a PhD. He is credited by the White House with being \"one of the first contemporary American scientists to study and research acupuncture, guided imagery, and other mind/body approaches.\" But the only two published clinical trials of which he is a co-author involve acupuncture, one of which showed no benefit in asthma. Another article purported to show scientifically that the whole human body is mapped out on the ear [84]. Guided imagery is based on almost as fanciful a notion, namely, that imagining physical changes in the body can effect those changes. Thus, cancer patients are taught to imagine their tumors being destroyed. Yet there is no published evidence \u2014 zero \u2014 in support of guided imagery affording more than psychological benefits for any condition, or that such effects are superior to those offered by other interventions. Nevertheless, Bresler founded the Academy of Guided Imagery (AGI) [85]. in 1989 which now sells 150-hour \"certification\" training programs at $3495 each. Among other things, such training involves \"dialoguing with symptoms.\" Another practice is to call up an \"inner advisor,\" a kind of spirit guide that may take the form of an animal. AGI promotes audio tapes to the general public. One for \"Arthritis and Lupus,\" for example, is \"[d]esigned to help reduce rheumatoid joint inflammation, soreness, excess fluid; replace eroded bone and joint tissue; help calm overactive, misguided immune cells.\" Another, for diabetic patients, is \"[d]esigned to encourage insulin sensitivity at the cellular level; help the body metabolize food in a steady, balanced way; help repair damage to organs and tissue.\" Still another, for victims of atherosclerosis, is alleged \"to help the body restore weary heart tissue; improve cholesterol and blood pressure; dissolve arterial plaque; [and] maintain healthy arteries.\" There is no evidence that AGI's tapes exert such miraculous effects. Bresler is a credulous believer in other nonsense as well. To an Iranian faith-healer, one Ostad Hadi Parvarandeh who claimed to be in touch with the \"collective consciousness\" of the universe, Bresler wrote: \"Ostad, I have been quite amazed by the progress shown by several of my patients who have seen you, and feel that it is time to launch some serious scientific studies to carefully document whatever is happening [86]. - Xiao Ming Tian is a Beijing-trained physician-acupuncturist who runs the Academy of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine at his Wildwood Acupuncture Center in Bethesda. There he offers acupuncture, acupressure, Chinese herbal remedies, and Qi-Gong \"treatments,\" qi-gong being the vitalistic \"energy\" medicine of the prescientific Orient [87]. Tian has been a consultant to the NIH and was involved in producing the NIH Consensus Statement on Acupuncture that deliberately excluded critics of the method. The biographical information on Tian released by the White House indicates that he received government funding for \"many research projects on the use of Chinese herbal medicine and dietary supplements,\" none of which appears to have resulted in published work available by search on PUBMED. According to the White House press release, Tian is also \"President of the American Association of Chinese Medicine,\" as well as \"Honorary Director of the China Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Vice President of The International Academy of Medical Qigong, both in Beijing, China.\" - Veronica Gutierrez is a chiropractor from Lake Stevens, Washington. She is extremely active in the World Chiropractic Alliance (WCA), sitting on its Board of Directors, serving as its Director of Programs in Public Policy, and chairing its Health Care Reform Committee and its Council on Women's Health [88]. The WCA is an organization of \"straight\" chiropractors whose allegiance is to the original doctrine of disease causation taught by chiropractic's founder, D.D. Palmer, that spinal \"subluxations\" interfere with the \"flow\" of supernatural \"innate intelligence\" and can only be corrected by chiropractic \"adjustments.\" The WCA promotes chiropractic as the ideal form of medical care for infants and children as well as for adults. It opposes routine immunizations [89]. while dismissing medical science \u2014 as \"alternative medicine\" guru Andrew Weil MD does \u2014 as good only for \"trauma care and crisis management.\" In fact, Gutierrez herself fumes that, \"If anyone still believes medical science reigns supreme, they now must say 'The Emperor wears no clothes.'\" [90] Ms. Gutierrez is also connected with the Council for Chiropractic Practice (CCP). The CCP advocates home births, chiropractic manipulation of infants for the prevention of SIDS, of children for pediatric ear infections, and lifelong \"adjustments\" for an alleged epidemic of \"subluxations\" for everyone. The CCP also claims that EEG's, surface EMG's, and thermography, as well as other unproven methods can demonstrate chiropractic \"subluxations.\" [91] Ms. Gutierrez's presence on the commission is the result of lobbying by the WCA [92], which boasts of growing political influence and maintains a presence in Washington D.C. for the purpose of exerting political influence [93]. Indeed, immediately upon Gutierrez's appointment to the commission, the WCA began mobilizing its members to testify at its meetings [94]. - Donald W. Warren is a dentist from Clinton, Arkansas who treats temporomandibular joint dysfunction and other ailments with \"dental cranial osteopathy.\" In addition, he practices \"contact reflex analysis,\" which is claimed to be a method of \"analyzing the body's structural, physical, and nutritional needs.\" This is done by pressing on various mystical points on the body while pushing and pulling on the patient's arm (or other body part). Alterations in muscle strength \u2014 the \"reflexes\" \u2014 are claimed to \"quickly and accurately uncover the root\" of any health problem. Details concerning this astonishingly irrational form of medical quackery, including the locations of the \"Master Allergy Reflexes,\" the \"Metabolic Reflex,\" and additional \"reflexes\" especially relevant for the flu season, can be found at http://www.crahealth.org (click on \"CRA and Syndromes\"). On this same website can be found Dr. Warren lengthy statement of enthusiastic belief in CRA as well as the healing powers of \"God, chiropractic, CRA-based nutrition, dentistry and osteopathy.\" [95] Dr. Warren's personal convictions concerning this curious application of stage magic are forthright, if delusional: \"In my 16 years of practicing as a dentist, I have never known any method of analysis, technique, treatment or nutritional presentation so helpful, so exact, so satisfying, and have such a high level of quality as Contact Reflex Analysis.\" [96] - Linnea Larson is a Social Worker who is Associate Director of an \"Integrative Medicine\" department of West Suburban Health Care in Oak Park, IL. She also practices Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) as well as other irrational forms of \"mind-body\" therapy [97]. Serious problems exist with respect to EMDR and its lack of validation [98]. Larson was among the faculty listed at a program in Santa Fe in October of 2000 entitled \"Integrating Culture and Complementary Medicine: Challenges to the Biomedical Paradigm.\" [99] This conference assailed the scientific biopsychosocial model of medicine from the perspective of postmodern cultural relativism. Another notable speaker was Victor Sierpina MD, the head of the University of Texas Medical Branch's alternative medicine program which has been nurtured by fellow commissioner George M. Bernier MD. - Joseph E. Pizzorno, Jr, is an \"ND\" Doctor of Naturopathy, a naturopathic midwife and the founding president of Bastyr University, a naturopathic school that was chosen by the National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) to be a Center for Alternative Medicine Research. He continues to act as an advisor to the school. Pizzorno is on the \"Management Team\" of The Dove Health Alliance [100], the mission of which is \"to discover, validate, and disseminate the principles and practices of energy medicine on personal, societal and environmental levels.\" [101] Pizzorno promotes a variety of unproven and irrational claims as fact. For example, he asserts that \"The hypothesis that gluten is a causative factor in the development of schizophrenia is substantiated by epidemiological, clinical and experimental studies.\" [102] He believes that food allergies cause multiple sclerosis [103]. He says the dandelion is useful for the \"sluggish, congested, toxic liver.\" [104] He promotes kava for \"stress.\" [105] And, like Deepak Chopra, he is a proponent of the mystico-herbal practice of Ayurveda [106]. Pizzorno also believes in the bizarre \"blood type diet\" advocated by fellow naturopathic \"doctor\" Peter D'Adamo, a Bastyr graduate. Pizzorno calls it \"The Medical Breakthrough For The Ages,\" saying that it will change the practice of medicine for centuries to come and lauds D'Adamo as \"an outstanding example of the best Bastyr has to offer.\" [107] - Joseph J. Fins, MD is Director of Medical Ethics at the Cornell campus of New York Presbyterian Hospital and holds academic positions at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. He appears to be one of only three Commission members who have not clearly established reputations as ideological advocates for irrational claims and practices. His primary interests to date have been in palliative and hospice care for the dying [108]. In his comments during meetings of the commission, Dr. Fins has betrayed more serious prejudices, saying that he was \"really struck by this notion of ancestral medicine.\" He also seems unaware of the fact that concern for the family and spiritual dimensions of patients is well within the biopsychosocial model of scientific medicine in speaking of the \"failings of allopathic medical education.\" [109] - George DeVries runs at least three different companies. American Specialty Health and Wellness sells supplements over the Internet. American Specialty Health Plans [110] and American Specialty Networks \"provide chiropractic and acupuncture managed-care services.\" Acupuncture Today calls him the \"president of one of the largest acupuncture HMOs in the nation.\" [111] DeVries'efforts seem to be devoted primarily to getting employers and insurance companies, and, it would now appear, taxpayers, to pay for unproven methods. - Sister Charlotte Rose Kerr is an acupuncturist who is said to \"integrate\" theology into her methods. This might be assumed to be Catholicism but she has taught and practiced at the Tai Sophia Institute in Columbia, Maryland since 1977 at which Qi Gong, homeopathy, food supplementation, shiatzu and \"zero balancing\" are offered [112]. Links from the Tai Sophia website include IONS, the Esalen Institute, and the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies, another New Age organization. An announcement praising Sister Kerr's appointment to commission is posted on the Tai Sophia website [113] in which it is stated that \"Dr. James S. Gordon, Director of the Center for Mind/Body Medicine in Washington, D.C., [is] a long-time friend of the Tai Sophia Institute.\" At the Commission's Draft Interim Report meeting on July 3rd of 2001, Sister Kerr said: \" we believe the body/mind has the right and power to heal itself. healing is being in right relationship with self, others, community and the cosmos.\" [114] . . . . - Dean Ornish, MD earned his reputation with his work on the management of atherosclerosis with extremely low fat vegetarian diets. But like predecessor Nathan Pritikin, Ornish's recommendations are not suitable for most people. The few small studies claimed to prove the worth of his work have also been questioned on scientific grounds. Dr. Richard Pasternak, director of preventive cardiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, has said that \"There's virtually no science\" in them [117]. Dr. Robert Eckel, Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver and chairman of the nutrition committee of the American Heart Association also expressed serious doubts, as did Dr. Frank Sacks, a nutrition professor at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Sacks, in trying to replicate Dr. Ornish's results with a grant from the NIH, found that it was difficult to recruit patients and few could stick with the program [118]. Fortunately, Ornish's program has been superseded by more effective forms of managing elevated blood cholesterol and the discovery of other treatable risk factors. Like Dr. Gordon, Dr. Ornish began as a devotee of an Indian guru, Sri Swami Satchidananda. He became involved with the Swami after dropping out of Rice University in 1972 in a state of suicidal depression. It was apparently during this time that he formed his beliefs about the importance of a vegetarian diet with no added salt, sugar or fat and no caffeine combined with meditation, yoga and exercise. Dr. Ornish has enthusiastically endorsed many irresponsible unscientific works by others including Larry Dossey's Healing Words [119], and psychic Judith Orloff's Second Sight\" [120]. Dr. Gordon's own Center for Mind-Body Medicine features an endorsement by Ornish as well [121]. - William Fair, MD is former Chief of Urology Services at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. He is a disciple of Dr. Ornish to whom he turned to help with colon cancer in the mid-1990s. Dr. Fair now credits dietary measures for his own cure and claims that similar approaches are effective with prostate cancer. At the first meeting of the Commission he stated that \"I honestly think we need to change medicine. I think we need to bring these complementary and alternative medicine techniques into the practice of every doctor.\" [122] Dr. Fair is currently chairman of the clinical advisory board of Health, LLC, through which he and his son promote alternative medicine [123]. He has also worked closely with the commission chair, Dr. Gordon, in putting on a series of conferences promoting alternative medicine for cancer [124] and is on the board of Gordon's Center for Mind-Body Medicine. Drs. Fair and Gordon also sit on the editorial board of Larry Dossey's Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine which regularly features articles on paranormal healing as well as bioenergetics and shamanism. - Thomas Chappell is a businessman with a degree from Harvard Divinity School. He runs Tom's of Maine, a dietary supplement company [125] as well as a management consulting firm in Colorado called the Saltwater Institute [126]. His supplement company makes typical unsubstantiated claims to promote its products such as that Ginseng \"revitalizes an active life-style\" and that Echinacea \"supports the immune system.\" [127] - Conchita M. Paz, MD, of Las Cruces, NM is a family practitioner who appears to be interested in cultural issues in medicine. She is a member of the National Hispanic Medical Association . - Buford Rolin has been the Health Administrator of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians since 1984. He is also a member of the Alabama Public Health Advisory Board and former chairman of the National Indian Health Board (NIHB). Mr. Rolin's primary interest has understandably been with the medically undeserved communities of native Americans. But the NIHB has endorsed Indian Health Service funding for \"traditional healing,\" apparently in the belief that this form of \"holistic\" care is a more realistic expectation for native Americans [128]. Mr. Rolin has voiced similar opinions [129]. - Julia R. Scott, RN, is the President of the National Black Women's Health Project, has been active on behalf of the Children's Defense Fund and has served as an NIH consultant on African-American health issues. The appointment of the last three members of the commission appears to be a cynical attempt to enlist the support of racial minorities in the cause of legitimizing irrational and aberrant medical claims and practices. This should be seen in the context of the ideological beliefs of other commission members, including its Chair, in the notion that science is little more than a tool of cultural domination and oppression. It is a shameful attempt to dissuade groups that are in the greatest need of accessible and equitable medical treatment to be satisfied, instead, with something less than the standards of science and reason. That this recurrent theme in the \"alternative medicine\" movement could appeal to a cynical interest in cost-saving at the expense of the lives and health of the nation's elderly is particularly worrisome [130]..Former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm's assertion that Americans have \"a duty to die and get out of the way with all of our machines and artificial hearts and everything else like that\" is not one with which all Americans disagree [131]. Completely absent from the WHCCAMP are any individuals whose concern is primarily for sound science, evidence-based medicine, and the protection of the public from health fraud. It is all the more surprising given the ready availability of many individuals who have established reputations as scholars of the subject of unproven, disproven and irrational methods often subsumed under the heading of \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" medicine. That the commission was created for the purpose of advocacy is also shown by the fact that its Executive Director and Secretary are also ideological proponents of \"alternative medicine.\" The former is Stephen C. Groft, who began as the acting director of OAM at its inception. The commission's Executive Secretary, Michele Chang, is a massage therapist who has worked for Senator Tom Harkin and says that she \"help[ed] with the conception of this Commission.\" At the WHCCAMP's first meeting she expressed her belief that there is a \"need to consider hearing from people who are practicing CAM modalities in secret\" but who \"are afraid that they are going to be closed down once the authorities become involved.\" [132] Conclusion The objections of the Honorable Congressman Burton to the nature and substance of the September 10 hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging are misplaced, misinformed, and unfair. All of those who spoke at the hearing, with the exception of Mr. Braswell and Mr. Tepper, were plainly interested in drawing the distinction between health-related claims that are based in facts and reason and those that clearly are not. This is the very same standard that was applied in the 1984 Pepper Report and from which current government policies have strayed dangerously. Not only are there serious problems with DSHEA but these problems exist in a context of political institutions such as the NCCAM and the WHCCAMP that are at best tolerant of quackery and at worst tend to directly or indirectly promote it. The controversy over these and related issues is not fundamentally one between personalities or philosophies but between reason and unreason in the sphere of the marketplace for health-related products and services.

Patrick Curry, for his collaboration on previous presentation of some of the material included in this response [133]. - Quackery: A $10 Billion Scandal: A Report by The Chairman of The Subcommittee on Health and Long-Term Care of the Select Committee on Aging, US House of Representatives, 98th Congress, USGPO 1984. - Eisenberg DM, Kessler RC, Foster C, Norlock FE, Calkins DR, Delbanco TL. \"Unconventional medicine in the United States.

Notable passages from The Golden Guru: (a) Dr. Gordon describes his own \"rebirthing\" in Chapter 3 \"Surrender to Bhagwan.\" pp 86-89. At the hands of a naked female therapist, Dr. Gordon recounted \"a replay of my descent through the birth canal\" leaving him \"flailing on the mat, squalling like a newborn,\" feeling \"gratitude and love, not so general now as in groups, but focused on Rajneesh, on his generosity.\" (b) On pages 84-86, Dr. Gordon defends the use of violent psychotherapies short of killing, which did happen at the Rajneesh's commune in India. He writes that he is \"not against fighting in groups\" and that the Rajneesh's followers \"believed that the violent confrontations \u2014 even their own bad bruises and broken limbs \u2014 had been a small and necessary price to pay for the freedom they now felt from past traumas and inhibitions, for the perspective they had gained on their own sadism and masochism.\" (c) On page 114, Dr. Gordon defends the Rajneesh' s collection of 93 Rolls Royces at the Oregon commune. \"In displaying his wealth so conspicuously, in ignoring accusations of selfishness,\" writes Dr. Gordon, \"Rajneesh was mocking the preconceptions of his New World audience, who \u2014 particularly the Christians \u2014 tended to associate spirituality with poverty, modesty, charity.\" (d) On page 148, Dr. Gordon defends the Rajneesh's recruitment and exploitation of the homeless and mentally ill, saying that the guru's \"program, in spite of its inequities and exploitativeness, does seem a great improvement over what these men have been offered in city and state mental hospitals and shelters. Those who stay are functioning, useful members of a loving community. They seem to have a real opportunity to change.\" (e) In his concluding paragraphs on page 245, Dr. Gordon writes exults in Rajneesh's \"vision of a loving, cooperative community dedicated to the creation of new men and women living in harmony with their own nature and the natural world. For me, it is not finally a question of agreeing or disagreeing with Rajneesh, of praising or condemning him or his sannyasins. It is, rather, a matter of learning from him and them, of appreciating his remarkable talents and gifts and recognizing his perverse uses of them, of seeing myself in him and his sannyasins, of using his extraordinary story and strange, as yet unfinished journey as a mirror for my own.\" - Torok TJ, Tauxe RV, Wise RP, Livengood JR, R, KA, Skeels MR, JM, Foster LR., \"A large community outbreak of salmonellosis caused by intentional contamination of restaurant salad bars.\" JAMA 1997 Aug 6;278(5):389-95. - He is listed as a plenary speaker at a 1999 \"Life After Death\" conference of parapsychologists and mystics at http://www.pathwaysminneapolis.org/lifedeath.html.

Dr. Barrett and three others have filed a total of four suits against Bolen and others who have republished his libelous messages. Clark's publishing company has responded with a groundless suit accusing Barrett, the National Council Against Health Fraud, and more than 30 other defendants of committing at least 12 types of crimes and about 20 other civil wrongs. Liverite marketers ordered to stop improper claims. Liverite, Inc., of Tustin, California, Corinne and Steven Jacobson, and James and Sheri Grant, have agreed to settle FTC charges that they made unsubstantiated claims in Internet, radio, and print ads that their herbal products were effective against liver diseases, hangovers, and many other health problems. Under the agreement, the Jacobsons and the company will pay $60,000 in redress, and all of the defendants will be prohibited from claiming making unsubstantiated claims that any product cures or prevents any disease or disorder. The FTC's complaint indicated that Liverite's Web pages used metatags so that people searching for information about AIDS, hepatitis A, B & C, liver problems, liver disease, liver detoxification, alcohol, hangover, cirrhosis, anabolic steroids, interferon, and hepatotoxicity would be more likely to go to defendants' sites.
