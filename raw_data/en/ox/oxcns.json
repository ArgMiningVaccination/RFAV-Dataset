Hi there! I'm Dr. Caroline M\u00e9th\u00e9 Naturopathic Doctor with a clinical focus on IBD My job is to gather all of the information on YOU - your history, your story of how you got here, your current symptoms, and your labs. Then I put the pieces together and figure out why your health concern is present. By finding out the WHY, I can tell you the HOW to fix it. In my opinion this is what true functional medicine is supposed to do - not just provide symptomatic relief, but actually fix the problem that is causing your symptoms in the first place. And that's what I'm here to help you with. When I'm not seeing patients, you will likely find me in a forest camping, hiking, running, rock climbing, or painting. Natural Remedies "}
