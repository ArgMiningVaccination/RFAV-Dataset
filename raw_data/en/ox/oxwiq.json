Living with pain of a Disc Herniation is no way to live. Unfortunately, having surgery will address the disc but not the reason for herniating the disc. Read the article below and learn what needs to be addressed to handle the underlying CAUSE. This is vital for your health and well being. We are here to find TRUE SOLUTIONS to your health concerns. To Request an Action Plan to Address Disc Herniations [Click Here](requestactionplan.asp) A disc herniation refers to a problem with one of the rubbery cushions (discs) between the individual bones (vertebrae) that stack up to make your spine. A spinal disc is a little like a jelly donut, with a softer center encased within a tougher exterior. Sometimes called a slipped disc or a ruptured disc, a herniated disc occurs when some of the softer \"jelly\" pushes out through a crack in the tougher exterior. A herniated disc can irritate nearby nerves and result in pain, numbness or weakness in an arm or leg. On the other hand, many people experience no symptoms from a herniated disc. Most people who have a herniated disc don't need surgery to correct the problem. You can have a herniated disc without knowing it \u2014 herniated discs sometimes show up on spinal images of people who have no symptoms of a disc problem. But some herniated discs can be painful. The location of your symptoms may vary, depending on where the herniated disc is located along your spine. Most herniated discs occur in your lower back (lumbar spine), although they can also occur in your neck (cervical spine). The most common signs and symptoms of a herniated disc are: Seek chiropractic care or medical attention if your neck or back pain travels down your arm or leg, or if it's accompanied by numbness, tingling or weakness. Disc herniations, from a medical perspective, are thought to be most often the result of a gradual, aging-related wear and tear called disc degeneration. The theory goes, as you age, your spinal discs lose some of their water content. That makes them less flexible and more prone to tearing or rupturing with even a minor strain or twist. What results from this theory is, most people can't pinpoint the exact cause of their herniated disc. Sometimes, using your back muscles instead of your leg and thigh muscles to lift large, heavy objects can lead to a herniated disc, as can twisting and turning while lifting. Rarely, a traumatic event such as a fall or a blow to the back can cause a herniated disc. What is a more accurate underlying cause is related to having a [Parasite](parasites.asp) (Read the article). Appreciating that your disc covering (annulus fibrosis) is 3/8 of an inch thick, made of the toughest tissue in the body, stronger than bone and able to withstand huge amounts of pressure, in order for the center of the disc to herniate out from the disc, something has to compromise the integrity of the outer protective covering. Parasites seem to like to feed off this tissue and when the annulus finally weakens enough, any activity can lead to a disc herniation. Hence, many times there is no specific trauma associated with having a disc herniation. Factors that increase your risk of a herniated disc may include: SYMPTOMS Your spinal cord doesn't extend into the lower portion of your spinal canal. Just below your waist, the spinal cord separates into a group of long nerve roots (cauda equina) that resemble a horse's tail. Rarely, disc herniation can compress the entire cauda equina. Emergency surgery may be required to avoid permanent weakness or paralysis. Seek emergency medical attention if you have: You're likely to initially bring your symptoms to the attention of your family doctor. He or she may refer you to a doctor specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation, orthopedic surgery, neurology or neurosurgery. What You Can Do Before your appointment, write a list that answers the following questions: What to Expect from Your Doctor During the physical exam, your doctor may ask you to lie flat so that he or she can move your legs into various positions to help determine the cause of your pain. Your doctor may also perform a neurological exam to check your: In most cases of herniated disc, a physical exam and a medical history are all that's needed to make a diagnosis. If your doctor suspects another condition or needs to see which nerves are affected, he or she may order one or more of the following tests. Imaging tests Nerve tests Having a discussion with your medical doctor or pharmacist so you can understand the potential for side-effects and other complications is important before starting any medication. Making sure to know what to expect is important. Physical therapists can show you positions and exercises designed to minimize the pain of a herniated disk. As the pain improves, physical therapy can advance you to a rehabilitation program of core strength and stability to maximize your back health and help protect against future injury. A physical therapist may also recommend: This is the last resort. Only consider this after all else has failed. A very small number of people with herniated discs eventually need surgery. Your doctor may suggest surgery if: In many cases, surgeons can remove just the protruding portion of the disk. Rarely, however, the entire disk must be removed. In these cases, the vertebrae may need to be fused together with metal hardware to provide spinal stability. Or your surgeon may suggest the implantation of an artificial disk.

Imaging studies show that the protruding or displaced portion of the disc shrinks over time, corresponding to the improvement in symptoms. This is the number one choice for treatment of a herniated disc. Relieving the pressure on the disc by restoring proper spinal alignment will often allow the disc to shrink.
