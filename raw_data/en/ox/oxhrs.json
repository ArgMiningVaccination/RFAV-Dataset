Is there anyone out there who has both Epilepsy and Celiac Disease? I was diagnosed with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and Frontal Lobe Epilepsy approximately two months ago and was diagnosed with Celiac Disease only yesterday.

She was a formula baby and it never agreed with her. I was hoping it would just go away. but now its worse than ever. (post nasal drip, tummy issues, milk cravings, lives for chocolate etc...) I am having her tested (bloods) this afternoon for celiac disease and if its a yes. I know that it had something to do with her having epilepcy. Ps.. Lancet has published a medical journal linking epilepcy and celiac disease. Regards My daughter has just turned 4 and has been diagnosed with epilepcy.

Regards Re: Epilepsy and Celiac Disease Submitted by confuzzed on Tue, 2008-11-18 - 06:41 There's some excellent info at [www.celiac.com](http://www.celiac.com/), including a forum where you can get lots of information from others with Celiac and gluten intolerance (yes, they're two different things), as well as other food issues. It's a great place for asking all kinds of questions, finding sources for gluten-free foods, and recipes. There's even sections for teens and for parents of kids with Celiac. One of the best features of the site is that it has listings of foods where gluten is \"hidden\". This is invaluable for avoiding getting glutened. There are also restaurant guides. Good luck and, hopefully, your new diet will help cut down or eliminate your seizures.

My first episode occurred after eating three large plates of Spaghetti. I have had many symptoms over the years that suggest I have gluten intolerence. I have rashes that are symmetrical in nature. The rash will occur on both buttocks, on both wrists, arms, hands or ankles. The rash will last for years and then mysteriously go away. I have pimples showing up on my stomach, I have blockages in 4 different arteries. When I was younger I had heart arrhythmia. I have short term memory issues and drowsiness issues. Before I went on a gluten free diet, I had alternating diarrhea and constipation, watery stools, bloating of the stomach, flatulence, low energy levels, incontinence, weight gain, allergic sneezing reactions to many foods, but it doesn't occur until hours after I eat. My epilepsy is far better controlled when I am on a gluten free diet. I lost 25 lbs over a period of 18 months on a gluten free diet. Tips for buying groceries for people with gluten intolerance. Keep it simple, most anything with one or two ingredients is safe. Never buy anything that lists artificial flavors, natural flavors, spice, or spices. They are not safe, the manufacturer. Do not buy any cereal unless iti is clearly labeled as gluten free. Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies both contain wheat. I have had epilepsy since I was 6 years old.

Re: Epilepsy and Celiac Disease Submitted by cellochimp on Mon, 2010-02-15 - 01:23 I was dianosed with left temporal lobe Complex Partial seizures 11 years ago for unknown causes. My frequency of seizures ranged from 4-8 per month. I have tried multiple alternative therapies (acupuncture, chiropracture, homeopathy) because 9 medications and 2 left temoral lobe crainiotomies have been ineffective for the long run. A few years ago I worked with a homeopath who put me on an elimination diet to place me in a state of Ketosis. It was pretty much the Atkin's diet without dairy. I was seizure free for 4 months until as a rebellious teenager I reintroduced the eliminated foods all at once and never discovered the root of the problem. 6 months ago I began to have gas, diarreah, and a return of auras after my second crainiotomy and 2 years seizure free. I used the books \"Healthier Without Wheat\" and \"The Yeast Connection\" to perform another elimination diet. Both books, written by seperate authors, pointed out food allergies are common causes for seizures/epilepsy as well as many other medical conditions. Eliminated foods were wheat, soy, dairy, eggs, nuts, shellfish, and yeast for a period of 2 weeks. You eat a lot of vegetables, fruit, and meat during these 2 weeks. At the end of the 2 weeks reintroduce each of the eliminated foods one day at a time and notice how you feel that day. My gas, diarreah, and auras all disappeared during my elimination period. The day wheat was reintoduced they all returned. If you don't want to do an elimination diet for food allergies you can get an IgG, IgA and IgE antibody reaction blood test done by a GI specialist, an allergist, or an internist specializing in food allergies for all of these foods, but especially for glonuin if testing for Celiac. Do all tests prior to eliminating any foods so a reaction will show up on the tests. \"Healthier Without Wheat\" points out you may have an allergy or intolerance to other parts of wheat besides the gluten (allergy to gluten=Celiac's disease) such as the germ or bran (not Celiac disease). Even if you're not diagnosed with Celiac disease if the elimination diet after the tests helps identify a hidden wheat allergy you should completely avoid all wheat products. Whole Foods, Wild Oats, Sunflower Markets, and other health food stores have a section of foods totally catering to wheat-free products including breads, pastas, cookies, brownies, cake mixes, and even pancake mixes, so having a wheat intolerance today is not as bad as it may have been 5-10 years ago. And if it frees you from the physical, mental, and financial bondage epilepsy can be, a change in diet is totally worth any expense, any extra distance to drive to a health food store, and any inconvenience to eliminate wheat and eliminate seizures for life.

[http://medschool.umaryland.edu/celiac/question.asp](http://medschool.umaryland.edu/celiac/question.asp) Gluten Intolerance is all too often misdaignosed or not diagnosed at all. My doctor's have told me that I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, but I know that my symptoms mostly go away when I am gluten free. I have many different tests for Celiac and they all come back negative. My experience with doctor's is that they don't understand the disease at all.
