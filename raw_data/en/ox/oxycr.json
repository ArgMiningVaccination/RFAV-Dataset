We previously reported that induction of au-tophagy through the inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) in-hibits HIV replication in human macrophages and (T cells). However, MTOR has modulatory effects beyond autophagy thatmight affect viral replication. Here, we examined the effect on HIV replication of tre-halose, a nontoxic, nonreducing disaccharide that induces autophagy through Treatment of HIV-infected macrophages and T cellswith trehalose inhibited infection in a dose-dependent manner. Uninfected and HIV-infected macrophages and T cells treated with trehalose exhibited increased markersof autophagy, including LC3B lipidation with further accumulation following balo-mycin A1 treatment, and increased levels of LAMP1, LAMP2, and RAB7 proteins re-quired for lysosomal biogenesis and Moreover, the inhibition of HIV by treha-lose was signicantly reduced by knockdown of ATG5. Additionally, trehalose the expression of chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in T cellsand CD4 in both T cells and macrophages, which reduced HIV entry in these cells.Our data demonstrate that the naturally occurring sugar trehalose at doses safelyachieved in humans inhibits HIV through two mechanisms: (i) decreased entrythrough the downregulation of CCR5 in T cells and decreased CD4 expression inboth T cells and macrophages and (ii) degradation of intracellular HIV through theinduction of MTOR-independent autophagy. These ndings demonstrate that cellularmechanisms can be modulated to inhibit HIV entry and intracellular replication us-ing a naturally occurring, nontoxic sugar. IMPORTANCE Induction of autophagy through inhibition of MTOR has been shown to inhibit HIV replication. However, inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) has cellular effects that may alter HIV infection through other mechanisms. Here,we examined the HIV-inhibitory effects of the MTOR-independent inducer of autophagy,trehalose. Of note, we identied that in addition to the inhibition of the intracellular rep-lication of HIV by autophagy, trehalose decreased viral entry in human primary macro-phages and CD4 /H11001T cells through the downregulation of C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in T cells and CD4 in both T cells and macrophages. Thus, we showed that tre-halose uniquely inhibits HIV replication through inhibition of viral entry and intracellulardegradation in the two most important target cells for HIV infection.

Whereas multiple FDA-approved drugs target HIV reverse transcription, integration, and maturation, only enfuvirtide (inhibiting fusion) and maraviroc (target-ing CCR5) inhibit viral entry ( 2,3). HIV entry is initiated through the attachment and fusion of the envelope protein gp120, gp41, the host cell CD4 receptor, and acoreceptor, usually C-C motif chemokine motifchemokine receptor (CXCR4) ( 4). Macroautophagy (here referred to as autophagy) is a cellular pathway responsible for recycling amino acids from degraded long-lived proteins or damaged organelles topromote cellular homeostasis during times of stress or starvation ( 5). Initiation of autophagy is mediated by a complex consisting of Unc-51-like kinase 1 or 2 (ULK1/2),ATG13,andfocaladhesionkinasefamilyinteractingproteinof200kDa(FIP200)( 6).The mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) is a master regulator of cell growth andautophagy. Under nutrient-rich conditions, MTOR is associated with the ULK complexand remains inactivated through phosphorylation, inhibiting autophagy initiation.However, during cell stress, starvation, or sirolimus (rapamycin) treatment, MTORdissociates from the ULK complex, becomes hypophosphorylated, and initiates au-tophagy ( 7). Following initiation, the nucleation complex, which consists of p150, ATG14, and Beclin1, is recruited to initiate the formation of a double membranestructure known as a phagophore. Subsequently, the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L complex isrecruited to mediate phagophore elongation ( 8). Concurrently, microtubule-associated protein 1 light beta (LC3B-I, cytosolic) is conjugated to phosphatidylethano-lamine (PE) through ATG7, ATG3 to form LC3B-II, whichtethers to the As the phagophore grows, it matures until iteventually sequesters a portion of the cytosol and cargo within a double-membranevesicle, termed the autophagosome ( 8). The outer membrane of the autophagosome then fuses with the membrane of a lysosome to form the autolysosome, where theinternal compartment is degraded and the contents are released back into the cytosolfor reuse ( 8,9). Recent studies suggest that autophagy plays an important role in the regulation of various cellular pathways, such as aging, inflammation, immune activa-tion, immune response to microbial pathogens disease 13,14). An increasing number of studies indicate that autophagy plays an important role in HIVpathogenesis.Ourresearchandthatofothershasshownthatuponinitialentryintocells, HIV induces autophagy to promote its own replication. However, once HIV hasestablished a permissive infection, viral proteins inhibit autophagy to promote cellsurvival and viral persistence. Induction of autophagy by rapamycin and other MTORinhibitors inhibits HIV replication, and the overinduction of a Na /H11001/K/H11001-ATPase- dependent form of autophagy, termed autosis, can selectively kill latently HIV-infectedresting memory T lymphocytes ( 15). Although an abundance of research has focused on MTOR-dependent autophagy, MTOR-independentautophagy,includingtheinositolpathwayandthecalcium/calpainpathway, is also important for inducers trehalose has been studied most extensively. Trehalose is a natural sugar composed oftwoglucoseunitsjoinedbyanalpha-alpha-1linkage.( 27).Itisthemostcommonsugar found in the blood circulation of insects ( 28). Humans are unable to synthesize trehalose, but they possess trehalase, which can hydrolyze trehalose in the smallintestine ( 29). Trehalose treatment promotes clearance of mutant ated with Alzheimer's, has been found to inhibit human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in a variety of celltypes ( 33). The mechanism of trehalose-induced autophagy remains controversial. One group has proposed that trehalose treatment inhibits several cellular glucose trans-porters(GLUT), which in turn decreases the cellular ATP level and activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and ULK1 phosphorylation to induce autophagyRawat et al. Journal of Virology September 2020 Volume 94 Issue 17 e00237-20 jvi.asm.org 2(34,35). Additionally, trehalose induces autophagy in by altering the levels of RAB7 and Rab11 proteins without affecting their cellularglucoseuptake( 36)andvialysosome-mediatedtranscriptionfactorEB(TFEB)activation in a motor neuron degeneration model ( 37). Currently, trehalose is considered a \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) substance by the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-tration, which makes it an attractive potential therapeutic agent ( 27). In this report, we examined the effects of trehalose-mediated autophagy on HIV replication. RESULTS Trehalose inhibits HIV replication in human primary macrophages. HIV modu- lates the autophagy pathway to its advantage by differentially regulating the early andlate degradative stages to establish a permissive infection in human macrophages( 38-40). We have shown earlier that chemical inducers of autophagy can inhibit HIV replication via induction of MTOR-dependent autophagy ( 41-43). In our current study, we rst analyzed the effects of MTOR-independent autophagy on HIV replication inhuman macrophages. Untreated and trehalose-treated (50mM to 150mM) macro-phages were infected with HIV (0.04 multiplicity of infection [MOI]) fo r8ha n d incubated for 10days in medium in the presence or absence trehalose.

Though trehalose is considered a GRAS substance and has been approved for human consumption at up to 50 g/day, it is unknown if it exerts any cytotoxicity ofhumanmacrophagesthatmightresultinwhatappearstobeinhibitionofHIVinfection.Therefore, we also assessed with trehalose (25mM to 150mM)for 1B). Sirolimus-treated (100nM) and vehicle- treated as controls. Trehalose-treated uninfected and HIV-infected macrophages showed minimal change in cell survival after 10days of treatment at different concentrations of trehalose. Spectrophotometric measure-ments did not show any signicant increase in LDH release in the culture super-natants in the presence of trehalose in both uninfected macro-phages ( P/H110220.1; macrophages by induc- ing TFEB nuclear translocation and activation of autophagy genes. Trehalose has been identied to induce autophagy in several human cell types, including broblasts, keratinocytes,aorticendothelialcells,andneurons( 26,31,33,44).Therefore,wesought macrophages andwas responsible for the inhibition of infection. The initial steps of autophagy includeformation of autophagosomes, which involves the lipidation of form LC3B-II.The mature autophagosome then fuses with lysosome to form the autolysosome,where autophagic cargo degradation and LC3B-II turnover takes place. Relative quan-tication of LC3B-II is therefore used as an important marker to assess autophagy incells. To assess trehalose-mediated modulation of autophagic flux, we incubatedmacrophages in medium in the presence or absence of 100mM and 150mM trehalosefor 12 to 24 h. Cells were harvested for lysate preparation and analyzed by Westernblotting using antibody to LC3B. Macrophages treated with 100mM and 150mMtrehalose exhibited 1.7- can be due to an increase in autophagosome formation or their accumulationbecause of blockage of the autophagy pathway at the autophagosome and lysosomefusion step. SQSTM1 degradation is generally used as a marker to measure theTrehalose Inhibits HIV Infection Journal of Virology September 2020 Volume 94 Issue 17 e00237-20 jvi.asm.org 3completion of autophagic flux ( 45), but some recent studies, including one that specically studied the effects of trehalose in keratinocytes, suggest that SQSTM1degradation may not be directly correlated with increased LC3B lipidation ( 31,46,47). Therefore, in our we included a 2-h cotreatment with balomycin A1 toprevent the turnover of LC3B-II blocking the autolysosome acidication via inhibi-tion of the vacuolar H /H11001ATPase. As such, if trehalose-treated cells exhibit a further increase in LC3B-II levels, it would indicate that autophagic flux was genes, hydrolases, other LC3B ( 37, FIG 1Trehalose is a noncytotoxic inhibitor of HIV replication in human macrophages.

In the case of HCMV infection, trehalose treatment increased the levels of RAB7 protein, enhancing lysosomal biogenesis, vacuolation and acidication, and HCMVautophagic degradation in infected HFE cells ( 36). In order to understand the mecha- nism of trehalose-induced autophagy in nuclear translocation in these cells. Macrophageswere incubated in the absence or presence of 100mM trehalose for 24 h, and theexpressionandlocalizationofTFEBwereanalyzedbyconfocalimmunofluorescence(IF)microscopy. Following 24 h of treatment with 100mM trehalose, both untreated andtrehalose-treated macrophages were xed, permeabilized, stained with antibody toTFEB and DAPI (4 =,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) nuclear stain, and analyzed by confocal IF microscopy. Untreated macrophages expressed very low TFEB, which was mostlyconned to the cytoplasm ( Following signicantly increased Fig. 2B, top). In the presence trehalose, 10-fold suggest that trehalose treatment induces both TFEB expression and nuclear translocation in human primary macrophages. Having shown that trehalose induces TFEB nuclear translocation in macrophages, we next P/H110210.01;Fig. 2C). IF images also conrmed that trehalose treatment not only increased TFEB expression and nuclear translocation ( Fig. 2B), but also expression of lysosomal biogenesis-related pro- teins(Fig.2D).WhileuntreatedmacrophagesshowedminimalLC3B,RAB7,LAMP1,and LAMP2 expression, following trehalose we observed increased punctatedstaining for LC3B in and increased the perinuclear ( Fig. These data further support that treatment autophagy in macrophages via TFEB activation andinduction of autophagy-related gene expression. Having shown a central role for TFEB in the induction of autophagy in uninfected cellsbytrehalose,wenextexaminedifTFEB-regulatedautophagywasalteredfollowingtrehalose treatment of infected macrophages. For these experiments, HIV-infectedmacrophages were incubated in the presence or absence of trehalose (100mM) for10days, and expression of TFEB and its localization HIV-infected of HIV-infected macrophages ( Fig. 3A). However, in the presence of trehalose, both TFEB expression and nuclear translocation are increased macrophages Fig. 3A, HIV-infected macrophages exhibited a /H1102215-fold increase in TFEB nuclear accumulation compared to control infected cells ( Fig. right; quanti- cation, nuclear translocation 3A) and expression proteins in HIV-infected macrophages ( Fig. 3B). Similar to what was observed in uninfected cells, trehalose treatment of HIV-infected macrophages P/H110220.05). Trehalose inhibits HIV entry in human primary macrophages. Although our ndings to this point indicated that the induction of autophagy by trehalose is likely responsible for the intracellular inhibition of HIV in macrophages, it was important todetermineiftrehalosemightaffectHIVinfectionthroughviralentry.Therefore,ournextseries of experiments were designed to determine if trehalose altered viral bindingRawat et al.

To assess entry, genomic DNA was extracted and HIV strongstopDNA(ameasureofearlyHIVtranscriptionorentry)wasquantiedbyqPCR.In contrast to what had been observed following a 30-min exposure to trehalose, 6-hpretreatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in HIV binding ( Fig. 4B). Addition- ally, similar to what was observed for HIV binding, a dose-dependent decrease in earlyHIV transcription was observed following a 6-h pretreatment of macrophages withtrehalose, indicative of a decrease in viral entry ( Fig. 4C). Having identied that a 6-h treatment with trehalose decreases viral entry, we hypothesized that the steady-state expression of CD4 or the major coreceptor onmacrophages, CCR5, would be altered by trehalose. Therefore, we the expres-sionofCD4andCCR5inourbindingexperimentsfollowing30-minor6-hpretreatmentwith vehicle, maraviroc, and trehalose by immunoblotting ( Fig. 4DandE). Consistent with our binding and entry experiments, we did not observe any signicant change inCD4 and CCR5 expression following 30min of incubation ( Fig. 4D). However, was expression followin g6ho con- rmed by flow cytometry ( Fig. 5A, top left) that demonstrated a 60% reduction in CD4 surface expression ( P/H110210.001) and a 28% decrease in on macrophages the presence of trehalose ( P/H110050.002). contrast, treated with sirolimus, of autophagy, resulted in no signicant change inCD4orCCR5expression( Fig.5A).Intotal,thesendingsindicatethattrehalosepartially inhibits HIV binding and entry through the downregulation of CD4 and CCR5 expres-sion on macrophages. Having shown a decrease in expression of CD4 and a modest decrease in CCR5 expression following trehalose treatment, we examined if there was a general decreasein cell surface receptor expression. Macrophages were treated as described above, andsurface expression for two additional surface receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR4, was as-sessed by flow cytometry ( Fig. 5A, top right). Of note, no signicant change in CXCR1 and CXCR4 surface expression was observed ( P/H110220.5;Fig. 5A, bottom, quantication) following trehalose treatment. These results suggest that trehalose treatment speci-cally reduces the surface expression of CD4 and CCR5 receptors in macrophages. The SIGLEC1 receptor is known to interact with sialic acid on the HIV envelope and isthoughttomediateCD4-independentHIVbindingandentryinmacrophages( 54,55). To assess if trehalose treatment also affects SIGLEC1-mediated entry in macrophages,we analyzed the effect of trehalose on SIGLEC1 expression by qPCR and found nosignicant effect ( Fig. 5B, right). Because SIGLEC1 expression is very low in adherent macrophages and cannot be reliably detected by immunoblotting ( 56), we used gene silencing ( Fig. 5C, left) to assess the effect of trehalose on SIGLEC1-mediated HIV entry (Fig. 5C, right). Compared to control small interfering RNA (siRNA)-treated HIV-exposed macrophages, knockdown of SIGLEC1 had a modest effect on viral entry; however, noadditional effect was observed on viral entry in trehalose-treated macrophages( Fig. 5C). In total, trehalose pretreatment did not show any direct effect on SIGLEC1 expression, and SIGLEC1 does not appear to play an important role in the trehalose-mediated decrease in viral entry. Trehalose inhibits HIV infection and replication via reduction of CD4- dependent HIV entry and induction of autophagy. Having unexpectedly identied that trehalose decreases HIV entry into macrophages, it was important to establish our original hypothesis that the non-MTOR induction of autophagy by trehalose is impor-tant in HIV determine the role of autophagy in trehalose intracellularinhibition, macrophages were infected with HIV fo r 8 h and cultured for 72 h without any treatment, at which time trehalose (100mM) was added to the culture medium.Cultures were maintained for an additional 7days, at which time supernatants werecollected (10days p.i.) and was measured by ELISA ( Fig. 6A).

At 24 h post-HIV infection, cells were collected and washed, and lysates were analyzed for p24 by immunoblotting and p24 antigencapture ELISA ( Fig. 8BandC).

In total, these ndings show that trehalose treatment inhibits HIV infection through two independent pathways. First, it downregulates the expression of CD4 in macro-phages and both CD4 and CCR5 in T cells to reduce virus entry. Second, trehalosepromotes the degradation of intracellular virus via induction of autophagy in both celltypes. DISCUSSION Autophagy plays an important role in host-virus interactions and viral pathogenesis (58).Whereassomevirusesusetheproteinsofautophagytoenhancereplication,other viruses are inhibited by autophagy. Still others, including HIV, utilize the proteins ofautophagy to enhance replication, but after establishing a permissive infection inhibitautophagytomaintaincellsurvival.Inthesecases,theinductionofautophagycanleadto inhibition of the targeted virus, including HIV ( the induction of autophagy through inhibition there is growingliterature the autophagy, trehalose is among the most studied and has been shown to inhibit human cytomeg-alovirus, varicella zoster virus and Zika virus replication ( 33,36; D. Spector, personal communication). Recently, trehalose was also shown to limit mycobacterial infectionduring HIV coinfection by reversing the 57). The /H9251,/H9251-trehalose derivatives containing guanidino groups have also been found to inhibit HIV replication throughthedisruptionofHIV-1tat-TARinteractioninhumancelllines( 65).Inthepresentstudy, we found that trehalose is a potent inhibitor of HIV in human macrophages and T cellswithout inducing cytotoxicity. Of note, we have also observed that other non-MTORinhibitors of autophagy, spermidine and SMER28, inhibit HIV replication (our unpub-lished data). Uniquely, however, we have identied that the inhibition of HIV infectionby trehalose is dependent not only on the induction of MTOR-independent autophagy,but also via the inhibition of viral entry through decreased expression of CD4 in bothT cells and macrophages and CCR5 in T cells. We have also shown that the decreasedexpression of CD4 and CCR5 by trehalose is specic to these receptors since trehalosehad no effect on CXCR1, CXCR4, or SIGLEC1. Thus, trehalose differs from other anti-HIVcompounds in that it affects HIV infection at entry and intracellularly. Trehalose has been found to induce autophagy by distinct mechanisms in different disease model systems. In the case of HCMV infection, trehalose treatment increaseslevels of RAB7 virus 36). multiple neurodegenerative disease (ND) model systems, trehalose- induced autophagy occurs via activation of TFEB. In these ND models, trehalosetreatment increases TFEB nuclear toactivate degradative autophagy ( 37,52,66). In agreement with these studies, we also found that trehalose treatment increased the nuclear accumulation of The of particular interest sinceTrehalose Inhibits HIV Infection Journal of Virology September 2020 Volume 94 Issue 17 e00237-20 jvi.asm.org 15in previous studies we have shown that during permissive infection, HIV Nef binds to BECN1,resultinginMTORactivation,TFEBphosphorylationandcytosolicsequestration,and the inhibition of autophagy ( 41). The TFEB-mediated inhibition of autophagy leads to enhanced cell survival and maintenance of HIV infection. Trehalose reverses thisprocess and, working through TFEB, enhances autophagy and inhibits HIV intracellularreplication. The upregulation of RAB7 by trehalose is also of considerable interest given our ndingthattrehalosedecreasestheexpressionofCD4.HIVNefdownregulatesCD4andthe major histocompatibility complex class I from the cell surface via endosomaltrafcking pathways to establish continued viral tness and persistence ( 67). Recently, Nef has been found target observed following trehalose treatment of CD4/H11001T cells and macrophages suggests that the decreased expression of CD4 observed in these cells could be related to the CD4endosomal/lysosomal degradation. In summary, we have shown that the nontoxic, naturally occurring sugar trehalose can uniquely inhibit HIV infection both at pre- and postentry. Preentry inhibition bytrehalose occurs by decreasing cell expression of CCR5 on T cells and CD4 onmacrophages. Postentry, trehalose inhibits HIV infection through the induction ofMTOR-independentautophagymediatedthroughTFEBactivation.Thesendingsdem-onstrate that cellular mechanisms can be modulated to inhibit HIV entry and intracel-lular replication using trehalose. Trehalose may be a useful, safe adjunct in themaintenance of patients who achieve an HIV functional cure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ethics Statement. Healthy HIV seronegative donors were enrolled for venous blood draw using a protocol that was reviewed and approved by the Human Research Protection Program of the Universityof California San Diego in accordance with the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations on theProtection of Human Subjects (45 CFR 46 and 21 CFR 50 and 56) and was in full compliance withthe principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from allthe donors prior to their participation. Cell Culture and Reagent Preparation. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from whole blood or buffy coat of HIV-seronegative donors by density gradient centrifugationover Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE macrophages CO 2and 37\u00b0C for 7 to 10days every Phytohemagglutinin (PHA, negative selection using the Miltenyi Biotech human CD4/H11001T cell isolation kit and 47). For autophagy induction, the culture medium was supplemented with different concentrations trehalose (50 Life Sciences), was reconstituted inDMSO and used at a nal concentration of 50nM to measure autophagic flux. Maraviroc (TorontoResearch Chemicals) was reconstituted in methanol and used at a nal concentration of 1 /H9262M. Virus assay. HIVBa-Lwas obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, from Suzanne Gartner and Robert Gallo ( 49,70). HIVBa-Lvirus stocks were prepared and the titer was determined as previously described ( 71). The 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) was determined using the Spearmen-Karber method ( 72) using the Alliance HIVp24 antigen ELISA (Perkin Elmer). Cells were pretreated with an autophagy-inducing agent for 6 to 12 h and then infected with 105TCID50/ml HIVBa-Lper 5/H11003105cells unless otherwise stated. For virus binding assessment, macrophages (2.5 /H11003105/well in a 48-well plate) were preincubated with 35min at 37\u00b0C ( 53). TheRawat et al.

Briefly, TaqMan primer probe sets for HIV strong stop DNA (measure of early reverse transcript, virus entry) (forward primer [5 =R]-5 early transcripts in genomic DNA samples.Predesigned GAPDH primer probe sets (Applied Biosciences) were used to both normalize the sample inputs and serve as a template integrity control. The cycling parameters used were as follows: 95\u00b0C for10min and 45 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1min. Normalized relative levels were calculated aslog 2-transformed fold difference from corresponding control (vehicle-treated) sample by 2-CT, where CT/H11005CTof treatment sample - CTof vehicle-treated cells, and CT/H11005average cycle threshold ( CT) of HIV target - average CTof corresponding GAPDH ( 54). Virus entry was also assessed by measuring intracellular p24 levels in cell lysates using ELISA. For T cells, virus entry was assessed in vehicle or trehalose-pretreated (50mM to 150mM), HIV-infected T cells.HIV-exposed T cells were cultured for 24 h and washed 3 times with DPBS and lysed with 120 /H9262l of cell lytic M cell lysis reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) as described above. Virus entry was analyzed by measuring theintracellular p24 levels in lysates using immunoblotting and ELISA. Cytotoxicity assay. Cytotoxicity and cell death were measured in vehicle and trehalose-treated macrophages with or without HIV infection using the LDH cytotoxicity detection kit (TaKaRa). Briefly,following 24 h of incubation with vehicle or trehalose, cells were infected with HIV and cultured in thepresence of trehalose for 10days. Uninfected cells were also cultured for 10days in the presence oftrehalose. At day 10, culture supernatants were collected, and LDH release was measured by ELISA. Flow cytometry. For cell surface expression analysis of CD4, CCR5, CXCR1, and CXCR4 by flow cytometry, macrophages were treated with trehalose for 12 h, collected, and stained with the followingfluorescent-tagged antibodies according xed with xation buffer (BD Biosciences) and resuspendedin stain buffer (hs.Ri.ATG5.13) and SIGLEC1 (hs.Ri.SIGLEC1.13) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.
