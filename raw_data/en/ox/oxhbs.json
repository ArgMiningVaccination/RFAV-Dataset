We are pleased to announce that the School of Continuing Studies will resume regular operations effective August 16 at the 640 Massachusetts Avenue building. We anticipate the conditions will be in place to bring our community back to the SCS building. We can expect some public health measures to remain in place as noted in [Provost Groves's message](https://www.georgetown.edu/news/fall-2021-public-health-guidelines-for-students-faculty-and-staff/). We will continue to adhere to health and safety protocols and guidelines as outlined by the University, and informed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the District of Columbia Department of Health, and local conditions; we will share additional information as it becomes available. Please note the following guidance for specific SCS programs: For students in the Executive Master of Professional Studies programs who are anticipating global residences, more information will be shared with you in the coming weeks. Professional Development and Certificate non-credit courses are scheduled in Flex Learning and online modalities for the Fall 2021 semester. For students in degree programs, please reach out to your academic program team for more information on in-person courses. International students with questions about their F1 visa status should contact Anka Dadarlat, Assistant Dean for International Students and Scholars at [scsimmigration@georgetown.edu](mailto:scsimmigration@georgetown.edu). English Language Center international students should contact Christina Koenig ( [elcimmigration@georgetown.edu](mailto:elcimmigration@georgetown.edu)). Our decisions continue to be informed by national and local public health guidelines and the current state of the pandemic. Our plans may need to be updated should the trajectory of the pandemic change. We will share additional updates as needed. COVID-19 Vaccinations In accordance with Georgetown University policy, SCS will require all students, faculty, and staff who will be at the 640 Massachusetts Avenue building this fall to be [fully vaccinated against COVID-19](https://www.georgetown.edu/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/#student-vaccination-requirement), unless granted a [medical or religious exemption](https://www.georgetown.edu/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/#religious-and-medical-exemptions). To meet this requirement, students, faculty, and staff will need to [submit documentation](https://uis.georgetown.edu/coronavirus-instructions-for-uploading-your-vaccination-documentation/) as soon as possible showing they have been vaccinated with a vaccine authorized for emergency use or granted approval by the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) (FDA) or the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines) (WHO). Students are asked to submit their documentation by no later than August 1; staff and faculty should do so by August 9. Vaccines are safe and effective, and getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. We are grateful to everyone who has already been vaccinated and submitted their information through the GU360 app or [GU360 website](https://gu360.georgetown.edu/s/). Answers to vaccination questions can be found in this [FAQ](https://www.georgetown.edu/coronavirus/frequently-asked-questions/health-and-safety/#vaccines), including [how to load your vaccination record into GU360](https://uis.georgetown.edu/coronavirus-instructions-for-uploading-your-vaccination-documentation/) and how to request a medical or religious exemption. In preparation for the Fall 2021 semester, please review the specific vaccination deadlines and other guidelines provided for students, faculty, and staff, respectively: [Guidance for students](https://www.georgetown.edu/news/reminder-to-submit-vaccination-documentation-and-guidance-for-international-students/) [Guidance medical and religious exemptions](https://www.georgetown.edu/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/#religious-and-medical-exemptions) I deeply appreciate the way all of you have come together to navigate this past year, and I know many of us are eager to have our community safely back together at the SCS building.
