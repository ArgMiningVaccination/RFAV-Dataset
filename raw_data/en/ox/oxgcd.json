This Act relates to child protection system provisions involving child abuse assessment pilot projects administered by the Department of Human Services and to other child protection provisions. Under the Act, a report of child abuse in pilot project counties is responded to differently than in other counties. In the other counties, when a report is received, the department performs a child abuse investigation to determine whether child abuse occurred and to ensure the safety of the child. If the department determines child abuse occurred, the names of the allcgL-d perpetrator and the. child are placed on a central computerized child abuse registry. The registry is used as a tool for employment screening in child day care positions and other jobs involving dependent children and adults. A statute enacted in 1995, implementing recommendations of a legislative interim committee on child protection, provided for testing of a different approach in five areas of the state. In the 19 pilot project counties, the focus of the response to a report is to perform an assessment of the child's safety and the functioning of the child's family. Only cases of significant abuse are placed on the registry. The 1.995 legislation included a statement of legislative intent t.o initiate the assessment-based approat:h statewide beginning July 1, 1996. This Act modifies this intent statement to instead consider statewide implementation beginning February l 0, 1997. 62 CHILDREN AND YOUTH In addition, the Act modifies the assessment-based pilot project statute as follows: The county attorney is to be notified of the receipt of a report of child abuse as is the practice in the investigation-based system. The department must commence the assessment within 24 hours instead of the 72 hours originally required. The written assessment must be completed within 20 business days instead of the 21 calendar days originally required. A copy of the written assessment pertaining to the child abuse report is to be provided to the county attorney and the juvenile court. Under the 01iginal enactment, the assessment was only provided if the assessment included a recommendation for a court action or petition. The department is required to work with representatives of local enforcement to develop a protocol for joint investigative processes. The criteria for placement on the child abuse registry is expanded tu include sexual abuse by perpetrators who arc ages 14 and older. The juvenile court is authorized to remove perpetrators from the registry who arc ages 14 through 17 upon a finding of go()d cause. In addition, placement on the registry is directed if the department dctcrrnincs that the alleged perpetrator will continue to pose a danger to the child in the report or to any other child, A report concerning the assessmcntubascd projects is to be submitted by the department in December 1996. The report is to include analysis of outcomes and other performance measures concerning the two methods of responding to a child abuse report. The Act includes additional provisions relating to child protection. Access to child abuse registry information is provided for a person to determine whether an individual is named in a founded child abuse report as having abused a child, if the individual provides written authorization for the access. Provisions allowing multidisciplinary prosecution teams in child abuse cases are expanded to permit consultation with a variety of professionals.

The Act takes effect April 30, 1996. SENATE FILE 2410 -Illegal Drugs in Parents and Children llY COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RESOURCES. This Act amends Juvenile Justice Code provisions involving the presence of illegal drugs in a child or a parent. Much of the Act reverses provisions enacted in 1995 Iowa Acts, Chapter 182, \"Child in need of assistance\" and ''child abuse\" definitions arc changed to include the presence of an illegal drug in a child as a direct and foreseeable consequence of the acts or omissions of the child's parent, guardian or custodian, In 1995, the definition utilized a r~asonablc and prudent person standard in applying child in need of assistance and child abuse definitions to the presence of an illegal drug in a child. The Act strikes provisions directing the Iowa Department of Public Health to adopt rules specifying mm1mum standards for reliable results for medically relevant tests to minimize the incidence of false positive tests and to identify qualified laboratories. The Act includes a provision voiding the adopted rules. The Act amends Juvenile Justice Code language containing requirements for medically relevant tests of parents, guardians or custodians. The amendment snikes language authorizing a parent to select the laboratory to perform a medically relevant test from among laboratories identified in rules adopted by the Iowa Department of Public Health. The Act also strikes language that prohibits the use of a positive test result in the criminal prosecution of the parent. The Act modifies a provision in law prior to the 1995 Legislative Session that prohibits the usc of a positive medically relevant test in the criminal prosecution of a parent for acts and omissions. resulting in intrauterine exposure of a child to an illegal drug. The modification limits the prosecution prohibition to tests obtained prior to the birth of the child. CHILDREN AND YOUTH 63 The Act provides that if a child is removed from the child's home under a court order due to the presence of an illegal drug in the child's body, the court is to allow reasonable or supervised visitation with the child's parent unless the court determines the visitation would cause an imminent risk to the child's life or health.

The Act also provides for an alternative procedure if an attending physician certifies that a medical emergency exists and an abortion is performed on a pregnant minor prior to the required notification of a parent.

The Act provides that a compact facility may be permanently closed before it reaches capacity and before the expiration of its 20-year participation period if approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the commission, including the affirmative vote of the commission member of the state in which the compact facility to be closed is located. \"Compact facility;; means a radioactive waste disposal facility and replace~ the previous term \"regional facility.\"\" The 1\\.ct contains the funding mechanism of the comm1sswn. Under ordinary circumstances) funding of the compact facility operations and the commission is provided through payment of a surcharge. During the period prior to initial operation of the first compact facility, the commission's funding is provided through fees paid by generators. The Act establishes a remedial action fund to provide additional assurance that users of the facilities pay all expenses associated with the regional disposal of l<>w\"levcl radioactive waste. The Act requires the commission to consider the economic impacts on the party states in developing and adopting procedures and criteria for selecting host states. The Act provides that the compact shall use sovereign immunity and generator indemnification to prevent party states from incuning liability, The Act provides that each party state shall take its turn hosting compact facilities. The Act states that if a host state fails to discharge its obligation to develop and operate a compact facility on a timely basis, the commission may terminate the pmty state;s designation as a host state. The Act provides that a facility shall accept waste for disposal for a 20-ycar period or until its capacity is reached. However, before a compact facility is closed, a host state and the commission may enter into an agreement to lengthen the time period during which the compact facility accepts waste for disposal or to increase the capacity of the facility. The Act establishes the process by which subsequent compact facilities are developed. A state that develops a compact facility cannot begin to operate its facility until the host state for the next compact disposal facility is designated. 116 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION The Act allows the host state of the thenwoperating compact facility to unilaterally decide to continue to operate its compact facility; even though the compact facility has already operated for 20 years or it~ capacity has been reached, if the next compact facility does not begin operating as planned. The Act allows a host state to make an emergency closing of the compact facility in its state in order to protect air, land and water resources and the health and safety of people who are affected by the compact facility. The Act prohibits a host state from developing a compact facility intended for the entire region and then using the compact facility only for the host state itself if it leaves the compact. Thcrefore1 a state that leaves the compact is required to close any compact facility located within its borders. The Act requires waste generators to sign and file with the commission an agreement providing for indemnification as a condition of acceptance of waste at a compact facility. The Act provides that only a federal court may make the final determination that a state law conflicts with and is, thcrcforcj subordinate to the compact. The Act reflects thatj except in cases between states that are within the original jurisdiction of the U. S. Supreme Court, the federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases arising under this compact. The Act provides that party states and their agencies, and the employees of both, are protected against liability and the costs of -litigation seeking to recover damages resulting from the development, construction, operation, closing, or long-term care of a compact facility. The Act rnakes it more diftlcult for a party state to withdraw frorn the compact. The Act allows the commission to impose reasonable financial penalties, suspend waste disposal rights, or rcv(>ke membership in the compact for withdrawal. The Act provides that a party state, whose right to have waste generated within its borders disposed of at a compact facility is suspended, shall pay to the host state of the compact facility an amount necessary to ensure that the host state docs not incur financial hardship.

The Act amends provisions initially enacted in 1995 Iowa Acts, Chapter 206, S. F. 69. Under prior law, a base year was established as the net amount a county expended in FY 1993-1994 for mental health and developmental disability (MH/DD) services. This base year is used as the maximum amount a county may levy for such services from the county's MH/DD fund, and the law provides a state goal of providing for funding for 50 percent of the total of all county base year expenditures. The Act provides a means for a county to change the base year amount by allowing a county to elect to either continue using the FY !993-1994 figure or switch to the amount the county projects to expend in FY 1995-1996. The Act also provides a budgeting mechanism to fund growth in MH/DD expenditures. The Governor vetoed provisions directed to this purpose in last year's S. F. 69.

This Act provides for the involvement of the county single entry point process in voluntary and involuntary placcmcnt.o,; of individuals for mental health or mental retardation care and treatment services and amends related statutes involving billing and payment for the services. Enactments in the 1994 and 1995 Legislative Sessions initiated reforms of county service and payment provisions for mental health, rnental retardation, and developmental disability (MI-1/MR/DD) services. The reforms involve gr{;atcr slate participation in the funding of the services, a requirement that county budgets for the services operate within a fixed budget, and implementation of service management provisions. The service management provisions include implementation of a single entry pojnt process (also referred to as .a central point of coordination) to manage intake and referral to services. The Act incorporates the single. entry point process into Code provisions providjng for voluntary and involuntary placements for mental health or mental retardation services when the services arc paid in whole or part by a county. Commitments for an evaluation or services must be to a provider designated through the single entry point process. The Department of Human Services is directed to utilize the single entry point process in referrals to Medical Assistance (Medicaid) services, to the extent allowed under federal requirements. The Act includes ptovisions for coordination between the single entry point process of an individual's county of residence and that of the individual's county of legal settlement. Iowa has historically maintained a process for determining the payment responsibllities of the county or state government for services based upon initial residence, subject to modification for other factors.. 'This process is known as \"legal settlement\" and is not changed by the Act. Other provisions of the Act address the amount of per diems billed to a county for care provided at a state hospital~ school or state mental health institute. Under prior law, the per diem amount was fixed at the amount in effect on July I, 1988, subject to an increase up to the amount of adjustment in the consumer price index. The Act changes this inflation im .. mase factor to be based instead upon the amount of the allowed growth factor authorized in law for COllnty MHIMRJDD budgets. The new factor applies beginning with FY 1997\u00b71998. Counties are expressly authorized to pay for Ml-I/DD services by pooling appropriations from their MHJJ)D funds with other counties and with regional county entities. Other service payment provisions of the Act relate to the Medical Assistance (Medicaid) program. Counties pay the non federal share of intermediate care facility for persons with mental retardation (ICFMR) services and other services to the same adult population covered under the program.
