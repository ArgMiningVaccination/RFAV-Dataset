The definitive version is held on InSite in the Policies and Guidelines Library 1. Introduction and Who Guideline applies to This Guideline is designed to give guidance and support to Midwives to provide appropriate and optimal care for women, who choose to employ the use of aromatherapy in the antenatal, labour and postnatal period. RCM positon statement for Complementary ther apies and natural remedies All Midwives at the point of registration, should have a basic understanding of the benefits and risks of complementary therapies and natural remedies, even though they may not be directly involved in administering or advising on them. Complementary and natural remedies should be treated with the same caution and degree of expertise as any other clinical intervention. They should be used in conjunction with conventional midwifery and obstetric care and not viewed by mothers or m idwives as a replacement for adequate monitoring and care by appropriately qualified maternity professional. It is appropriate for midwives to gain competence in new skills, in accordance with NMC requirements, so that they can offer women a wider range of choices during maternity care. However, they must take care not to overstep the boundaries of professional accountability. Midwives who are using these therapies in their practice should have gained the necessary knowledge and skills through recognised tr aining programmes. The admini stration of complementary therapies and/ or provi sion of advice on their use must be in the best interests of the mother and baby and midwives must be able to justify their use in terms of current ly available evidence. ( NMC Cod e 2018: 4 ). Currently NICE (2017) sta tes that women should not be offered , or advised to use , aromatherapy for pain relief during the latent stage of labour as there is limited evidence to support this at present , but NICE also adds that if the woman wishes to use this technique, her wishes should be respected . What's new? Scope of guideline changed from low risk women to all if not contraindicated Women with raised BP with no PET symptoms and normal bloods now included Highlighted th e oils that have uterotonic properties Added aromatherapy cards to appendix Contents 1.

The chemical constituents of the oils work pharmacologically, acting ph ysiologically on different organs in the body and psychologically via the limbic system in the brain. (Tiran 2018) Evidence Some women find the use of aromatherapy during labour beneficial as highlighted in Burns et al (2000) original study found. Women described having increased satisfaction with their labour, more control of their bodies and better psychological outcomes.

The definitive version is held on InSite in the Policies and Guidelines Library Appendix 5: Aromatherapy Cards A set of easy to follow cards from which to make blends for specific situations; use as a guide only...be creative and think about what is going on physiologically, emotionally, intellectually and even spiritually. The cards are in line with UHL Aromatherapy policy, for use with women having straightforward pregnancies, labours and births and in the postnatal period, and for post -dates women who would like this optio n alongside care. Midwives are in a unique position to impact on a family's experience, so using positive language that builds expectation and excitement when using Aromatherapy, helps with the effectiveness of the oils and the experience. The following i nformation is based around the therapeutic effects of the oils we can use in UHL and the situations that might warrant consideration of their use. Always remember Midwifery skills and common sense first - if you are not sure about using the oils, ask for another opinion and please remember to record everything in the notes for audit purposes as outlined in the policy. A list for further reading is included at the end Page 18 of 29 Title: Aromatherapy in pregnancy labour and postnatally V:2 Approved by: Maternity Governance Committee: 2024 Trust Ref No: C1/2019 NB: Paper copies of this document may not be most recent version. The definitive version is held on InSite in the Policies and Guidelines Library Suggested methods for administration Inhalation - when inhaled, the oil molecules stimulate the olfactory pathways that are closely connected to the Limbic System which plays a major role in emotions and feelings. Gather - chosen oils (up to 3 drops) cotton wool/swab. If using at home, a universal conta iner labelled with woman's name, date and oils used. Drop oil(s) onto material for immediate inhalation or send home for use in a labelled universal bottle. If using in labour, oil can be also dropped onto a wet face flannel or small towel and folded so it doesn't contact the skin directly, and inhaled, then refreshed as needed, particularly useful when in the pool. Situations for use Absolutely any situation - fear, anxiety, panic, transition, insomnia, nausea, headache, to feel calm and relaxed and to aid sleep, to stimulate and revive, to elicit feelings of strength and power; Inhaling oils is very helpful in a 'first aid' situation where a feeling needs to change quickly. Using inhalation alongside a massage for example is incredibly powerful and multipl ies the therapeutic effect but remember the universal principle of 'less is always more' - very small amounts can make a huge difference. Oils - any of the oils can be used (see 'Therapeutic Properties' section) always think as a Midwife first and ask your self \"what is going on physiologically, emotionally and perhaps even spiritually\" Compress - A compress is a clean, damp, folded cloth that has been infused with water mixed with essential oils, and then applied to an area to Page 19 of 29 Title: Aromatherapy in pregnancy labour and postnatally V:2 Approved by: Maternity Governance Committee: 2024 Trust Ref No: C1/2019 NB: Paper copies of this document may not be most recent version. The definitive version is held on InSite in the Policies and Guidelines Library be treated. It can be either cold or warm, depending on its purpose. It is important to mix the oils vigorously into the water to break up the droplets prior to use (gloves can be worn if desired). Alternatively, chosen oils could be added to a little of t he water in a universal pot and then shaken prior to adding to the container. Gather - wash bowl/container, face flannels/small towels/washable breast pads, larger towel, chosen oils Situations for use In labour - Soak face cloth or small towel in a bowl of hot water containing 2 - 3 drops of essential oil, disperse the oil briskly with your hands, wring out cloth and apply to woman's back as contraction builds to peak. Remove as contraction wanes and re -soak in prepa ration for next contraction - teach birth partner to continue to do this. Choose oils depending on woman's demeaner, look at 'Therapeutic properties' section. After pains - Using hot water, take care that it's not too hot, add 2 -3 drops of chosen oil and briskly mix with hand. Choose oils that are analgesic, relaxing and anti -inflammatory/anti -spasmodic. Plunge towel into water mix, squeeze out excess and apply to lower abdomen then cover with a large, dry towel. Repeat once cooled and repeat as needed, us ually 30 mins or until improvement is felt. Breast engorgement - using hot water, add 2 -3 drops of chosen oils, think in physiological terms and choose oils that are decongestant, analgesic and anti-inflammatory. Perineal compress - to alleviate pain and swelling to perineum or haemorrhoids, and to promote healing. Using cold water in a bowl, add up to 3 appropriate oils. Plunge pad -shaped cloth into well mixed solution, then place directly on affected area covered with a clean, dry pad and leave for up to \u00bd hour - replace with fresh, dry pad. Woman can continue to do this at home 2 -3 times a day, keeping leftover solution covered in the fridge - remember to thoroughly mix the oil into the water each new application to disperse the oils. Choose oils that ar e anti -bacterial, analgesic and immune Page 20 of 29 Title: Aromatherapy in pregnancy labour and postnatally V:2 Approved by: Maternity Governance Committee: 2024 Trust Ref No: C1/2019 NB: Paper copies of this document may not be most recent version. The definitive version is held on InSite in the Policies and Guidelines Library boosting such as Lavender, Cypress, Chamomile Frankincense and Geranium (Geranium is fine to use with prophylactic anticoagulation but NOT IF THERAPEUTIC). Compress for sore nipples - using lukewarm water with up t o 3 drops of chosen oils added, mix briskly and plunge small flannel or washable breast pad into the mix. Squeeze out excess and place on nipple for up to 15 minutes covered with a dry towel, then air dry. Obviously both nipples can be treated at the same time if necessary. Analgesic, antiseptic, bactericidal and anti -inflammatory oils can be used in this instance. Dispose of anything left -over down the toilet. Massage - latent/early/active labour/prolonged pregnancy or for general relaxation - oils will absorb through the skin into the circulatory system and will be greatly increased via the principles of therapeutic touch and heat transfer. It is important that whoever is doing the massage feels calm and relaxed themselves because physical contact i n this way is also a transferral of energy and intention. Gather - grapeseed oil base, chosen oils, universal pot for mixing and pouring (label pot with woman's details, date and blend/percentage used and record in notes). Situations for use Use your judg ement or if woman asks for an intervention. Involve partner and show how easy it is! Massage whole back s -l-o-w-l-y from sacrum to nape of neck, around shoulders, ribs and waist using long, firm strokes keeping hands in contact with the skin.

Absorp tion is through the skin and by inhalation. Gather - a bath full of water, mix of base oil and up to 3 drops of chosen oils added once bath has run . Situations for use As a choice, when you feel it would be of benefit or when intervention is asked for by woman - nothing relaxes the body more than a soak in the bath! In labour and postnatally, it relaxes, soothes and heals on many levels. It is beneficial in perineal care postnatally and can be adjusted by using a wash bowl or bidet instead - pat area dry gently afterwards and apply fresh sanitary pad. A soak in a bath with essential oils can be very healing after a traumatic birth and is something a woman can do once home. Remember, base oil is slippery - there's no need to use a lot, just enough to emulsify the drops of essential oils that you add. Foot bath - absorp tion of essential oils via a foot bath is easy to administer and of great value due to the reflex points on the feet which correspond to all the systems and organs of the body. The feet are conveniently placed, and their large surface area readily absorbs the oils. The foot bath method is of value in maternity practically, as it takes up very little space and can be done alongside routine care. Gather - bowl, towel, base oil and up to 3 drops of carefully chosen essential oils - add this mixture to the foo t bowl once the warm water has been added and then carefully place woman's feet into the bowl. Make sure she is comfortably seated in a chair and the bowl is safely positioned so her feet can sit flat in it. She could also inhale a blend at the same time - remember 'less is more' principle.
