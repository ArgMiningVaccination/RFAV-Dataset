Children are growing up with an \"always -on\" mentality: -94% of American 12 -17-year-olds use the Internet -58% of 12 to 17 -year-olds use online social networking sites 70% of girls 15 -17 57% of boys 15 -17* Kids consume -and increasingly - produce content. (*Pew Internet & American Life Project, June, 2008)Teens, Online Stranger Contact & Cyberbullying, June 30, 2008 3 Online Threats Children face a variety of threats when online today: -Cyberbullying -Online predators -Cutting and suicide sites -Anorexia, bulimia sites Threats are not static -they are dynamic and ever-changing. -Social networking sites and chat rooms didn't exist five years ago. -\"Sexting\" (inappropriate images taken with cell phone cameras and transmitted between teens) is the latest threat to emerge in the U.S. Companies, governments, educators and law enforcement need to engage in an ongoing cooperative effort to make the internet as safe as possible for our children.4 Verizon's Position Verizon provides access to broadband services across multiple platforms. Parents need tools to help protect their children on all platforms: Verizon Wireless -Age appropriate content filters, usage controls and family locator for children's wireless devices (verizonwireless.com/parentalcontrols ) & (verizonwireless.com/usagecontrols ). Verizon FiOS TV -Extensive parental controls are offered on all FIOS subscriptions providing the ability to block unsuitable or objectionable content (verizonwireless.com/fiostivhelp ).5 Verizon Online Parental Controls and Cybersecurity Tools Tools: We offer strong cybersecurity tools which allow parents to identify and block websites which are inappropriate for children: -Block websites by category -Block or allow websites based on URL of the site -Block Internet access for certain programs or groups of programs -Schedule when Internet access is available Verizon Security Advisor is a free security test to see if a personal computer is protecting you from the latest online threats. In addition, Verizon Internet Security Suite offers a package of anti -spyware, anti-virus, firewall, pop -up and ad blocker, privacy manager, fraud protection and personal computer tune -up. More information: ( http://www.verizon.net/parentalcontrol ) Personal safety on the Internet is a top priority for Verizon.6 Education and Awareness While a range of blocking tools continue to expand and improve, more attention is being drawn to online safety education and awareness -raising. Recent studies in the United States and the United Kingdom have shown the importance of teaching critical thinking, digital citizenship, and new forms of media literacy. However, experts are continuing to stress that young people are not passive \"victims\" but active participants. How can we best promote self -respect and socially responsible behavior both online and offline?7 Corporate Responsibility Coalitions & industry partners -Family Online Safety Institute -MySpace Task Force -StopCyberBullying -NCTA Blue Ribbon Task Force -U.S. Telcom Online Safety Working Group Expanding research into online habits.

Empowering people to help themselves. http://responsibility.verizon.com Consumer Awareness & Education 9 Working with Law Enforcement Supporting investigations into all manner of online criminal activity. Working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to report and investigate child pornography. Maintaining a highly trained staff of investigators and security personnel to respond to legal process. Providing training to law enforcement regarding subpoena compliance and forensic investigation.10 Conclusions (1) Rapid evolution from just consumer to producer of online content. Online threats always evolving -we need flexibility to respond. Online parental controls and cybersecurity tools are also evolving, and improving. Education and awareness becoming more important, with extensive industry -sponsored programs underway, with a focus on: -Children -Parents -Teachers and schools Working to do more: -More education outreach -Better communication through web -based media -Continuing research into technical approaches to address online safety and security issues -Increase resources for law enforcement11 Conclusions (2) No quick fixes: Online safety is a societal issue demanding a broad -based response through schools, libraries, and community outreach. While the internet has caused a fundamental shift in the way people learn, socialize and interact, communication with our children remains of fundamental importance. Today we heard a lot about the evils lurking on the Internet, but let us not lose sight of the fact that the Internet is overwhelmingly a good thing for society. Our focus will remain providing the best network tools available; informing people on how to make safer choices; and guarding against cybercrime.12 Thank you!
