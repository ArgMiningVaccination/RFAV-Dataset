The State Forestry Commission protects and manages Georgia's 24 million acres of forestland, which represents anapproximate $28.9 billion in assets and comprises 75% of allland in the State. The Commission has four programs:Administration, Forest Protection, Forest Management, andthe Tree Seedling Nursery. Through these programs, theForestry Commission provides a wide variety of services torural forest landowners, offers technical assistance tomunicipalities and urban landowners, provides seedlings tothe citizens of Georgia at a reasonable price, and protects theforest resources of the State through fire prevention andsuppression.

Thislength of this recovery exceeds the average length of therecovery and expansion phase of other post-World War IIeconomic cycles. While this economic cycle is long induration, it shows few signs that it is reaching an end point. In contrast to the US economy which continues to grow at a moderate pace, the Global economy is facingheadwinds. Growth in China has moderated as it transitionsfrom an export driven growth orientation to one centered ondomestic demand driven growth. This transition, which hasled to weaker conditions in China's manufacturing sector,has contributed to declines in commodity prices, includingoil prices. Countries dependent on commodity exports havethus seen growth weaken. Weak growth is apparent in lowglobal inflation and low interest rates as central banks keepmonetary policy loose to boost economic growth. Forecastsof the global economy anticipate relatively weak growthover the next year. Real (inflation adjusted) US GDP growth is quite volatile. Real GDP grew by 3.2% at a seasonally adjusted annual ratein the third quarter of 2016; up from 1.4% in the secondquarter and 0.8% in the first quarter. GDP growth over thelast year had been reduced as the economy has workedthrough an overhang of excess inventories. Inventory activityreduced GDP growth by 1.2% in the second quarter of 2016but added 0.5% to reported growth in the third quarter. Overall, the national economy has the fundamentals in place to support continued economic growth. Labor marketsare improving, consumer sector finances are in good shapeand business have sound balance sheets to help them investand hire. A key risk is Federal Reserve monetary policy. TheFed has ended its purchases of private securities and isexpected to take another step to normalizing interest rateswith an increase in the target Fed Funds rate at the FederalOpen Market Committee meeting in December 2016. Thepath back to a more neutral policy stance is uncertain andcould lead to financial market volatility. This is complicatedby the on-going challenges in international financial marketsas foreign central bankers wrestle with low growth and thethreat of deflation. A wide range of economic indicators show that the economic recovery is progressing. Total U.S. year over yearnon-farm employment growth equals 1.6% as of November2016. Job growth has moderated in the fall of 2016 but is stillgrowing at a solid rate. The U.S. is adding an average of176,000 jobs per month as of November 2016. The U.S.unemployment rate has also fallen. The U.S. rate as ofNovember 2016 is 4.6%, down from a peak of 10.0% inOctober 2009. This rate suggests that slack in US labormarkets is rapidly eroding. In addition, broader measures ofunemployment also show that the US is moving toward fullemployment and this is setting the stage for the Fed toinitiate interest rate increases. Real consumer spending growth has been running in excess of 2.5% on a year over year basis. A bright spot inconsumer spending has been auto sales. Auto sales hadaveraged over 16 million units per year prior to the recessionbut fell to an annualized sales rate below 10 million unitsduring parts of 2008 and 2009. Sales have improved significantly from that trough. Sales have been averagingaround 17.5 million units on an annualized basis over the lastthree months; this is down from over 18.0 million units on anannualized basis during late 2015. It is likely that the boost ineconomic growth from high vehicle sales activity has toppedout. Still, the economic fundamentals underlying consumerspending are in good shape. Household wealth hasrecovered from the declines during the Great Recession andis far above its pre-recession level. Household debtobligations as a percent of monthly income are near recordlows and job and disposable income growth both supportconsumer spending growth. Consumer use of revolvingcredit is growing as consumer confidence improves andbanks gradually loosen lending standards. All of thiscontributes to an expectation that consumer spending willcontinue to contribute to economic growth. Measures of business activity show that manufacturing growth has recovered from levels consistent withcontraction in late 2015 and early 2016 to levels consistentwith modest growth in recent months while services activityis expanding at a healthier rate. The Institute of SupplyManagement index for manufacturing is at 52.3 as ofNovember 2016, slightly above the neutral value of 50. Thisreading is consistent with a manufacturing sector in whichactivity is expanding slowly. The weakness in manufacturingis tied to declines in exports due to the strength of the dollarand the pullback in oil field activity due to the decline in oilprices. In contrast, the index for services is running at 56.9well above the neutral level. This indicates a solid rate ofexpansion off activity in the service sector. The national housing market continues its recovery. Various measures of home prices are moving higher. Forexample, the S&P Case Shiller index for 20 metro areas acrossthe U.S. is up 5.1% year over year as of September 2016. Salesof new homes and existing homes are volatile but aretrending up as are housing starts. Mortgage foreclosure anddelinquency rates are trending down and are approachinglevels seen prior to the housing bust. Rising home prices areeasing pressures on homeowners who had been underwateron mortgages and mortgage credit conditions have eased. Georgia's economy generally follows the overall trends of the U.S. economy, although it tends to grow more quicklyduring expansions and fall further during recessions.Georgia's employment situation has improved significantlyin the last year. Non-farm employment grew by just over97,100 jobs from October 2015 to October 2016. Thisequates to a 2.3% increase in employment which is higherthan the comparable rate for U.S. employment. Georgia'sunemployment rate is 5.2% as of October, down fromOctober 2015's reading of 5.5%. However, Georgia'sunemployment rate is still slightly above the unemploymentrate for the US, 4.9%. Employment growth is well diversified across industry sectors in Georgia. Growth leaders include construction,leisure and hospitality, trade, transportation and utilities,professional and business services, financial, and educationand health. Other services and information sectors are a yearover year decline in employment as of October. 349 State of Georgia's Budget Report FY 2018Georgia Economic Report The S&P Case Shiller home price index for the Atlanta metro area is up by 5.3% as September 2016 compared tothe prior August. Residential construction permits are up8.8% from the prior year as of September 2016. This indicatesthat the housing market in Georgia is growing at a measuredpace. Georgia tax revenues growth in FY 2016 was strong and bolstered by tax law changes associated with HB 170, thetransportation funding bill. Total tax revenue grew by 8.4%and General Fund revenues grew by 8.8%. Individual incometax revenues, the single largest component grew by 7.9%but corporate income tax revenues declined by 2.0%. Salestax revenues grew by 1.7%; sales tax growth was reduced bythe elimination of the fourth penny of motor fuel taxationfrom General Sales Tax. Motor fuel tax revenues grew by61.3% and Title Ad Valorem tax revenues grew by 13.4%,reflecting the strong performance of the auto market.Revenue growth has continued in FY 2017. The Departmentof Revenue has reported tax revenue growth of 4.8% year-to-date through November 2016.The US economy is on solid footing as the end of 2016 approaches. Labor markets are expanding, consumerspending is growing and the housing recovery continues. The government sector has switched from being a drag on growth to a contributor to economic growth. The primaryarea of weakness is the manufacturing sector which is feelingthe impact of declines in exports and the pullback in the oilsector. Overall, the US and Georgia economies are on-track tocontinue to grow at rates comparable to those experiencedin 2016. There are risks to the outlook. As note, themanufacturing sector is the key area of weakness in thedomestic economy. In addition, the Federal Reserve isexpected to restart increases in its policy interest rate inDecember 2016. This creates some risks in financial marketsand interest rate sensitive sectors such as housing and autosales. Finally, global growth poses risks with weakness inChina, resource-based economies and the Euro-zone.Georgia Economic Report Detail State of Georgia's Budget Report FY 2018 350Georgia Economic Report Detail Georgia Economic Report Detail. Georgia Economic Indicators Personal Income Nominal personal income has been growing over the prior quarter for much of the recovery with occasionalquarters in which income has fallen compared to the priorquarter. Similarly, wage and salary income has been growing.Income growth in Georgia has exceeded 4.5% year over yearfor each of the last four quarters. Wage and salary growth hasgrown more quickly over this period. This reflects consistentgrowth in Georgia's economy and highlights the recentstrength in labor market growth. Labor Markets Georgia's labor market continued to grow during 2016. Over the 12 months ending in October 2016, non-farmemployment in Georgia increased by 97,100 jobs. Thisequates to 2.3% year over year growth and exceeds thegrowth rate for U.S. non-farm employment over the sameperiod of 1.7%. Over the last three months ending inOctober, non-farm employment growth has averaged 6,700jobs per month. Employment growth across industry sectorshas been well diversified during 2016. Sectors such asconstruction, leisure and hospitality, professional andbusiness services, manufacturing, finance, education andhealth, and trade, transportation, and utilities, andgovernment added jobs over the year. The information andother services sectors are the only industry sectorsexperiencing year over year declines in employment. MostGeorgia metro areas are also seeing net job growth, withAthens, Savannah, and Atlanta having the highest year overyear job growth on a three month moving average basis as ofOctober. No Georgia metro area is suffering net job losses ona three month moving average year over year basis as ofOctober 2016. The large job losses that occurred during the recession resulted in peak unemployment rates of 10.4% for severalmonths during 2009. The current rate has fallen considerablyfrom its peak and now equals 5.2% as of October 2016. This isdown from5.5% in October 2015 but above the U.S.unemployment rate of 4.9%. Unemployment rates areunlikely to decline much further as the national economyapproaches full employment. Unemployment insuranceclaims are also showing improvement. Initial claims arebelow year ago levels as of early November 2016 and arerunning at or below pre-recession levels. Housing Sector Georgia's housing market is recovering. Residential building permits issued are trending up and are well aboveyear ago levels. Home prices, as measured by the S&P / Case-Shiller home price index for the Atlanta metro area are up5.3% on a year over year basis as of September 2016. Whileprice appreciation of homes has moderated this year, thislevel is consistent with a sustainable price path for residentialreal estate. 351 State of Georgia's Budget Report FY 2018Georgia Economic Report Detail Mortgage foreclosures were a key contributor to the decline in home values during the housing bust. Foreclosurerates soared leading to a large number of distressedproperties available for sale which depressed home values.Currently, foreclosure rates are trending down and are atlevels comparable to those experienced prior to therecession. Thus, housing markets are normalizing and priceappreciation and starts are expected to move slowly toward historical trends as labor market and demographic trendsfirm.
