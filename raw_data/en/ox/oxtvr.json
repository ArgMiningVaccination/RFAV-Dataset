The Commission approved a tentative recommendation on the topic earlier this year, after more than two years of study.4 Pursuant to the Commission's longstanding practice, the tentative recommendation was widely circulated for comment. The Commission considered the comments in September and directed the staff to revise the proposed recodification in various respects.5 Attached for the Commission's consideration is a draft of a final recommendation, which implements the decisions made in September, updates the proposal to include recently-enacted legislation, and incorporates various technical corrections and other minor revisions. Those changes are described in more detail below. Commissioners should review the attached draft and consider the points discussed in this memorandum. Further comments are still welcome, at or before the upcoming meeting. After considering all of the input, the Commission will need to decide whether to approve the attached draft as a final recommendation (with or 1. See 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)). 2. Any California Law Revision Commission document referred to in this memorandum can be obtained from the Commission. Recent materials can be downloaded from the Commission's website (www.clrc.ca.gov). Other materials can be obtained by contacting the Commission's staff, through the website or otherwise. The Commission welcomes written comments at any time during its study process. Any comments received will be a part of the public record and may be considered at a public meeting. However, comments that are received less than five business days prior to a Commission meeting may be presented without staff analysis. 3. Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48. 4.

Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references in this memorandum are to the Government Code. IMPLEMENTATION OF SEPTEMBER DECISIONS At the September meeting, the Commission made numerous decisions regarding the proposed recodification.6 For the most part, implementing those decisions and any necessary conforming changes was simple and straightforward. Only a few points are worth mentioning: In September, the Commission decided that \"the Commission's report should alert the Legislature to the possibility of (1) revisiting each statute that now cross-refers to Government Code Section 6254, (2) assessing in each instance whether the intent was, or should be, to cross-refer to all CPRA exemptions, and, if so (3) replacing the specific cross-reference with a more general reference to records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the CPRA.\"7 The discussion implementing that decision is shaded in gray on pages 15-16 of the attached draft. In September, the Commission decided that \"[i]nstead of consolidating the provisions in 'Article 1. Law Enforcement Records Generally' into a single code section, the staff should add a new code section to that article, which would state that (1) prior to the recodification, the provisions in the article were in a single subdivision, and (2) dividing the substance of that subdivision into multiple code sections was not intended to affect their construction or relation to each other.\"8 The Commission further decided that the accompanying Comment \"should make clear that courts and others should not draw any conclusions from the lack of similar language elsewhere in the proposed recodification.\"9 In the attached draft, proposed Section 7923.630 and the accompanying Comment would implement those decisions. See also the narrative discussion shaded in gray on pages 9-10 of the attached draft. At the September meeting, the Commission approved the version of proposed Section 7923.615(a) shown on page 42 of Memorandum 2019-47.10 That version mistakenly refers to 6. See Draft Minutes (Sept. 2019), pp. 5-9. 7. Id. at 5; see also id. at 7 (lines 25-30). 8. Id. at 6. 9. Id. 10. See id. at 6-7. - 3 - \"subdivision (a)\" instead of \"paragraph (1).\" The staff corrected that mistake in the attached draft. In September, the Commission directed the staff to add several issues to the list of \"Minor Clean-Up Issues For Possible Future Legislative Attention\" at the end of the Commission's report.11 The additions to that list are shaded in gray on pages 211-12 of the attached draft. Are these revisions acceptable to the Commission? It was also necessary to update the proposed recodification to incorporate legislation enacted in 2019. That process is discussed next. INCORPORATION OF NEW LEGISLATION Using Legislative Counsel's table of sections affected, the staff found a number of bills enacted in 2019 that revise provisions in the CPRA. The affected provisions are: Section 6253. This section was amended by AB 1819 (Committee on Judiciary), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 695, \u00a7 1. Section 6253.21. This section was added to the CPRA by SB 75 (Committee on Budget & Fiscal Review), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 51, \u00a7 64. That was a bill relating to the budget, so it became effective immediately. Later, newly-enacted Section 6253.21 was amended by AB 378 (Lim\u00f3n), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 385, \u00a7 28. Section 6254. This section was amended by SB 94 (Committee on Budget & Fiscal Review), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 25, \u00a7 1. That was a bill relating to the budget, so it became effective immediately. Later, Section 6254 was amended by two more bills: (1) AB 378 (Lim\u00f3n), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 385, \u00a7 29, and (2) AB 991 (Gallagher), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 497, \u00a7 130. The latter was the annual maintenance of the codes bill, consisting entirely of stylistic and technical corrections. It included a subordination clause (2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 497, \u00a7 334), which means that the revisions made by AB 378 will take effect, not the revisions made by AB 991. See Section 9605. Section 6254.18. This section was amended by AB 1622 (Carrillo), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 632, \u00a7 5. Section 6254.26. This section was amended by AB 857 (Chiu), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 442, \u00a7 8. Section 6254.35. This section was added to the CPRA by AB 857 (Chiu), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 442, \u00a7 9. 11. See id. at 7 (lines 14-18, 20-24), 8 (lines 19-34); see also Memorandum 2017-47, pp. 59-60 (discussing proposed Section 7929.420); First Supplement to Memorandum 2019-47, p. 2 (consent items); Draft Minutes (Sept. 2019), p. 5 (approval of consent items). - 4 - Section 6259. This section was amended by AB 991 (Gallagher), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 497, \u00a7 131. Section 6276.18. This section was amended by SB 251 (Committee on Banking & Financial Institutions), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 143, \u00a7 64. In general, it was obvious how to incorporate these new enactments into the proposed recodification. Where the staff made such revisions, we included a boxed Note referring to the newly-enacted legislation.12 Those Notes would be included in the final recommendation, to alert readers to the changes made in 2019. In a few instances, the staff had to exercise some discretion in deciding where to place newly-enacted material. In particular: AB 1819 (Committee on Judiciary) added two new paragraphs to Section 6253, to make clear that members of the public are entitled to copy a public record on the premises of a public agency at no charge. The staff inserted those new paragraphs into proposed Section 7922.530 (copy of public record). SB 75 (Committee on Budget & Fiscal Review) added and AB 378 (Lim\u00f3n) amended Section 6253.21, which governs disclosure of records relating to a family childcare provider, as defined in Education Code Section 8431(b). The staff decided to recodify that new provision in \"Chapter 9. Miscellaneous Public Records\" as proposed Section 7927.305. It did not seem to fit in any of the other categories in Part 5 of the proposed recodification. Another alternative would be to create a new chapter entitled \"Family\" and put the new provision in that chapter. That would require extensive renumbering, which would only be worth doing if it is reasonable to anticipate that the Legislature will add more family-related exemptions in the future and the best location for those exemptions will be the CPRA itself rather than the Family Code. AB 857 (Chiu) added Section 6254.35, governing disclosure of records of a public bank and related decisions of the bank's directors, officers, and managers. The staff decided to recodify that provision in \"Chapter 16. Regulation of Financial Institutions and Securities\" as proposed Section 7929.010. Are these drafting decisions acceptable to the Commission? In addition to incorporating the above-described legislation, the staff checked every code section listed in the CPRA's alphabetical index of exemptions 12. See the Notes the attached draft. See also the Notes accompanying proposed Sections 7923.615 and 7923.620, regarding incorporation of technical corrections made by AB 991 (Gallagher), but chaptered out due to the subordination clause in that bill. - 5 - (Sections 6275-6276.48), to see whether it was revised in 2019, and, if so, whether any corresponding revisions of the alphabetical index in the proposed recodification were necessary. In the process, we spotted the following problems: Section 6276.04 includes an entry for \"Artificial insemination, donor not natural father, confidentiality of records, Section 7613, Family Code.\" That entry is obsolete because Family Code Section 7613 no longer says anything about confidentiality of records.13 The staff therefore deleted that entry from proposed Section 7930.110 (the proposed recodification of Section 6276.04) and explained the deletion in the accompanying Comment. Section 6276.12 contains an entry for \"Controlled substance offenders, confidentiality of registration information, Section 11594, Health and Safety Code.\" In this year's legislative session, Health and Safety Code Section 11594 was repealed and added.14 The newly-added provision includes a confidentiality requirement similar to the one in the repealed provision. Accordingly, the staff left the entry as is in proposed Section 7930.130 (the proposed recodification of Section 6276.12) and inserted a Note explaining the situation. Section 6276.12 also contains an entry for \"Criminal offender record information, access to, Sections 11076 and 13202, Penal Code.\" In this year's legislative session, Penal Code Section 13202 was amended to include a sunset clause, which would repeal the provision on July 1, 2020.15 In addition, a new version of Penal Code Section 13202 was added to the codes, with an operative date of July 1, 2020.16 Although there are now two versions of Penal Code Section 13202, they contain similar language regarding confidentiality and one of them would be repealed by its own terms before the operative date of the Commission's proposed recodification. Thus, proposed Section 7930.130 (like existing Section 6276.12) would simply refer to Penal Code Section 13202. An accompanying Note would explain the situation. Section 6276.14 includes an entry for: \"Dairy Council of California, confidentiality of ballots, Section 64155, Food and Agricultural Code.\" In this year's legislative session, Food and Agricultural Code Section 64155 was amended.17 The new version does not contain any language about confidentiality of ballots; that language was moved to a new code provision (Food and Agricultural Code Section 64323).18 Thus, proposed Section 7930.135 (the recodification of Section 6276.14) would refer to Food 13. Compare 2013 Cal. Stat. ch. 510, \u00a7 5, with 2015 Cal. Stat. ch. 566, \u00a7 1. 14. See 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 580, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 (AB 1261 (Jones-Sawyer)). 15. See Cal.

Stat. ch. 304, \u00a7 118 (AB 590 (Mathis)). - 6 - and Agricultural Code Section 64323, instead of Food and Agricultural Code Section 64155. The accompanying Comment would explain the situation. Section 6276.19 includes an entry for: \"Fur dealer licensee, confidentiality of records, Section 4041, Fish and Game Code. That entry is obsolete because the whole article on licensing of fur dealers was repealed by a recently-enacted bill.19 The staff therefore deleted that entry from proposed Section 7930.145 (the proposed recodification of Section 6276.19) and explained the deletion in the accompanying Comment. Many other code sections in the CPRA index were also revised in 2019, but not in a manner relevant to how they are described in the index.20 Because we were curious, the staff also tried to determine whether the Legislature had enacted any new exemptions (aside from the ones discussed above) that belong in the CPRA index. Any bill limiting the state constitutional right of access to public records must include legislative findings supporting that limitation,21 so we searched the 2019 legislation for the phrase \"right of access.\" We found a surprising number of new (or newly-revised) provisions located outside the CPRA that might warrant inclusion in the CPRA index.22 Consistent with the Commission's prior decision not to attempt to update the CPRA index in the course of this study,23 the staff did not add any of those provisions to the proposed recodification of that index (proposed Sections 7930.000-7930.215). As previously discussed, such revisions could be made in a future bill, as part of a comprehensive effort to update the index.24 Does the Commission agree with the decisions that the staff made when redrafting the recodification of the CPRA index? OTHER REVISIONS In addition to the revisions discussed above, the staff made routine changes to convert a tentative recommendation into a draft of a final recommendation. 19. See 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 216, \u00a7 11 (AB 273 (Gonzalez). 20. See, e.g., Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 30; Fam. Code \u00a7 3111; Labor Code \u00a7 432.7. 21. See Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 3. 22.

See Minutes (May 2019), pp. 3-4; see also Memorandum 2019-44, pp. 40-41, 47-48; Draft Minutes (Sept. 2019), p. 4. - 7 - We also made various formatting changes, corrections, and other technical revisions. The following revisions are more significant: Part 4 of the proposed recodification concerns enforcement of the rights established by the CPRA. In the tentative recommendation, Chapter 2 of that Part was entitled \"Procedure.\" To more clearly identify the content of that chapter and differentiate it from the material in \"Part 3. Procedures and Related Matters\" (which specifies procedures for requesting a public record and responding to such a request), the staff relabeled it \"Enforcement Procedure.\"25 In the tentative recommendation, Chapter 7 of Part 5 of the proposed recodification was entitled \"Library Records.\" As discussed at pages 52-55 of Memorandum 2019-47, however, it seems likely that courts would construe existing Section 6254(j) (proposed Section 7927.100) to encompass museum materials in addition to library records. To account for that possibility without affecting the construction of the provision in question, and to afford latitude for future expansion of the chapter regardless of how that provision is construed, the staff relabeled the chapter \"Library Records and Similar Matters.\"26 In the tentative recommendation, Chapter 8 of Part 5 of the proposed recodification was entitled \"Litigation Records.\" In the attached draft, the staff relabeled that chapter \"Litigation Records and Similar Matters\" because proposed Section 7927.200 (recodifying Section 6254(b)) encompasses records relating to claims under the Government Claims Act that might not result in litigation. Proposed Section 7927.700 (recodifying Section 6254(c)) governs disclosure of personnel, medical, and similarly private files. The accompanying Comment refers to some other laws that protect personal privacy. In the attached draft, the staff added a reference to California's constitutional right of privacy. Are these revisions acceptable to the Commission? APPROVAL OF A FINAL RECOMMENDATION After considering the issues discussed above and any other points that come to its attention, the Commission needs to decide whether to approve the attached draft as a final recommendation (with or without revisions), for publication and submission to the Legislature and the Governor. 25. Emphasis added. 26. Emphasis added. - 8 - If the Commission decides to approve a final recommendation at the upcoming meeting, it will be well-situated to seek enactment of the proposed legislation in 2020. If the Commission does not approve a final recommendation until December, it might still be possible to seek enactment in 2020, but that would be harder. Respectfully submitted, Barbara Gaal Chief Deputy Counsel #G-400 STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION STAFF DRAFT RECOMMENDATION California Public Records Act Clean-Up November 2019 California Law Revision Commission c/o UC Davis School of Law Davis, CA 95616 650-494-1335 <commission@clrc.ca.gov> SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATION The California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") was enacted in 1968 to promote public access to public records, while also recognizing competing interests. In enacting the CPRA, the Legislature, \"mindful of the right of individuals to privacy,\" found and declared that \"access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.\" Since its enactment, the CPRA has been revised over and over again, in piecemeal fashion. This has resulted in a statute that is poorly organized and cumbersome for members of the public to use and understand, impeding fulfillment of the goals underlying the CPRA. To address that problem, the Legislature asked the Law Revision Commission to study the CPRA on a priority basis and prepare a report containing recommended legislation that would make the CPRA more user-friendly, without changing its substance. More specifically, the Legislature asked the Commission to develop legislation that would: (1) Reduce the length and complexity of current sections. (2) Avoid unnecessary cross-references. (3) Neither expand nor contract the scope of existing exemptions to the general rule that records are open to the public pursuant to the current provisions of the CPRA. (4) To the extent compatible with (3), use terms with common definitions. (5) Organize the existing provisions in such a way that similar provisions are located in close proximity to one another. (6) Eliminate duplicative provisions. (7) Clearly express legislative intent without any change in the substantive provisions. The Commission studied the CPRA as directed and this is the requested report. In preparing it, the Commission took great care to ensure that the proposed recodification of the CPRA would not make any substantive change in the law. This recommendation was prepared pursuant to Resolution Chapter 158 of the Statutes of 2018. STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 1 - CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CLEAN-UP In 2016, the Legislature directed the Law Revision Commission to conduct a 1 strictly nonsubstantive clean-up of the California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\")1 2 and related provisions. The Legislature requested that the Commission complete 3 this work \"as soon as possible, considering the Commission's preexisting duties 4 and workload demands ....\"2 As requested, this recommendation presents a 5 proposed recodification of the CPRA to make it more user-friendly, without 6 changing its substance. 7 The history and purposes of the CPRA are discussed briefly below, followed by 8 a discussion of the history and purposes of this study. The Commission then 9 describes the general character and noteworthy features of the proposed 10 recodification, as well as the methodology used in preparing it. 11 Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the 12 Government Code. 13 History and Purposes of the CPRA 14 The CPRA was enacted in 1968 to promote public access to public records, 15 while also recognizing competing interests.3 In enacting the CPRA, the 16 Legislature, \"mindful of the right of individuals to privacy,\" found and declared 17 that \"access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business is a 18 fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.\"4 19 \"[P]eople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, 20 but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.\"5 The 21 CPRA thus serves \"a crucial function.\"6 As the California Supreme Court has 22 explained: 23 Implicit in the democratic process is the notion that government should be 24 accountable for its actions. In order to verify accountability, individuals must 25 have access to government files. Such access permits checks against the arbitrary 26 exercise of official power and secrecy in the political process.7 27 1. Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48. 2. 2016 Cal.

Rptr. 3d 693 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 2 - Although public access to public records is of great importance, it must 1 sometimes yield to a competing interest.8 Thus, the CPRA \"contains numerous 2 exemptions to the requirement of public disclosure, many of which are designed to 3 protect individual privacy.\" 9 Under the CPRA, the public \"is entitled to inspect 4 public records unless one of the exemptions ... applies.\"10 5 The CPRA thus strikes \"a careful balance\" between the right of public access 6 and competing considerations.11 Since its enactment, the Legislature has 7 continually refined that balance, adjusting the statutory scheme over and over 8 again in an incremental manner as new issues surfaced.12 9 Due to the piecemeal nature of these repeated reforms, the CPRA has developed 10 into a complicated tangle of statutory provisions. In its present form, it is hard for 11 users (especially non-lawyers) to comprehend and follow, and hard for the 12 Legislature to place new material where it logically belongs. 13 Here are a few illustrations: 14 Instead of being grouped together, provisions with the same subject matter 15 are sometimes separated in ways that can make key material hard to find. 16 For example, Section 6254(f) is a long and complicated exemption 17 pertaining to law enforcement records, with multiple caveats, qualifications, 18 exceptions, and exceptions to the exceptions. Sections 6254.30 and 6262 19 clarify aspects of Section 6254(f), but they are not referenced in, or located 20 in proximity to, Section 6254(f).13 21 8.

Rptr. 3d 183 (2006) (Judicial decisions interpreting CPRA \"seek to balance the public right to access to information, the government's need, or lack of need, to preserve confidentiality, and the individual's right to privacy.\"). The statutory balancing of competing interests in the CPRA is similar to the interplay between two sometimes conflicting provisions of the California Constitution: the people's right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 3) and the right of privacy (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1). See, e.g., City of San Jose, 2 Cal. 5th at 616 (\"Similarly, while the Constitution provides for public access, it does not supersede or modify existing privacy rights.\"); Commission on Peace Officer Standards & Training, 42 Cal. 4th at 288 (comparing balancing in California Constitution with balancing in CPRA). 12. See, e.g., Assembly Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 148 (April 19, 2016), p. 3 (\"Since the enactment of the CPRA, it has been amended multiple times to exempt certain records.\"); Senate Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 148 (June 14, 2016), p. 4 (referring to \"nearly 50 years of amendments to the CPRA\"). 13. Similarly, Section 6254(l) is a CPRA exemption for \"[c]orrespondence of and to the Governor or employees of the Governor's office or in the custody of or maintained by the Governor's Legal Affairs Secretary.\" Sections 6268 and 6268.5 also concern access to the Governor's records, but they are not referenced in, or located in proximity to, Section 6254(l). STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 3 - Other CPRA provisions are buried amongst unrelated material. Section 1 6254.7(c), governing records of a housing or building violation, is a good 2 example. It could easily be overlooked, because it is located in the middle of 3 Section 6254.7, surrounded by pollution-related material. 4 To place new material where it seemed to belong, the Legislature has at 5 times resorted to unsystematic decimal numbering (e.g., Sections 6254.1, 6 6254.10, 6254.4.5). This is potentially confusing, because it is difficult to 7 determine the proper sequence of those code sections and thus can be 8 difficult to find them. 9 At other times, the Legislature has added new material on a subject to an 10 already overlong statute that addresses the same subject and other topics. 11 This necessitates cumbersome labeling, such as Section 6254(f)(4)(B)(ii)(I). 12 Such labeling makes it hard for CPRA users to readily refer to the material 13 in question. 14 Problems like these impede fulfillment of the purposes underlying the CPRA. 15 History and Purposes of the Commission's Study 16 In 2016, the Legislature recognized and decided to address the problems 17 described above. That year, Assembly Member Chau authored the biennial 18 legislative resolution regarding topics assigned to the Commission for study. At 19 the request of the Assembly Committee on Judiciary, he included the following 20 new study in the resolution: 21 Resolved, That the Legislature authorizes and requests that the California Law 22 Revision Commission study, report on, and prepare recommended legislation as 23 soon as possible, considering the commission's preexisting duties and workload 24 demands, concerning ... revision of the ... California Public Records Act and 25 related provisions, and that this legislation shall accomplish all of the following 26 objectives: 27 (1) Reduce the length and complexity of current sections. 28 (2) Avoid unnecessary cross-references. 29 (3) Neither expand nor contract the scope of existing exemptions to the general 30 rule that records are open to the public pursuant to the current provisions of the 31 Public Records Act. 32 (4) To the extent compatible with (3), use terms with common definitions. 33 (5) Organize the existing provisions in such a way that similar provisions are 34 located in close proximity to one another. 35 (6) Eliminate duplicative provisions. 36 (7) Clearly express legislative intent without any change in the substantive 37 provisions ....14 38 An analysis for the Assembly Committee on Judiciary explained the need for 39 such a study: 40 14. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)); see also 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)). STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 4 - The CPRA, signed into law in 1968 as a general record keeping law, allows the 1 public to monitor government activity. Since the enactment of the CPRA, it has 2 been amended multiple times to exempt certain records. ... Due to the multiple 3 changes to the statute, the CPRA has become difficult for the public to 4 understand.15 5 Similarly, an analysis for the Senate Committee on Judiciary explained: 6 Because of nearly 50 years of amendments to the CPRA, the CPRA has become 7 more difficult to understand. Making it easier for the public to understand their 8 rights to access government information will arguably lead to more access to 9 public records and more government accountability.16 10 The Legislature passed the resolution near the end of the legislative session 11 without anyone voting against it. Soon afterwards, the Commission began 12 examining the CPRA as requested. 13 Scope of Study 14 As originally introduced, the legislative resolution instructed the Commission to 15 \"study, report on, and prepare recommended legislation ... concerning the revision 16 of the portions of the Government Code relating to public records ....\"17 It was not 17 clear whether the study was to encompass all Government Code provisions 18 relating to public records, or only those relating to inspection of public records. It 19 was also uncertain at best whether the Commission could examine any related 20 provisions located outside the Government Code, such as statutes that cross-refer 21 to the CPRA. 22 Later, however, the resolution was amended to instruct the Commission to 23 \"study, report on, and prepare recommended legislation ... concerning the revision 24 of ... the California Public Records Act and related provisions ....\"18 Given this 25 amendment, the Commission's authority appears to be limited to public records 26 inspection law, not other aspects of public records law (e.g., laws governing 27 retention of public records19 or criminalizing conduct relating to public records20). 28 Importantly, however, the Commission's authority does not appear to be 29 restricted to the Government Code. Rather, the Commission may examine 30 15. Assembly Committee on Judiciary Analysis of ACR 148 (April 19, 2016), p. 3 (emphasis added). 16.

STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 5 - provisions located elsewhere, so long as they relate to the CPRA. The Commission 1 is thus authorized not only to prepare a recodification of the CPRA, but also to 2 recommend conforming revisions of the many statutes throughout the codes that 3 cross-refer to the CPRA. 4 Whether the Commission is authorized to go beyond conforming revisions and 5 suggest additional clean-up of record inspection laws other than the CPRA (e.g., 6 the Richard McKee Transparency Act of 201121) is not obvious from the language 7 of the resolution requesting this study. To move the study forward promptly, and 8 keep any resulting legislation manageable in size, the Commission did not do so. 9 Nonsubstantive Reform 10 In directing the Commission to study the CPRA, the Legislature said that the 11 Commission's recommended legislation should \"[c]learly express legislative 12 intent without any change in the substantive provisions\" and \"[n]either expand 13 nor contract the scope of existing exemptions to the general rule that records are 14 open to the public pursuant to the current provisions of the Public Records Act.\"22 15 The Legislature thus made clear that the Commission's work was to be entirely 16 nonsubstantive in nature. 17 The Commission took extreme care to abide by that limitation in preparing this 18 recommendation. The specific measures it took to prevent any substantive change 19 are described below. 20 Objective and Participatory Study Process 21 The Commission's study process is well-suited to the development of a 22 nonsubstantive reform of the CPRA, for the following reasons: 23 The Commission is neutral and objective, with a long history of nonpartisan 24 statutory reforms.23 25 The Commission is experienced in drafting legislation to recodify a complex 26 body of law without substantive change.24 27 The Commission actively solicits input from affected individuals and 28 interest groups. It carefully considers each comment and often makes 29 revisions in response to concerns raised. 30 21. Sections 92950-92961. 22. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (emphasis added). 23. For a listing of reforms that have been enacted on the Commission's recommendation, see the most recent version of its Annual Report (available at www.clrc.ca.gov). 24. See, e.g., Nonsubstantive Reorganization of Deadly Weapon Statutes, 38 Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports 217 (2009) (enacted as 2010 Cal. Stat. chs. 178 & 711, with support from both gun control and gun rights groups); Civil Discovery: Nonsubstantive Reform, 33 Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports 789 (2003) (enacted as 2004 Cal. Stat. ch. 182, without any \"no\" votes). STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 6 - In proposing a statutory reform, the Commission prepares a thorough report 1 that explains the purpose and effect of the reform. The report also includes a 2 complete draft of the proposed legislation and accompanying commentary, a 3 detailed table of contents, and a table showing the disposition of every 4 affected section. This report facilitates public review of the proposed 5 reform. 6 The Commission's work is transparent. All materials are publicly 7 distributed. All deliberations are conducted at open public meetings.25 8 Commission Comments 9 In preparing a recommendation, the Commission drafts an explanatory 10 \"Comment\" for every section that is added, amended, or repealed.26 A Comment 11 indicates the derivation of the section and often explains its relation to other law. 12 Virtually every Comment in this recommendation expressly states that a 13 proposed new code section continues an existing code section \"without substantive 14 change.\"27 That is important because upon enactment of the Commission's 15 recommendation, the Comment will become a key aid in determining legislative 16 intent. 17 On completion of its recommendation, the Commission will present the full 18 recommendation, including the Comments, to the Legislature and the Governor. 19 When a bill is introduced to implement the recommendation, the Commission will 20 provide the full recommendation to each member of every policy committee that 21 reviews the bill. 22 Commission materials that have been placed before and considered by the 23 Legislature are considered evidence of legislative intent,28 and are entitled to great 24 weight in construing statutes.29 The materials are a key interpretive aid for 25 25. For a more thorough description of the Commission's study process, see CLRC Staff Memorandum 2012-1; B. Gaal, Evidence Legislation in California, 36 Sw. U. L. Rev. 561 (2008); see also http://www.clrc.ca.gov/Menu5_about/process.html. 26. In the proposed legislation presented in this recommendation, the Comment for each proposed code section appears immediately after the code section. 27. For example, the Comment to proposed Section 7921.705 states that it \"continues former Section 6264 without substantive change.\" The Comment refers to the existing provision as \"former Section 6264\" (rather than \"Section 6264\") because the Comment would be used after enactment of the proposed law and repeal of the existing version of the CPRA. 28. See, e.g., Fair v. Bakhtiari, 40 Cal. 4th 189, 195, 147 P.3d 653, 51 Cal. Rptr. 3d 871 (2006) (\"The Commission's official comments are deemed to express the Legislature's intent.\"); People v.

STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 7 - practitioners as well as courts,30 and courts may judicially notice and rely on 1 them.31 Courts at all levels of the state32 and federal33 judicial systems use 2 Commission materials to construe statutes enacted on Commission 3 recommendation.34 4 The Commission's Comments to the proposed legislation in this study will thus 5 help to demonstrate that the legislation constitutes a purely nonsubstantive 6 recodification of the CPRA. 7 Statements of Legislative Intent 8 The proposed law would be known as the \"CPRA Recodification Act of 9 2020.\"35 It includes several codified provisions that would expressly state the 10 purpose and effect of the recodification. 11 Proposed Section 7920.100 is a general statement regarding the nonsubstantive 12 effect of the recodification: 13 7920.100. Nothing in the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is intended to 14 substantively change the law relating to inspection of public records. The act is 15 intended to be entirely nonsubstantive in effect. Every provision of this division 16 and every other provision of this act, including, without limitation, every cross-17 reference in every provision of the act, shall be interpreted consistent with the 18 nonsubstantive intent of the act. 19 30.

STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 8 - Proposed Section 7920.105 would make clear that a provision of the proposed 1 law is intended as a restatement and continuation of the provision that it restates, 2 rather than a new enactment, and that any reference to a restated provision is 3 deemed to include a reference to the section that restates it (and vice versa): 4 7920.105. (a) A provision of this division, or any other provision of the CPRA 5 Recodification Act of 2020, insofar as it is substantially the same as a previously 6 existing provision relating to the same subject matter, shall be considered as a 7 restatement and continuation thereof and not as a new enactment. 8 (b) A reference in a statute to a previously existing provision that is restated and 9 continued in this division, or in any other provision of the CPRA Recodification 10 Act of 2020, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed a reference to the 11 restatement and continuation. 12 (c) A reference in a statute to a provision of this division, or any other provision 13 of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which is substantially the same as a 14 previously existing provision, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed to 15 include a reference to the previously existing provision. 16 Another provision (proposed Section 7920.110) would make clear that 17 restatement of an existing CPRA provision is not intended to have any effect, 18 positive or negative, on a judicial interpretation of the restated provision: 19 7920.110. (a) A judicial decision interpreting a previously existing provision is 20 relevant in interpreting any provision of this division, or any other provision of 21 the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and continues that 22 previously existing provision. 23 (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, the Legislature 24 has not evaluated the correctness of any judicial decision interpreting a provision 25 affected by the act. 26 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended to, and does not, 27 reflect any assessment of any judicial decision interpreting any provision affected 28 by the act. 29 Proposed Section 7920.115 sets forth similar rules with respect to an interpretation 30 advanced in an Attorney General opinion, because such opinions are particularly 31 common and influential in this area of the law. 32 Lastly, proposed Section 7920.120 would make clear that restatement of a 33 CPRA provision is not intended to have any effect, positive or negative, on a 34 judicial decision or Attorney General opinion on the constitutionality of the 35 restated provision: 36 7920.120. (a) A judicial decision or Attorney General opinion on the 37 constitutionality of a previously existing provision is relevant in determining the 38 constitutionality of any provision of this division, or any other provision of the 39 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and continues that previously 40 existing provision. 41 (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, the Legislature 42 has not evaluated the constitutionality of any provision affected by the act, or the 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 9 - correctness of any judicial decision or Attorney General opinion on the 1 constitutionality of any provision affected by the act. 2 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended to, and does not, 3 reflect any determination of the constitutionality of any provision affected by the 4 act. 5 The provisions discussed above would establish that enactment of the proposed 6 recodification should not be viewed as acquiescence in any court case or Attorney 7 General opinion construing the CPRA, or as an indication that the Legislature 8 assessed the constitutionality of each recodified section in enacting the 9 recodification. The proposed law would take no stand and have no effect on such 10 matters. 11 In addition to these codified statements of legislative intent, the proposed 12 legislation includes an uncodified provision that sets forth the following legislative 13 findings: 14 This act would recodify the California Public Records Act (Sections 6250 to 15 6276.48, inclusive, of the Government Code) in a more user-friendly manner 16 without changing its substance, and make conforming revisions. Consistent with 17 subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the 18 Legislature finds and declares: 19 (1) This act continues the existing substantive balance between the public's 20 right of access to information concerning the conduct of public business and 21 competing interests. This act does not impose any new limitation on the public's 22 right of access, which would require findings demonstrating the interest protected 23 by the new limitation and the need for protecting that interest. 24 (2) By making the California Public Records Act more user-friendly, this act 25 furthers the public's right of access to information concerning the conduct of 26 public business. 27 These legislative findings would further reinforce the nonsubstantive nature of the 28 reform. 29 Conservative Drafting 30 In preparing this recommendation, the Commission used a conservative drafting 31 approach. It stuck closely to the existing statutory text, to further minimize the risk 32 of a substantive change. 33 The Commission was especially cautious with Section 6254(f), the exemption 34 pertaining to law enforcement records. Although that provision is particularly 35 complex and difficult to understand, the Commission refrained from attempting to 36 rephrase it more clearly.36 Instead, to avoid generating concerns about a 37 substantive change, the proposed legislation would relocate the substance of 38 36. Similarly, the Commission refrained from addressing the apparently minor substantive issues that are listed at the end of its report in \"Appendix B. Minor Clean-Up Issues for Possible Future Legislative Attention.\" STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 10 - Section 6254(f) in a new article almost verbatim.37 A provision at the end of the 1 article would expressly state that (1) before recodification, the provisions in the 2 article were located in a single subdivision, and (2) dividing the substance of those 3 provisions into multiple code sections was not intended to affect their construction 4 or relation to each other.38 An adjacent article would contain the substance of the 5 related provisions previously mentioned (Sections 6254.30 and 6262).39 6 Legislative Process 7 After the Commission completes its study process and issues a final 8 recommendation, the proposed law would be scrutinized carefully in the 9 legislative process, just like any other bill. This would serve as a final safeguard 10 against any substantive change in the law. 11 Drafting Approach 12 As discussed above, the Commission used a conservative drafting approach in 13 preparing this recommendation. Other significant drafting techniques and 14 decisions are described below. 15 Location of the Proposed Law 16 The CPRA is currently codified as \"Chapter 3.5. Inspection of Public Records\" 17 in \"Division 7. Miscellaneous\" in \"Title 1. General\" in the Government Code. It is 18 divided into two articles: 19 \"Article 1. General Provisions,\"40 which contains the heart of the CPRA. 20 \"Article 2. Other Exemptions from Disclosure,\"41 which contains a list of 21 CPRA exemptions (\"the CPRA index\"), most of which are located outside 22 the CPRA. 23 To effectively reorganize the CPRA, it would be helpful to be able to divide the 24 material now in \"Article 1. General Provisions\" into various subcategories, placing 25 similar provisions together. That would further the legislative objective to 26 \"[o]rganize the existing provisions in such a way that similar provisions are 27 located in close proximity to one another.\"42 28 37. See proposed Sections 7923.600-7923.625 infra. 38. See proposed Section 7923.630 infra. 39. See proposed Sections 7923.650-7923.655 infra. 40. Sections 6250-6270.7. 41.

STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 11 - In the hierarchy of the Government Code, an article is the lowest level heading 1 used to organize code sections. Because an article cannot be further subdivided, it 2 would be difficult to effectively reorganize the CPRA in its current code location. 3 Instead, the proposed law would repeal the existing CPRA and recodify its 4 substance in a new division (Division 10) of Title 1 of the Government Code. This 5 would make it possible to divide that material into parts,43 chapters, and articles \u2014 6 enough subcategories to create a user-friendly organizational scheme.44 7 Structure of the Proposed Law 8 New Division 10 would be divided into six parts, as follows: 9 Part 1. General Provisions. 10 Part 2. Disclosure and Exemptions Generally. 11 Part 3. Procedures and Related Matters. 12 Part 4. Enforcement. 13 Part 5. Specific Types of Public Records. 14 Part 6. Other Exemptions From Disclosure. 15 The content of each part is described briefly below. 16 Proposed \"Part 1. General Provisions\"45 consists of two chapters. \"Chapter 1. 17 Preliminary Provisions\" includes the short title of the law,46 the statements of 18 legislative intent described above,47 and a few other preliminary provisions.48 19 \"Chapter. 2. Definitions\" consists of some definitions that apply to the entire 20 CPRA.49 That chapter also includes (1) the definition of \"elected or appointed 21 official,\" which is used in a CPRA-wide definition,50 and (2) a definition of 22 \"former Section 6254 provisions,\" which will provide a convenient means of 23 collectively referring to the material that is currently located in Section 6254 (an 24 unmanageably long section) but would be split up in the recodification.51 The 25 definitions in \"Chapter 2. Definitions\" would be in alphabetical order. The other 26 43. There is precedent for using \"part\" as a subheading within the Government Code. See \"Division 3.6. Claims and Actions Against Public Entities and Public Employees\" (Sections 810-998.3). 44. In deciding to relocate the CPRA, the Commission noted that the CPRA is currently located near several other chapters that pertain to public records (see Chapters 3, 3.01, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 of Division 7 of Title 1). To alert CPRA users to that material, the Commission's Comment to the introductory provision in new Division 10 would refer each of those chapters. See proposed Section 7920.000 Comment infra. 45.

See proposed Section 7920.500 infra. 51. See proposed Section 7920.505 infra. STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 12 - definitions used in the CPRA have limited application and would remain in close 1 proximity to the substantive material to which they pertain.52 2 Proposed \"Part 2. Disclosure and Exemptions Generally\"53 consists of three 3 chapters. \"Chapter 1. Right of Access to Public Records\" contains the legislative 4 findings and declarations for the CPRA.54 The chapter also contains some 5 restrictions on an agency's ability to transfer a public record or otherwise 6 relinquish control over its disclosure.55 \"Chapter 2. General Rules Governing 7 Disclosure\"56 and \"Chapter 3. General Rules Governing Exemptions from 8 Disclosure\"57 contain material corresponding to their respective titles. Among 9 other things, the CPRA catch-all exemption (existing Section 6255(a)) would be in 10 \"Chapter 3. General Rules Governing Exemptions from Disclosure.\"58 11 Proposed \"Part 3. Procedures and Related Matters\"59 contains a chapter on how 12 to request a public record, which is divided into several articles.60 Among other 13 things, the chapter includes the basic rule on inspection of a public record61 and 14 the basic rule on copying of a public record.62 Proposed \"Part 3. Procedures and 15 Related Matters\" also contains a second chapter, which consists of the CPRA's 16 procedural rules governing agency regulations, guidelines, systems, and similar 17 matters.63 18 Proposed \"Part 4. Enforcement\"64 contains provisions relating to enforcement of 19 a CPRA request. It is divided into two chapters: (1) a chapter of general principles 20 relating to enforcement65 and (2) a chapter on the enforcement process, which is 21 further subdivided into an article on petitioning the superior court66 and an article 22 on writ review and contempt.67 23 52. See, e.g., proposed Sections 7924.100 and 7924.105 infra. 53. Proposed Sections 7921.000-7922.210 proposed Section 7921.000 infra (recodifying 55. See proposed 7921.010 infra. 56.

Specific Types of Public Records\"68 consists of provisions 1 (mostly exemptions) that relate to a specific type of public record. It is divided 2 into nineteen different chapters, each addressing a particular subject matter, such 3 as \"Crimes, Weapons, and Law Enforcement\"69 or \"Health Care.\"70 The chapters 4 are arranged in alphabetical order. 5 Lastly, proposed \"Part 6. Other Exemptions From Disclosure\"71 contains the 6 CPRA's alphabetical index of exemptions,72 which is not substantive law but 7 rather a tool designed by the Legislature to assist CPRA users locate exemptions 8 scattered throughout the codes.73 Part 6 would continue that index in essentially its 9 current, alphabetical format.74 The Commission considered but rejected other 10 possibilities,75 such as reorganizing the index by subject matter76 or relocating all 11 of the exemptions into the CPRA (thus separating them from other substantive 12 provisions on the same subject matter).77 13 Numbering System 14 Throughout the proposed legislation, the Commission used a 3-digit decimal 15 system for numbering code sections (e.g., Section 7920.000). The Commission 16 also left gaps in the numbering, to allow ready insertion of new statutory material 17 in an appropriate location if needed in the future. 18 This numbering approach will prevent confusion regarding the proper 19 sequencing of code sections. It will also promote logical, user-friendly 20 organization as the CPRA continues to evolve. 21 68. Proposed Sections 7923.600-7929.610 infra. 69. Proposed Sections 7923.600-7923.805 infra. 70.

The Commission also added an entry for California's constitutional right of privacy (Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1), because it is so fundamental. See proposed Section 7930.100 infra. The Commission did not attempt to find other provisions that should be added to the CPRA index. Such research would be time-consuming and could have significantly delayed the progress of this study. It is not essential at this time, because the index is just a user guide (not substantive law) and does not purport to be exhaustive. See Sections 6275-6276 (proposed Sections 7930.000-7930.005 infra). 75. See CLRC Minutes (April 2019), p. 6. 76. See CLRC Staff Memorandum 2019-25, pp. 6-8 & attached \"Partial Draft of 'Part 6.

STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 14 - Short, Simple Sections 1 The legislative resolution on this study instructs the Commission to \"[r]educe 2 the length and complexity of current sections.\"78 The CPRA currently contains a 3 number of long and complicated sections, most notably Section 6254, which spans 4 many single-spaced pages if printed from the Legislative Counsel's website (over 5 5,500 words), with subdivisions labeled from (a) to (z) followed by (aa) to (ad), 6 some of which are split into paragraphs, subparagraphs, and even unnumbered 7 provisions.79 8 Excessively long sections can obscure relevant details of law, especially if a 9 single section addresses several different subjects. A better approach is to divide 10 the law into a larger number of smaller sections, with each section limited to a 11 single subject. 12 Short sections have numerous advantages. They enhance readability and 13 understanding of the law, and make it easier to locate and refer to pertinent 14 material. In contrast to a long section, a short section can be amended without 15 undue technical difficulties80 and new material can be inserted where logically 16 appropriate, facilitating sound development of the law.81 The use of short sections 17 is the preferred drafting technique of the California Code Commission,82 the 18 Legislature,83 the Legislative Counsel,84 and the Law Revision Commission.85 19 For all of the reasons discussed above, the proposed law would divide lengthy 20 sections into shorter and simpler provisions. The number of sections would 21 approximately double, but the word count would not change that much. 22 78. 2016 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 150 (ACR 148 (Chau)); see also 2018 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 158 (SCR 91 (Roth)) (reaffirming Commission's authority to study CPRA). 79. For the text of Section 6254, see Appendix C. Other, less egregious examples in the CPRA include Sections 6253, 6254.2, 6254.18, and 6254.21. 80. The full text of a section must be set forth in any bill amending the section. Joint Rule 10. A lengthy bill entails higher printing costs than a short one. It also takes longer to review. Much of the material may be unrelated to a proposed reform, wasting reviewers' time and potentially injecting additional issues into a simple proposal. Further, the likelihood that two bills will be introduced to amend the same section is greater if a section is long and covers multiple topics than if a section is short and limited to a single topic. If two bills affect the same section and both are enacted, the bill that is signed last generally prevails over the other bill, rendering it a nullity. Section 9605. This can be avoided by double-jointing the bills or including other language to address the conflict. Taking such steps entails expense and effort, however, and introduces new possibilities for error. 81. In amending a short section, the Legislature is unhampered by constraints such as overlong paragraphs and lack of available subparts. This promotes clear and straightforward drafting, as opposed to confusing and convoluted provisions. 82.

STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 15 - Signposting in Comments 1 In the proposed legislation, the Comment accompanying each code section 2 would refer to other provisions (particularly within the CPRA) that may be of 3 interest to users.86 This would help CPRA users locate material relevant to their 4 situations. 5 Cross-References 6 The CPRA contains numerous internal cross-references. In the proposed 7 legislation, the Commission updated each such cross-reference to reflect the new 8 numbering scheme in the recodification. 9 To facilitate review of the updated cross-references, this recommendation 10 includes two tables, located immediately after the proposed legislation. One table 11 shows the disposition of each existing code section; the other table shows the 12 derivation of each proposed code section. 13 The CPRA also contains numerous cross-references to statutes located outside 14 the CPRA. The Commission checked each of those cross-references, as well as 15 each of the internal cross-references, in preparing this recommendation. 16 A few of the cross-references in the current version of the CPRA are plainly 17 erroneous. Where the proper cross-reference is obvious, the Commission corrected 18 the cross-reference in the proposed legislation, rather than perpetuating the error. 19 The cross-reference corrections are explained in the accompanying Comments; 20 they are also listed and explained in Appendix A. Where the proper cross-21 reference is not altogether obvious, the Commission left the cross-reference alone, 22 so as not to create a risk of a substantive change. 23 There are also many code sections located outside the CPRA that cross-refer to 24 one or more provisions within the CPRA. Those cross-references will also need to 25 be conformed to the new numbering scheme in the recodification. The 26 Commission prepared a separate recommendation with those conforming 27 revisions.87 28 One issue relating to cross-references merits special mention. Within the CPRA, 29 some provisions cross-refer to Section 6254 in its entirety;88 such cross-references 30 also exist elsewhere in the codes.89 In at least some of those instances, the 31 Legislature might have intended to use the cross-reference to Section 6254 32 86. See, e.g., proposed Section 7920.000 Comment & proposed Section 7921.000 Comment infra. 87. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up: Conforming Revisions, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (Nov. 2019). 88. See Sections 6253.1(d)(2) (proposed Section 7922.605(a)), 6254.5 (proposed Section 7923.110(a)). \u00a7\u00a7 \u00a7 186.34; Pub. \u00a7 827.9(a), (h). STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 16 - (sometimes coupled with a cross-reference to another code provision) as a 1 shorthand way of referring to all of the CPRA exemptions generally, or at least all 2 of the exemptions located in the CPRA itself.90 3 That approach may have worked in the past, but Section 6254 no longer contains 4 all (or even almost all) of the CPRA exemptions. Consequently, a cross-reference 5 to \"Section 6254\" is underinclusive and thus imperfect as a means of referring to 6 all of the exemptions codified in the CPRA, much less all of the CPRA 7 exemptions that are sprinkled throughout the codes. 8 The Legislature may therefore wish to: 9 (1) Revisit each statute that cross-refers to Section 6254 (or \"the provisions 10 listed in proposed Section 7920.505\"). 11 (2) Assess in each instance whether the intent was, or should be, to cross-refer 12 to all of the CPRA exemptions. 13 (3) If appropriate, replace the existing cross-reference with a more general 14 reference to records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the CPRA.91 15 Such work might involve some substantive revisions, so the Commission did not 16 undertake it in the course of this study. 17 Recently-Enacted, Pending, and Future Legislation 18 A number of bills affecting substantive provisions of the CPRA were enacted in 19 2019.92 The proposed recodification incorporates that new legislation, as well as 20 recently-enacted legislation affecting some provisions currently listed in the 21 CPRA index.93 22 90. See, e.g., CLRC Staff Memorandum 2019-47, pp. 47-48 (discussing comment on proposed recodification of Section 6259(b)); id. at Exhibit p. 2 (comment of CPRA Committee of City Attorneys' Dep't of League of California Cities on proposed recodification of Section 6259(b) (proposed Section 7923.110)). See also CLRC Staff Memorandum 2019-47, 15-17 (discussing comment on convenient cross-referencing of CPRA exemptions); id. at Exhibit p. 7 (comment of California News Publishers Ass'n on convenient cross-referencing of CPRA exemptions). 91. See generally CLRC Staff Memorandum 2019-47, Exhibit p. 7 (suggestion of California News Publishers Ass'n that \"it may be appropriate to consider whether the Legislature needs to make minor substantive changes to the CPRA, and other laws that reference Section 6254, to instead make a more general reference to records exempt from disclosure pursuant to the CPRA.\"); see also id. at 15-17 (staff analysis of that suggestion). 92. See AB 378 (Lim\u00f3n), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 385, \u00a7\u00a7 28, 29; AB 857 (Chiu), 2019 Cal.

Code \u00a7 64155 & Food & Agric. 1261 (Jones-Sawyer), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 580, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 (repealing STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 7, 2019 - 17 - When a legislator introduces a bill to implement this recommendation, there 1 might be conflicts between that bill and other bills that are pending or 2 subsequently introduced (i.e., two bills might try to revise the same code provision 3 in different ways). If so, the Commission will recommend double-jointing 4 amendments or other steps to eliminate the conflicts and coordinate the bills. 5 Similar steps may be appropriate with regard to a bill that affects a provision listed 6 in the CPRA index. Any such adjustments will be consistent with the 7 nonsubstantive nature of this study. 8 Delayed Operative Date 9 Because of the breadth of the organizational changes that would be made by the 10 proposed legislation, the Commission recommends that it be given a delayed 11 operative date. The proposed legislation includes an uncodified provision to that 12 effect, which would delay the operation of the proposed law by one year (i.e., until 13 January 1, 2022).94 14 This delayed operation would provide time for those who work closely with the 15 affected statutes, including legal publishers, to adjust to the new organizational 16 scheme before it takes effect. The Commission's comments and the disposition 17 and derivation tables in the Commission's report would also help ease the 18 transition. 19 Although the proposed recodification would entail some transitional costs (such 20 as updating manuals and regulations), the Commission believes that the long-term 21 benefits of having a better organized, more user-friendly statutory scheme would 22 soon outweigh those transitional costs. The CPRA would become more readily 23 accessible and understandable to laypersons and other persons using it, thus 24 furthering its underlying purposes. Importantly, the new statutory scheme would 25 also afford ample room for future refinement of the CPRA, promoting sound 26 development of the law. 27 ____________________ & adding Health & Safety Code \u00a7 11594); AB 1331 (Bonta), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 581, 6 (amending, repealing & adding Penal Code \u00a7 13202). Many other provisions in the CPRA index were also revised in 2019, but not in a manner relevant to how they are described in the index. See, e.g., Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 30; Fam. Code \u00a7 3111; Labor Code \u00a7 432.7. Recent legislation also added some new CPRA exemptions to the codes. Consistent with its general approach to the CPRA index, the Commission did not incorporate those new exemptions into the index. That could be done in a follow-up study comprehensively updating the index. See supra note 74. 94. In general, a bill passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor becomes operative on January 1 of the year after its enactment. See Cal. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 8(c)(1); Gov't Code \u00a7 9600(a). For a variety of reasons, some bills specify a delayed operative date. See, e.g., Preston v. State Bd. of Equalization, 25 Cal. 4th 197, 223-24, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 407 (2001); Cline v. Lewis, 175 Cal. 315, 318 (1917); Johnston v. Alexis, 153 Cal. App. 3d 33, 40 (1984).

TEXT OF SECTION 6254 ................................................................................................. 213 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 26 - STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 27 - PROPOSED LEGISLATION Note. An official Commission \"Comment\" follows each code section in the proposed 1 recodification. The Comments indicate the source of each recodified code section (or provision 2 within the code section) and describe how the recodified code section (or provision) compares with 3 the law before recodification. Courts have routinely held that the Commission's Comments are 4 evidence of legislative intent with regard to any legislation that implements a Commission 5 recommendation. 6 There is a \"disposition table\" at the end of the proposed recodification. It summarizes, in tabular 7 form, the disposition of every provision of the existing code that has been included in this proposed 8 recodification. 9 There is also a \"derivation table\" at the end of the proposed recodification. It summarizes, in 10 tabular form, the statutory derivation of every new code provision in this proposed recodification. 11 Almost all of the proposed provisions would be located in the Government Code. All references 12 are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated. 13 Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 6250-6276.48 (repealed). California Public Records Act 14 SEC. ___. Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 15 of the Government Code is repealed. 16 Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 7920.000-7930.215 (added). California Public Records Act 17 SEC. ___. Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) is added to Title 1 18 of the Government Code, to read: 19 DIVISION 10. ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS 20 PART 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS 21 CHAPTER 1. PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS 22 Article 1. Short Titles 23 \u00a7 7920.000. California Public Records Act 24 7920.000. This division shall be known and may be cited as the California Public 25 Records Act. 26 Comment. Section 7920.000 continues former Section 6251 without substantive change. The 27 California Public Records Act or \"CPRA\" was formerly codified as Chapter 3.5 (commencing with 28 Section 6250) of Division 7 of this title. 29 For a similar law pertaining to federal agencies, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (\"Freedom of Information 30 Act\" or \"FOIA\"). 31 For a key constitutional provision on \"access to information concerning the conduct of the 32 people's business,\" see Cal. Const. art. I, \u00a7 3(b). For legislative findings and declarations 33 underlying the CPRA, see Section 7921.000. For an alphabetical index of many CPRA exemptions 34 (most of which are located outside the CPRA), see Sections 7930.000-7930.215. 35 For guidance on access to legislative records, see Sections 9070-9080 (\"Legislative Open 36 Records Act\"). For discussion of provisions and doctrines governing access to judicial records, see, 37 e.g., NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court, 20 Cal. 4th 1178, 980 P.2d 337, 86 Cal. 38 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 28 - Rptr. 2d 778 (1999). For a law on access to the records of certain quasi-public entities, see Educ. 1 Code \u00a7\u00a7 72690-72701, 89913-89919, 92950-92961 (Richard McKee Transparency Act). 2 For guidance on record management, see, e.g., Sections 9080 (legislative records), 12220-12237 3 (State Archives), 14740-14746 (State Records Storage Act), 26200-26202.6, 26205-26205.8, 4 26206.7-26206.8 (county records), 34090-34090.8 (city records), 68150-68152 (trial court 5 records). See also Sections 12270-12279 (State Records Management Act). 6 Many other statutes and sources of law govern public records. For instance, the following statutes 7 are located in Division 7 of this title, where the CPRA was formerly codified: Sections 6200-6203 8 (crimes relating to public records, documents and certificates), 6204-6204.4 (public records 9 protection and recovery), 6205-6210 (address confidentiality for victims of domestic violence, 10 sexual assault, and stalking), 6215-6216 (address confidentiality for reproductive health care 11 service providers, employees, volunteers, and patients), 6219 (governmental linguistics). 12 \u00a7 7920.005. CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 13 7920.005. This division recodifies the provisions of former Chapter 3.5 14 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of this title. The act that added this 15 division, and the act that consists of conforming revisions to reflect the addition of 16 this division, shall be known and may be cited as the \"CPRA Recodification Act of 17 2020.\" 18 Comment. Section 7920.005 is new. It provides a convenient means of referring to the 19 recodification of former Sections 6250-6276.48. For background, see California Public Records 20 Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). 21 Article 2. Effect of Recodification 22 \u00a7 7920.100. Nonsubstantive reform 23 7920.100. Nothing in the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is intended to 24 substantively change the law relating to inspection of public records. The act is 25 intended to be entirely nonsubstantive in effect. Every provision of this division and 26 every other provision of this act, including, without limitation, every cross-reference 27 in every provision of the act, shall be interpreted consistent with the nonsubstantive 28 intent of the act. 29 Comment. Section 7920.100 is new. It is modeled on Penal Code Section 16005. It makes clear 30 that the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 has no substantive impact. The act is intended solely to 31 make the California Public Records Act more user-friendly. For background, see California Public 32 Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). 33 For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial decision interpreting a predecessor of a 34 provision in this division, see Section 7920.110. For specific guidance on the impact of an Attorney 35 General opinion interpreting a predecessor of a provision in this division, see Section 7920.115. 36 For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial decision or Attorney General opinion assessing 37 the constitutionality of a predecessor of a provision in this division, see Section 7920.120. 38 See Sections 7920.005 Continuation of existing law 40 7920.105. (a) A provision of this division, or any other provision of the CPRA 41 Recodification Act of 2020, insofar as it is substantially the same as a previously 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 29 - existing provision relating to the same subject matter, shall be considered as a 1 restatement and continuation thereof and not as a new enactment. 2 (b) A reference in a statute to a previously existing provision that is restated and 3 continued in this division, or in any other provision of the CPRA Recodification Act 4 of 2020, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed a reference to the 5 restatement and continuation. 6 (c) A reference in a statute to a provision of this division, or any other provision 7 of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which is substantially the same as a 8 previously existing provision, shall, unless a contrary intent appears, be deemed to 9 include a reference to the previously existing provision. 10 Comment. Section 7920.105 is new. Subdivision (a) is similar to Section 2, which is a standard 11 provision found in many codes. See, e.g., Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 2; Corp. Code \u00a7 2; Code \u00a7 2(a); Veh. Code \u00a7 2. 13 Subdivision (b) is drawn from Section 9604 and Penal Code Section 16010(b). 14 Subdivision (c) is drawn from Family Code Section 2 and Penal Code Section 16010(c). 15 See Section 7920.005 (\"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\"). 16 \u00a7 7920.110. Judicial decision interpreting former law 17 7920.110. (a) A judicial decision interpreting a previously existing provision is 18 relevant in interpreting any provision of this division, or any other provision of the 19 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and continues that previously 20 existing provision. 21 (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, the Legislature 22 has not evaluated the correctness of any judicial decision interpreting a provision 23 affected by the act. 24 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended to, and does not, reflect 25 any assessment of any judicial decision interpreting any provision affected by the 26 act. 27 Comment. Section 7920.110 is new. It is modeled on Penal Code Section 16020. 28 Subdivision (a) makes clear that case law construing a predecessor provision is relevant in 29 construing its successor in the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020. 30 Subdivisions (b) and (c) make clear that in recodifying former Sections 6250-6276.48, the 31 Legislature has not taken any position on any case interpreting any of those provisions. 32 For specific guidance on the impact of an Attorney General opinion interpreting a predecessor 33 of a provision in this division, see Section 7920.115. For specific guidance on the impact of a 34 judicial decision or Attorney General opinion assessing the constitutionality of a predecessor of a 35 provision in this division, see Section 7920.120. For general guidance on the nonsubstantive impact 36 of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, see Section 7920.100. 37 See 7920.005 (\"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\"). 38 \u00a7 7920.115. Attorney General opinion interpreting former law 39 7920.115. (a) An opinion of the Attorney General interpreting a previously 40 existing provision is relevant in interpreting any provision of this division, or any 41 other provision of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and 42 continues that previously existing provision. 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 30 - (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, the Legislature 1 has not evaluated the correctness of any Attorney General opinion interpreting a 2 provision affected by the act. 3 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended to, and does not, reflect 4 any assessment of any Attorney General opinion interpreting any provision affected 5 by the act. 6 Comment. Section 7920.115 is new. It is comparable to Section 7920.110, but it pertains to 7 Attorney General opinions rather than judicial decisions. 8 Subdivision (a) makes clear that Attorney General opinions construing a predecessor provision 9 are relevant in construing its successor in the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020. 10 Subdivisions (b) and (c) make clear that in recodifying former Sections 6250-6276.48, the 11 Legislature has not taken any position on any Attorney General opinion interpreting any of those 12 provisions. 13 For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial decision interpreting a predecessor of a 14 provision in this division, see Section 7920.110. For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial 15 decision or Attorney General opinion assessing the constitutionality of a predecessor of a provision 16 in this division, see Section 7920.120. For general guidance on the nonsubstantive impact of the 17 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, see Section 7920.100. 18 See 7920.005 (\"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\"). 19 \u00a7 7920.120. Constitutionality 20 7920.120. (a) A judicial decision or Attorney General opinion on the 21 constitutionality of a previously existing provision is relevant in determining the 22 constitutionality of any provision of this division, or any other provision of the 23 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, which restates and continues that previously 24 existing provision. 25 (b) However, in enacting the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, the Legislature 26 has not evaluated the constitutionality of any provision affected by the act, or the 27 correctness of any judicial decision or Attorney General opinion on the 28 constitutionality of any provision affected by the act. 29 (c) The CPRA Recodification Act of 2020 is not intended to, and does not, reflect 30 any determination of the constitutionality of any provision affected by the act. 31 Comment. Section 7920.120 is new. It is modeled on Penal Code Section 16025. Due to the 32 prevalence and significant impact of Attorney General opinions on CPRA issues, the section 33 expressly refers to Attorney General opinions as well as judicial decisions. 34 Subdivision (a) makes clear that case law and Attorney General opinions on the constitutionality 35 of a predecessor provision are relevant in determining the constitutionality of its successor in the 36 CPRA Recodification Act of 2020. 37 Subdivisions (b) and (c) make clear that in recodifying former Sections 6250-6276.48, the 38 Legislature has not taken any position on the constitutionality of any of those provisions. 39 For specific guidance on the impact of a judicial decision interpreting a predecessor of a 40 provision in this division, see Section 7920.110. For specific guidance on the impact of an Attorney 41 General opinion interpreting a predecessor of a provision in this division, see Section 7920.115. 42 For general guidance on the nonsubstantive impact of the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, see 43 Section 7920.100. 44 See Section 7920.005 (\"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\"). 45 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 31 - Article 3. Effect of Division 1 \u00a7 7920.200. Effect of division 2 7920.200. The provisions of this division shall not be deemed in any manner to 3 affect the status of judicial records as it existed immediately before the effective 4 date of the provision that is continued in this section, nor to affect the rights of 5 litigants, including parties to administrative proceedings, under the laws of 6 discovery of this state, nor to limit or impair any rights of discovery in a criminal 7 case. 8 Comment. Section 7920.200 continues former Section 6260 without substantive change. 9 Former Section 6260 was enacted in 1968 (see 1968 Cal. Stat. ch. 1473, \u00a7 39) and amended in 10 1976 to insert the phrase \"nor to limit or impair any rights of discovery in a criminal case\" (see 11 1976 Cal. Stat. ch. 314, \u00a7 2).

Video or audio recording relating to critical incident 16 7923.625. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, commencing July 17 1, 2019, a video or audio recording that relates to a critical incident, as defined in 18 subdivision (e), may be withheld only as follows: 19 (a)(1) During an active criminal or administrative investigation, disclosure of a 20 recording related to a critical incident may be delayed for no longer than 45 calendar 21 days after the date the agency knew or reasonably should have known about the 22 incident, if, based on the facts and circumstances depicted in the recording, 23 disclosure would substantially interfere with the investigation, such as by 24 endangering the safety of a witness or a confidential source. If an agency delays 25 disclosure pursuant to this section, the agency shall provide in writing to the 26 requester the specific basis for the agency's determination that disclosure would 27 substantially interfere with the investigation and the estimated date for disclosure. 28 (2) After 45 days from the date the agency knew or reasonably should have known 29 about the incident, and up to one year from that date, the agency may continue to 30 delay disclosure of a recording if the agency demonstrates that disclosure would 31 substantially interfere with the investigation. After one year from the date the 32 agency knew or reasonably should have known about the incident, the agency may 33 continue to delay disclosure of a recording only if the agency demonstrates by clear 34 and convincing evidence that disclosure would substantially interfere with the 35 investigation.

The agency shall reassess withholding and notify the requester every 30 40 days. A recording withheld by the agency shall be disclosed promptly when the 41 specific basis for withholding is resolved. 42 (b)(1) If the agency demonstrates, on the facts of the particular case, that the 43 public interest in withholding a video or audio recording clearly outweighs the 44 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 73 - public interest in disclosure because the release of the recording would, based on 1 the facts and circumstances depicted in the recording, violate the reasonable 2 expectation of privacy of a subject depicted in the recording, the agency shall 3 provide in writing to the requester the specific basis for the expectation of privacy 4 and the public interest served by withholding the recording and may use redaction 5 technology, including blurring or distorting images or audio, to obscure those 6 specific portions of the recording that protect that interest. However, the redaction 7 shall not interfere with the viewer's ability to fully, completely, and accurately 8 comprehend the events captured in the recording and the recording shall not 9 otherwise be edited or altered. 10 (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if the agency demonstrates that the 11 reasonable expectation of privacy of a subject depicted in the recording cannot 12 adequately be protected through redaction as described in paragraph (1) and that 13 interest outweighs the public interest in disclosure, the agency may withhold the 14 recording from the public, except that the recording, either redacted as provided in 15 paragraph (1) or unredacted, shall be disclosed promptly, upon request, to any of 16 the following: 17 (A) The subject of the recording whose privacy is to be protected, or the subject's 18 authorized representative. 19 (B) If the subject is a minor, the parent or legal guardian of the subject whose 20 privacy is to be protected. 21 (C) If the subject whose privacy is to be protected is deceased, an heir, 22 beneficiary, designated immediate family member, or authorized legal 23 representative of the deceased subject whose privacy is to be protected. 24 (3) If disclosure pursuant to paragraph (2) would substantially interfere with an 25 active criminal or administrative investigation, the agency shall provide in writing 26 to the requester the specific basis for the agency's determination that disclosure 27 would substantially interfere with the investigation, and provide the estimated date 28 for the disclosure of the video or audio recording. Thereafter, the recording may be 29 withheld by the agency for 45 calendar days, subject to extensions as set forth in 30 paragraph (2) of subdivision (a). 31 (c) An agency may provide greater public access to video or audio recordings than 32 the minimum standards set forth in this section. 33 (d) For purposes of this section, a peace officer does not include any peace officer 34 employed by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. 35 (e) For purposes of this section, a video or audio recording relates to a critical 36 incident if it depicts any of the following incidents: 37 (1) An incident involving the discharge of a firearm at a person by a peace officer 38 or custodial officer. 39 (2) An incident in which the use of force by a peace officer or custodial officer 40 against a person resulted in death or in great bodily injury. 41 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 74 - (f) This section does not alter, limit, or negate any other rights, remedies, or 1 obligations with respect to public records regarding an incident other than a critical 2 incident as described in subdivision (e). 3 Comment.

Stat. ch. 25, \u00a7 1. 26 \u00a7 7923.630. Rule of construction 27 7923.630. (a) Immediately before the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, the other 28 provisions in this article comprised a single subdivision of former Section 6254 29 (subdivision (f) of Section 29 of Chapter 385 of the Statutes of 2019). 30 (b) Dividing the substance of those provisions into multiple code sections was not 31 intended to affect the construction of those provisions or their relation to each other. 32 Comment. Section 7923.630 is new. It underscores that Sections 7923.600, 7923.605, 7923.610, 33 7923.615, 7923.620, and 7923.625 (the six preceding provisions in this article) derive from a single 34 subdivision and should be construed accordingly. 35 The purpose of this section is to provide useful information where it is particularly needed due 36 to the high volume of matters involving the law enforcement exemption to the California Public 37 Records Act (\"CPRA\"). Courts and others interpreting the CPRA should not draw any inferences 38 from the failure to include similar statutory language elsewhere. 39 See Section 7920.005 (\"CPRA Recodification Act of 2020\"); see also Section 7920.100 40 (nonsubstantive reform). 41 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 75 - Article 2.

INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS 38 \u00a7 7930.000. Legislative intent and instructions 39 7930.000. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature to assist members of the public and 40 state and local agencies in identifying exemptions to the California Public Records 41 Act. It is the intent of the Legislature that, after January 1, 1999, each addition or 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 159 - amendment to a statute that exempts any information contained in a public record 1 from disclosure pursuant to Section 7927.705 shall be listed and described in 2 Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7930.100) pursuant to a bill authorized by a 3 standing committee of the Legislature to be introduced during the first year of each 4 session of the Legislature. 5 (b) The statutes and constitutional provisions listed in Chapter 2 (commencing 6 with Section 7930.100) may operate to exempt certain records, or portions thereof, 7 from disclosure. The statutes and constitutional provisions listed and described may 8 not be inclusive of all exemptions. The listing of a statute or constitutional provision 9 in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7930.100) does not itself create an 10 exemption. Requesters of public records and public agencies are cautioned to review 11 the applicable statute or constitutional provision to determine the extent to which it, 12 in light of the circumstances surrounding the request, exempts public records from 13 disclosure. 14 Comment. Section 7930.000 continues former Section 6275 without substantive change. 15 For additional guidance on using the alphabetical list in the next chapter (Sections 7930.100-16 7930.215), see Section 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California 17 Public Records Act (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-18 7929.610. For the CPRA catch-all exemption, and effect of index 22 7930.005. Records or information not required to be disclosed pursuant to Section 23 7927.705 may include, but shall not be limited to, records or information identified 24 in statutes listed in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 7930.100). 25 Comment. Section 7930.005 continues former Section 6276 without substantive change. 26 For additional guidance on using the alphabetical list in the next chapter (Sections 7930.100-27 7930.215), see Section 7930.000 (legislative intent and instructions).

Section 7930.100 continues former Section 6276.01 and includes a reference to the 38 constitutional right of privacy, which is fundamental in this context (see Section 7921.000). That 39 addition is not a substantive change. The alphabetical list in this chapter is just a user guide, not 40 substantive law. 41 For the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The 42 statutes and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 160 - portions thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in 1 Section 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 2 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 3 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

For 16 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 17 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 18 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 19 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 20 Former Section 6276.02 included an entry for: \"Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, 21 confidentiality of test results of person convicted of prostitution, Section 1202.6, Penal Code.\" That 22 entry is not included in Section 7930.105 because it is obsolete. Penal Code Section 1202.6 was 23 repealed and added in 2017, and the new provision has nothing to do with confidentiality of AIDS 24 test results. See 2017 Cal. Stat. ch. 537, \u00a7 17. 25 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 26 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

Section 7930.110 continues former Section 6276.04 without substantive change. For 7 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 8 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 9 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 10 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 11 Former Section 6276.04 included an entry for: \"Artificial insemination, donor not natural father, 12 confidentiality of records, Section 7613, Family Code.\" That entry is not included in Section 13 7930.110 because Family Code Section 7613 no longer says anything about confidentiality of 14 records. Compare 2013 Cal. Stat. ch. 510, \u00a7 5, with 2013 Cal. Stat. ch. 566, \u00a7 1. 15 Former Section 6276.04 also included entries for \"Auditor General, access to records for audit 16 purposes, Sections 10527 and 10527.1\" and \"Auditor General, disclosure of audit records, Section 17 10525.\" Those entries are not included in Section 7930.110 because they are obsolete. Sections 18 10525, 10527, and 10527.1 have been repealed. See 2011 Cal. Stat. ch. 328, \u00a7 12. 19 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 20 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 21 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.610. For the 22 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. \u00a7 7930.115. From \"Bank and Corporation Tax\" to \"Business and professions licensee 24 exemption for social security number\" 25 7930.115. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 26 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 27 Bank and Corporation Tax, disclosure of information, Article 2 (commencing 28 with Section 19542) of Chapter 7 of Part 10.2 of Division 2, Revenue and Taxation 29 Code. 30 Bank employees, confidentiality of criminal history information, Section 4990, 31 Financial Code. 32 Bank reports, confidentiality of, Section 459, Financial Code. 33 Basic Property Insurance Inspection and Placement Plan, confidential reports, 34 Section 10097, Insurance Code. 35 Beef Council of California, confidentiality of fee transactions information, 36 Section 64691.1, Food and Agricultural Code. 37 Bids, confidentiality of, Section 10304, Public Contract Code. 38 Birth, death, and marriage licenses, confidential information contained in, 39 Sections 102100, 102110, and 102230, Health and Safety Code. 40 Birth defects, monitoring, confidentiality of information collected, Section 41 103850, Health and Safety Code. 42 Birth, live, confidential portion of certificate, Sections 102430, 102475, 103525, 43 and 103590, Health and Safety Code. 44 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 164 - Blood tests, confidentiality of hepatitis and AIDS carriers, Section 1603.1, Health 1 and Safety Code. 2 Blood-alcohol percentage test results, vehicular offenses, confidentiality of, 3 Section 1804, Vehicle Code. 4 Business and professions licensee exemption for social security number, Section 5 30, Business and Professions Code. 6 Comment. Section 7930.115 continues former Section 6276.06 without substantive change. For 7 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 8 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 9 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 10 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 11 Former Section 6276.06 included an entry for: \"Bank employees, confidentiality of criminal 12 history information, Sections 777.5 and 4990, Financial Code.\" That entry has been revised to refer 13 only to Financial Code Section 4990. The reference to Financial Code Section 777.5 is obsolete 14 because that section has been repealed. See 2008 Cal. Stat. ch. 125, \u00a7 53. 15 Former Section 6276.06 also included an entry for: \"Bank reports, confidentiality of, Section 16 289, Financial Code.\" That entry has been revised because Financial Code Section 289 was 17 repealed and its substance moved to Financial Code Section 459. See 2011 Cal. Stat. ch. 243, \u00a7 1; 18 compare 2008 Cal. Stat. ch. 501, \u00a7 9 with Fin. Code \u00a7 459. Section 7930.115 thus refers to Financial 19 Code Section 459, instead of Financial Code Section 289. 20 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 21 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

Section 6276.10 includes an entry for: \"Community care facilities, confidentiality of client 5 information, Section 1557.5, Health and Safety Code.\" There are two, almost identical versions of 6 Section 1557.5 in the Health and Safety Code. Because the two sections are almost identical, it is 7 not necessary to differentiate between them. Like existing Section 6276.10, proposed Section 8 7930.125 would simply refer to \"Section 1557.5, Health and Safety Code.\" 9 \u00a7 7930.130. From to \"Customer list of telephone answering service\" 10 7930.130.

Section 7930.130 continues former Section 6276.12 without substantive change. For 36 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 37 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 38 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 39 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 40 Former Section 6276.12 included an entry for: \"Contractor, license applicants, evidence of 41 financial solvency, confidentiality of, Section 7067.5, Business and Professions Code.\" That entry 42 is not included in Section 7930.130 because it is obsolete. Business and Professions Code Section 43 7067.5 has been repealed. See 2015 Cal. Stat. ch. 656, \u00a7 8. 44 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 170 - For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 1 7930.005 (scope and effect of index). For special rules in the California Public Records Act 2 (\"CPRA\") that apply to specific types of public records, see Sections 7923.600-7929.610. For the 3 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 4 Note. Section 6276.12 includes an entry for: \"Controlled substance offenders, confidentiality of 5 registration information, Section 11594, Health and Safety Code.\" A recently-enacted bill 6 (operative Jan. 1, 2020) repeals Health and Safety Code Section 11594 and adds a new provision 7 with the same number. See 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. ch. 580, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8 (AB 1261 (Jones-Sawyer)). The new 8 provision includes a confidentiality requirement similar to the one in the repealed provision. 9 Accordingly, proposed Section 7930.130 (the proposed recodification of Section 6276.12) includes 10 the same entry for Health and Safety Code Section 11594 as in Section 6276.12. 11 Section 6276.12 also includes an entry for: \"Criminal offender record information, access to, 12 Sections 11076 and 13202, Penal Code.\" A recently-enacted bill amends Penal Code Section 13202 13 to include a sunset clause, which would repeal the provision on July 1, 2020. That bill also adds a 14 new version of Penal Code Section 13202 to the codes, with an operative date of July 1, 2020. See 15 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 581, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6 (AB 1331 (Bonta)). Although the bill creates two versions of Penal 16 Code Section 13202, they contain similar language regarding confidentiality and one of them would 17 be repealed by its own terms before the operative date of this proposed recodification. Thus, 18 proposed Section 7930.130 (like existing Section 6276.12) would simply refer to Penal Code 19 Section 13202. 20 \u00a7 7930.135. From \"Dairy Council of California\" to \"Driving school and driving instructor 21 licensee records\" 22 7930.135.

Section 7930.135 continues former Section 6276.14 without substantive change. For 40 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 41 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 42 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 43 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 44 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 172 - Former Section 6276.14 included an entry for: \"Dairy Council of California, confidentiality of 1 ballots, Section 64155, Food and Agricultural Code.\" That entry has been revised because Food 2 and Agricultural Code Section 64155 was amended in 2019 and no longer contains any language 3 about confidentiality of ballots; that language was moved to a new code provision (Food and 4 Agricultural Code Section 64323). See 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 304, \u00a7\u00a7 89, 118 (AB 590 (Mathis)). 5 Section 7930.135 thus refers to Food and Agricultural Code Section 64323, instead of Food and 6 Agricultural Code Section 64155. 7 Former Section 6276.14 also included an entry for: \"Developmentally disabled person, 8 confidentiality of patient records, state agencies, Section 4553, Welfare and Institutions Code.\" 9 That entry has been revised because Welfare and Institutions Code Section 4553 was repealed in 10 2002 and replaced by a new provision that has nothing to do with record disclosure (see 2002 Cal. 11 Stat. ch. 676, \u00a7 21). The substance of the repealed provision was moved to Welfare and Institutions 12 Code Section 4552.5 (compare 1977 Cal. Stat. ch. 1252, \u00a7 550 with Welf. & Inst. Code \u00a7 4552.5). 13 Section 7930.135 thus refers to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 4552.5, instead of Welfare 14 and Institutions Code Section 4553. 15 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 16 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

Section 7930.145 continues former Section 6276.18 without substantive change. For 24 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 25 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 26 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 27 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 28 Former Section 6276.19 included an entry for: \"Firearms, centralized list of exempted federal 29 firearms licensees, disclosure of information compiled from, Sections 24850 to 24890, inclusive, 30 Penal Code.\" That entry has been revised to refer to Penal Code Sections 28475 and 28480. This 31 revision corrects a transposition error (Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 24850-24890 do not exist but Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 32 28450-28490 do).

Stat. ch. 334, 34 \u00a7 4), which was repealed in 2010 and recodified as Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 28450-28490). 35 Former Section 6276.19 also included an entry for: \"Firearms, centralized list of dealers and 36 licensees, disclosure of information compiled from, Sections 26700 to 26915, inclusive, Penal 37 Code.\" That entry has been revised to refer only to Penal Code Section 26715. This revision deletes 38 irrelevant material that used to be combined with the pertinent material in a long code section (see 39 former Penal Code \u00a7 12071 (2009 Cal.

Fish and Game Code Section 4041 has been repealed. See 2019 Cal.

Section 7930.155 continues former Section 6276.24 without substantive change. For 16 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 17 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 18 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 19 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 20 Former Section 6276.24 included an entry for: \"Hazardous waste control, business plans, public 21 inspection, Section 25506, Health and Safety Code.\" That entry has been revised because Health 22 and Safety Code Section 25506 was repealed in 2013 (see 2013 Cal. Stat. \u00a7 419, \u00a7 2). The current 23 version of Health and Safety Code Section 25506 has nothing to do with record disclosure. The 24 substance of the repealed provision was moved (with revisions) to Health and Safety Code Section 25 25509 (compare 1988 Cal. Stat. ch. 1585, \u00a7 7 with Health & Safety Code \u00a7 25509). Section 26 7930.155 thus refers to Health and Safety Code Section 25509, instead of Health and Safety Code 27 Section 25506. 28 Former Section 6276.24 also included an entry for: \"Hazardous waste control, trade secrets, 29 disclosure of information, Sections 25511 and 25538, Health and Safety Code.\" That entry has been 30 revised because Health and Safety Code Section 25511 was repealed in 2013 (see 2013 Cal. Stat. 31 ch. 419, \u00a7 2). The current version of Health and Safety Code Section 25511 has nothing to do with 32 record disclosure. The substance of the repealed provision was moved (with revisions) to Health 33 and Safety Code Sections 25512 and 25512.1 (compare 1985 Cal. Stat. ch. 1167, \u00a7 1 with Health 34 & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 25512, 25512.1). Section 7930.155 thus refers to Health and Safety Code Section 35 25512 and 25512.1, instead of Health and Safety Code Section 25511. 36 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 37 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

Section 7930.160 continues former Section 6276.26 without substantive change. For 3 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 4 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 5 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 6 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 7 Former Section 6276.26 included an entry for: \"Influenza vaccine, trade secret information and 8 information relating to recipient of vaccine, Section 120155, Health and Safety Code.\" That entry 9 has been revised because the version of Health and Safety Code Section 120155 relating to trade 10 secrets and record disclosure (2007 Cal. Stat. ch. 130, \u00a7 174) was amended and renumbered as 11 Health and Safety Code Section 120160 (see 2015 Cal. Stat. ch. 303, \u00a7 347). Section 7930.160 thus 12 refers to Health and Safety Code Section 120160, instead of Health and Safety Code Section 13 120155. 14 Former Section 6276.26 also included an entry for: \"In forma pauperis litigant, rules governing 15 confidentiality of financial information, Section 68511.3.\" That entry has been revised because 16 Section 68511.3 was repealed (see 2008 Cal. Stat. ch. 462, \u00a7 1). Similar (but not identical) material 17 relating to record disclosure is now located in Section 68633 (compare former Section 18 68511.3(a)(4)-(5) & (c)(1) (2006 Cal. Stat. ch. 538, \u00a7 326) with Section 68633(f)). Proposed 19 Section 7930.160 would thus refer to Section 68633, instead of Section 68511.3. 20 Another entry in former Section 6276.26 was for: \"Insurance Commissioner, information from 21 examination or investigation, confidentiality of, Sections 1215.7, 1433, and 1759.3, Insurance 22 Code.\" That entry has been revised because the version of Insurance Code Section 1215.7 relating 23 to record disclosure (1969 Cal. Stat. ch. 1275, \u00a7 1) was amended and renumbered as Insurance 24 Code Section 1215.8 (see 2012 Cal Stat. ch. 282, \u00a7 8). Proposed Section 7930.160 would thus refer 25 to Insurance Code Section 1215.8, instead of Insurance Code Section 1215.7. 26 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 27 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

Section 7930.165 continues former Section 6276.28 without substantive change. For 32 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 33 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 34 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 35 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 36 Former Section 6276.28 included an entry for: \"Labor dispute, investigation and mediation 37 records, confidentiality of, Section 65, Labor Code.\" That entry has been revised because Labor 38 Code Section 65 was repealed (see 2012 Cal. Stat. ch. 46, \u00a7 78). The substance of former Labor 39 Code Section 65 was moved to Section 3601 of this code (compare former Labor Code Section 65 40 (1997 Cal. Stat. ch. 772, \u00a7 11) with Section 3601). Proposed Section 6278.28 would thus refer to 41 Section 3601, instead of Labor Code Section 65. 42 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 43 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

Section 7930.170 continues former Section 6276.30 without substantive change. For 13 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 14 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 15 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 16 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 17 Former Section 6276.30 included an entry for: \"Managed care health plans, confidentiality of 18 proprietary information, Section 14091.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\" That entry is not 19 included in Section 7930.170 because it is obsolete. Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14091.3 20 (2012 Cal. Stat. ch. 23, \u00a7 81) was repealed by its own terms on January 1, 2014. 21 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 22 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

Existing Section 6276.30 includes an entry for: \"Mentally disordered or mentally ill person, 26 weapons restrictions, confidentiality of information about, Section 8103 of the Welfare and 27 Institutions Code.\" At present, there are two versions of Welfare and Institutions Code Section 28 8103. However, one version (2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 861, \u00a7 1) will sunset by its own terms on January 29 1, 2020, before this proposed recodification is introduced in the Legislature; the other version (2018 30 Cal. Stat. ch. 861, \u00a7 2) will become operative at that time. Moreover, both versions contain the 31 same language regarding record disclosure (see subdivision (e)(3)). Consequently, proposed 32 Section 7930.170, like existing Section 6276.30, would simply refer to Welfare and Institutions 33 Code Section 8103. 34 \u00a7 7930.175.

For 19 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 20 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 21 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 22 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 23 Former Section 6276.34 included an entry for: \"Payment instrument licensee records, inspection 24 of, Section 33206, Financial Code.\" That entry is not included in Section 7930.180 because it is 25 obsolete. Financial Code Section 33206 (1996 Cal. Stat. ch. 1064, \u00a7 712) has been repealed. See 26 2010 Cal. Stat. ch. 612, \u00a7 4. 27 Former Section 6276.34 also included an entry for: \"Physician and surgeon, rehabilitation and 28 diversion records, confidentiality of, Section 2355, Business and Professions Code.\" That entry is 29 not included in Section 7930.180 because it is obsolete.

For the 35 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 36 Note. Existing Section 6276.34 includes an entry for: \"Persons with mental health disorders, 37 weapons restrictions, confidentiality of information about, Section 8103, Welfare and Institutions 38 Code.\" At present, there are two versions of Welfare and Institutions Code Section 8103. However, 39 one version (2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 861, \u00a7 1) will sunset by its own terms on January 1, 2020, before 40 this proposed recodification is introduced in the Legislature; the other version (2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 41 861, \u00a7 2) will become operative at that time. Moreover, both versions contain the same language 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 187 - regarding record disclosure (see subdivision (e)(3)). Consequently, proposed Section 7930.180, 1 like existing Section 6276.34, would simply refer to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 8103. 2 \u00a7 7930.185.

Section 7930.185 continues former Section 6276.36 without substantive change. For 5 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 6 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 7 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 8 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 9 Former Section 6276.36 included an entry for: \"Public Employees' Retirement System, 10 confidentiality of data filed by member or beneficiary with board of administration, Section 11 20134.\" That entry has been revised because Section 20134 was repealed and its substance moved 12 to Section 20230. See 1995 Cal. Stat. ch. 379, \u00a7 1; compare 1985 Cal. Stat. ch. 1508, \u00a7 1 with 13 Section 20230. Section 7930.185 would thus refer to Section 20230, instead of Section 20134. 14 Former Section 6276.36 also included an entry for: \"Pupil records, disclosure in hearing to 15 dismiss or suspend school employee, Section 44944.1, Education Code.\" That entry has been 16 revised because Section 44944.1 was repealed and added, and the new provision does not address 17 record disclosure (see 2014 Cal. Stat. ch. 55, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 18). The substance of the repealed provision 18 has been moved to Education Code Section 44944.3 (compare 1985 Cal. Stat. ch. 324, \u00a7 3 (former Educ. Code Educ. Code \u00a7 44944.3). Proposed Section 7930.135 would thus refer 20 to Education Code Section 44944.3, instead of Education Code Section 44944.1. 21 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 22 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

For the 3 CPRA catch-all exemption, see Section 7922.000. 4 Note. Existing Section 6276.38 includes an entry for: \"Residential care facilities for the elderly, 5 confidentiality of client information, Section 1569.315, Health and Safety Code.\" There are two 6 versions of Section 1569.315 in the Health and Safety Code (1985 Cal. Stat. ch. 869, \u00a7 4; 1985 Cal. 7 Stat. ch. 1096, \u00a7 5). 8 Both versions require a residential care facility for the elderly to keep and protect \"the privacy 9 and confidentiality of\" certain records. Most of the differences between the versions are stylistic, 10 but only the first version applies to \"the ... address ... of the client's physician ....\" 11 Like existing Section 6276.38, proposed Section 7930.190 would simply refer to \"Section 12 1569.315, Health and Safety Code.\" 13 \u00a7 7930.195. From \"Safe surrender site\" to \"Social security numbers within records of local 14 agencies\" 15 7930.195. The following provisions may operate to exempt certain records, or 16 portions thereof, from disclosure pursuant to this division: 17 Safe surrender site, confidentiality of information pertaining to a parent or 18 individual surrendering a child, Section 1255.7, Health and Safety Code. 19 Sales and use tax, disclosure of information, Section 7056, Revenue and Taxation 20 Code. 21 Santa Barbara Regional Health Authority, exemption from disclosure for records 22 maintained by the authority regarding negotiated rates for the California Medical 23 Assistance Program, Section 14499.6, Welfare and Institutions Code. 24 Savings association employees, disclosure of criminal history information, 25 Section 6525, Financial Code. 26 Savings associations, inspection of records by shareholders, Section 6050, 27 Financial Code. 28 School district governing board, disciplinary action, disclosure of pupil 29 information, Section 35146, Education Code. 30 School employee, merit system examination records, confidentiality of, Section 31 45274, Education Code. 32 School employee, notice and reasons for hearing on nonreemployment of 33 employee, confidentiality of, Sections 44948.5 and 44949, Education Code. 34 School meals for needy pupils, confidentiality of records, Section 49558, 35 Education Code. 36 Sealed records, arrest for misdemeanor, Section 851.7, Penal Code. 37 Sealed records, misdemeanor convictions, Section 1203.45, Penal Code. 38 Sealing and destruction of arrest records, determination of innocence, Section 39 851.8, Penal Code. 40 Search warrants, special master, Section 1524, Penal Code. 41 Sex change, confidentiality of birth certificate, Section 103440, Health and Safety 42 Code. 43 Sex offenders, registration form, Section 290.021, Penal Code. 44 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 192 - Sexual assault forms, confidentiality of, Section 13823.5, Penal Code. 1 Sexual assault counselor and victim, confidential communication, Sections 2 1035.2, 1035.4, and 1035.8, Evidence Code. 3 Shorthand reporter's complaint, Section 8010, Business and Professions Code. 4 Small family day care homes, identifying information, Section 1596.86, Health 5 and Safety Code. 6 Social security number, applicant for driver's license or identification card, 7 nondisclosure of, Section 1653.5, Vehicle Code, and Section 7922.200, this code. 8 Social security number, official record or official filing, nondisclosure of, Section 9 9526.5, Commercial Code, and Sections 7922.205 and 7922.210, this code. 10 Social Security Number Truncation Program, Article 3.5 (commencing with 11 Section 27300) of Chapter 6 of Part 3 of Division 2 of Title 3, this code. 12 Social security numbers within records of local agencies, nondisclosure of, 13 Section 7922.200, this code. 14 Comment. Section 7930.195 continues former Section 6276.40. For the source of the 15 introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes and constitutional 16 provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions thereof, from 17 disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 7930.000 and 18 essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 19 Former Section 6276.38 consisted of entries beginning with \"R,\" plus an entry for: \"Safe 20 surrender site, confidentiality of information pertaining to a parent or individual surrendering a 21 child, Section 1255.7, Health and Safety Code.\" The quoted entry belongs with other entries that 22 begin with \"S,\" not with entries that begin with \"R.\" Thus, the quoted entry is recodified here in 23 Section 7930.195, not in Section 7930.190. 24 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 25 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

Existing Section 6276.40 includes an entry for: \"Social security number, applicant for 29 driver's license or identification card, nondisclosure of, Section 1653.5, Vehicle Code ....\" At 30 present, there are two versions of Vehicle Code Section 1653.5, with different rules governing 31 when they are operative: (1) 2014 Cal. Stat. ch. 452, \u00a7 2, and (2) 2014 Cal. Stat. ch. 71, \u00a7 168. Both 32 versions restrict disclosure of the social security number of an applicant for a driver's license or 33 identification card. For that reason, and because only one version will be operative at a time, 34 proposed Section 7930.195, like existing Section 6276.40, would simply refer to \"Section 1653.5, 35 Vehicle Code ....\" 36 \u00a7 7930.200.

That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 13 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 14 Former Section 6276.42 included an entry for: \"State Teachers' Retirement System, 15 confidentiality of information filed with the system by a member, participant, or beneficiary, 16 Sections 22306 and 26215, Education Code.\" That entry has been revised to refer only to Education 17 Code Section 22306. The reference to Education Code Section 26215 is obsolete because that 18 section was repealed as redundant. See 2017 Cal.

For 30 the source of the introductory clause, see the third sentence of former Section 6275 (\"The statutes 31 and constitutional provisions listed in this article may operate to exempt certain records, or portions 32 thereof, from disclosure.\"). That sentence is continued without substantive change in Section 33 7930.000 and essentially repeated in each section in this chapter. 34 Former Section 6276.44 included an entry for: \"Trust companies, disclosure of private trust 35 confidential information, Section 1582, Financial Code.\" That entry has been revised because 36 Financial Code Section 1582 was repealed in 2011 and replaced by a new provision that has nothing 37 to do with disclosure of private trust confidential information (see 2011 Cal. Stat. ch. 243, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3). 38 The substance of the repealed provision was moved to Financial Code Section 1602 (compare 39 former Fin. Code \u00a7 1582 (1996 Cal. Stat. ch. 1064, \u00a7 212) with Fin. Code \u00a7 1602). Section 7930.205 40 thus refers to Financial Code Section 1602, instead of Financial Code Section 1582. 41 For guidance on using this chapter, see Sections 7930.000 (legislative intent & instructions) and 42 7930.005 (scope and effect of index).

This act would recodify the California Public Records Act (Sections 10 6250 to 6276.48, inclusive, of the Government Code) in a more user-friendly 11 manner without changing its substance, and make conforming revisions. Consistent 12 with subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the 13 Legislature finds and declares: 14 (1) This act continues the existing substantive balance between the public's right 15 of access to information concerning the conduct of public business and competing 16 interests. This act does not impose any new limitation on the public's right of access, 17 which would require findings demonstrating the interest protected by the new 18 limitation and the need for protecting that interest. 19 (2) By making the California Public Records Act more user-friendly, this act 20 furthers the public's right of access to information concerning the conduct of public 21 business. 22 Operative date 23 SEC. ____.

CORRECTED CROSS-REFERENCES In reorganizing the CPRA, the Commission identified some provisions that contain one or more incomplete or incorrect cross-references. Where the proper cross-reference is obvious, the Commission corrected the cross-reference in its proposed legislation. That approach seems more sensible than proposing to perpetuate a plainly incorrect cross-reference. Those instances are described in detail below. Section 6252(a), defining \"local agency,\" cross-refers to \"subdivisions (c) and (d) of Section 54952.\"1 It seems improbable, however, that the Legislature intended to require an entity to satisfy the requirements of both subdivisions to qualify as a \"local agency\" under Section 6252(a) for purposes of the CPRA. Proposed Section 7920.510 (continuing the substance of Section 6252(a)) would correct this problem by referring instead to \"subdivision (c) or (d) of Section 54952.\"2 Section 6253.2 cross-refers to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 12302.25. The 2018 maintenance of the codes bill amended Section 6253.2 to cross-refer to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 12302.25 instead of Section 12302.5,3 but that amendment was chaptered out by another bill.4 Proposed Section 7926.300 would incorporate the cross-reference correction that the Legislature approved in the 2018 maintenance of the codes bill. Section 6254(f) contains two cross-references to Penal Code Section 288a. In 2018, Penal Code Section 288a was renumbered as Penal Code Section 287.5 Proposed Sections 7923.615 and 7923.620 would continue the part of Section 6254(f) in question, with revisions to reflect the renumbering of Penal Code Section 288a. Section 6254.4(c) refers to \"the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 15301 et seq.) ...\" However, the content of the federal Help America Vote Act was transferred to a new title of the federal code in 2012 (52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20901). Proposed Section 7924.000(b) (continuing the substance of 6254.4(c)) would update the cross-reference to reflect the relocation. Section 6254.18(f) says: \"Within 90 days of separation of an employee, contractor, volunteer, board member, or officer of the reproductive health service facility who has provided notice to a public agency pursuant to subdivision (c), the facility shall provide notice of the separation to the 1.

See Section 9605 (bill conflict rules); 2018 Cal. Stat. ch. 35, \u00a7 4 (AB 1811 (Committee on Budget)); 2018 Cal.

STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 208 - relevant agency or agencies.6 The notification requirement is currently located in subdivision (d), not in subdivision (c). Proposed Section 7926.425 would correct that problem by cross-referring to the provision that would continue the substance of subdivision (d) of Section 6254.18 (proposed Section 7926.415), instead of the provision that would continue the substance of subdivision (c). In defining \"public safety official,\" Section 6254.24(b) refers to a \"public officer or other person listed in Sections 1808.2 and 1808.6 of the Vehicle Code.\"7 Given the content of Sections 1808.2 and 1808.6, however, it seems improbable that the Legislature intended to require a person to be listed in both of those provisions to qualify as a \"public safety official\" within the meaning of Section 6254.24. Proposed Section 7920.535(b) (continuing the substance of Section 6254.24(b)) would correct that problem by referring to \"Section 1808.2 or 1808.6 of the Vehicle Code.\"8 Section 6254.24(g) includes as a \"public safety official\" an employee \"who supervises inmates in a city police department, a county sheriff's office, the Department of California Highway Patrol, federal, state, or a local detention facility, and a local juvenile hall, camp, ranch, or home ....\"9 It seems improbable that the Legislature intended this provision to include as a \"public safety official\" only an employee who supervises inmates in one of the enumerated facilities for adults and in one of the enumerated facilities for juveniles. Thus, proposed Section 7920.535(g) (continuing the substance of Section 6254.24(g)) would refer instead to an employee \"who supervises inmates in a city police department, a county sheriff's office, the Department of California Highway Patrol, federal, state, or a local detention facility, or a local juvenile hall, camp, ranch, or home ....10 Section 6254.25 cross-refers to \"subdivision (q) of Section 11126.\" However, Section 11126 no longer has a subdivision (q); the material in question was relocated to subdivision (e) in 1996.11 Proposed Section 7927.205 (continuing the substance of Section 6254.25) would correct the erroneous cross-reference to \"subdivision (q) of Section 11126.\" The second sentence of Section 6268(c) says: \"Records or writings shall not be transferred pursuant to this paragraph unless the institution receiving them agrees to maintain, and does maintain, the materials 6.

Stat. ch. 1041, \u00a7 5. Additionally, the cross-referenced provision (Section 11126) appears to contain an inadvertent drafting error; some paragraph relabeling and related revisions seem necessary. The Commission's recommendation on California Public Records Act Clean-Up: Conforming Revisions, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019), includes a technical amendment of Section 11126 to accomplish the necessary clean-up. For further discussion of this point, see CLRC Staff Memorandum 2017-50, pp. 11-16. STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 8, 2019 - 209 - according to commonly accepted archival standards.\"12 Section 6268(c) is not divided into paragraphs; the entire subdivision consists of a single paragraph, making the quoted reference to \"this paragraph\" (as opposed to \"this subdivision\") slightly confusing. Examination of the legislative history clarifies the situation. The material now labeled as subdivision (c) of Section 6268 used to be in an unlabeled paragraph of that section.13 The quoted reference to \"this paragraph\" was thus meant to refer to the entirety of what is now subdivision (c). Accordingly, proposed Section 7928.010(b)(2) (continuing the quoted sentence) would refer to the material continuing subdivision (c) \u2014 i.e., proposed Section 7928.010(b) or \"this subdivision.\" Sections 6276.01 to 6276.48 comprise an alphabetical list of CPRA exemptions located throughout the codes. Some of the entries in that list are obsolete and require revisions. For discussion of the obsolete entries and revisions made, see the Comments to proposed Sections 7930.100 to 7930.215. 12.

MINOR CLEAN-UP ISSUES FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION In conducting this strictly nonsubstantive study, the Commission identified some minor problems in the CPRA, which it probably could not address without potentially raising concerns about the possibility of a substantive change. Those issues are listed here. As far as the Commission is aware, this list consists of relatively noncontroversial clean-up issues, not issues involving substantial controversy. If any of the issues listed below appears likely to involve substantial controversy, please notify the Commission. Consider whether to clarify the usage of the term \"local agency\" in Section 6252.7 and its continuation (proposed Section 7921.310).14 Consider whether Section 6254(j) (proposed Section 7927.100) and Section 6267 (proposed Section 7927.105) are redundant to some extent and, if so, how to eliminate such redundancy.15 Consider whether the second sentence of Section 6254.2(b) (the second sentence of proposed Section 7924.305) should be relocated to the chapter on pesticides within the Food and Agricultural Code16 and, if so, where it should be placed within that chapter.17 Consider whether to simplify the description in the first sentence of Section 6254.5 (proposed Section 7921.505(a)) of which exemptions are waived.18 Consider whether to revise the descriptions in subdivisions (g) and (i) of Section 6254.5 (proposed Section 7921.505(b)(7) & (9)) to make them more readily understandable.19 Consider whether the reference in Section 6254.24 (proposed Section 7920.535) to \"a probation officer as defined in Section 830.5 of the Penal Code\"20 should be revised (e.g., to refer to \"a probation officer as used in Section 830.5\").21 14.

(B)(i) If the agency demonstrates, on the facts of the particular case, that the public interest in withholding a video or audio recording clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure because the release of the recording would, based on the facts and circumstances depicted in the recording, violate the reasonable expectation of privacy of a subject depicted in the recording, the agency shall provide in writing to the requester the specific basis for the expectation of privacy and the public interest served by withholding the recording and may use redaction technology, including blurring or distorting images or audio, to obscure those specific portions of the recording that protect that interest.
