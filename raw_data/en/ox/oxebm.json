It was a landmark event for the field and involved a number of important achievements. The Congress was again convened by the Academic Consortium on Integrative Medicine and Health (Consortium), an organization that numbers close to 70 academic health centers and systems in US, Canada and Mexico, as this conference has evolved into a biennial event. A key partner in planning and co-sponsoring the Congress was the International Society for Complementary Medicine Research (ISCMR). The Consortium has partnered with ISCMR on several previous conferences, and this Congress served as ISCMR's 11th International Congress on Complementary Medicine Research (ICCMR). For the first time, the Congress broadened its specific focus on research to include aspects of education, clinical care and policy issues related to integrative medicine and health. To assist with the planning those elements into the program, the Consortium invited three other organizational partners: The Academic Collaborative for Integrative Health (ACIH\u2014formerly known as the Academic Consortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care) for education, the Academy for Integrative Health and Medicine (AIHM) for clinical care, and the Integrative Healthcare Policy Consortium (IHPC) for policy. Planning such a complex scientific gathering was no easy task, and the Organizing Committee, ably chaired by Judy Balk and Rick Hecht, was assisted by a 22-member Program Committee, a 17-member Scientific Review Committee, and a 12-member communications committee, all representing institutions and organizations from around the world dedicated to advancing integrative medicine and health.In attendance were over 800 researchers, healthcare practitioners, educators and policy advocates, representing over 150 academic institutions and organizations from 28 countries. In addition, there were over 211 attendees who identified themselves as individuals in training, from students to residents and fellows. Thus, though the audience was geographically and professionally diverse in many aspects, all attendees shared the unifying passion to improve health and healthcare around the world by bridging research, clinical care, education and policy in integrative medicine and integrative health. The tone for the conference was set right from the first plenary session by keynote speaker, Dr. Richard Davidson, who titled his presentation, Well-being is a Skill: Perspectives from Affective and Contemplative Neuroscience. He opened his talk by sharing that, in his quest to understand why some individuals are vulnerable to life's challenges whereas others are resilient, the Dalai Lama asked why he not focus his studies on kindness and compassion rather than stress, anxiety and depression. Dr. Davidson then provided considerable neuroscientific data to support the contention that mindful practices can improve attention and foster well-being. Collaborating to Advance Integrative Medicine & Health: Reflections on the International Congress 2016 Aviad Haramati, PhD Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC7 www.imconsortium.orgAn amazing experience for multiple disciplines to come together and share a common vision for healthcare.This theme of focusing on health creation rather than disease management continued in many of the plenary lectures and interactive sessions. Dr. David Relman addressed The Inner Self: The Human Microbiome and Health, and pointed out how the human-microbiome mutualism can lead to improved health. Dr. Ted Kaptchuk updated the Congress participants on the powerful effects of placebo, and the intrinsic nature of healing in the human mind and body, and Dr. Lorimer Moseley from Australia gave a very animated and engaging presentation as he explored the manner in which pain is perceived by the brain and addressed implications for clinical treatment approaches. Other keynote addresses focused on interprofessional education by Dr. Barbara Brandt, who heads the National Center for Interprofessional Practice and Education at the University of Minnesota, and on clinical care as Dr. Gustav Dobos provided a European perspective on clinical care models in integrative medicine and took the opportunity to share the extraordinary work his center has pioneered at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany. Dr. Wayne Jonas summarized the work of the NATO Health and Human Factors Task Force on Integrative Medicine in the Military. This is the second Congress to include perspectives from the US Military on the utility and applicability of integrative approaches to address aspects of health in the armed forces. The rationales and processes used in that context have significant implications for academic medical centers and the health of the public. Finally, Dr. Heather Boon described the issues surrounding policy and regulation of complementary medicine in Canada, and the lessons learned in that country that can inform practices and policies elsewhere. The spirit of the Congress was one of collaboration in the present and commitment to the future. Many of the oral and poster abstract presentations highlighted examples of Individuals and organizations worked together across disciplines in research, education, policy and clinical delivery to achieve the common goal of improved health. There were also a number of events in which students and trainees had opportunities to share their experiences and outcomes, but also to hear from veterans in the field during special receptions and targeted lunch gatherings. Perhaps the Congress can best be summarized by some final reflections offered by Elizabeth 'Liza' Goldblatt, Executive Director of the Academic Collaborative for Integrative Health who welcomed the debate and discourse at the Congress and in looking to the future suggested that \"the field is looking at how we shift the current system of health care from one that is fractionalized and disease-based to one that is much more collaborative, team-based, patient- and person-centered care and focused on prevention and health and well-being. \" 8 ICIMH Summary Report 2016 Pre-Congress Workshops On the day prior to the Congress, more than 250 individuals attended one of twelve different pre-congress workshops. Workshops were selected through the same peer review process as abstracts and included: Emerging Leaders Programming ICIMH 2016 continued the practice of having programming dedicated to new investigators, and this year expanded to new clinicians, educa-tors, and health policy advocates. This group, including early-career faculty, fellows, residents, and students, were invited to the Tuesday eve-ning Welcome Reception, mentoring lunchtime sessions, and participated in informal networking throughout the Congress. These experiences provided the opportunity for new attendees to make connections with senior academic leaders and researchers. Peer-Selected Sessions, Panel Discussions and Workshops ICIMH 2016 featured eight well-received plenary sessions featuring renowned Integrative Health researchers, featured on pages 12-19. The Congress concluded with the ninth plenary session featuring representatives from the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine & Health, and each of the Congress partnering organizations: Academic Collaborative for Integrative Health, Academy of Integrative Health & Medicine, Integrative Health Policy Consortium, and the International Society for Complementary Medicine Research. Sessions highlighted the trailblazing and rigorous research being conducted around the world, with a packed agenda of 56 concurrent work- shop sessions and 11 oral abstract sessions. Webcasts of the plenary sessions are freely accessible online at webcast.icimh.org/m/2016. Poster Sessions With over 380 posters accepted through a scientific peer review process, a wide breadth of research in Integrative Medicine was accessible to congress attendees through ten different poster viewing sessions. Congress attendees also had the opportunity to engage with representatives from supporter organizations and exhibitors at their information tables in the poster hall. Experiential Sessions True to the spirit of integrative health, participants had the opportunity to begin each day with an engaging session of Yoga, Tai Chi/Qigong, Medi-tation, or a Morning Walk. Over 160 participants took advantage of one of these sessions over the course of the three days. \u00bbDiscrimination in Practice - The History of Discrimination in Integrative Health Care and What to Do About It \u00bbHands On Fascial Approaches for Low Back Pain \u00bbIntegrative Medicine Group Visits: A Training in Facilitation Skills \u00bbMind/Body Skills for Pediatric Pain Management Across the Spectrum: From Conventional to Complementary \u00bbMixing Qualitative and Quantitative Methods in Integrative Medicine Research \u00bbNCCIH Career Development Opportunities \u00bbAuthentic Leadership with Bill George \u00bbIntroducing the Integrative Medicine Decision Toolkit \u00bbMindfulness and Relational Neuroscience: The Real Founda- tion for Health Coaching \u00bbPolicy and the Economics of Integrative Medicine \u00bbThe National Center for Integrative Primary Healthcare - Enhancing Interprofessional Integrative Health EducationFeatures of the 2016 International Congress on Integrative Medicine and Health9 www.imconsortium.org Statistics from the 2016 ICIMH 29 710 2 2 22 29 9 6 61736 3720 9 1 11 1 1 11 3060708090100110 42 219109 7 7 3 3 322 4224 4946 43 1134 1 1 1 1 15 1518161756 1313 1012 STATE NUMBER OF JERSEYRegistrants Outside United States The Congress boasted an extensive international presence withrepresentation from the following 27 international countries.

The mission of the Consortium is to advance integrative medicine and health through academic institutions and health systems. The Consortium is committed to leading the effort to transform the health care system to one promoting integrative medicine and health for all. By convening the 2016 Congress, and future Congresses, we provide a forum for the best of the best in the Integrative Medicine & Health community throughout the world to share, learn, and network. We were pleased to see that there were nearly 200 students involved in this year's meeting, bridging the current esteemed leaders with the future leaders of the field. The Consortium is proud to put on the Con-gress - bringing together the best and the brightest working in the field of Integrative Medicine & Health in one place to share the best work being done via research, clinical care, policy and education. 2016 INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS MEDICINE & HEAL TH Seeing the huge field, growing movement and variety of actors in Integrative Medicine and Health was a really remarkable experience, as well as the effort of aligning the different perspectives and organiza-tions for the further development of a new patient-centered medicine.12 ICIMH Summary Report 2016 Expect to be engaged, intrigued, enlightened and revitalized.13 www.imconsortium.org 14 ICIMH Summary Report 2016 Student Reflection Elie Adler University of California, San Francisco As a medical student, much of my learning has been framed around problem lists and treat- ment algorithms. Health concerns are often described as isolated, discreet entities. In my training thus far, I have felt somewhat dissatisfied by this lens. So, in the opening plenary session at the ICIMH, when the presenter projected the words of Albert Einstein\u2014\"A human being is part of a whole\"\u2014I knew I was in the right place. I felt inspired by this expansive framework for understanding health. This statement is indeed an apt summary of the nu-anced, innovative, and holistic ideas and strategies around health that the ICIMH cultivated. The conference program allowed me to explore a wide variety of subjects in Integrative Medicine and health while also allowing me to deeply understand new concepts and current research. I was able to learn about transdisciplinary models for integrative health care deliv-ery; the placebo effect and the significant impact of the provider-pa- tient relationship on quality of life; research tools to better understand the impact of yoga; the ability for compassion training to increase altruism; strategies for bringing Integrative Medicine to underserved communities; etc. etc. The topics varied, but at the foundation of all the presentations and talks was a commitment to creating interven-tions and systems that support whole-person health. The ICIMH advanced my understanding of the biopsychosocial aspects of wellness, approaches to treating whole people rather than discreet diseases, and methodology to implement and study Inte-grative Medicine modalities. This conference allowed me to expand beyond the problem-centered framework of my medical training on the wards to engage in the vast potential for person-centered care. As a research trainee I felt incredibly supported by the Congress - from scholarship support to a sense of inclusion and celebration of trainee work - the exposure to, and mentorship of great thinkers and doers in the field of integrative medicine from around the world was both inspiring and compelling! 15 www.imconsortium.org Facts from the 2016 ICIMH Nearly 900 participants from 27 countries convened in Las Vegas. The Congress received 118 proposals for sessions and included 56 workshops in the program. 457 scientific abstracts were submitted to the Congress, 94% of which were accepted. The Congress accepted both regular and late-breaking abstract submissions. 150 members in the field of integrative medicine and health participated in the scientific research abstract review process. The Congress had 62 oral presentations and over 380 poster presentations. 19% of the oral presentations and 43% of the poster presentations were presented by students . 2016 Congress Poster Presentation Topics Oral Poster Basic Science 4 37 Clinical Research: Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine 5 37 Clinical Research: Herbs and Supplements 1 26 Clinical Research: Manual Therapies 6 19 Clinical Research: Mind-body 14 76 Education Research 3 19 Health Services Research 10 56 Research Methodology 3 16 Other Research 5 36 Non-Research: Clinical 4 29 Non-Research: Education 3 12 Non-Research: Policy 4 316 ICIMH Summary Report 2016 Some of the most rigorous research presented of any medical conference I have attended.17 www.imconsortium.orgPLENARY SESSION Presentation Synopsis BiographyWell-Being is a Skill: Perspectives from Affective and Contemplative Neuroscience Richard Davidson, PhD Founder, Center for Investigating Healthy Minds Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA Richard Davidson presented an overview of the work in the Waisman Center that focuses on some of the fundamental constituents of well-being, their neural bases and biobehavioral correlates, and how they can be cultivated through mental training. In addition, disorders that may arise from abnormalities in some of these constituents will be considered. Emphasis was placed on prefrontal, ventral striatal and amygdala circuitry and connectivity that may play a role in aspects of well-being. Both basic and translational neuroscientific and behavioral research on the impact of specific contemplative practices were also featured. One of the key conclusions of this body of research is that well-being is best conceptualized as a skill that can be enhanced through training. Richard J. Davidson, Ph.D. is the William James and Vilas Research Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry, Director of the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior, and Founder of the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds at the Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison.

MeriganProfessor, Department of Medicine - Division of Infectious Diseases and Department of Microbiology & Immunology Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA All complex ecosystems display mul- tiple, alternative stable states. These alternative states can be conceptu-alized as discrete domains of attrac-tion on a stability landscape, where the likelihood of a persistent state relates to the depth of the valley and the energy required to displace the system. Regime shifts, or transitions from one state to another, occur in response to disturbance or change in the environment. In humans, these environmental changes might include the effects of aging or of immunosuppressing drugs. Resilience refers to resistance to ecosystem state shift or to recovery of prior ecosystem services following disturbance. Given the known and suspected benefits that humans derive from their microbiota, the stability and resilience of this ecosystem are critical properties that deserve attention. We have undertaken longitudinal studies in human volunteers who are monitored for two months before and after a standardized disturbance, with the goals of describing the temporal dynamics of the human microbiome, and identifying features that are associated with stability in the face of disturbance as well as recovery of a prior state. A predictive understanding of the microbiome and the mechanisms that underlie resilience will inform effective strategies for its manipulation, so as to maintain or restore health, and avoid or mitigate disease. David A. Relman, MD is the Thomas C. and Joan M. Merig- an Professor in Medicine, and Microbiology & Immunology, and Co-Director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University.

His presentation emphasized clinical studies that describe the components of placebo effects, its scope of action and how it relates to effective pharmaceuticals. This talk also included a historical overview of how a mechanistic, biological understanding of placebo effects has evolved, and the implications for the field of integrative medicine. Ted J. Kaptchuk is a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Director of the Harvard-wide Program in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic Encounter (PiPS) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. He is also a lecturer in the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School. As a leading figure in placebo studies, a scholar of East Asian medicine, and an academic authority on medical pluralism, Professor Kaptchuk's career has spanned multiple disciplines, drawing upon concepts, research designs and analytical methods from the human-ities and basic and clinical and social sciences. In collaboration with his colleagues, Professor Kaptchuk has made significant contributions to the field of placebo studies through his investigations of the impact of placebos in various illnesses, the neurobiology of placebo effects, the experience of patients being treated by placebo, and various psychological, cultural, sociological and philosophical dimensions of placebos. Professor Kaptchuk has written well-regarded histories of placebo controls and the placebo effect, and significant ethical analyses of the use of placebos in clin-ical practice and research. His laboratory is currently investigating molecular signatures for placebo responses.Professor Kaptchuk entered the field of placebo research after pioneering the study of East Asian medicine in the United States and Europe and establishing himself as a scholar of multiple healing traditions. He is the author of The Web that Has No Weaver: Under - standing Chinese Medicine, a classic textbook, and was senior writer and researcher for the 9-hour BBC-TV series The Healing Arts which documented healing practices around the world. in the 1980s, he directed the pain unit at Boston's Lemuel Shattuck Hospital, a state-run chronic disease facility. Professor Kaptchuk received a B.A. in East Asian Studies from Colum- bia University in 1968 and graduated with a degree in Chinese medi-cine from the Macao Institute of Chinese Medicine (Macao, China) in 1975. He was appointed Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in 1998, was promoted to Associate Professor in 2007, and to full Professor in 2013. From 1998 to 2011, Professor Kaptchuk was Associate Director of the Osher Research Center at Harvard Medical School. He was a member of NCCAM's National Advi-sory Council from 1999 to 2010 and an expert panelist for the FDA from 2001 to 2005.PLENARY SESSION0320 ICIMH Summary Report 2016 PLENARY SESSIONPLENARYSESSION Presentation SynopsisPain and the Brain: Conceptual and Clinical Considerations Lorimer Moseley, PhD Professor of Clinical Neurosciences and Chair in Physiotherapy, Division of Health Sciences University of South Australia and Neuroscience Research Australia, Adelaide, Australia That the brain is a critical player when it comes to pain is now well established and widely, although not universally, accepted. As a result, the way we interpret many clinical interventions has changed and new interventions have emerged. Not surprisingly, the massive advances in our understanding of the role of the brain in pain have highlighted how little we really know. This has triggered a renewed focus on conceptual models and the development of novel experi-mental approaches with which to test them. In this talk, Lorimer Moseley presented some contemporary theories that serve as a kind of road map along which we are pursuing a better understanding of why some people get chronic pain and others do not, how we can interrupt this process and how we can treat those who have already made the transition to chronicity. He focused on theories that relate to the human as a complex system, rather than theories based on any particular molecular, genetic or end-organ dysfunction. Biography Lorimer Moseley, PhD is Professor of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of South Australia and Senior Principal Research Fellow at Neuroscience Research Australia. He leads the Body in Mind research group, which investigates the role of the brain and mind in chronic pain, undertaking both fundamental behavioural and neu- rophysiological experiments, and randomized controlled trials and prognostic studies. Lorimer has written over 200 papers and several books. He has won Australia's most prestigious prize for Innovation and Potential Transformation in a Medical or Health related project, was runner-up in the Australian Science Minister's Prize for Life Sciences and was the inaugural winner of the International Associ-ation for the Study of Pain's Prize for Outstanding Clinical Science in a Pain-related field. He has editorial roles with PAIN, the Journal of Pain and the European Journal of Pain. He is Chief Editor of bodyin- mind.org, the most influential web and social media presence in the clinical pain sciences.PLENARY SESSION04 This is an amazing venue for keeping current in many areas of integrative health and making vital connections between policy makers, clinicians, and researchers.21 www.imconsortium.org PLENARY SESSION Presentation SynopsisInterprofessional Education and Collaboration in a Transforming Health System Barbara Brandt, PhD Director, National Center for Interprofessional Practice and Education; Associate Vice President for Education, Academic Health Center University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA Barbara Brandt believes the time is right for interprofessional practice and education. Teamwork is a vital part of our new health care reality, and we must reconnect the education and practice communities to sustain our new models of collaborative learning and care. In the fall of 2012, the University of Minnesota was selected as the National Center for Interprofessional Practice and Education, a public-private partnership and cooperative agreement with the Health Resources and Services Administration. She's encouraged by the enthusiasm and interest in her work and looks forward to where we're headed, together.PLENARY SESSION05 Biography Since 2000, Barbara Brandt, PhD has served as associate vice president for education at the University of Minnesota Academic Health Center, where she's working to align interprofessional educa-tion and collaborative practice across the health professions and to forge a new kind of relationship between the education and practice communities. She also lead the Minnesota Area Health Education Center network, an interprofessional workforce development program for underserved rural and urban areas across our state. A rich opportunity to be immersed in cutting-edge thought on integrative health.22 ICIMH Summary Report 2016PLENARY SESSION Presentation Synopsis Clinical Care Models: The European Perspective Gustav Dobos, MD Director, Clinic for Internal and Integrative Medicine Chair for Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany In Western Europe, the use of complementary and alternative Medicine (CAM) has increased over the past two decades. Reflecting the international situation, a broad spectrum of methods is available. However, local CAM systems, e.g. in Germany-- Traditional European Medicine consisting of phytotherapy, nutrition, exercise, hydrotherapy, life style and health education-- are more often integrated into daily medical care than other CAM interventions. Gustav Dobos discussed the Department for Internal and Integrative Medicine at the Hospital Essen-Mitte in Essen, Germany as a good example for a successful clinical integration. Providing integrative medical care that is covered by the German health insurance system, it combines conventional medicine with evidence-based comple-mentary medicine for inpatients and outpatients since 1999. Starting as a model institution, the main focus of the clinic was on chronic pain and internal medicine. Being associated with the University of Duisburg-Essen, research played an important role and served as a strong enabler for integration. Over the last 10 years Integrative On- cology has become another important focus. Inspired by the Integra-tive Medicine Model of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, a concept suitable for the German situation has been developed, implemented and integrated into other departments of the hospital. The research and clinical care at the hospital is supplemented by an Integrative Medicine Training Academy, offering a number of trainings for physicians, medical students and practitioners as well as an annual Summer School for Mind-Body Medicine. Gustav Dobos, MD is Professor for Internal Medicine and Director of the Department for Internal and Integrative Medicine at Kliniken Essen-Mitte in Essen, Germany. The in-patient department holds 54 beds for patients with acute and chronic internal diseases as well as chronic pain and was established as a model institution for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) of the county of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1999. Dobos is a trained internist, specialized in nephrology and internal intensive care medicine and finished his medical and basic science education at the University of Freiburg, Germany, the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing, China as well as at the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic in La Jolla and the University of California, San Diego, USA. Parallel to his mainstream medical training he was trained in acupuncture, physical therapy, nutritional and complementary medicine as well as in Mind-Body Medicine. In 2004 he was appointed to the Chair of Complementary and Integrative Medicine of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach-Foundation at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. Dobos' scientific interest lies in classical naturopathic medicine, Chinese and Mind-Body medicine. Special focus of his work is the development of evidence-based guidelines in the field of CAM and Mind-Body Medicine.

Jonas, MD President and Chief Executive Officer, Samueli Insitute, Alexandria, VA, USA The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, is a relatively young organization. It was founded on April 4, 1949, in the aftermath of World War II. NATO was formed as a transatlantic security agreement to ensure greater Military cooperation, collective defense, and Euro-pean political integration, with the support of North American allies. NATO is composed of 28 countries with diverse cultural and political frameworks. For the military leadership and the health care professionals in charge of this specific population, it is critical to acquire a better knowledge on these integrative or CAM interventions, and the poten-tial impact of the use of these modalities on military medical pre-paredness. As increasingly medical care within the NATO environment is carried out in a multi-national setting, it is crucial that medical personnel of each nation understand the integrative modalities which may have been used by their patients from other nations, and which in some cases the patients will expect to be provided for them in the NATO environment, as they are at home.PLENARY SESSION07 Biography Wayne B.

Our research team has been studying the regulation of natural health products (also known as dietary supplements) and traditional, com-plementary and alternative medicine practitioner groups for more than 10 years. This presentation provided an overview of the pros (the Good) and cons (the Bad) of regulation including how regulation has the po-tential to both support and impede attempts to provide evidence-in-formed integrative care. It also highlighted a few recent cases where well-intentioned regulators have created significant controversy (The Ugly). Examples will include the attempts to bring additional regulatory oversight to the dietary supplement market in New York State and how regulation of practitioner groups can have significant unintended consequences as in the case of acupuncture regulation in Ontario, Canada. Using a variety of examples, the presentation highlighted key lessons learned that may be helpful in guiding choices of groups seeking regulation and those involved in making regulatory decisions.
