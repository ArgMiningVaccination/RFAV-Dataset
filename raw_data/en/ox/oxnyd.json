The Center aims to achieve this mission through the generation or synthesis of evidence that brings a family medicine and primary care perspective to health policy deliberations from the local to international levels. It is a functioning division of the American Academy of Family Physicians that operates with editorial independence. This project was completed with the support of the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation. The information and opinions contained in research from the Graham Center do not necessarily reflect the views or policy of the AAFP. viExecutive Summary Unlike many Western nations, the United States does not manage or actively regulate the number, type, or geographic distribution of its physician workforce. As a result, medical trainees choose how and where to work. As with most free markets, equitable distribution is at risk without well-informed, evidence-based policies and incentives capable of promoting equitable access to appropriate care. This study contributes to understanding of important policy options and incentives by identifying factors that influence medical student and resident choices about medical specialties and location of practice. Specifically, it identifies factors that are associated with choice of primary care specialties, particularly family medicine, and with caring for rural and underserved populations. Prior studies of the impact of debt on student specialty choice have revealed mixed effects. Recent studies suggest that physician payment disparities and the medical school learning environment are potent factors for specialty choice, and that exposure to Federal Title VII grant-funded programs during medical school and residency is associated with higher likelihood of students choosing primary care specialties and practice in underserved settings. Most studies of specialty choice or practice location focus on the decisions students make at graduation or immediately thereafter. This study is perhaps the most comprehensive to date, as it examines multiple factors along the training path and how they relate to the end result, which is specialty of physician practice and wh ere they practice. This study incorporates nearly 20 years worth of survey data from graduating medical students about their experiences, their debt, their beliefs, and their intentions. It includes historical files over the same period of exposure to Title VII funds during training, and of participation in National Health Service Corps (NHSC). It includes cross-sectional data about physicians' current specialties and practice locations, and a five-year cross-section of service in Rural and Federally Qualified Health Centers. All of these data about individual physicians were brought together to te st for associations between student characteristics and training influences that may have policy releva nce for a more purposefully produced health care workforce. Findings: The income gap between primary care and subspecialists has an impressively negative impact on choice of primary care specialties and of practicing in rural or underserved settings. At the high end of the range, radiologist and orthopedic surgeon incomes are nearly three times that of a primary care physician. Over viia 35-40 year career, this payment disparity produce s a $3.5 million gap in retu rn on investment between primary care physicians and the midpoint of income for subspecialist physicians. There are measurable student characteristics, intentions, and training experiences that are significant predictors of our study outcomes. Rural birth, interest in serving underserved or minority populations, exposure to Title VII in medical school, and rural or inner-city training experiences all significantly increased the likelihood of students choosing primary care, rural and underserved careers. Being married increased the likelihood of choosing family medicine. Attending a public medical school significantly increased the probability of choosing a primary care specialty and practicing in a rural, shortage or underserved area, compared with private medical schools. Title VII exposure in residency increased the likelihood of serving in the National Health Service Corps and physician shortage areas but not primary care or rural practice. Other student characteristics reduced the likelihood of study outcomes. Women are much less likely to choose rural practice, and men are less likely to choose primary care. The outcomes associated with debt were complex. Students with no debt and no obligating scholarships (NHSC or Armed Forces) were the least likely to later practice in primary care, in a rural area or in a health center. Debt above $250,000 also reduced these outcomes compared to other levels of debt. Students who took scholarships and reduced debt were much more likely to have careers in all three. There is a group of students sensitive to debt or agreeable to trading debt for service that chooses NHSC and, possibly, other loan repayment programs. The NHSC is currently only available to 3-4% of physicians despite a much larger applicant pool. Conclusions: The outcomes we studied -- practicing in primary care, practicing in family medicine, practicing in a rural community, practicing in a health center, practicing in an underserved area, ever having served in the NHSC-- are important if we hope to secure access to primary care for all people in the United States. Within the last decade, US medical student interest in and choice of these important outcomes fell well below the thresholds ne cessary to maintain the physician workforce in primary care and underserved settings, threatening to enhance an exi sting workforce maldistribution. The complex relationship between debt and career outcomes likely has several explanations. Medical students increasingly come from affluent families who may influence career specialty and income expectations, and limited exposure to rural or underserved populations. Alternatively, debt-averse students may not apply to medical school due to fear of debt or may choose less expensive public schools. Both suggest a selection bias against our study outcomes--schools may select students less likely to choose these careers, or students more likely to make these choices are not applying. Students willing to accept obligating debt reduction (NHSC, military), are much more likely to later practice and viiiremain in primary care and underserved settings and such programs could be an option for more students and residents. This study reaffirms the positive relationship between Title VII exposure and most of our study outcomes despite severe reductions in Title VII funding. It is an important support for the pr esence and quality of student training experiences and is an immediately relevant policy option that promotes these outcomes as it is currently due for reauthorization. Growing physician income disparities are a major driver of student behavior. It does so directly, but also indirectly through messages abo ut prestige, intellectual rigor, need to increase \"productivity,\" and status. In many academic health centers, primary care is labeled as the revenue \"loss leader\" rather than as a core function or even producer of downstream revenue. This income disparity explains much of the difficulty in achieving the balance in specialty and geographic physician distribution and will continue to inhibit achieving the workforce needed for better quality, efficiency and equity. These potent effects of market factors do not absolve medical schools and residency programs of their role in affecting student choices. We found clear evidence that the student selection process and curriculum are very important in producing primary care physicians and physicians willing to serve in rural and underserved settings. In general, public and rural schools do a better job of producing primary care, rural and health center physicians, which should be an important consideration in the ongoing expansion of medical school capacity and in the design of new schools. They should also be a focus for state and federal funding of programs that enhance their success with these outcomes. Feminization of primary care, particularly pediatrics and family medicine, threatens the rural workforce without efforts to make rural practice a more attractive or viable choice for women. We also need to understand male resistance to primary care careers and how to improve it as an option. Finally, there is a convergence of interest in assuring sustaining healing relationships through primary care among large employers and federal advisory bodies and agencies. Previously unthinkable conversations are happening about investing more in primary care and in specific models of care that can unfetter primary care's capacity to achieve the effectiveness, efficiency and equity realized in other countries. There are also calls for changes in how training is financed and the settings in which training can be supported to purposefully align training with desirable population health outcomes. Both policy efforts\u2014enhancement of primary care functions and accountable training of the next generation of physicians\u2014will be needed to reverse the current trends for more expensive and less equitable health care. We believe that this study offers supporting evidence for these policy efforts and suggests ways that the training pipeline can be modified to help. ixRecommendations: 1.Create more opportunities for students and young physicians to trade debt for service, through effective programs such as the National Health Service Corps. 2.Reduce or resolve disparities in physician income. 3.Admit a greater proportion of students to medical school who are more likely to choose primary care, rural practice, and care of the underserved. 4.Study the degree to which educational debt prevents middle class and poor students from applying to medical school and potential policies to reduce such barriers. 5.Shift substantially more training of medical students and residents to community, rural and underserved settings. 6.Support primary care departments and residency programs and their roles in teaching and mentoring trainees. 7.Reauthorize and revitalize funding through Title VII, Section 747 of the Public Health Service Act. 8.Study how to make rural areas more likely practice options, especially for women physicians. 9.New medical schools should be public with preference for rural locations. xWhen countries at the same level of economic development are compared, those where health care is organized around the tenets of primary health care produce a higher level of health for the same investment.(1)Foreword The United States struggles with an enduring shortage of physicians in rural and underserved areas, and with reliable production of primary care physicians. There is growing concern that these problems will grow worse as fewer graduates of US medical schools choose primary care, as student economic diversity declines in medical schools, and as fewer inte rnational graduates come to the US on visas that obligate them to work in underserved areas. Physicia n maldistribution, by specialty and geography, results in gaps in access to care, gaps that result in health disparities suffered by specific regions, races, and income groups. Sizeable growth of the physician workforce in the last two decades has not resolved the maldistribution, and current efforts to simply train more physicians are unlikely to help. Market forces alone will not prepare our nation to care for the Baby Boom generation or expand the health care safety net to a growing un- and underinsured population. In 2008, the World Health Organization World Health Report called for a return to primary health care, noting that when countries at the same level of economic development are compared, those where health care is organized around the tenets of primary health care produce a higher level of heath for the same investment.(1) The report notes that, \"health care is often delivered according to a model that concentrates on diseases, high technology, and specialist care, with health viewed as a product of biomedical interventions and the power of prevention largely ignored. The results are predictable: unnecessary tests and procedures, more frequent and longer hospital stays, higher overall costs, and exclusion of people who cannot pay.\"(2) Even as States demonstrate a willingness to fund expansion of physician training there is remarkably little direction or funding to purposefully tailor the output to future needs. Meanwhile, the miniscule but critical Federal funding designed to affect physician distribution is in real jeopardy: Title VII funding is reduced to a trickle after the program suffered from inadequate evaluation; Medicare Physician Scarcity Area bonus payments sunset without evaluation or attention; and, Health Professional Shortage Area incentive payments were threatened by a redesignation proposal that was not coordinated with Medicare. The federal government purposefully doubled the capacity of the healthcare safety net over the past decade, xibut failed to coordinate a physician training effort to staff further expansion. Policy makers could purposefully couple these very expensive efforts--physician production and improving health care access- -but need evidence to guide the use of scant resources to good effect. Like the Macy Foundation, the Robert Graham Center is committed to finding evidence-based policy options for healthcare workforce improvement and the related goal of securing access to care for all Americans. This is our first collaboration with the Macy Foundation and we are most grateful for their support of our research. xiiMessage from the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation There is once again a serious discussion about extending health care to all Americans, and there is the real possibility that this time it is going to happen. In this context, the question about whether there will be enough primary care physicians, in the right locations, to serve the needs of the public takes on a greater urgency. With a declining number of medical graduates choosing careers in primary care or willing to practice in underserved areas, it is important to understand the factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of students and residents choosing such career paths. This understanding can then be the basis for interventions that might influence these outcomes in a socially desirable way. The Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation is pleased to have funded this study by the Robert Graham Center. It is one of the most comprehensive assessments of the influences on medical student and resident career choice. It incorporates nearly 20 years of survey data and looks at the final outcomes of type and location of practice rather than the proximate outcomes of residency choices. The results indicate that the determinants of career choice are complex and multifactorial. It is clear that the large and increasing income gap between primary care and specialty care has a negative impact on the decision to enter primary care or to practice in an underserved area. This is not surprising, but the findings from this study should give further impetus to policy and payment changes that would narrow this gap. Beyond this, one of the most important findings of this study is that the content and milieu of the medical school experience do matter in career choice. Medical educators sometimes have taken a fatalistic view that they cannot influence these choices because the y are solely driven by market forces. But this study clearly shows that the nature of clinical experiences in medical school and residency as well as the learning environment itself can have a positive impact on the likelihood of choosing careers in primary care. It is also clear from this study, even with its limitations in the amount of socioeconomic data available, that the characteristics of the students upon admission are important determinants as well. Both of these findings are important messages to medical school leaders to encourage innovations in admissions policies and curriculum at this time of medical school expansion. The role of student debt in the decision making process is extremely complex. In this study, as in several other studies, it has failed to emerge as a dominant factor. I suspect this is because it is powerfully xiiiconfounded by the overlap between the student characteristics that predict debt or freedom from debt and those that predict the likelihood of primary care or specialty care as a career choice. Students most likely to incur high debt are also those most predisposed to go into primary care or to practice underserved areas; and those from the highest socioeconomic strata who are most likely to be debt-free are also most likely to be interested in specialty care a nd in practice sites that afford them a similar lifestyle to that in which they were raised. That said, we have no reliable way to assess who never enters the profession because of prospective debt or the full extent of the negative influence of debt among the subset of students most predisposed to careers in primary care. Targeted programs to address these issues would be highly desirable, and expanded programs to allow recent graduates to reduce debt by providing public services would make good policy sense. This document should serve as an important input to health care reform discussions in the new Obama administration, in Congress and in wider health policy circles. I applaud Robert Phillips and his team at the Graham Center for their excellent work. George E.

practice primary care careers or service to the nation's most needy populations, and where state, federal, and private funding sources can best be used to address these shortfalls. Chapter One What We Know About Factors Affecting Medical Student & Resident Career Decisions Medical schools and residency training programs in the United States produce fewer primary care physicians than subspecialist physicians, and have done so for decades.(3) The popularity of primary care among US medical students has been steadily declining for the last decade, and is now at historic lows.(4) This is especially true for Family Medicine, the broadest primary care field, and the one in which residents are least likely to eventually subspecialize and most likely to care for underserved populations.(5) The imbalance of primary care to specialist physicians in the U.S. physician workforce contributes to high health care costs(3;6;7) and leaves many parts of the country without primary care physician access, especially rural and low-income urban areas. In the coming decades, some have projected a substantial physician shortage in the United States,(8) including primary care physicians.(9) While these projections are debata ble, two things are becoming more clear: 1) There is a problem with sufficient access to primary care physicians in rural and impoverished areas(3); and 2) current practice configuration or organization will have great difficulty absorbing all uninsured patients if universal acce ss is achieved.(10) Now more than ever, it is critical for our nation's future health to understand why most U.S. medical students are not choosing to practice primary care careers or service to the nation's most needy populations, and where state, federal, and private funding sources can best be used to address these shortfalls. Medical students' career decision-making has been discussed and studied extensively. Studies have shown that students' choices of primary care or specialty careers are influenced by student-related factors , such as gender, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, rural or urban background, and attitudes and values (11;12) ; and curriculum factors , particularly exposure to required Family Medicine curriculum during the third or fourth year of medical school.(11-14) Debt studies are mixed but Specialty income difference has been a consistent factor in student specialty choice out of school. Specialty choice 1is also related to institutional factors , such as state funding, Title VII funding, and the strength of Family Medicine departments, which all contribute to the \"institutional culture.\"(13;13;15-19) Studies of student and physician decisions to practice in underserved areas are less extensive, but have uncovered important predictors. Students who grow up in rural areas, plan to choose family medicine at matriculation to medical school, and are male, have historically been more likely to practice rural primary care.(20-24) Similarly, students who grow up in urban underserved areas are more likely to practice in inner cities.(20) Under-represented minority physici ans(25;26) and women(26) are more likely to care for underserved populations. Personal values, spirituality, and mentoring also increase students' likelihood of choosing service careers.(25-27) Finally, longitudinal, comprehensive medical school and residency educational programs with the explicit goals of preparation of students and physicians for underserved practice have demonstrated clear success.(28-33) Despite the importance of these issues, and the understanding gained from previous researchers, significant gaps in knowledge remain about the role of medical student debt, scholarship and loan programs, type of school, curriculum, institutional culture, and potential income on medical students' specialty choices and decisions to care for underserved populations. Medical Student Debt The role of medical student debt in specialty choice has received significant attention, but is most often examined through attitudinal surveys of students still in the process of training. Most medical students carry a debt burden on graduation that is out of proportion to that of other professions, and there is a substantial income gap between primary care and specialist physicians, making a primary care career a relatively poor financial investment.(34) Nearly one in four 2008 medical school grad uates carried more than $200,000 in educational debt, and the rate of growth of debt is out of proportion to most inflation indices or even rate of growth of physician income.(35) Research to date has not consistently demonstrated a convincing relationship between low debt and primary care specialty choice.(36-39) (18;40-46) Likewise, the relationship between debt and service ca reers is poorly understood. One might expect that higher debt would motivate physicians to maximize their income by excluding low-paying patients, such as uninsured and Medicaid patients, and by practicing in affluent areas, where the exclusion of such patients is feasible. Two older studies failed to demonstrate that debt correlated with graduating medical students' intentions to practice in an underserved area .(38;47) However, these studies only examined practice intentions, rather than actual physician behaviors; they examined broadly defined practice locations rather than actual patient panels; and they were performed at a time when student and physician debt levels were significantly lower than they are now. A more recent study, examining the career intentions of graduates in 2002, found that students with higher debt loads were slightly more likely 2to plan to work in underserved areas than their pee rs.(39) Only one study has directly examined the relationship between physicians' debt level and proportion of needy patients, and this study demonstrated that Family Medicine physicians and Pediatricians with more debt were more likely to care for Medicaid and uninsured patients.(48) Although the findings of the latter appear counterintuitive, it is likely that willingness to care for indigent patients and level of debt are both associated with other determinants, such as the socioeconomic status of the physician's family of origin, students' interest in serving the underserved, and loan repayment options. The effect of educational debt on physicians' willingness to care for uninsured and impoverished patients, and act ual practice in underserve d settings, needs further study. A recent, important study on debt was done with law students.(49) In the study, potential students were randomized to one of two financial aid packages of equivalent monetary value prior to enrollment: one offered loan repayment to graduates wh o pursued public interest law; the second offered full tuition scholarships contingent upon students working in public interest law. Randomization was announced prior to enrollment and tuition assistance students were twice as likely to enroll in law school as loan repayment students. Tuition assistance recipients were 36-45% more likely to work in public interest law than were students with loan repayment options. This study was exceptionally well done and suggests that the risk of incurring debt is a psychological deterrent to enrollment for some students, and to choosing non-service careers for graduates. It is difficult to say how well this generalizes to medical students, but it is an important contribution to research on the effects of debt. Scholarship and Loan Repayment Programs Medical students have limited opportunities to benefit from low-interest loans and loan repayment and scholarship programs, including Primary Care Loans, Loans for Disadvantaged Students, state-based loan repayment and scholarship programs, National Health Service Corps loan repayment and scholarships, Armed Forces scholarships, as well as other private loans and scholarships. Federal Primary Care Loans were created to induce medical students to ch oose primary care careers by offering low interest rates to students committed to primary care practice. Loans for Disadvantaged Students are low-interest loans for financially needy students from disadvanta ged backgrounds, rega rdless of specialty or practice intentions. The US Armed Forces offer medical school scholarships and financial support during residency for students who commit to service in the Armed Forces. Since 1972, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) has offered scholarships for students who commit to practice primary care in federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas. In the last decade the NHSC reduced scholarships in lieu of loan repayment, moving the choice to trade debt for service after training has finished. 3NHSC alumni provide vital health care in their spon soring communities and have a high likelihood of continuing to care for underserved populations even after their commitments have ended,(25;50-52) although they are less likely to remain in underserved practice than physicians who initially care for underserved populations without NHSC financial support.(53;54;54) Pathman also demonstrated that state-sponsored scholarship and loan repayment programs support a substantial work force of physicians in underserved communities throughout the country,(55) and that physicians who benefit from state- based financial incentives are more likely than other generalist physicians to practice in needy areas and care for uninsured and Medicaid.(56) A few studies of specific state or Canadian province-based loan or scholarship programs have shown mixed success.(57) The impact of the Primary Care Loan program, Arme d Forces Scholarships, and Loans for Disadvantaged Students has not been studied with regard to career choice and underserved practice. Although the primary purposes of Armed Forces Scholarships and Loans for Disadvantaged Students are to provide medical care for military personnel and provide access to higher education for needy students, respectively, the possible secondary outcome of providing a primary care physician workforce for the nation's underserved is worthy of investigation. In addition, Pathman's study of state programs is the only study to comprehensively examine the national impact of non-NHSC loans. The specialty choices of students who benefit from state-based scholarships and loan repayment have never been compared to those without such support. Institutional Funding There is evidence that students' decisions to choose primary care and service careers are influenced not only by their personal finances, but by the financial structures that underpin their medical schools. As noted above, multiple studies have demonstrated that public medical schools, which are supported by the state and generally view service to the state as core to their mission, generate a larger proportion of primary care physicians than privately funded schools.(58) The proportion of state financial support per student at a given school has also been correlated with the percentage of graduates entering Family Medicine residencies.(16) Public schools also produce more students interested in rural practice(59) and more rural physicians,(60) although public medical education is not predictive of rural physician retention.(61) Since 1976, Title VII funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has provided substantial support for Family Medicine educational progra ms at medical schools in many states. These curricula focus on development of primary care physicians who would care for urban and rural underserved populations.(62) Studies have found strong, sometimes dose-dependent associations between Title VII funding and increased production of primary care graduates, and physicians who eventually practice in rural areas and federally designated physician shortage areas.(13;15;63) The 4Studies have found strong, sometimes dose-dependent associations between Title VII funding and increased production of primary care graduates, and physicians who eventually practice in rural areas and federally designated physician shortage areas. (13,15,63)manner in which it might affect these outcomes is unclear but speculated to be related to curriculum content and to training experiences developed as a result of Title VII funding.(64) Title VII funding was reduced from $92.4 million in fiscal year 2003 to $48.0 million in 2008 and the President's budget typically recommends cutting it out altogether. Specialist / Primary Care Income Gap Physician income disparities are consistently and strongly correlated with the initial specialty choices students make.(65;66) It is unclear how this factor relates to the other factors affecting student choices. Steinbrook recently suggested that this strong, direct correlation between income and specialty choice was related to debt since primary care income can make paying off debt a difficult burden.(35) Institutional Culture Data about the influence of \"institutional culture\" on students' career choices is somewhat limited, primarily because it is difficult to differentiate recruitment from educational effects. Institutional culture is also closely related to funding and to curriculum. Regardless of the underlying contributors, medical schools' institutional culture seems to correlate with career choice. For example, medical schools located in rural areas graduate substantially more rural physicians,(60) and training away from urban centers is believed to be a core component of preparation for eventual rural practice. Schools that graduate a greater proportion of primary care physicians are more likely to: 1) have community hospital teaching sit es, rather than academi c medical centers(67); 2) have explicit primary care missions; 3) have been founded since 1960; and, 4) have Family Medicine departments.(68) Some studies have found an inverse relationship between the amount of institutional NIH funding and the proportion of primary care gradua tes, and NIH funding is hypothesized to be a measurable proxy for the research culture of medical schools.(58) The influence of institutional culture, particularly as it can be assessed independently from other factors, deserves further study. In particular, the influence of residency program (vs. medical school) institutional culture has not been systematically evaluated. Unfortunately, the culture of academic medicine, as a whole, has a negative disposition toward primary care.(69;70) Curriculum Longitudinal, comprehensive medical school and residency educational programs with the explicit goals of preparing trainees for primary care rural and/or underserved practice have demonstrated clear 5success.(23;28;29;71-75) It is difficult to isolate the effect of the educational experiences from the effect of selection of motivated students, but several studies have shown evidence of success beyond that of recruitment alone.(22;31;76;77) Family medicine residents who train in Community Health Centers are also more likely to later care for underserved populations.(33) Although the achievements of these longitudinal education al experiences are commendable, they include only a small fraction of the total number of medical students educated in the United States. Unfortunately, only a few studies have examined the out comes of brief educational interventions, such as isolated rural rotations or exposure to underserved populations, and these have not demonstrated a long- term impact on career outcomes. Both Fryer(78) and Brooks(24) have demonstrated a correlation between participation in a rural medical school rotation and rural practice, but these findings did not control for the effect of interest in rural practice prior to the rotation - which has been shown in other studies to correlate strongly with eventual rural prac tice. In Brooks' study, rural medical school rotation was not predictive of rural prac tice in multivariate analysis. Easterbrook et al found no association between medical school or residency exposure to rural health care and eventual rural practice.(79) Pathman demonstrated that non-NHSC physicians have the same level of retention in rural communities, regardless of whether they completed rural rotations as students or residents.(61) Brush et al evaluated the impact of participation in medical school service-learning activities, and did not find a relationship with specialty choice.(80) Public health and community medicine teaching are increasingly incorporated into medical school curricula, either as requirements or elective experiences. Underserved clinical electives are also widely available to most students. However, it remains unclear whether brief rotations with inner city or rural populations, or curriculum in public health or community medicine, are related to eventual specialty choice or practice with underserved populations. Previous studies substantiate that required exposure to prima ry care in the curriculum influences students toward primary care specialty choices. Multiple studies have shown that implementation of a required clinical clerkship in family medicine increases the proportion of medical students who choose Family Medicine careers. Longer clerkships in Family Medicine appear to be more effective.(81) Similarly, a required outpatient rotation in Internal Medicine increases the proportion of students choosing Internal Medicine careers.(82) (A more recent study found that an outpatient Internal Medicine clerkship made a general internal medicine career appear less appealing to students, but final career choices of these students were not compared to students without such an experience.(45)) Several randomized studies have also demonstrated that longitudinal community primary care experiences increase students' likelihood of choosing primary care careers,(68;81) although these results have not been replicated in all studies.(83) Brief curricular interventions in the first a nd second year do not a ppear to influence specialty choice.(11) 6Students report that mentors and training experiences are also important in their specialty intentions.(45) We recognize that the mentoring and training experiences are very important and are interested in whether Title VII funding makes specific types of experiences and mentoring possible. Medical students often receive negative messages from mentors about primary care and these messages may be influenced by the academic culture and income disparities.(69;70;84) 7Chapter Two Study Aims, Questions, Methods, Limitations Purpose: The purpose of our study is to further examine the impact of financial and educational factors on medical students' likelihood of eventually practicing as primary care physicians and caring for underserved populations. We systematically examined most of the US medical student population over several decades to assess the effects of these factors on student s' practice choices over time, using a very large sample size that will be sensitive to subtle relationships. Specific Aims: 1. To understand whether or not debt at graduation from medical school is predictive of choices related to specialty or location of practice, with work ing in a community health center (CHC), or with National Health Service Corps (NHSC) participation. To assess whether or not exposure to Title VII Section 747 funding modifies the effects of or interacts with debt. Hypotheses to guide our analyses: Hypothesis 1: Higher levels of debt at graduation will be associated with decreased likelihood of choosing a primary care specialty, rural practice location, care for underserved populations, and lower likelihood of current work in a CHC but will increase likelihood of ever having been in the NHSC despite controlling for other factors. The association will be curvilinear, increasing as debt in creases. The effect of exposure to Title VII funds (predoctorate, residency, departmental) on choices related to practice location, work in a CHC, or NHSC participation will be attenuated by debt. Hypothesis 2: Acceptance of scholarships with service commitments, including NHSC and Armed Forces scholarships will be associated with low levels of medical student debt, greater likelihood of primary care practice, service to underserved populations, rural practice, and practice in community health centers. 2. To understand the association of Title VII exposur e in medical school with career choice and with perceptions of primary care training and unde rserved populations while in medical school. 8Hypothesis 3: Exposure to Title VII funding will be associated with greater likelihood of primary care practice, service to underserved populations, rural practice, and practice in community health centers. Hypothesis 4: Students exposed to Title VII in medical school will have measurably better assessments of their training experiences in primary care with underserved populations. 3. To understand how specialty income differences are associated with student specialty choices and to quantify the eventual Return on Investment and Rate of Return of student specialty choices. Hypothesis 5: Differences between primary care and subspecialty income at graduation will be associated with reduced selection of primary care specialty. Hypothesis 6: Subspecialty physicians will have a higher Return on Investment than primary care and debt at graduation will exace rbate these differences. 4. To understand how the type of medical school, the quality of primary care training experiences, experiences with underserved populations in medical school, and interest in underserved populations affect subsequent decisi ons about specia lty and practice location. Hypothesis 7: There will be differences in choice of primary care specialty or in practice location associated with the quality (or presence) of such experiences in medical school Hypothesis 8: Medical school rotations in rural and inner-city underserved locations will predict primary care and service careers. Hypothesis 9: Attending public medical school will be more predictive of primary care and underserved area career. Hypothesis 10: Students' intentions to care for underserved populations and to enter primary care will be highly correlated with later practice patterns. Brief Methods (see appendix A for complete methods): The financial factors examined include medical student debt, scholarships, loan repayment programs, and Title VII funding of medical schools. Educational factors include participation in primary care clerkships, student-assessed quality of these clerkships, exposure to clerkships in rural or inner city 9settings, exposure to Public Health or Community Health curri culum, and education about \"health issues for underserved populations.\" Because previous studies have shown medical student debt to be a complex issue, itself influenced by many factors, the study also examines medical student debt as an outcome variable, evaluating geographic and institutional (public v. private) factors associated with higher debt at graduation. The study also examines the strength of the relationship between stated student intentions in the American Association of Medical Colleges' Graduate Questio nnaire and eventual practice patterns. This should offer better assessment of outcome than many previous career choice studies that rely on student intentions or first year residency positions as outcomes of interest. Finally, we sought and quantify the relationship between career choice and the income difference between primary care and specialist physicians at the time of graduation from medical school. We take this one step further and objectively assess the Return on Investment for choosing a primary care career vs. subspecialty career. Predictive variables are primarily drawn from the American Association of Medical Colleges' Medical School Graduation Questionnaire, which has been administered to most graduating medical students annually since 1972. These predictive variables include total educational debt; the presence of Armed Forces, NHSC, or need-based scholarships; the presence of Primary Care Loans, Loans for Disadvantaged Students, or state-based loans; educational experiences, including primary care clerkships, the quality assessment of these clerkships, and underserved or community medicine/public health experiences; medical school; and residency program. Medical school and residency predictive variables include the presence or absence of Title VII funding during training. We planned to test the effect of university affiliation during residency training as a marker for institutional culture during the residency years (provided by the American Medical Association), a nd the presence of a rural or primary care track in residency; however we were unable to get a sizeable match for these factors with physicians during training. These predictive variables were examined for relationships to the primary outcomes of interest: primary care career choice and care for underserved populations. Career specialty and location (rural vs. urban) data were obtained from the AMA Physician Masterfile. Underserved care is defined to include work in a Community Health Center (CHC), Rural Health Center (RHC), National Health Service Corps (NHSC), federally designated rural or urban Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA), and Medically Underserved Area/Population (MUA/P). These were obtained from Medicare claims data (CHC or RHC) for the period of 2001-2005; from historical NHSC data (1978-2004), and from geographic linkage between the AMA Masterfile and shortage area shapefiles from the US Health Resources and Services Administration. Data on Title VII grant awards were obtained from US Health Resources and Services Administration's Bureau of Health Professions and were previously linked to individual physicians in the AMA Masterfile in a prior study, the methods of which are published.(85) Nine grant types were included 10and grouped into 3 categories: Pre -doctoral Education (\"pre-doctoral grants\"), Department Development (Academic Administrative Unit or \"academic unit gran ts\"), and Residency Train ing (\"residency grants\"). We evaluated emerging variables in stepwise multivariate analysis, including known demographic factors, in order to establish a model demonstrating their interactivity and relative importance in determining students' likelihood of choosing primary care specialties and service to underserved populations. Relative risk calculations were done independent of the logistic regression analysis to explore the relationships between this Federal support for primary care training and the presence and quality of curriculum associated with desirable physician workforce. Relative risk calculations were also used to explore the interaction effects of Title VII, debt and obligating scholarships on study outcomes. Limitations: This study has several real and potential limitations. First, the student response rates to the AAMC Graduate Questionnaire were variable over the last thirty years. We restricted our analysis to those years for which most complete responses were obtained (after 1980 and before 2004). The 310,000 responding students represent more than 2/3rds of graduating allopathic students (Figure 1, Appendix A). We were unable to obtain similar data from the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine and so our analyses exclude osteopathic physicians. Since international medical graduate (IMG) physicians do not attend medical school in the US, and therefore did not complete the Graduate Questionnaire, we excluded IMGs from our analyses as well. Doctors of osteopathy and IMGs make important contributions to the primary care workforce and underserved communities. Many of these excluded physicians are reflected in the incomplete matches for Medicare claims from Federally Qualified and Rural Health Centers (FQHC, RHC), and from the National Heal th Service Corps files (Figure 1, Appendix A). Otherwise, we were remarkably successful (greater than 90% ) in matching study subjects to these important career choices. Since Pediatricians rarely file Medicare claims, our ability to identify their contributions to FQHCs and RHCs is necessarily limited. Largely due to disabled children with social security benefits, we were able to identify hundreds of Pediatricians in health centers, but this may belie the true commitment by these physicians to underserved care. Finally, we did not have access to the AAMC Matriculation Survey Questionnaire data that would have enabled assessment of parental income, education and profession as additional predictive variables. These data would also have provided more complete race and ethnicity data, more about geography of upbringing, and more on undergraduate experiences. This gap in our predictive variable pool also reminds us that the associations we find may be reflective of other missing predictive factors. That said, 11this study is an important step forward in terms of the collection of predictive factors and in terms of being able to connect these to ultimate prac tice specialty and location. 12Chapter Three Outcomes of Current Physician Training Primary Care Between 2001 and 2005, slightly more than 1/3rd of practicing physicians were doing so in primary care (Table 1). A recent survey found that just 2% of students were interested in general internal medicine careers, 4.9% in family medicine, and 11.7% in general pediatrics.(45) Current US graduate interest falls short of maintaining the current proportion of primary care in the physician workforce. As a result, maintaining the primary care physician workforce is increasingly reliant on International Medical Graduates. In 2008, 37.9% of first year residency positions that could potentially produce primary care physicians were filled by International Medical Graduates.(86 ) Of those who do graduate from primary care residencies, an increasing number of internal medicine graduates are avoiding primary care and pursuing subspecialty training and hospitalist careers.(87) Pediatricians are also increasingly subspecializing. In fact, Salsberg estimates that between 2002 and 2006, the percentage of all residents in training who will potentially practice primary care decreased from 28.1% to 23.8%.(88) This loss in production of primary care physicians may join the problem of maldistribution and further erode access to primary care services. Shortage areas Nearly one in four physicians was practicing in a Primary Care Health Profession Shortage Area (HPSA), Medically Underserved Area (MUA), or Medically Underserved Population (MUP) (Table 1). This does not mean that 25% of physicians care for underserved patients in these areas. The MUA and population HPSA designations are often used to designate an area that has many underserved people with poor health outcomes among a much larger and better served population. The MUP and geographic HPSA designations are more specific for isolated, underserved communities and account for just over 3% of physicians. One estimate places the number of people with potentially reduced access to care in these areas at 56 million.(89) There are many federal and state programs that use these designations to place health care resources and incent physician location. Federally Qualified and Rural Health Centers Based on Medicare claims (2001-2005), one in ten practicing physicians work in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) or Rural Health Center (RHC) with the latter having the larger proportion; however we know from the Uniform Data Set, that the full time equivalent physician counts are lower (7,505 FTE physicians in FQHCs in 2006 from UDS vs. 10,642 submitting any Medicare claims).(90) The clinical 13Historically, rural areas have depended more on family physicians than other specialties.(91)capacity of FQHCs increased by 57% between 2000 and 2006 and similar expansion is planned through 2015. The expected capacity to care for 30 million pe ople will require nearly 16,000 more full-time primary care providers. This goal cannot be achieved with the current choices made by graduating medical students and or contributions of the NHSC.(90) Rural Practice Nearly 10% of physicians are in rural practice compared to about 20% of the US population. Historically, rural areas have depended more on family physicians than other specialties.(91) There has been a sharp decline in other primary care specialties choosing rural practice; for example, between 1981 and 2001, the percentage of new pediatricians choosing rural practice fell from 14.6% to less than 1%.(92) The decline in acceptance of rural-born students to medical sch ool and general loss of new graduates to primary care will likely exacerbate the relative access shortage in rural areas. National Health Service Corps Between 1978 and 2005, we were able to identify 2.3% of physicians who served in the National Health Service Corps (NHSC). The majority of Corps participants were medical school scholarship recipients (1.7%) despite the fact that most NHSC physicians now come through loan repayment during or after residency training (0.7%). NHSC scholarship recipients are likely to have lower or no debt, while elevated levels of debt at graduation may be predictive of acceptance of NHSC loan repayment. For these reasons we chose to study them independently. 14Table 1: Physician Specialty, Practice Location and NHSC Service Study Outcomes (Dependent Variables) Percent of Direct Patient Care Physicians Ever primary care physician (2001-05) 35.3% Family Physicians 13.2% HPSA or 24.6% % practicing in Medically Underserved Population area 3.4% % practicing in Medically Underserved Area 14.6% % Primary Care Health Profession Shortage Area (Population) 11.1% % Primary Care Health Profession Shortage Area (Geographic) 3.1% Rural Practice 9.8% Ever NHSC service 2.3% NHSC scholarship NHSC an FQHC or RHC (2001-2005) 10.4% % Federally Qualified Health Center 4.7% % Rural Health Center 5.8% See Tables, Appendix A for full tables of other findings and data sources 15Chapter Four Debt The role of medical school debt in specialty choice and location of practic e has received considerable scrutiny, but remains unclear. Aim To understand whether or not debt at graduation from medical school is predictive of choices related to specialty or location of practice, with working in a community health center (CHC), or with National Health Service Corps (NHSC) participation. To assess whether or not exposure to Title VII Section 747 funding modifies the effects of or interacts with debt. Hypothesis 1: Higher levels of debt at graduation will be associated with decreased likelihood of choosing a primary care specialty, rural practice location, or current work in a CHC but will increase likelihood of ever having been in the NHSC despite controlling for other factors. The association will be curvilinear, increasing as debt increases. The effect of exposure to Title VII funds (predoctorate, residency, departmental) on choices related to practice location, work in a CHC, or NHSC participation will be attenuated by debt. Hypothesis 2: Acceptance of scholarships with service commitments, including NHSC and Armed Forces scholarships, will correlate with low levels of medical student debt and predict primary care and service to underserved populations. Hypothesis 3: Exposure to Title VII funding will be associated with greater likelihood of primary care practice, service to underserved populations, rural practice, and practice in community health centers. Hypothesis 9: Attending public medical school is more predictive of primary care and underserved area career. Findings Debt: The proportion of students with debt and average debt per student rose steadily over the last 30 years (Figure 1). Three out of four students in private and public schools graduate with debt, but for those 16The proportion of students with debt and average debt per student rose steadily over the last 30 years (Figure 1).in private schools average debt is nearly 50% higher (Table 2). For students with any debt, the average in 2006 was $130,000.(93) After adjusting for inflation using the Consumer Price Index and excluding scholarship recipients, we found that the average public school debt ranged from $61,000 - $91,000, and average private school debt ranged from $85,000 - $129,000 (Table 2). As we expected, NHSC scholarship recipients had lower average debt and loan repayment physicians had higher debt than the average student. In the aggregate, debt does not appear to have a notable effect on most of our study outcomes except National Health Service Corps and rural practice. The odds of serving in the NHSC are significantly higher at all debt levels except more than $250,000, likely due to the lower debt levels of scholarship recipients, and higher debt levels of loan repayment ph ysicians (Figure 4). The odds of practicing in a rural area rise as debt level rises but only modestly compared with other factors (Figure 6). Separate analyses for public and private schools revealed two different pictures for the odds of choosing primary care associated with debt. For private schools, odds of choosing primary care practice increases as debt increases, with those havin g no debt (and no scholarships) less likely to choose primary care. For public schools, debt had more of a bell-curve shape. Students with no or low debt (less than $50,000) and those with high debt (more than $150,000) had higher odds of not choosing primary care, while those with debt between $100,000 and $150,000 had the highest odds of choosing primary care. This same pattern remained when we controlled for public school attendance, but the significance was less robust due to the effects of private school (Figure 2). 17$0$20,000$40,000$60,000$80,000$100,000$120,000$140,000$160,000 1979 1980 198119821983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 19921993 1994 1995 19961997 1998 1999 20002001Graduation YearMean Debt (CPI adjusted) Public Schools Private Schools% public ==> 79%.................. 76%............................................ 78%.......... 80%.............................. 80%Figure 1: Mean Debt among graduating medical students who have debt in Public and Private Schools (adjusted with the Consumer Price Index) Table 2: Debt among graduating medical students who have debt and practice location (deflated with the CPI, 1979-2001) Outcome Attended Public Medical School Attended Private Medical School Mean debtMedian debtPercent with debtMean debtMedian Service Corps NHSC scholars had much lower debt on average. NHSC loan repayment recipients were more likely to have debt and had much higher debt than their peers (Table 2). NHSC obligation is to an underserved area, sometimes, but not necessarily in an FQHC or RHC. Participation in the NHSC scholarship program is associated with a quadrupling of the odds of choosing primary care (Figure 2) and family medicine career (Figure 3). The association is even stronger for NHSC loan repayment but this option is chosen in or after residen cy when specialty is more decided. Working in an FQHC or RHC are not the only options open to NHSC physicians but participation in either the scholarship or loan repayment program increases the likelihood of working in either by 3.6 times (Figure 5). Participation in the loan repayment and scholarship programs increases the likelihood of rural practice by 2.1 and 1.9 times, respectively (Figure 6). The scholar program is associated with a small but significant increase in the odds of working in a shortage or underse rved area (Figure 7). Title VII: Matriculation in a medical school during the time that the school received Title VII funding was a proxy for potential exposure to the effects of these funds which are designed to increase primary and underserved care. The logistic regression analysis found the most impressive, independent effect to be a 24% increase in likelihood of NHSC selection for Title VII exposure in residency (Figure 4). Medical school exposure to Title VII significantly increased the likeliho od of a primary ca re career (11%), family medicine career (12%), or rural practice (11%)(Figures 2,3,6). Strangely, exposure to Title VII in residency was associated with significantly reduced likelihood of a primary care career (-42%), family medicine (-6%), practice in a health center (-42%), or rural practice (-10%)(Figures 2, 3, 5, 6). Title VII exposure in residency was associated with a small but significant increase in likelihood of practice in a shortage/underserved area (10%) (Figure 7), which may explain why it had a positive association with NHSC but negative with rural (greater association with NHSC physicians in urban areas). We conducted bivariate relative risk analysis of Title VII exposure in medical school to test for interactive effects beyond the independent effects found in the logistic regression. We found that Title VII exposure is associated with increased likelihood of students choosing primary care careers and for choosing to work in an FQHC or RHC (Figure 8). It does not appear to have a significant as sociation with choosing to practice in underserved areas mo re broadly than health center staffing. The interaction of Title VII exposure, debt and obligating scholarships (NHSC or Armed Forces) produces interesting outcomes (Figures 9a-9c). Title VII exposure is associate d with a step-wise increase in likelihood of choosing primary care or family medicine caree rs when combined with debt or debt and an obligating scholarship (Figure 9a). Practice in an FQHC or RHC is maximized by having an obligating scholarship and is reduced by any debt (Figure 9b). Exposure to Title VII is not associated with health center location when there is no scholarship but is associated with a reduced effect of debt when a student has a scholarship. Title VII exposure is associated with an increase in lik elihood of practicing in a rural area, especially in conjunction with obligating scholarships (Figure 9c). 19Other Factors Physician income gap at graduation: Ebell demonstrated a tight correlation between specialty income at graduation and choice of residency specialty.(65 ) We found that the income gap is a significant and substantial factor in students' eventual practice locatio n and specialty (Figures 2-7). Medical Group Management Association data on physi cian income show that the income gap has grown steadily since 1979 such that the difference between diagnostic radiology or orthopedic surgery and primary care was $250,000 in 2005 (Figure 10). This gap reduced the odds of students' choice of primary care or family medicine by nearly half. It reduced the odds of working in an FQHC or RHC by 30%, and of practicing in a rural area by almost 20%. Only practice in a shortage or underserved area had slightly higher odds with relative expected income at graduation which is largely due to the desi gnations made in areas with poor people and access despite dense physician population (Figure 7). The association between this income gap and most of these outcomes is stronger than debt at graduation. Being male : Being male was associated with a similar odds redu ction of choosing primary care as the income gap, that is to say, the odds of choosing primary care was cut in half for men (Figure 2). The associated effect for choice of family medicine was not as drastic, in that male students were only 13% less likely to choose family medicine (Figure 3). Males had no reduction in odds of working in an FQHC or RHC, and were substantially more likely than women to practice in rural and underserved areas. The majority role that women now play in the Pediatrician workforce may be one of the explanations for why Pediatricians have nearly stopped going to rural and small towns.(92) Rural birth: Birth in a rural county may not necessarily mean that someone grew up in a rural area or that they are wedded to returning to one. This potentially poor and temporally distant marker of rural background is still associated with some important outcomes. It increases the odds of practice in a rural area by 2.4 times and nearly doubles the odds of cho osing Family Medicine (Figures 3 and 6). It increased students' odds of choosing primary care or serving in a health center by approximately 50% and of serving in a shortag e /underserved area by nearly 30% (Figures 2, 5 and 7). For its faults, it is a potent marker if not predictor of students who will make these important choices. It is therefore not surprising that the significant declines of acceptance of rural-born students to medical school overlaps so well with the declines in student interest in choosing primary care, rural practice, and care for underserved populations.(94) Type of Medical School: Attending a public medical school is posi tively associated with most of our outcomes including a 77% increase in the odds of students choosing to practice as Family Physicians and a 66% increase in practicing in a rural area (Figures 3 and 6). Not many medical schools are in rural areas, but graduating from one of them nearly triples the likelihood of practicing in a rural area. Further, 20medical schools that have purposefully built community linkages realize 20% or more increase in the odds of most of our study outcomes. As states con sider investments in the expansion of their existing medical schools, or in building new ones, they would do well to consider these findings if they expect a return on investment related to our study outcomes. Summary: Hypothesis 1: x Higher levels of debt at graduation were not associated with decreased likelihood of choosing a primary care specialty, or current work in a community health center relative to no debt x Higher levels of debt were associated wi th greater likelihood of rural practice x Students with any debt were more likely to participate in the NHSC compared to no debt\u2014lower debt is associated more with scholarships and higher with loan repayment x The interplay of Title VII funding and debt was complicated: o Title VII enhanced the likelihood of work in either an RHC or FQHC and debt attenuated this effect o Title VII enhanced the likelihood of primary care practice and debt enhanced this effect; the two combined with scholarships produced the greatest likelihood. Hypothesis 2: Scholarships were strongly associated with increased likelihood of primary care practice, rural practice, service in health centers and in underserved areas. Hypothesis 3: Title VII exposure in medical school enhanced the likelihood of primary care practice, family medicine careers, and rural practice. Title VII exposure in residency was significantly associated with increased likelihood of community health center service and practice in physician shortage or underserved areas. Title VII exposure in residency was curiously associated with a reduction in likelihood of primary care and rural careers and even had a smaller but significant negative effect for family medicine. Title VII exposure in medical school interacted with debt and scholarships to increase likelihood of practice in rural areas but not of serving in the NHSC. Hypothesis 9: Attending public medical school strongly increased likelihood of family medicine practice and significantly increased all other out comes (primary care practice, health centers, rural practice, and underserve d area practice). Attending a medical school in a rural area substantially increased the li kelihood of future rural practice. 21Figure 2.

Aim To understand the association of Title VII exposure in medical school with career choice and with perceptions of primary care training and unde rserved populations while in medical school. Hypothesis 4: Students exposed to Title VII in medical school will have measurably better assessments of their training experiences in primary care with underserved populations. Aim To understand how the quality of primary care trai ning experiences, experiences with underserved populations in medical school, and interest in underserved populations affect subse quent decisions about specialty and practice location. Hypothesis 7: There will be differences in choice of primary care specialty or in practice location associated with the quality (or presence) of such experiences in medical school. Hypothesis 8: Medical school rotations in rural and inner-city underserved locations will predict primary care and service careers. Hypothesis 10: Students' intentions to care for underserved populations and to enter primary care will be highly correlated with later practice patterns. Findings The presence of Title VII funding to both medical schools and departments of family medicine while students were matriculated proved to have a strong effect on student assessments of their primary care 33Schools and residency programs that can foster interest in serving disadvantaged populations and create training experiences with them may enhance choice of primary care careers.experience regardless of where they ultimately practiced (Figure 11). This supports prior contention that it exerts some of its effect via curriculum and the quality of training experience.(64) Primary care and family medicine physicians were moderately more likely as students to rate their primary care experience as being excellent than were subspe cialists, regardless of where their practice was located (Table 3). Title VII may be an im portant mediator of students choosing primary care careers since it is associated with a greater likelihood of a good primary care experience. Primary care physicians Primary care physicians were more likely as students to express interest in serving minority populations and serving in socially deprived or underserved areas than were subspecialists (Table 3). Interest in service in underserved areas was particularly predictive of primary care careers regardless of whether the physician wound up in underserved area. Interest in certifying in a primary care specialty was not predictive of all primary care specialties but was slightly significant for family physicians. These findings suggest that altruistic student intent may have a stronger association with students who will choose primary care careers than does students' expressed interest in a primary care career. It also suggests that schools and residency programs that can foster interest in serving disadvantaged populations and create training experiences with them may enhance choice of primary care careers. Practice in a Rural Health Center The relative risk of working in an RHC nearly quadrupled for students interested in serving in an underserved area (Table 3). It was also substantially higher if students had clerkships in family medicine, rural experiences, planned to certify in primary care or serve in a socially deprived area. Physicians completing primary care residency were nearly twice as likely to work in a rural health center. Practice in a Federally Qualified Health Center The likelihood of practicing in an FQHC was nearly tripled by interest in serving an underserved population and more than doubled by an interest in serving a minority population (Table 3). It was also significantly increased by school experiences delivering care to underserved people and by inner city and primary care electives (exp eriences selected in the fourth year of medical school). 34Practice in a HPSA or MUA/P The relative risk of working in any one of the four shortage or underserved areas were only slightly increased by interest in serving an underserved population or a community-based rural training experience (Table 3). Focusing on geographic HPSAs, the most pure of shortage areas, intent to serve underserved areas or mino rity populations increased the relative risk by more than two and nearly two, respectively. Training in primary care, community health electives, and highly rating one's primary care elective all significantly increased the relative risk of working in a geographic HPSA. Rural community medicine electives and experiencing a family medicine clerkship both significantly increased the relative risk of practicing in a MUP. National Health Service Corps The NHSC appears to be a strong calling for students with intentions to serve minority populations, to serve underserved populations, and particularly those with an interest in working in underserved areas (Table 3). Each of these was significant multipliers of the relative risk of this outcome. Experiences in community health and underserved populations were robustly associated with an increased relative risk of this outcome. These students were more likely to plan primary care careers and to do primary care residencies. Curiously, the higher the quality of their primary care experiences in medical school, the less likely they were to choose NHSC. Rural Practice Intention to serve underserved populations more than tripled the relative risk of this practice outcome and rural experiences in medical school doubled it. Family medicine and community medicine experiences both had significant effects. Title VII funding is also associated with significant increase in likelihood of rural practice. Summary: Hypothesis 2: Students exposed to Title VII in medical school were significantly more likely to have primary care and family medicine training experi ences and to rate them as excellent or very good compared to students in schools that did not have Title VII funding. Rural experiences were also more likely to occur in funded schools. Students were less likely to have inner-city community medicine experiences in schools receiving Title VII funding than those not receiving funding. Hypothesis 7: While intentions to serve underserved or minority populations were more profoundly associated with an increased likelihood to practice in primary care or underserved areas, there was also a significantly increased likelihood of primary care specialty or 35in practice location associated with the presence and quality of such experiences in medical school. Hypothesis 8: Medical school rotations in inner-city locations increased the likelihood of serving in an FQHC. Rural rotations were associated with increased likelihoo d of most study outcomes, especially rural practice. Hypothesis 10: Intentions to serve underserved or minority populations were profoundly associated with an increased likelihood to practice in primary care, health centers, rural areas, and underserved areas. 36Figure 11.

Hypothesis 3: There will be measurable differences in ROI for students choosing subspecialty careers over primary ca re and debt at graduation will exacerbate these differences. Findings We found that the annual income gap between prim ary care specialties and highly compensated specialists (radiology or orthopedic surgery) is associated with dramatic reductions in choice of primary care careers. Information on this difference is readily available to students. We were interested to understand how this annual difference relates to a career-long difference in the return on investment yielded by students' career choices. People can rarely access information on career ROI, but they see the differences in the lifestyles, offices, and personal property of their physician-teachers and role models. The income gap that stratifies much of society often stratifies the physician community as well, in terms of where they live, the types of cars they drive, and which universities their children attend. It is also reflected in where they work; the \"heart hospital\" side of a medical campus may have fountains and artwork, while the mental image of the primary care offices is a necessarily full waiting room of a practice where physicians see 40 or more patients a day. Many of the cognitive subspecialties that don't have well-reim bursed procedures and technology, or that depend on Medicaid and other low-margin insurance streams, like pediatric subspecialists, share primary care's lower career ROI and struggle to compete for students. Our goal is not to bemoan the career ROI of primary care physicians, most of whom will still occupy the top 10% of the US income strata. It is to show 40the cumulative, relative gap that may be even more important than annual income gap in how it drives student choices. Most of the work on return on investment related to medical careers was done more than a decade ago when the difference between primary care physicians and subspecialists was also a concern. Weeks and colleagues used an economic measure called hours-adjusted net present value (NPV) of educational investment to compare primary care career return on investment with other potential career options.(95) They found that students could expect a poorer financial return on their educational investment by choosing a career in primary care than if they chose a proced ure-based medical or surgical specialty or careers in business, law, or dentistry. The $250,000 difference between the incomes of radiologists or orthopedic surgeons and primary care physicians discussed earlier (Figure 10. Progress of the Physician Payment Gap) is an extreme. Between 2000 and 2004, the average subspecialist income ($286,777) is $125,808, or 78% more per year than the average primary care physician ($160,969)(Table 4). However, for the average physician career the difference in ROI is much more impressive. Using average income data from the Department of Labor Statistics and t he Medical Group Management Association, we found that the average college graduate could expect to make a cumulative net income of nearly $3 million, primary care physician nearly $6.5 million, and the subspecialists more than $10 milllion. The hourly adjusted Net Present Value to primary care physician s was an hourly rate of $29.58 and for subspecialists $74.45 - a 165% difference. This difference is twice as high as the more simple comparison of annual income and has not change substantially in the last 25 years (Table 5). The additional time, expense and opportunity cost of choosing a subspecialty that requires additional training reaps considerable benefit. Choo sing a specialty that requires relatively little more training or expense than primary care, such as Radiology or Dermatology, pays tremendous dividends. Debt plays a role in eventual ROI (as measured by hourly adjusted Net Present Value), but a relatively small role compared to the difference in cumulative earni ng or to opportunity costs of not taking a job straight out of college. It plays a larger role in the ROI for primary care, though, since the same relative debt level will offset a higher proportion of cumulative net earnings. Net Present Value (NPV) is an economic measure of cumulative income adjuste d for opportunity costs. NPV is a traditional business calculation often used to determine whether an investment should be made. It is the difference between the sum of the discounted cash flo ws expected from an investment, and the initial investment. For our purposes: NPV = (net career income) - (adjusted income lost from an average post-baccalaureate career x years in training) - (cost of schooling and maintaining licensure) 41The cumulative income difference between a subspecialist and a primary care physician is nearly the same as the cumulative income difference between a primary care physician and an average college graduate. However, the relative ROI gap between primary care physician and college graduate is smaller than that between the two physician groups. The smaller gap is because the opportunity cost represented by the college graduate's first seven years of income is a much higher proportion of the primary care physician's cumulative net earnings than it will be for the subspecialist. The consistency of the ROI gap between primary care and subspecialty physicians over the three- decades we studied suggests that the findings for the studies done in the early 1990's still hold\u2014that ROI is higher for busines, law and dentistry than for primary care. We did not repeat this comparison but it is unlikely that these three professions will have lost much ground in ROI. This suggests that primary care is not only competing with subspecialty care for our best and brightest students, but with other professions as well. Interestingly, in 2002, when medical school applications dropped to their lowest levels in decades, applications to law schools were peaking and applications to business schools were also rising.(96) These trends have sinse reversed, but with little benefit acruing to primary care. 42Table 4.

The capacity to connect long-term career choice outcomes over 25 years to medical student survey data, AMA Masterfile data, Medicare data, NHSC data, and Title VII funding data is an important step forward in understanding the factors that affect student career choice. It permitted robust re-testing of important past research, and helped begin filling in holes in our understanding. Lessons learned about our outcomes: x Primary care physicians now make up slightly more than 1/3rd of the physician workforce, yet only slightly more than 1/5th of our current students are interested in a primary care career.(45) This discrepancy gives little hope of resolving a long-standing specialty maldistribution or securing patient centered medical homes for all Americans. The resulting dependence on international medical graduates to shore up our primary care workforce is unethical as it directly and indirectly deprives many developing countries.(97) x Less than 10% of physicians practice in rural areas where more than 20% of the US population lives. In 2003, the US Government Accountability Office found that the physician workforce had grown faster than the US population but that this growth had not resolved the geographic maldistribution.(98) Fewer new physicians are choosing to practice in rural areas. x Only 3% of allopathic physicians are currently located in the most underserved of US communities-- geographic Health Professional Sho rtage Areas. The proportio n in Medically Underserved Population areas is similarly small and fewer physicians are serving populations in these areas except through Federally Qualified Health Centers, Rural Health Cen ters, and the National Health Service Corps. x At least one in ten allopathic physicians spends some time caring for patients in an FQHC or RHC. Community health centers are the cornerstone of current Federal policy for securing access to primary care services for the un- and underinsured in the US and considerable resources have been poured into rapidly expanding their capacity. Currently, incentives and policies are not sufficiently aligned for our medical schools and residencies to staff another large expansion. Staffing a rapidly 45enlarged health center network will likely require incentives to shift currently practicing physicians, NPs and PAs into these settings. x Slightly more than 2% of allopathic physicians have served in the NHSC during its first 25 years of existence. This important program was recently reauthorized and is critical to access to care for underserved people. Lessons learned about our hypotheses: xDebt has an important role in shapi ng the career choices for some students, but it does not appear to be a potent factor for most, at least not relative to other important factors. In private schools, increasing debt is associated with increased likelihood of choosing some of our study outcomes. In public schools, the mid-range of debt, $100,000 - $1 50,000, appeared to have the highest likelihood of choosing primary care practice and this likelihood decreased with no debt or higher debt. The gap in average debt between graduates of private and public schools may relate to debt tolerance and how it sorts students into the two types of schools.(49) The lower likelihood of students with no or low debt with our study outcomes may be explained by the types of students who are able to graduate from medical school without debt\u2014 they often come from households with higher socioeconomic status which may influence their career choices. Most are likely to not have rural or underserved life experiences that make such communities career options. There is some evidence that the risk of educational debt deters students from lower socioeconomic families from ever applying to professional school. x Clearly, for NHSC scholars there is a willingness to accept service obligations to avoid debt, and for NHSC loan repayment physicians, to pay off high debt. There is some evidence that interest in NHSC and its trade-off of obligation for reduced debt is a growing interest among students. NHSC physicians had much higher odds of choosing careers reflective of all our study outcomes. The NHSC obligation is typically 3-5 years, but its desirable outcomes are sustaining, well beyond the initial obligation. With current interest in the NHSC and requests for NHSC providers well above offered positions, there is room to expand the program size and offset the effects of debt for many more students. x This study confirms that Title VII , Section 747 of the Public Health Service Act serves an important role in facilitating the choice of primary care, practice in underserved regions, an d service to needy populations. It is a shadow of its former self in terms of funding. Attending medical school receiving Title VII funds was associated with significantly increased odds of all of our study outcomes except NHSC. Attending a residency receiving Title VII funds was associated with significantly increased 46odds of NHSC careers and practice in physician shortage or underserved areas. The latter was associated with reduced likelihood of some important outcomes (primary care and rural practice) which deserves further exploration. Maximizing our study outcomes looks to be best when there is Title VII exposure, debt of any kind, and an obligating scholarship (NHSC or Armed Forces). xTitle VII was associated with better ratings of primary care training experiences in medical school, and improved ratings were associated with greater likelihood of choosing a primary care career and working with underserved populations. While we cannot assume this is a causal link, Title VII may be an important mediator of students choosing primary care careers since it is associated with a greater likelihood of a good primary care experience. x The Physician income gap is a potent damper on all of our study outcomes. It decreases odds of choosing primary care by nearly 50% and most other outcomes by 20% or more. This is consistent with Ebell's findings for specialty training choices.(65) This gap has grown and changing the payment policies that support the widening of the gap has been politically impossible. The higher paid specialties make 267% of the average primary care income. This potent disincentive for careers in primary care and rural settings is being discussed in several policy arenas but requires action to resolve the disparity if improving access, population health outcomes, and health system efficiency are important goals. x The Return on Investment for choosing a subspecialty at the average salary of all subspecialties (lower than the radiology or orthopedic surgery comparison above) produces a net ROI of $3.5 million over choosing a primary care career. In the early 1990's, the ROI for primary care was lower than that for professionals in business, law or dentistry, and likely remains so. Medical students may not be able to cite the relative ROI difference, but they see its fruits in the lifestyle and respect that many subspecialists enjoy relative to their primary care colleagues. The di fference in ROI makes the income disparity between primary care and subspecialties more glaring, its outcomes more understandable, and persistence unconscionable. xTraining in rural locations is important to students' choosing to practice in rural locations and rural health centers. Inner city experiences did not seem to have such effect for any of the outcomes. If rural-born students (2.4 x likelihood of rural practice) interested in serving the underserved (1.5 x likelihood of Rural Health Center) also have rural training experience, it may have multiples of effect. Currently, most schools do not purposefully align these enhancing factors. Schools, residency 47programs, and medical education funders should consider this as they look at curriculum and funding priorities. x Attending public medical school is more predictive of primary care and underserved area careers than private medical school; in fact, it increases the o dds of choosing Family Medicine by 77% and primary care by 27%. To the extent that these outcomes are desirable to state policymakers and legislators, they should study their relevant schools to help inform their funding decisions. They may also want to consider public school models and outcomes if they are considering adding new medical schools. xStudents intent on caring for underserved populations were significantly more likely to do so. For example, interest in underserved populat ions nearly tripled the likelihood of practice in an FQHC and increased the likelihood of serving in the NHSC eight-fold. Interest in serving minority populations, underserved areas and underserved populations increased the likelihood of our study outcomes several fold. Schools should institute a series of interview questions about service to underserved, socioeconomically deprived, rural, minority and inner-city patients\u2014and should give these weight in acceptance. They could also become markers for targeted mentoring and training experiences. Schools should partner with community health centers, area health education centers, and private clinicians to provide related experiences and reinforce student interest. Students could be identified early for specific mentoring and guided to residency programs that can offer clinical, community, and leadership training geared to caring for these populations. Converting knowledge into meaningful policy: A convergence of opportunity? The US Commission on Graduate Medical Education, an advisory body to Congress and the President on postgraduate medical training, advocated for a 15% expansion of allopathic medical school enrollment, and the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) increased the recommendation to 30%. As a result, current schools are projected to expand by 20%(99) and a dozen new schools are in production.(100) Osteopathic training is also undergoing a significant expansion. Several states have committed to investing billions of dollars in supporting expansions of existing schools and building new ones. Federal, state and local policymakers will need other policy levers to correct provider maldistribution in a free market whose forces offer incentives to maximize provider revenue, not access to care. In many cases these policymakers lack evidence to guide their policy. The Association of Academic Health Centers recently recommended that this expansion, and other efforts to increase the health care workforce, should be purposefully directed to producing a workforce designed to improve the health of the public.(101) 48Through this study, we have identified factors that could be purposefully imbedded in the training process to achieve purposeful physician workforce growth. Recently, employer and physician organizations have called for a medical home for all Americans, a daunting task given the inequitable distribution of primary care providers, as Massachusetts recently discovered.(102;103) In parallel to the growing burden of uninsurance, there are an increasing number of Americans who are 'medically disenfranchised' (104;105) Many of the medically disenfranchised consider federally qualified health centers across the U.S. their medical home. The 1000 health centers and their more than 5000 clinic sites are a critical component of the health care safety net. The Federal government has recently invested in an expansion of FQHCs to enhance access to care for underserved populations. It is not clear that these FQHCs will be able to recruit the primary care workforce needed to expand their service capacity.(90) As Congress considers legislation that promotes access to a Medical Home, understanding what predicts eventual service in a medical home for these disenfranchised is essential. Several studies support the important role Title VII training grants play in preparing primary care clinicians to work in safety net settings such as FQHCs, but these studies were un able to account for important factors such as education debt, rural origins and other factors now available to us from the Association of American Medical Colleges. This study reveals the important interactions between these factors and their impact, further validating the role of Title VII funded programs as a key pipeline producing the clinician workforce for FQHCs. In terms of training support, COGME and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) both recently identified the need to increase GME funding flexibility to better support primary care training in the settings where they are needed.(106;107) Specifically, MedPAC offered: Policymakers could consider ways to use som e of these GME and IME subsidies toward promoting training in primary care. For example, a portion could be targeted specifically to support medical residency positions in primary care. Further, a share of GME and IME subsidies could be expressly directed toward training all medical residents on the importance of primary care and interdisciplinary teams, quality measurement, and clinical uses for information technology (IT). Encouragement of geriatric training opp ortunities in nonhospital settings (e.g., nursing facilities) may also be useful. Medical education subsidies could also be used to help pay student loans for clinicians committed to primary care specialties. Primary care providers generally earn lower salaries than their more procedurally based counterparts. Therefore, student loan subsidies could somewhat offset incentives for medical students to select higher paid specialties to help pay off their medical school debts more easily. (page 32) 49All of these options resonate well with our findings and could go a long way toward supporting the Commission on Medicare and Medicaid Services' goals for Medicare beneficiaries. MedPAC also recently began considering how Medicare could help reduce primary care payment disparities, help rebuild its infrastructure, and reap the benefits of primary care: To promote use of primary care and redistribute payments toward services furnished by primary care providers, the Commission recommends that Medicare's payment system for physician services\u2014the physician fee schedule\u2014include an adjustment for primary care. The adjustment would raise payments for selected primary care services furnished by physicians, advanced practice nur ses, and physician assistants with practices focused on primary care. (June 08 report of MedPAC) We hope that these findings will encourage CMS/Medicare and large employers to embrace MedPAC's recommendation to secure the primary care workforce for the future. Recommendations: 1. Create more opportunities for students and young physicians to trade debt for service. The NHSC experience demonstrates a willingness to make this trade and that it has profound effects for needed physician specialty and practice location choices. The most immediate rallying reason is the dire projected need for expansion of community health centers. Certainly, more Federal programs, such as expansion of the NHSC, are needed but states and municipalities could realize much higher return on investments in loan repayment than for building new medical schools as measured by retention and improved distribution. 2. Reduce or resolve disparities in physician income. The current income gap and return on investment disparity significantly and adversely affects primary care, rural areas, and access for underserved populations. The current disparity is the product of insidious payment policy and can be reversed by purposeful payment policy. Countries tha t reduced or eliminated primary care payment disparity realized greater interest and entry by their students and reaped economic and health benefits from investments in primary care. 3. Admit a greater proportion of students to medical school who are more likely to choose primary care, rural practice, and care of the underserved. Our findings and others' suggest that rural-born or raised students are more likely to choose primary care and practice in a rural area. Our 50study also substantiated prior findings that students with demonstrated interest in working with underserved or minority populations are more likely to serve them in practice. We also feel that universities and medical schools have an obligation to expose more rural students to health care professions and increase their ability to compete for medical school. 4. Study the degree to which educational debt prevents middle class and poor students from applying to medical school and potential policies to reduce such barriers. Medical students are increasingly from more affluent families and, despite the high return on investment from attending medical school, the risk of high educational debt may be a barrier for students from less affluent families.(108) Reducing debt during medical training could increase applications from students more likely to choose primary care, rural and underserved careers. A rise in applicants from less affluent families could also increase the opportu nity for their selection (Recommendation 3). 5. Shift substantially more training of medical students and residents to community, rural and underserved settings. This includes support for Title VII (Section 747 of the Public Health Service Act) funding expansion since it supports many of the experiences that promote these important choices. Rural, inner-city and underserved population clerkships and electives are associated with profound changes in students' ultimate specialty and location of practice. Learning experiences in FQHCs, RHCs and Area Health Education Centers can be means of accomplishing these goals. Arranging summer experiences for NHSC scholars after their first year of medical school could be another important opportunity. 6. Support primary care departments and residency programs and their roles in teaching and mentoring trainees. Strengthening the viability of primary care pr ograms and their role in teaching and mentoring of students can provide important expos ure and role-modeling. The large growth in subspecialty programs relative to primary care programs (and contraction of family medicine training positions) since the turn of this century illustrate the biases of training hospitals to bend training capacity to their bottom line. Being responsive to their mission to the health of the public will require strengthening of primary care training and ability to train in appropriate settings. The US Council on Graduate Medical Education and the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee have called for reformation of the 40-year old Graduate Medical Education payment model to better serve the public good. Changes are needed in this nearly $8 billion federal funding stream for training residents to better prepare them for practicing in communities and afford them opportunities to experience working in rural and underserved settings. 517. Reauthorize and revitalize funding through Title VII, Section 747 of the Public Health Service Act. Title VII Funding has languished over the last decad e and is due for reauthorization. There is overwhelming evidence, confirmed in this study, of the beneficial effects associated with this small federal program. It is associated with increased prim ary care selection by trainees, and with rural and underserved practice. This program deserves expansion to secure these benefits and the viability of primary care departments in academic health centers. 8. Study how to make rural areas more likely practice options, especially for women physicians. Female physicians are twice as likely as men to choose primary care but half as likely to practice in rural areas. We need to listen to and learn from young women in medicine about what would make rural areas more of an option. Such research should also explore how to recruit female students more likely to make this choice. 9. New medical schools should be public with preference for rural locations. Attending a public medical school significantly increased the likelihood of primary care, family medicine, and rural practice. Attending a rural medical school was an eve n more potent factor for these outcomes, nearly tripling likelihood of rural practice, and also increased probability of work in a health center. 52Appendices Appendix A: The data, their sources and our analytical methods Overview: Data was extracted from a variety of sources and various data files were match-merged to create a unique analysis file for this study. The major data files included the following: 1. American Medical Association (AMA) master file database (2001-2005) 2. An enhanced 2004 AMA master file database 3. Medicare outpatient institutional claims filed from Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), Rural Health Centers (RHC), and rural primary care hospitals. 4. American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) graduation survey (GQ) database 5. Medical School Title VII Exposure database file 6. Primary Care Medical Residency Training History database file 7. National Health Service Corps (NHSC) participant database file 8. Supplementary data on medical student training costs AMA master file database The Master file database was obtained from the AMA. It is a flat-file database which contains updated information on U.S. allopathic physicians and many osteopathic physicians, including those who are not AMA members. The database is updated using information from medical schools, hospitals, state licensing agencies, medical societies, professional associations, and an ongoing survey of the physician population with each physician surveyed every 3 years. Details regarding administration of the Master file database have been published elsewhere.1,2 Master file variables include for each physician the \"preferred mailing address\" and \"primary office address\" for primary care physicians (family practice, general pediatrics, and general internal medicine), providing active patient care. The AMA has recently gone to great lengths to clean up the work and home 1Pasko, Thomas, Derek Smart , 'Physician Characteristics And Distribution In The US 2005, Amer Medical Assn (December 30, 2004) 2Kletke Phillip, D. Polsky, G. Wozniak, and J. Escarce \"HMO Penetration and the Geographical Redistribution of Generalist and Specialist Physicians, 1987-1997,\" Health Services Research October, 2000. 53address fields in the 2004 Master file. This is the most comprehensive data file available for physician practice location. We used data extracted annually from the database in 2001 through 2005. We excluded from the data: x Osteopathic physicians, x Physicians with an indication in any of the source data files to have died. x International medical graduate physicians not trained in an accredited US medical school. Enhanced 2004 AMA master file database At the Robert Graham Center the 2004 AMA Master file has specific data enhancements used for previous projects through an exclusive data agreement with the AMA. This enhanced data file includes unique identifiers, medical school experience, and up to 6 graduate medical education programs for each physician. We have geo-coded the practice location of physicians to permit both address and geographic locality matches with health center sites. Medicare outpatient institutional claims from Health Centers Medicare data on all physicians filing claims from Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), Rural Health Centers (RHC), and Rural primary care hospitals, from 2001 through 2005, were obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Centers (CMS). We excluded all claim lines that had clinicians with surrogate UPINs as the attending provider - billing for services by non-physician clinical providers, osteopathic physicians, dentists etc.: Anesthesia Assistant, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist, Certified Nurse Midwife, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Clinical Psychologist, Clinical Social Worker, Foreign Doctor (for all non-United States physicians), non-allopathic medical doctors (e.g.: DO, CH, DDM, DDS, DPM, OD), Nurse Practitioner, Occupational Therapist, Physician Assistant, Physical Therapist. We created four extract files for each year of claims data. The first file had one record per physician per year with a Unique Physician Identification Number (UPIN) as the identifier. The second had one record per beneficiary per year and included the beneficiary's zip code. The third was a cross-walk file with one record for each combination of physician and beneficiary from the claims files. The fourth was an aggregate file with one record per he alth center facility or site per year. Each of the first and second extract files were geo-coded to append geographic variables corresponding to each physician and each beneficiary. Geographic variables included whether the physician was born in a rural or non-rural county. 54AAMC graduation survey database We obtained data on the Medical school loans, pre-medical school loans, non-educational loans, and data on the medical school experience from medical students graduating between 1979 and 2004 from the AAMC. We found 75 physicians who completed the GQ twice, between 1994 and 2005. In most cases with double completions (79.45%) there was one year between the completions. We summed the scholarship amounts reported on double GQ completion, deleted the first GQ completed, and kept the second (or last) GQ completed. We then substituted the summed scholarship amounts for the reported scholarship amounts on the second (or last) GQ completion. The GQ field that indicates whether the physician received a scholarship for medical studies was missing for all the GQs completed in 1978, and about 24% of the GQs completed in 1984. For all other years the scholarship indicator is missing for only1 to 3% of the respondents. We excluded all the 1978 GQ data. Medical School Title VII Exposure database We obtained the Medical School Title VII Exposure database from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The HRSA maintained database has the full listing of Title VII awards for the years 1978-2004. We linked individual physicians' medical school and date of graduation data from the AMA master file to the Title VII Funding database resulting in Medical School Title VII Exposure at the physician level for 1979 through 2004. Primary Care Medical Residency Training History database We obtained a Primary Care Medical Residency Training History database from HRSA. The database included information on not only residency prog rams but also hospitals, universities and other institutions affiliated with residency programs. We invested substantial staff time and effort to identify residency programs that received Title VII funding to permit matchin g to residency \"institution codes\" listed in the AMA master file and ultimate analyses of potential exposure by graduates of those programs. This effort included use of the databases maintained by professional organizations, hand searches of ACGME and AMA-FREIDA databases, and reviews of historical files on residency programs. We matched nearly all of the Title VII awards granted to residency programs between 1970 and 2004 for all relevant activity codes available from HRSA. NHSC Participant Database HRSA provided us with a list of all current and past participants in the NHSC. The list includes information whether a physician was a NHSC participant and the type of obligation (i.e. scholarship or loan repayment).We were able to match NHSC participants to the physicians in our AMA master file database 55extracts using name and date of birth (AMA Med Ed number is not available for NHSC participants). For those without date of birth information we were able to match using a simple algorithm. Supplementary data on medical student training costs We also obtained supplementary data primarily to estimate the returns to medical education in the U.S. These data included for example: The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) fees from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) 3. The fees for participation in preparation courses for the MCAT and USMLE licensing exa minations from Kaplan Medical.4 Medical school tuition, fees and medical student expenses from AAMC5, the Cornell University archives6, the University of Pennsylvania archives7, and the University of Puerto Rico.8 Professional medical board certification examination fees from the Board of Medical Examiners and American Board of Family Medicine9, and the American Board of Neurosurgical Surgery10. Supplementary data on for example the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for adjusting the debt data to account for inflation, and compensation for various physician specialties for the 1980s, the 1990s, and the 2000 s, from various Medical Group Man agement Association (MGMA) and AMA sources. Match-merge of data files After match-merging the data files, we estimated relative incomes for the various physician specialties as the CPI adjusted salary for radiologist divided by the CPI adjusted salary for a primary care physician. We deflated individual debt and income data from GQ surveys using the CPI for each year. Residency history data was first merged with all the physician medical residency Title VII exposure data, prior to merging with the AMA master file data.
