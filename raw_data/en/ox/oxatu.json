NOTE: This dashboard is unable to show accurate information due to no longer displaying data of individuals who have received the bivalent COVID vaccine prior to April 18, 2023. The current dashboard includes doses administered statewide, including vaccines supplied directly by the state to various locations and incorporates a long-term care vaccination program operated and supplied by the federal government. Individuals receiving a vaccine have the option to self-report race and ethnicity to their vaccination site. Vaccination sites are required to report that information to the state, whether the individual provided the information or declined to answer. The state is working with hospitals and community partners to improve collection of this information. How to use this dashboard COVID-19 Vaccination Summary The summary page presents the total number of COVID vaccinations administered by dose (see below) and age group. COVID-19 Demographics The demographics page presents COVID vaccinations by gender, race and ethnicity. Data can be filtered by clicking on elements in the legend or in the pie charts. Hit Esc to clear filter selections. COVID-19 Vaccination Trends At the top of the dashboard, click COVID-19 vaccination trends to see the trend of doses administered by manufacturer (pie chart). The year of vaccination and dose filters at the top can be used to easily narrow down date ranges and select doses. Hover over any data point to see exact numbers. Select a manufacturer in the pie chart to see the vaccination trend for that manufacturer. COVID-19 Vaccination County Listing At the top of the dashboard, click COVID-19 vaccination by county to see summary measures by county. The dose filter can be used to narrow the results by dose. Note: To prevent indirect disclosure of identifiable patient information, population counts of five or fewer people have been suppressed. Details about the data Doses administered: Total vaccine doses administered to individuals is not a measure of fully vaccinated individuals. First dose: People who have received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine series. Final dose: When this dashboard was initiated, individuals who had completed the initial vaccine series were considered \"fully vaccinated.\" Today, the U.S. CDC urges everyone to stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccination, which includes receiving updated doses of vaccine which cannot be appropriately accounted for in this data. Population first dose %: First doses completed, divided by the Census population count. Population final dose %: The percentage of \"fully vaccinated\" individuals in the population. Census Population: Based on 2020 Census data. Includes all Maine residents, though COVID-19 vaccine is currently authorized only for people six months and older. None of the vaccines are currently authorized for persons under six months of age. Booster/Additional: This included all doses a patient had received beyond the initial series (First Dose, Final Dose). These include booster doses and additional doses for immune compromised individuals. This also includes the second dose of any three-dose series. Again, as of the latest U.S. CDC changes to the vaccine schedule, this category no longer represents an accurate depiction of anyone who has received additional doses of vaccine post-April 18, 2023.
