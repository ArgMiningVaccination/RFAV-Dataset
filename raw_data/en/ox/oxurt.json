The obj ective was to assess physical and emotional well-being before and after Samyama participation by evaluating psychological surveys and objective health biomarkers. Methods: This was an observational study of 632 adults before and afte r the Isha Samyama retreat. All participants were invited to comp lete surveys. Controls included household signicant others. Surveys were comple ted at baseline (T1), just before Samyama (T2), immediately after Samyama (T3), and 3 m onths later (T4) to assess anxiety, depression, mindfulness, joy, vitality, a nd resilience through validated psychometric scales. Voluntary blood sampling for biomark er analysis was done to assess hemoglobin (Hb), HbA1c, lipid prole, and C-reactiv e protein (CRP). Primary outcomes were changes in psychometric scores, body weight, and blood biomarkers.Sadhasivam et al. Samyama Improves Mental/Physical Health Results: Depression and anxiety scores decreased from T1 to T3, with t he effect most pronounced in participants with baseline depression or anx iety. Scores at T4 remained below baseline for those with pre-existing depression or an xiety. Vitality, resilience, joy, and mindfulness increased from T1 to T3 (sustained at T4). Bo dy weight decreased by 3% from T1 to T3. Triglycerides (TG) were lower from T2 to T3. P articipants had lower HbA1c and HDL at T2, and lower CRP at all timepoints compared w ith controls. Conclusions: Participation in the Isha Samyama program led to multiple be nets. The 2-month preparation reduced anxiety, and participants mai ntained lower anxiety levels at 3 months post-retreat. Physical health improved over the course of the program as evidenced by weight loss and improved HbA1C and lipid prole . Practices associated with the Samyama preparation phase and the retreat may serve as an effective way to improve physical and mental health. Future studies may ex amine their use as an alternative therapy in patients with depression and/or anx iety.

Keywords: meditation, depression, anxiety, biomarkers, Ish a, Samyama, triglycerides, mindfulness BACKGROUND Meditation is gaining credibility as a simple and eective tool to impact health and well-being. Researchers from a variety of disciplines have begun to investigate meditation - related cognitive, psychological, and physiological change s (Brandmeyer et al., 2019 ). As meditation-related research has grown exponentially since the 1990's, there are now over 5,000 peer-reviewed publications from the National Library of Medicine (pubmed.com). Meditation practices may impact factors such as cognition, emotions, perception, and attenti on, and a new eld of contemplative neuroscience aims to elucidat e changes in brain structure and function related to meditati on (Brown and Ryan, 2003; Holzel et al., et al., 2015; Vieten et al., 2018 ). Other researchers have begun to explore the underlying mechanisms of meditation such as impact on inflammatory modulators, cell- mediatedimmunity,andaging( BlackandSlavich,2016 ). The term \"meditation\" may include a variety of practices and the denition may be open to interpretation. For practitioners , meditation is typically a spiritual practice aiming for self- actualization,enlightenment,ortranscendence.Fromasc ientic perspective, meditation is a method for distinct attentional training to improve insight into one's own mental activity (Brandmeyeretal.,2019 ).Meditation,asdenedfromaWestern perspective for studies, may broadly include mantra meditati on, mindfulness training, yoga, transcendental meditation, lipoprot ein; Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale; PROMIS, Patient -Reported OutcomesMeasurementInformationSystem;TG,triglycerides.Meditation has been investigated as a treatment for anxiety and mood disorders. Although current evidence cannot support meditation as a monotherapy, a 2012 meta-analysis by Chen et al. (2012) concluded that it was eective in reducing anxiety symptoms. This is noteworthy, as more than half of Americans will likely experience anxiety or mood disorders over the course of a lifespan ( Alegria et al., 2016 ), and many are seeking complementary and integrative treatment options such as meditation. Meditation was as eective as other alternative therapies for anxiety (exercise, music the rapy, relaxationpractices,etc.)( Chenetal.,2012 ). Despite being recently discovered by the Western world, the practice of yoga has existed for thousands of years. In the Yoga Sutras, a comprehensive set of ancient texts about yoga writtenbyPatanjali,thereareeightlimbsofyoga.Thesein clude: (1) Yama (ethical standards), (2) Niyama from senses), (7 ) Dhyana (contemplation), and (8) Samadhi (union). Yama and Niyama involve what not to do and what to do, respectively, in living. Asana involves physical postures and is most commonly associated with the current Western view of yoga. Pranayama involves breath control and is utilized in kriya yoga practic es. Pratyaharaisaprocessofconsciouslynotreactingtotheexte rnal world. Dharana is the process of focusing on a particular object for an extended period of time. Dhyana, or Dhyan, involves intense contemplation. Many traditions, such as Zen Buddhism , are based on this limb. The eighth limb, Samadhi, involves a sense of unication or consciousness. The combined practice of Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi is referred to as a process calledSamyama. The Samyama process has been around for thousands of years, although it has typically not been oered to the general population.TheIshaFoundationperiodicallyoerstheadvanced Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 659667Sadhasivam et al. Samyama Improves Mental/Physical Health meditation Samyama program to people who have completed previous requirements, and it is an 8-day residential program usually held at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India. In 2018, this program was conducted at the Isha Institute of Inner Sciences located in McMinnville, TN, USA. Samyama is the most advanced meditation program oered by Isha Foundation for the general population, requiring a substantial number of prerequisite programs and preparation to attend. Furthermore, potential participants are evaluated before the preparation process to assess suitability to attend the program. Preparation requires about 2 months of vegan diet and daily practice of hata yoga (physical postures), kriya yoga (breathingandsound),andShoonyameditation(consciousn on- doing). No previous scientic studies have been conducted to assessthephysiologicalandpsychologicalimpactofSamyama. Although the impact of Samyama has not been scientically documented,therehavebeenseveralpriorstudiesdemonstra ting the impact of programs and practices oered by Isha Foundation. In a recent study, our group detected increased endocannabinoid and BDNF expression after Bhava Spandana program (BSP), a 4-day meditation retreat ( Sadhasivam et al., 2020). Participants from a 3-month retreat showed changes in visual attention ( Braboszcz et al., 2013 ) and increased BDNF expression ( Cahn et al., 2017 ). A combination of several practices was shown to improve the cardiac autonomic nervous system and increase the parasympathetic response (Muralikrishnan et al., 2012 ). Other studies have demonstrated physiological and psychological improvements with practice of Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya, a breath and sound-based meditation technique ( Selvaraj et al., 2008; Peterson et al., 2017). One of the prerequisite programs for involves practicing the Shoonya meditation. This meditation is practiced in combination with Shakti Chalana Kriya, a breath and sound- basedpranayamapractice.AlongwithVipassanaandHimalayan Yoga, practitioners of Shoonya meditation showed higher gamma amplitude based on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity (Braboszcz et al., 2017 ) and regular practice of these meditations could lead to states of high brain entropy ( Martinez Vivot et al., 2020 ). Daily practices of Shakti Chalana Kriya and Shoonya, and prior participation in BSP are prerequisites to enrollintheSamyamaprogram.The objective of this study was to evaluate physical and emotional health benets before and after the Isha Samyama program using objective blood biomarkers, and validated psychological tools. Serial assessments through standardi zed surveys and blood biomarkers were performed upon enrollment intheSamyamaprogram,afterthepreparationfortheSamyama program, and immediately and 3 months after the Samyama retreat.Ourhypothesiswasthatpreparationforandparticipati on in the Samyama program would improve physical health and psychologicalwell-beinginparticipants. METHODS Subject Recruitment TheIshaInstituteofInnerSciences(McMinnville,TN)provid ed a list of registrants for the April 2018 Samyama Program. Invitation letters with study information, including a lin k to the online survey, were sent electronically to all registran ts 2-3 months prior to the program. Study eligibility criteria included: Advanced meditation program participants of at leas t 18 years of age (and interested cohabitating spouses/partners ). Study exclusion criteria were: Inability to read or comprehe nd the consent form; subjects with medical conditions in which a blood draw would be contraindicated (e.g., severe anemia) ; active use of marijuana, opioids, or related drugs; use of antibiotics or probiotic/prebiotic supplements within 60 days of enrollment; participants living outside of the country. Spouses who actively participate in meditation were excluded from the spousalcontrolgroup. Potential participants were provided a Study Information Sheet at the beginning of the online survey. They were given the following options: (1) survey-only participation (no blood sampling); (2) survey and blood sampling (requiring two blood samples prior to the Samyama program and two blood samples upon completion of the program); and (3) no participation. This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Indiana University School of Medicine (#1801728792). Participants and controls provided electron ic informed consent for blood biomarker studies at the end of completinginitialelectronicsurveys. Control subjects were the signicant others of Samyama participants, residing in the same household. FIGURE 1 | Samyama retreat timeline.

Surveys Allstudyparticipantsandcontrolscompletedweb-basedsurve ys at four timepoints: (1) baseline (2) and (4) 3-4 months after Samyama; T4. These surveys included 10 scales that have well-established reli ability and validity in the literature to assess depression, anxiety , mindfulness, joy, vitality, and resilience ( Table1). Additional questions addressed gender, race, diet, yoga practice, diet ary restrictions,andoverallhealth/well-being. Depression was measured by the 10-item Center for eight-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Emotional Distress\u2014Anxiety (Short Form) ( Pilkonis et al., 2011). The scale uses a 7-day time frame, and a sample item is: \"I felt fearful.\" The response is coded on a 5-point scale from 1 (never)to5(always). Mindfulnesswasmeasuredbytheve-itemMindfulAttention Awareness Scale (MAAS) ( Brown and Ryan, 2003; Osman et al., 2016 ). The MAAS is designed to assess awareness and observation of what is occurring in the present moment in participants'everydayexperience.Asamplestatementis:\"Ico uld be experiencing some emotion and not be conscious of it until sometime later.\" The response is coded on a 6-point scale from 1 (almost always) to 6 (almost never). The MAAS score is computed as the average of the ve items. Many scales have been developed to measure mindfulness in recent years. Each scale addresses one or multiple aspects of mindfulness and is associated with certain strengths and weaknesses ( Sauer et al.,2013). Nevertheless, MAAS remains the most widely used scale for general and clinical population in scientic research ( Goh et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, although MAAS has been criticized for its uni-dimensionality focusing on the attentional aspe ct of mindfulness( Baeretal.,2006 ),MAASisamoresuitablescalefor the nature of intensive Samyama meditation than other aspect s of mindfulness, such as acceptance ( Sauer et al., 2013 ) and non-judgmental( Baeretal.,2006 )facetsofmindfulness. Joy was measured by the six-item Joy Subscale of the Dispositional Positive Emotion Scales ( Shioata et al., 2006 ). A sample statement is: \"I often feel burst of joy,\" and it is coded on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The scores are computed as an average of item scores with scores ranging from 1 to 7 and higher scores indicating greaterjoy. Vitalitywasmeasuredbythesix-itemSubjectiveVitalityS cale (RyanandFrederick,1997;Bosticetal.,2000 ).Bosticetal.found that the short six-item scale was a better scale. A sample item is: \"I feel alive and vital,\" and it is coded on a 7-point scale from 1 (not at all true) to 7 (very true). The composite score is the su m ofthesixitems,rangingfrom7to42. Resilience was assessed by the six-item Brief Resilience Scal e (BRS) (Smith et al., 2008 ). A sample item is: \"I tend to bounce back quickly after hard times.\" The response is coded from 1 (stronglydisagree)to5(stronglyagree).Thescoreistheav erage scoreofthesixitems. Blood Sampling Study participants who elected blood analysis had 10mL peripheral blood taken at four timepoints as described above. At T1 and T4, blood draws were performed at home by an in-home phlebotomist or at an Isha Center group meditation by study personnel. The remaining samples were collected at the Isha Institute of Inner Sciences (IIIS) before/after the Samyama. All samples were collected using sterile venipuncture technique by physicians, nurses, or phlebotomists. Participan ts who did not submit baseline blood samples were allowed to participate at T2 and T3 (but not T4). Blood samples were de-identied and labeled with unique codes when shared with sources outside of the primary research team. Blood samples were used to assess hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), hemoglobin (Hb), lipid prole [cholesterol, high density low lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides (TG)], and C-reactive protein (CRP). The study controls only had blood draws at T1, T2, and T4, as they did not participate in the Samyama program and the interval between T2 and T3 was not expected to not make signicant dierence. All blood draws for controls were done at home by an in-home phlebotomist and samplesweresenttoIndianaUniversity. Sample Transfers, Storage, and Analysis All blood samples were centrifuged, labeled upon collection by the phlebotomist, and transferred on dry ice to Indiana University. Samples were stored frozen at 80C until analysis wasperformed. Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 659667Sadhasivam et al. Samyama Improves Mental/Physical Health Samyama Participant Recruitment Those who were interested in attending the Samyama program lled out an application with Isha Foundation. Each applicant was then individually assessed by an Isha Foundation instru ctor for suitability to attend the program. The requirement for participation in the Samyama retreat included prior completion of four Isha programs (Inner Engineering, Bhava Spandana Program, Shoonya Meditation, and Yogasanas) and a commitment to continue preparatory practices 2 months beforetheSamyamaretreat. Samyama Participant Dietary Requirements As part of the Samyama preparatory process (60 days before the program), participants were required to follow a vegan diet with atleast50%rawfoodsconsumed.Theywereencouragedtoavoi d foods which may be considered \"negative pranic,\" or negative to life energy, including eggplant, as afoetida, coee,andtea.Additionally,useofalcohol,cigarettes,st imulants, andillicitdrugswasdiscouraged.

Samyama Program During the program, participants were to remain silent for the entire 8-day duration of the program. The program hall was closed to external influences. No specic instructions or programs were given to the controls, and controls did not practiceanymeditation. Statistical Analysis Statistical calculations were performed with IBM SPSS versi on 25.0 (IBM Corporation, Amonk, NY) or SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). To be included in the analyses, a participant was required to have completed surveys at all four assessment timepoints. For analysis of the survey results, repeated meas ures ANOVAs were conducted for each dependent variable with assessment time (T1, T2, T3, and T4) as the within-subjectvariable. The sphericity assumption was not met and thus Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were used. Partial eta-squa red (2) and Cohen's deect sizes are reported. Cohen (1977) provides guidelines for interpreting 2(small=0.01, medium =0.06, large =0.14) and d(small=0.2, medium =0.5, large =0.8). We performed several adjustments on the survey scales as follows. The CESD-10 scale was modied, as Item 9 (\"I felt lonely\") was inadvertently omitted from the administer ed questionnaire; therefore, it was treated as a missing item i n scoring. To assess dierences in outcomes in persons with and without baseline depression scores above clinical cut-o s, depression status (yes =CESD-10 score of 10; <10)wasenteredasabetween-subjectsvariable.The PROMIS Emotional Distress\u2014Anxiety Scale was also modied, as the scores were converted to T scores (mean =50, SD=10) with higher scores indicating more anxiety. A score of 60 (i. e., onestandarddeviationaboveaverage)wasusedasacut-score to indicateclinicallysignicantlevelsofanxiety. Summary statistics of baseline demographics, blood tests, and weights were calculated for both controls and participant s. Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to compare the baseline bloodandweightmeasurementsoftheparticipantsandcontrol s, as well as compare the nal measurements for participants who continued Samyama practices. To assess changes in blood biomarker measurements over time for the participants and the controls, mixed ANOVA models with a xed eect of assessmenttime(categorical)andarandominterceptforsub ject were used to assess each measurement; Sidak adjustment were applied for multiple comparisons for blood biomarker analyses. In order to satisfy the necessary conditions for ANOVA, a ran k transformation was performed prior to analysis for each of themeasurements.

Depression, anxiety, mindfulness, joy, resilience, and vitality signicantly improved with participation in the Isha Samyama program, and the benets lasted for at least 3 months. Triglyceride levels and body weight also improved during the preparation and participation in Samyama\u2014providing objective evidence of the health benets of this program. Samyama participants had 2-3-fold lower levels of CRP throughout the study compared with household controls including at the baseline and at T4\u2014thus indicating lower levels of systemic inflammation observed in meditators despite some of them discontinuingvegandietatT4. Participants maintained a strict vegan diet for 2 months during the preparation for Samyama. The vegan diet has been shown to have anti-inflammatory eects and protect against coronary artery disease ( Shah et al., 2018 ). This diet likely influenced the biomarker results, as participants had improvedHDLandHbA1ClevelsatT2comparedwithcontrols. Additionally, the participants' triglyceride values decrea sed during this time but returned to baseline values by the end of the study. The vegan diet resulted in lower hemoglobin levels compared with controls and the baseline values at T2, but returned to the baseline and clinically normal values at T 3 and T4. The vegan diet preparation is an essential and unique aspect of the advanced Samyama program. Future Samyama participants could potentially benet from vitamin B12 and possibly iron supplements during the 2 months of preparation before the Samyama to maintain hemoglobin levels ( Lederer etal.,2019 ).Thevegandietplayedamajorroleinthesignicant improvement HbA1c and lipid T2. Signicantly lower CRP level observed in meditators persisted 3 months after the retreat at T4 despite most of the participants discontinuin g vegan diet at T3. Furthermore, the favorable inflammatory an d lipid prole parameters seen in the participants from baseline through the Samyama program is potentially due to their vegan diet,yogaandmeditationpracticesthatshouldprotectthemf rom cardiovasculardiseases( Shahetal.,2018 ). There were a few unexpected results in the blood prole. ThoughSamyamaparticipantshadsignicantlylowerCRPlevels at all time-points, they exhibited the higher CRP levels at T3, soon after completing the Samyama program. Samyama is an intensive process with an estimated time of meditation/yoga practice of 15 h/day over the course of 8 days. This likely resulted in acute inflammation in Samyama participants, simil ar to observations made in marathon runners ( Takayama et al., 2018). Higher CRP levels have been linked to increased HbA1c levels (Liu et al., 2015 ). This could help explain why Samyama participantsshowedgreaterHbA1clevelsatT3comparedtoT2. Another interesting trend was that hemoglobin levels incre ased from T2 to T3, thought the vegan diet restrictions were still i n eect.

The most likely explanation is that the study population was relatively health y atbaseline,asmanywerepracticingAsanas,vegetariandiet ,and Ishapractices.ThemeanweightofSamyamaparticipantswas63 kg\u2014far below the 2015-2016 mean American weights reported by the United States Center for Disease Control and Preventio n (89.7kg for men, 77.3kg for women) ( Fryar et al., 2018 ). The participants likely had better baseline blood parameters comparedwiththeaverageAmerican,astheyevenshowedbette r baseline body weight and CRP compared with the household controls. CRP, an indicator of systemic inflammation, was 2- 3-fold lower throughout the 6-month study in the meditators compared with household controls. If more unhealthy people were to participate in the Samyama retreat, we expect that the eectonthesebiomarkerswouldbemuchgreater. The process of preparation for participation in the Samyama program was correlated with positive psychological outcomes. The eects on depression and anxiety are particularly noteworthy, as these conditions are increasingly common in society and non-pharmacologic interventions are being sought. For participants who reported baseline depression, the mean CESD-10 scores dropped precipitously from baseline to T2 (11.53-6.88). This eect was sustained after the retreat, as the mean score (6.76) remained well below the cuto of 10 for clinical depression 3 months later at T4. A similar eect was observed for participants with baseline anxiety, as the PROMIS Emotional Distress-Anxiety-Short Form 8a score remained belowthecutoof60onallsurveysbeyondthebaseline. Itisimportanttoemphasizethatimprovementsinanxietyand depression happened during the preparation phase, from T1 to T2. During the preparation phase, participants engaged in daily practice of hata yoga (physical oved theconditionsofthosesueringfromanxietyanddepression. In addition to reduction in reported anxiety and depression values, Samyama participants expressed improvements in joy, vitality, resilience, and mindfulness. All of these metric s increased from T1 to T3. Furthermore, reported joy was at the maximum value at T4 compared with all other timepoints. The other three metrics reduced slightly at T4 compared with T3, but were still considerably greater than values reported at T1 and T2. This indicates participants sustained positive psychological impacts from participating in theSamyamaprogram.Prior research has demonstrated the impact of yoga/meditation practices on improving stress, anxiety, and depression ( Saeed et al., 2010, 2019; Wielgosz et al., 2019 ). Daily practice of Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya, one of the techniques practiced during the Samyama preparation phase, resulted in reduced perceived stress and increased general well-being (Peterson et al., 2017 ). A one-time meditation session resulted in lower perceived stress amongst operating room professional s (Rangasamyetal.,2019 ).RegularpracticeofSudarshanKriyahas beenattributedtodecreasedanxietyanddepression( Doriaetal., 2015;Sharmaetal.,2017;Hamilton-Westetal.,2019;Shiju al., 2015; Eustis et al., 2019 ). For college students, taking a meditation course resulted i n improvements in mindfulness, happiness, and perceived anxiety (Lemay et al., 2019; Crowley et al., 2020 ). Taken together, these studiesdemonstratethatawiderangeofmeditativepractice scan improve anxiety, depression, happiness, mindfulness, and othe r psychologicalfactors. This study did have some limitations. We could not randomizeSamyamaparticipants,asallinterventions(2mont hs of intense practices, vegan diet, and 8 days of Samyama meditation program) are required aspects of the Samyama program. To match the controls as closely as possible for socio-economic factors, we included the Samyama participant s' household controls who were not meditators and were not required to follow a vegan diet. Another limitation is the relatively smaller size of the control group compared with the Samyama participant group. Blood samples could not be collected from all participants and controls that completed surveys at all-timepoints due to logistical issues, and the b lood sampling was optional. Although we followed the participants and controls for almost 5-6 months in this prospective longitudinal study, the last follow up was 3-4 months after the Samyama program. This study was not designed to assess longer-term benets of Samyama program. Finally, there was a limited number of household controls available for this stu dy and participant numbers decreased over the 6-month study timeframe(especiallyatT4). Strengths of this study include a relatively large study populationofmeditators,prospectiveandlongitudinalfollow-u p for5-6months,serialobjectivebloodbiomarkersmeasurem ents, use of multiple validated wide-spectrum psychometric tools and inclusion of a household control group accounting for match ing socioeconomic status. Although the participation rate at T4 w as low, a total of 195 Samyama participants still completed surveys at all four timepoints over 6 months, making this one of the largest prospective studies of advanced meditation practices . The eect size in reduction of anxiety and depression over Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 May 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 659667Sadhasivam et al. Samyama Improves Mental/Physical Health time was one of the highest report for a meditation program. The study also assessed objective health measures includin g body weight and robust blood biomarkers, rather than simply using psychometric surveys, showing objective dierences in meditatorsovertimeandlowersystemicinflammationcompare d with the household controls. This has not been reported in the literature before, and these results provide objective evid ence of Samyamaeectsonphysicalhealthandpsychologicalwell-bein g. Samyama program participants suering from pre-existing anxiety and depression beneted during the preparation phase. Therefore, further investigation is needed into these pract ices as possible interventions for those suering from clinical anxi ety and/or depression to determine the utility as an adjunctive therapy. Additionally, it would be worthwhile to investigat e the eect of these practices on biomarker expression in a less healthy population, and potential benets in reducing longer- termcardiovascularanddiabeticrisks. CONCLUSION This study assessed two components of participation in the Isha Samyama program (1) the preparation phase with daily kriya, asana and meditation practices along with vegan diet, and (2) participation in 8-days of silent advanced Samyama meditationprogramretreat.Preparationandparticipationint he advanced Isha Samyama meditation retreat cumulatively led to signicantly lower anxiety and depression as well as increas ed mindfulness, joy, vitality, and resilience. These improvem ents were sustained for at least 3 months after the retreat. Addit ional important and objective health benets such as lower systemi c inflammation(2-3-foldlowerCRPlevels),lowerHbA1C,highe r HDL, and body weight were also seen in Samyama participants longitudinally at T2/T3 and as well as when compared with household controls. Two months of vegan diet, yogasanas, kriyas, and meditation preparation for Samyama meditation retreat cumulatively improved HbA1 and lipid proles in the participants while their household controls did not see any improvements (despite sharing similar socioeconomic status over the 6-month study period). The \"positive pranic\" and raw vegan diet together with daily practices of yogasana, kriya, and otherpreparatorypracticeshadasignicantimpactonimportant blood biomarker levels in the Samyama participants. Although themeanhemoglobinleveldroppedwith2monthsofvegandiet in the participants, it returned to baseline at completion of the retreat and 3 months later. Preparation and participation in th e Samyama retreat was psychologically and physically benecia l for a large group of individuals. A relatively small percenta ge of Samyama participants at the baseline had scores representin g high anxiety and depression. These participants were able to reduce their depression and anxiety signicantly and sustai ned the psychological benets 3 months after completing Samyama retreat. Future studies are needed to evaluate the sustaine dlonger-term physical and psychological benecial eects of Samyama in even a larger cohort as well as in those individuals diagnosed with clinical depression and/or anxiety.
