We can all be justly proud of our heritage as the oldest institution of higher education in the City of Boston and one of the few independent colleges specializing in the health professions. 2008 also marks the fifth anniversary of the first class to graduate from the Worcester Cam- pus' accelerated Doctor of Pharmacy program. From this initial group of \"pioneers,\" the cam-pus has grown to almost 500 students in pharmacy, nursing and physician assistant studies. Look for a special feature on Worcester alumni in the summer issue of The Bulletin. MCPHS has a long tradition, but it is also focused on the future, which continues to look brighter than ever before. This fall the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), our regional accrediting body, informed us that MCPHS has received a full 10-year accreditation from the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education. The commission made its decision following a two-year process that included an extensive self-study prepared by the College, a detailed report based on five days of on-site visits to all three MCPHS campuses and a hearing before the commission. Continuing accreditation by regional and professional groups is an important measure of institutional effectiveness and quality. On behalf of the trustees and administration of the Col-lege, I want to thank Michelle Kalis, PhD, who served as Chair of the Self-Study Steering Committee, as well as the many faculty, staff, students, trustees and alumni who contributed to this process through participation on subcommittees and focus groups. Their hard work is much appreciated. The feature article in this issue profiles four alumni whose careers have taken a surprising turn. It is always interesting to see how a degree from MCPHS provides the foundation for so many different professional options, including law, business, government and the media. I hope you enjoy reading about them. As always, I look forward to seeing many of you at future College events. In the meantime, let us know about your personal and professional milestones such as marriages, births and promo-tions. Just drop a note, or send an e-mail to The Bulletin\u2014we'd love to hear from you. Happy New Year and Happy Anniversary, MCPHS! Charles F .

LETTER FRoM ThE PRESIDENT THE BullETin WinTER 2008 3CoRRESPoNDENCE The Famous Foxes Just a note to tell you that you did it again: another feature article on a Fox family, this time our niece and nephew! Ten years ago, in your spring issue, you featured George and me on the front cover of The Bulletin as a couple who met and fell in love at MCPHS. I remember so well your attention to our story that you wrote so well and the array of cameras you brought to our home. We had no idea that we were the cover story until we received the magazine! Now as I read the magazine, which you have im- proved upon so magnificently, I come across a pic-ture and a feature article on Pamela Kilbey-Fox, a Forsyth graduate, who went on to her present posi-tion in public health in the state of Connecticut. I have to say she is as intelligent and compassion- ate as she is beautiful. She is married to George's nephew Dr. Arthur Fox, and they have two beautiful daughters, Shayna and Aleah. You wrote an excellent story about Pamela and her accomplishments, and we thank you for honoring her. You are doing your best to make the Fox family famous. Keep up your good work. \u2014Naomi and George Fox, both BSP '56 Burlington, Mass. It's a Small, Small World... This is coming to you from Richard Scott Cole BSP '92 and Ana Claudia Dacunha-Cole BSP '90. We live in Westport, Mass. with our three children; Joshua 14, Jillian, 10, and Alexis, 3. Richard is a pharmacist for CVS and Ana is a pharmacist for Rite Aid. We recently took a vacation at Disney World, which is where the photograph we are sending was taken. We attended the Reed Conference at Gillette Stadium and had the pleasure to reunite with many former classmates and friends.

Laughter Is the Best Medicine I have worked as a pharmacist in the greater-Boston area for the past 30 years. I'm also a professional stand-up comedian (myspace.com/artiejanuario). I work all over the country (when I can get off the bench). I currently work at Stop and Shop as a floater; my position frees me up to travel. I perform regularly at The Riviera in Las Vegas. I used to think it was just a goofy old wives' tale, but I have personally found that laughter truly is the best medicine. The Bulletin is a nice magazine. \u2014Artie Januario, BS '78 Billerica, Mass. Any thoughts on this issue of The Bulletin? Write or e-mail us. We want to know what you think.

Boston Campus Library Named in Honor of Beloved Alumna The Henrietta DeBenedictis Library was formally dedicated on October 30 before an assem-bly of friends and family mem- bers. Ms. DeBenedictis had great devotion and affection for the MCPHS students who are well-served by the state-of-the-art research and learning resources facility on the Boston campus. Ms. DeBenedictis be- queathed more than $4.5 mil-lion to MCPHS. Her total giving to MCPHS exceeded $6 million. The Worcester campus building at 19 Foster Street was named in her honor in 2000. A 1931 alumnus, she left behind a remarkable legacy of leader-ship and generosity to the Col-lege, and to the profession of pharmacy. As a pioneer among women pharmacists, she was a champion for women in the profession during her 42-year career, and was instrumental in founding the Massachusetts Society of Hospital Pharma-cists. At the ceremony held in the library, Richard D. Kaplan, Dean of Library and Learn-ing Resources, reflected upon the significant evolution in the design, technology and holdings of libraries since Ms. DeBenedictis was a student. Despite these changes, Dean Kaplan noted, the library has remained a central hub for stu-dent research activities. Following the ceremony, a reception and dinner for invit-ed guests was held at the Brant House. In remarks after din-ner, President Charles F . Mo-nahan Jr. reflected on the con-tributions and commitment of Henrietta DeBenedictis to MCPHS. In particular, he Continued on next page noted, \"Her achievements on behalf of women in the health professions, as well as her gen-erosity to her alma mater, will serve as a model and inspira-tion for generations to come.\" President's Conference Room on Boston Campus DedicatedOn October 3, the President's Conference Room in the Bos-ton campus' George Robert White Building was formally dedicated in the names of Ray-mond A. Gosselin BSP '43-II, MS '48, ScD Gosselin MS '53. Mr. Gosselin was the second full-time presi-dent of the College, a position that he held for more than 15 years. He presided over the first modern expansion of the College, acquiring Hampden College of Pharmacy in 1977 and changing the Massachu-setts College of Pharmacy charter to include allied health sciences in 1979. Ms. Gosselin was the first woman to hold a faculty position at the Col-lege and the second woman to head the Massachusetts Phar-macists' Association. More than 50 members of the Gosselin family, friends, business associates and MCPHS officials took part in the dedication proceedings. Guests visited the President's Conference Room to review newly installed plaques and photos of the Gosselins, as well as to view a historical DVD retrospective of the Gosselins' relationship with the College. The program of events contin-ued in White Hall with formal remarks delivered by Ms. Gos-selin, her son Jack Gosselin, Thomas E.

The service can be found at www.massmedline.com or toll free at 1.866.633.6799. Lt. Gover - nor and former Worcester Mayor Tim Murray, a longtime supporter of the MassMedLine program, spoke at the event, which included a demonstration of the service's online tools and hotline. The website and hotline feature detailed information about six topics: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol), hypertension, and medication safety. New topics will be added regularly. A unique Ask the Phar - macist online tool allows residents to submit questions directly to licensed pharmacists. \"We are very excited about this new format in which patients can learn about their condition and ask questions from the conve-nience and privacy of their own home,\" said Mary Sullivan, Director of MassMedLine. \"Our goal is to continue to enhance access to critical health information for residents across the state, and we hope that both patients and caregivers will utilize the service.\" MassMedLink to Health was made possible by The Health Foun- dation of Central Massachusetts, which awarded an $84,500 grant to MassMedLine in December 2006. The service targets patients with issues of adherence, compliance and affordability through in- dividualized and interactive technology and utilizes existing Mass- MedLine clinical pharmacy staff. The Web service and hotline won't be restricted to office hours, and brochures promoting the new ser - vices are being distributed to patients and health care professionals across the state.Lt.

Some you may see fre-quently at alumni events. Others you may see in The Bulletin every now and then. If you live in New England and recognize Jim Morelli BSP '83, it's no fluke. He's been on your TV screen. Mr. Morelli has been a reporter for WCVB-TV (Channel 5) since February 2004, covering all kinds of stories. Any New Englander worth his or her salt knows that means pretty much everything: snow storms, car accidents, politics, and, of course, the Red Sox. \"As a reporter, you get to be a part of some amaz-Editor's Note: The College is proud of our more than 16,000 alumni who live in all 50 states and 41 foreign countries. For this issue of The Bulletin, we selected four graduates whose career paths have taken surprising turns, whether geographic, political or organizational. The common thread is that they all credit their success to the education they received at MCPHS. Photo by George Rodrique.ing things,\" Mr. Morelli said. Growing up in Thomaston, Conn., Mo- relli dreamed of becoming a musician or a politician. Becoming a pharmacist wasn't usually included in those dreams. One Sep-tember morning he found himself standing on Longwood Avenue outside the doors of MCPHS. \"It was so long ago, but I still remember it so clearly,\" he said. \"The way the sky looked, the way the air smelled. It was such a pristine late summer day.\" Clar-ity, he says, quickly gave way to confusion, especially in science. \"I was always the guy in chemistry class whose final product never weighed what it was supposed to weigh,\" Mr. Morelli said. \"How I passed college physics remains one of the greatest mysteries of my life.\" But, he did pass physics, and every other course he took. After graduating, he took the boards, got licensed and went to work as a pharmacist. Mr. Morelli quickly realized, though, that he yearned to do something else, and grappled with that for two years. He would figure out what that something was on a summer night at T ufts University. He had enrolled in a master's program and picked up an elective writing course, cho-sen, in part, because the description sug-gested it would involve \"only light intellec-tual lifting.\" \"Hey, it was summer,\" Mr. Morelli jokes.Half-way through the first class, Mr. Mo- relli realized he wanted to be a writer. So, he became one, initially covering town meet-ings and the like for community newspa-pers, then moving on to magazine, public relations writing, and even fiction. T ruth would soon turn out stranger than fiction, as a somewhat chance encounter would lead to a new career. And a wife. One day, while working as a chain-store pharmacist in the late 1980s, a familiar look-ing woman walked up to the prescription area. She wanted help choosing contact lens products. \"That was the ruse, anyway,\" Mr. Morelli said. He swore he'd seen her face before. That's because he had seen her face before. She was Linda Ciampa, daughter of well-known MCPHS alumnus Walter Ciampa BSP '57. Mr. Morelli had worked at Walter's pharmacy in Cambridge a few years earlier. Need more coincidence? Lin-da's brother Joe (YOG) and sister Susan BSP '84 also graduated from MCPHS. As it happened, Ms. Ciampa was a TV writer with WHDH-TV (Channel 7), and Mr. Morelli had seen a blurb about her in the Boston Herald just a few days earlier. There she was, pretending to be looking for contact lenses, but actually looking for Mr. Morelli. After the \"chance\" encounter, the two dated, got married and now are the par- ents of 5-year-old Will, who is \"growing up much too fast,\" he said. Mr. Morelli's route to WCVB would prove to be much more circuitous. In 1992, Ms. Morelli got an offer to work at CNN in Atlanta. Mr. Morelli followed, but he didn't enter the TV world until 1996. That year, he combined his two areas of ex-pertise and published a home guide to com-mon poisonings. The book led to several media appearances, including one on the \"Oprah Winfrey Show.\" Bitten by the TV bug, Mr. Morelli accept- ed a part-time, temporary job at the CNN Airport Network. As associate producer, he wrote and produced a few five-minute newscasts, which an anchor then recorded. As he watched the anchor read his words, he figured he could do just as good a job, if not better. He began practicing reading the news, put a tape together, and took it to the President of CNN/Headline News. \"He pretty much told me to get lost,\" Mr. Morelli said. Undeterred, he kept making tapes and bugging the President until one day he blew up at Mr. Morelli. Months later though, something shocking happened. The Presi- dent offered him a job as weekend overnight an-chor. \"That job didn't last very long, but it opened the door to so many other things,\" Mr. Morelli said. Mr. Morelli later began reporting for one of CNN's feature units, anchoring for CNN Radio and writing for Headline News. From there he moved to reporting for the CBS affiliate in Atlanta, a true \"break-ing news\" station, for three years. \"It was a crazy three years\u2014and I loved every minute of it,\" Mr. Morelli said. In February 2004, he made the move to WCVB, where he is a weekend reporter and has covered widely-watched events like the Blizzard of 2005 and the Boston Red Sox historic World Series win in 2004. What's the best thing about working in TV news? \"First and foremost, the camaraderie.\" Field crews\u2014which consist of the reporter, the photographer and the live truck oper-ator\u2014spend a lot of time together, and often in difficult situations, Mr. Morelli said. \"You quickly develop deep and lasting friendships.\" Truth would soon turn out stranger than fiction, as a some-what chance encounter would lead to a new career. And a wife. THE BullETin WinTER 2008 15olyMPiCS 16 THE BullETin WinTER 2008During a golf game at the Pitts- field Country Club in 1978, Peter N. Foss BSP '67, owner of two Pittsfield, Mass.-area drugstores, had an unexpected offer by Jack Welch, soon to be the chairman of General Electric (GE), one of the world's largest companies. \"He encouraged me to join GE and said he thought it would be a good fit,\" recalls Mr. Foss, who had known him for 10 years. It turns out Jack Welch, whose business man- agement skills as GE's CEO became legendary, was right. Today Mr. Foss, who has served for 29 years in a variety of capacities, and has seen GE grow from a $25-billion company to a $170-billion company, is President of GE's Olympic Sponsor-ship and Corporate Accounts. He is responsible for coordinating GE's global Olympic Sponsor-ship as well as serving as the GE interface with the National Football League (NFL) and leading a team whose goal is to develop and implement growth strategies with a select group of GE's strategic global customers. He spends half his time out of the country, mostly in Beijing, China, site of the 2008 Sum-mer Olympics. Other cities he visits frequently are Vancouver, Canada, host of the 2010 Winter Olympics, and London, England, host of the 2012 summer Olympics. \"Of all the positions I've held this one is the most fun,\" he said. GE, a diversified technology and media com- pany that employs more than 300,000 people worldwide, is the exclusive provider of a wide range of products and services for staging the Beijing games, including energy distribution, power generation, lighting, security and water treatment. GE also supplies hospitals with ultra-sound and MRI equipment to help doctors treat athletes. NBC Universal, a division of GE, is also the sole U.S. media partner of the Olympic games. Both partnerships extend through 2012. In Beijing, GE is contributing to more than 335 infrastructure projects. Working with China's National Development and Reform Commission, for example, GE is using environ-mentally sound technology for several projects, including filtration systems for clean drinking water and rainwater recycling at the National Stadium; solar-powered lighting at Fengtai Softball Field; water processing technology to recycle water for Olympic Green landscaping; Peter N. Foss BSP '67and high-efficiency energy units at Jing Hui Garden Hotel for the media. \"We love the Olympic movement and are happy to support it,\" said Mr. Foss. \"Our combined monetary support is about $3 billion for the upcoming three games.\" (Log on to www.ge.com/innovation/ china/index.html to see and hear Mr. Foss and other GE employees talk about the projects under-way in Beijing.) According to the website, China is invest-ing $40 billion on new subway, airline terminals, and 12 new stadiums, hotels and housing to accommodate the 1 million visitors ex-pected in Beijing. The goal for Beijing, and the other two Olympic venues, is sustainable development. \"A city wants to have a positive legacy after the Olympics are over,\" Mr. Foss said. \"Barcelona was a city that benefited dramatically by hosting the Olympics, and it's now a popular tourist destination. It's quite an undertaking. This is a chance for China to demon-strate to the world its capabilities and willingness to partner for growth.\" Regarding the College's planned trip to China (see page 13), Mr. Foss said he thought it would be a most enjoyable, well-organized trip. Having the proper visa documentation was of utmost im-portance. \"Beijing is a beautiful city and is a busy, busy, place,\" he said. Mr. Foss attended MCPHS, a college recommended by the Foss family friend, alumnus Philip S. Hart PhG '33, PhC '35, who was President of Hart's Pharmacy in Williamstown and was an MCPHS benefactor. At MCPHS, Mr. Foss was the recipient of the John L. Thompson and Sons, Inc. Scholarship and the Johnson and Johnson Award. He still can recall a few of the principles outlined in the Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy textbook and a few of his professors: Charles Bauer \"one of the smartest\"; Mitchell Stoklosa \"easy to understand and very good with students\"; and Joseph Goodness, who taught busi-ness and \"wore a carnation in his lapel.\" \"The College gave me a mean-ingful education that taught me to dig into details and become a logical thinker,\" he said. After graduation from MCPHS, Mr. Foss purchased Magner's Store in Pittsfield, and was co-owner of Lee Pharma-cy in Lee, Mass. with Mark Wheeler BSP '74. By 1977, he had divested himself from both stores. \"I had always been interested in business,\" he said. Prior to his cur- rent position, he was President of GE Polymerland, the commercial organiza-tion representing GE Plastics in the global marketplace, for six years. He was an early adopter and leader in e-commerce. His other roles at GE include introducing Lexan\u00ae film in the 1970s, and he was the Market Development Manager on the ULTEM\u00ae introduction team in 1982. In Columbus, Ohio, he worked with GE Superabrasives as the General Manager of Marketing. He also served as the Regional General Manager for four of the GE Plastics regions, includ-ing leading the GE Plastics effort in Mexico in the mid 1990s. Working in Mexico, Mr. Foss recalled the enormous changes taking place with the North American Free T rade Agree-ment (NAFTA) and the pleasure he derived from mentoring GE employees. \"It was very fulfilling to help people develop skills and ultimately their ca-reer,\" he said. \"Mexico was an incredible learning experience.\" n THE BullETin WinTER 2008 17\"Of all the positions I've held, this one is the most fun.\" \u2014Peter FossGoverNMeNTFrank Case BSP '59 of Nottingham, N. H. earns $100 a year in his new position, but he's not complaining. He's delighted. \"It's great; I always wanted to run for office and be involved in the legislature,\" said Mr. Case, who was elected to a two-year term in the New Hampshire General Court (House of Represen-tatives) in November 2006. And in a twist on political candidacies within families, he ran for the legislative seat of his wife, Peg, who retired after serving in the New Hampshire House for 15 years. After the election, as the only pharmacist in the General Court, Mr. Case was immediately assigned to the Health, Human Services and Elderly Affairs Committee, where he reviews bills pertaining to pharmacies, nursing homes, mental illness, and lead poisoning, to name a few topics. The busy committee, which meets two or three times a week, acted on 67 bills during the past session. He is proudest of the electronic prescription bill signed into law in September 2007 by Governor John Lynch. Now that the law is in place, the New Hampshire Board of Registration in Pharmacy can regulate its usage. \"The electronic prescription law is my pride and joy,\" he said. \"It's a great law. It takes a lot of errors out of the process. We were happy to get it through.\" His committee passed the electronic prescription bill, and it was forwarded to the New Hampshire Sen-ate, where it also passed easily. However, an amendment 18 THE BullETin WinTER 2008was tacked onto the bill, and it had to be reviewed by the Committee of Conference, where three House and three Senate members hashed out the differences. He was one of the House members on the committee. \"I thought it would be a slam-dunk but it wasn't,\" recalled Mr. Case. \"I spent a lot of time on it.\" The New Hampshire Legislature meets six months of the year, from January to June, three days per week, but lawmakers often spend more time than required attending hearings when the legislature is not in session. As a member of the Governor's Com-mission to Study Childhood Lead Poisoning Preventions, Laws, Policies and Standards, he is often traveling to meetings around the state. After graduation from MCPHS, Mr. Case and his classmate Jack Ross BSP '59 bought Raymond Drugstore in Raymond, N.H. from his father, Frank Sr., and operated the store from 1959 to 1984. \"Being a phar-macist is a great life,\" he said. \"It all started at MCPHS. It's a wonderful school. My education opened a lot of doors. It taught me how to think.\" At that time, as an unpaid lobbyist for the New Hampshire Pharmacists' Association, he attended many hear-ings regarding pharmacy issues, and he loved being part of the process and vowed to run for office in the future. In 1984, he sold the store and joined Unicare. He retired from Uni-care in 2003 and began working as a pharmacist for Northeast Pharmacy in Concord 10 hours a week, and in the summer of 2006, started cam-paigning for the Rockingham Dis-trict 1 seat being vacated by Peg Case. He attended selectman meetings and traveled around the four towns, Candia, Deerfield, Northwood, and Nottingham, where he set up booths at town events, and handed out health literature and in-formation about his credentials. He logged 1,927 miles on his car that sum-mer, talking with his prospective con-stituents. \"It's a lot of fun talking to people,\" said Mr. Case. \"I'm a people person, I have been all my life.\"Prior being elected, Mr. Case served on the Raymond School Board and as the Raymond town moderator. His philosophy re-garding public service is simple: he believes if a community helps you earn a living, you should give back in some way. And if you are enjoying yourself in the process, all the better. \"Being an elected representative is a wonderful learning experience,\" he said. \"I feel very fortunate and very happy to be part of it.\" n \"It all started at MCPHS. It's a wonderful school. My education opened a lot of doors. It taught me how to think.\" \u2014Frank CaseFrank Case BSP '59 Representative Case and Governor John l ynchKnown for its sublime landscapes, savory cheeses and tempting chocolate, Swit-zerland is also one of the few places in the world where dental hygienists can practice independently. And Forsyth alumna Janis M. (DiCarlo) Meier DH '74 was the first (and still the only) hygienist to open a practice in the picturesque Canton of Zug, located just southwest of Zurich, Switzerland's financial center. After graduating from Forsyth, Ms. Meier practiced dental hygiene in Boston and White Plains, N.Y., before relocating to Switzerland in 1981. \"I was one of more than 200 dental hygienists from the United States, Canada and Australia who brought the benefits of professional preventive dental care to Switzerland, Germany, Lich- tenstein, and other European countries\" in the 1980s, she says on her website\u2014www.dentalhygiene-zug.info.ms. She became active in the Swiss Dental Hygien-ists' Association while working in private practice in the towns of Luzerne and Aargau for more than 20 years. When the Canton of Zug approved independent practice, Ms. Meier jumped at the opportunity to open her own office in September 2005. Her teenage daughter Eve helped set up her website, which contains useful information on oral health and the profession of dental hygiene. Still a Red Sox fan, Ms. Meier also loves Switzerland's national pastime \u2014skiing. The favorite part of her job?

Monahan Jr. and Acting Provost Michelle Kalis, PhD, were on hand to welcome the group. \"The College has made a major commitment to nursing education and has experienced a 30 percent growth in the nursing program alone over the past two years,\" President Monahan told the attendees. \"Our goal is to help address the national nursing shortage by offering high-quality, accelerated programs for both high-school graduates and second-career professionals.\" During Radiologic Science Week in november, the Madame Curie lec- ture drew a record crowd of more than 200 registrants, including area radiologic science professionals as well as MCPHS faculty and students. The ASRT-accredited programs included \"Radiation Protection in the Heal- ing Arts,\" presented by Frank A. Ascoli, M.S., medical physicist, technical engineer, and Radiation Safety Officer at Radiation Oncology Associates, inc. in Providence, R.i.; and \"Can't We All Get Along and Sing a Song: Dealing with Conflict in the Workplace\" by laura Carwile Aaron, PhD, RT (R)(M)(QM), program Director and Assistant Professor of Radiologic Tech-nology at northwestern State university in Shreveport, la. This program expands upon the College's continuing edu-cation offerings in the radio-logic sciences, which in the past two years have included a one-hour Radiologic Science CE program and a CT imag- ing course attended by both students and professionals in the field. The Alumni and Continuing Education departments presented two programs for recent pharmacy graduates. The classes of 2006 from Boston and the classes of 2003 and 2006 from Worcester/Manchester were invited to join classmates for a complimentary networking reception, dinner and for many their first postgradua-tion session on pharmacy law. The Boston gathering was at Brant House, and the Worcester/Manchester classes enjoyed the beauti-ful view from the Fuller Conference Hall in the Borysek Living and Learning Center. This fall the class CE initiative will provide not only an opportunity for networking but also a professional de-velopment component.

THE BullETin WinTER 2008 21A beautiful fall day brought out more than 200 pharmacists, MCPHS students, faculty, alumni and other pharmacy and industry professionals for the fourth annual Fall Health Care Symposium. Held at the Sheraton Colonial in Wakefield, Mass. on November 1, the symposium has become a regional favorite, attracting nationally known speakers. The full-day program included presentations by Dennis Lyons, Vice President for Alumni and Professional Affairs, who provided an update on the College's recent projects and initiatives, and Andrew Kroger, MD, MPH, Coordinating Center for Infectious Disease, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who traveled from Atlanta, Ga. to present \"CDC Initiatives: Prevention and Guidelines for Immunization.\" Other topics covered included immuniza-tion, preventing medication errors in children, bipolar depression, obesity and pharmacy law. Par-ticipants were able to receive additional credits by participating in the poster session, where MCPHS faculty and sixth-year PharmD students were on hand to present their posters based on this year's theme Patient Safety. Added to this year's event was an exhibit hall where more than 15 pharmaceutical companies, pharmacy and organization representatives greeted participants and answered questions about their products and services. \"The College strives to provide high-quality continuing education programs that are interactive and designed to help satisfy licensing and certification requirements,\" said Dawna G. Burrus, Direc-tor of Continuing Education. See page 22 or visit the MCPHS website to view a list of CE programs scheduled for 2008.Fall Health Care Symposium Sets Another Record Patient Safety was the theme of the poster session at the fourth annual Health Care Symposium. Esther Wilkins Symposium The inaugural Esther Wilkins Sympo- sium was held on Saturday, November 17 at the Boston campus and was attended by an audience of 190 dental hygienists. The first presenter was the namesake of the symposium, Dr. Esther Wilkins DH '39, who lectured on \"Dental Caries: The Periodontal Infection Connection.\" The author of the textbook Clinical Practice of the Dental Hygienist, now in its ninth edition, Dr. Wilkins graciously autographed copies of her book. She is an adjunct professor at Forsyth School of Dental Hygiene and an internationally recognized lecturer in dental hygiene. During the lunch break, many par- ticipants took the time to tour the new state-of-the-art dental hygiene clinic at MCPHS, opened and named in 2005 in honor of Dr. Wilkins. Anna M. Pattison RDH, MS, Associ- ate Professor and former chair of den-tal hygiene at USC School of Dentistry, was the presenter for the second half of the day-long symposium. Professor Pat-tison, a Forsyth benefactor, presented \"Advanced Periodontal Instrumentation: New T echnologies, New Instruments\" to rave reviews by participants. Although alumni come from near and far to attend Continuing Education events, one globetrotter trav- eled all the way from italy for november's Esther Wilkins Symposium. Mary Rose Boglione DH '70, a native of Plymouth, Mass., just couldn't miss this year's event! A former student of the symposium's namesake, Ms Bo- glione has lived in italy (one of only six Forsyth alumni who currently do so) since her graduation from Forsyth's Dental Hygiene program in 1970. At that time, there was only one dental hygiene school in the country; when the second opened in 1971 at the university of Bologne, she was tapped as a founding faculty member\u2014along with two other Forsyth alums. \"A degree from Forsyth was like a degree from MiT or Harvard,\" she said. She spent her summers bringing italian dental hygenists here to Bos- ton, to learn about the prestigious Forsyth program and facilities. She continued teaching at the university of Bo-logne for 10 years, while also assisting Jerry Kramer to teach the first series of italian peri- odontal courses. She currently works in a private clinic in Florence, and is also a dental consultant for a pharmaceuti- cal company. She has been honored to host symposium speakers Esther Wilkins and Anna Pat- terson in her adopted country, but this was her first visit back to Forsyth since 1999\u2014and therefore her first glimpse of the newly renovated clinic. She was very impressed, but expected no less from a place she dubbed \"a good calling card!\" Symposium Draws International Crowd!

Ms. Ronshagen's easy smile and mild manner belie the strong list of accom- plishments and leadership initiatives she has taken in the field of pharmacy, for which she was commended at the 2007 Commencement ceremony in Worcester. Ms. Ronshagen was awarded the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences College Medal \"for her contribu- tions to the practice of health-systems pharmacy through leadership positions at Elliot Hospital, Catholic Medical Center and Optima Health; for her outstanding service to the citizens and practitio- ners of new Hampshire as Vice President of the new Hampshire Board of Pharmacy; for her exemplary leadership roles in such national organizations as the American Pharmaceutical Association, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties and national Association of Boards of Pharmacy; for her unselfish contributions to public health through voluntary service to the American Cancer Society, Health Education Consortium, new Hampshire Diabetes Association and new Hampshire Heart Fund; for her many honors, including Pharmacist of the Year from the new Hampshire Pharmacists' Association, Hospital Pharmacist of the Year from the new Hampshire Society of Hospital Pharmacists and the Alumni Achievement Award from Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences; and for her dedication as an alumna of the College who has served as a member of the Col-lege Corporation, President of the Alumni Association and Chair of the Education Committee of the Board of Trustees.\" \"i knew that i wanted to be a pharmacist from the time i was a teenager work- ing the soda fountain at a local Manchester pharmacy,\" she said. \"i thought it would be a great profession for a woman, and i was right. My boss was a female pharmacist who knew Dr. Stoklosa, and she introduced me to Massachusetts Col- lege of Pharmacy. i graduated from high school, set my sights and never looked back.\" When Ronshagen recalled her early years at the College, she smiled. \"in the 1960s, in most classes, students were seated alphabetically, with the girls in the front of the class. There were 12 females in a class of 150 students.\" Today, women account for 68 percent of the student population on the Boston, Manchester and Worcester campuses combined. \"it's been amazing to watch the transformation,\" she said. \"MCP didn't have dorms in those days, so during my first year i stayed at the students' house on the Fenway near Forsyth. it was a dorm for women who attended college in the area. For the next three years i lived in an apartment with other MCP women.\" For her senior year, Ms. Ronshagen readjusted her living arrangements, moved back home, and commuted to college. After graduation, she decided to stay in new Hampshire until she knew where she wanted to settle. \"As time passed i found it hard to leave,\" she said. \" i had a very nice life; the mountains, the ocean and the city of Boston were all within an hour's drive.\" Thirty-seven years later, Ms. Ronshagen remains in new Hampshire, working in the field that captured her interest as a young adult and today remains her passion and focus. Since 1996 she has served as the Coordinator of Pharmacy Systems at Elliot Hospital in Manchester, where she is responsible for the accuracy and security of all of the hospital pharmacy's clinical, productivity, information and drug databases. Throughout her professional career she has also held part-time positions in retail pharmacies in an effort to keep her finger on the pulse of the needs in the com- munity. \"in the late 70s, early 80s i reconnected with my alma mater by becoming active in the new Hampshire MCPHS Alumni Chapter and a member of the Cen- tury Club. i was then invited to join the MCPHS Alumni Board [she has served as a member, chairman, vice president, president and director emeritus] and became a preceptor for students. For the last 20 years, in addition to taking on various roles on numerous committees, Ms. Ronshagen has served on the 20- member College Board of Trustees, to which all constituencies of the College are accountable. \"When Charlie Monahan became President, his vision and energy were contagious,\" she said. \"The College has grown so much and now includes 3 campuses. it's incredible what we have accomplished since his tenure began.\" \"it's been a wonderful career, reflects Ms. Ronshagen. \"it's terrific to see that pharmacists are being utilized more extensively than ever before in clinical set- tings. The doctors are actually consulting with the pharmacists and asking for help. if i could make one suggestion to current students entering the profession, it would be get involved. Be a trendsetter. Be a leader in making the changes neces-sary to the future of your profession. Don't sit back and let others decide what your future will be.\" \"Be a leader in making the changes necessary to the future of your profession.

Pagliuca PHG '28, MD, HON '82, passed away in his beloved hometown of Medford, Mass. He graduated from Massachusetts College of Pharmacy in 1928 - just one year before the stock market crash that started the Great Depression. Among his fellow MCP graduates was Edward Breck from Springfield\u2014who would go on to invent Breck Shampoo and help launch a whole new trend in women's hair fashion. Soon after becoming a registered pharmacist in 1929, Mr. Pagliuca entered Boston's College of Physicians and Surgeons, which later become the Tufts University School of Medicine. Over the years, Dr. Pagliuca and his wife, Caro-line, became major benefactors of Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sci-ences. They established two scholarship funds, including one that is still the largest in the history of the College. Several generations of students from Medford and surround-ing communities have benefited from the Pagliuca's generosity, including at least two current members of the MCPHS faculty, who were awarded Pagliuca scholarships as undergraduates. \"I love the College,\" Dr. Pagliuca once said. \"That's where I received the best education.\" And the College, in turn, loved him and will be forever grateful for his generosity in helping students achieve their professional dreams.Friday, June 6 Stay tuned for more details...
