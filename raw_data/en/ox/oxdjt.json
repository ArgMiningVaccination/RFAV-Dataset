Physical medicine is a hands-on approach to medicine utilizing physical touch and soft tissue manipulation to provide pain relief and relaxation of your nervous system. Re-aligning your skeletal muscular structures can promote your body's innate ability to heal itself. Individuals with health concerns such as muscle strains, arthritic and other types of pain, as well as detoxification and immune support may benefit from physical medicine. Dr. Perrine has obtained extra training and certifications and in advanced physical medicine modalities through various institutions. Physical Medicine Therapies Include: Visceral manipulation VM assists functional and structural imbalances throughout the body including musculoskeletal, vascular, nervous, urogenital, respiratory, digestive and lymphatic dysfunction. It evaluates and treats the dynamics of motion and suspension in relation to organs, membranes, fascia and ligaments. VM increases proprioceptive communication within the body, thereby revitalizing a person and relieving symptoms of pain, dysfunction, and poor posture and may help improve digestion and elimination. Naturopathic manipulation A safe and effective technique to realign the body's skeletal system. Muscle energy stretching This stretching technique helps retrain hypertonic muscles Kinesio taping Therapeutic elastic taping can help retrain and support the body while allowing the body to continue to move freely (whereas conventional athletic taping is rigid and restrictive) Craniosacral therapy Using a soft touch which is generally no greater than 5 grams - about the weight of a nickel - practitioners release restrictions in the soft tissues that surround the central nervous system. CST is increasingly used as a preventive health measure for its ability to bolster resistance to disease, and it's effective for a wide range of medical problems associated with pain and dysfunction. Ozone Therapy Medical Ozone therapy involves the use of medical grade ozone gas to provide increased oxygen to cells of the body. Cells need oxygen to function. Ozone helps oxygenate the tissues contributing to cellular regeneration and energy production. \"Researchers have shown that ozone therapy improves blood circulation and oxygen delivery to ischemic (low oxygen) tissue, improves oxygen delivery, induces mild activation of the immune system, up regulates cellular antioxidant enzymes, and stimulates neuro-endocrine pathways.\" Resources: - David "}
