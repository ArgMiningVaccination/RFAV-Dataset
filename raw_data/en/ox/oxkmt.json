its intention to learn from the experience of its participants. One element of information- gathering which contributes to this learning is survey administration to patie nts and their certifying health care practitioners in the program. These surveys are sent three months after the patient's first medical cannabis purchase and capture information on the types and degree of benefit and negative effects the patient experienc es as a result of medical cannabis treatment. An additional survey asks patients who have not purchased medical cannabis for two months whether they have discontinued treatment, and what their reasons for doing so may be. This report contains results of t hose surveys for patients who initiated participation in the program during its first three months: July - September, 2015. Though the number of patients is relatively small (n=435) response rate was quite good for both patients (55%) and health care prac titioners (29%). Results shared here should be considered an early look; reports later in 2016 and early in 2017 will include both larger numbers of patients and broader sources of data, including patient reported changes in specific symptom severity score s over time. Patients and their certifying health care practitioners (HCP) were asked to rate the benefit they received from medical cannabis on a scale from 1 (no benefit) to 7 (a great deal of benefit). Overall, both patient and HCP perceptions of benefi t were quite high: 88% of the 238 complete patient reports and 69% of the 142 complete HCP reports chose a score of 4 or greater. Among the top three qualifying conditions (muscle spasms, cancer and seizures), cancer patients appeared to gain the greatest benefit from medical cannabis. Patient -perceived benefit scores were compared with the HCP -perceived benefit scores in the group of 78 patients with completed data for both scores. A high level of agreement was found between patient and HCP perceptions of benefit: 4% of patient -HCP pairs agreed the patient received no or little benefit (score of 1 -2); 14% agreed the patient received mild or moderate benefit (score of 3 -5) and 45% agreed the patient received significant benefit (score of 6 -7) from medical cannabis. Patient and HCPs also had opportunities to report the most important benefit to the patient. Most of these reports cited direct benefits (reduction of symptoms related to the qualifying medical condition). Notably, comparison of benefit scores and most important benefits showed that symptom improvement was seen at relatively high degrees of benefit (most scores were above 4). Many patients and some HCPs, however, indicated that the most important benefit to the patient was an indirect benefit, such as improved quality of life, sleep, mobility, cognitive functioning, or reduced anxiety. As with benefit, patients and HCPs were asked to report on type and severity of negative effects related to medical cannabis use. Reported negative effects were not frequent: 20% of patients and 16% of HCPs reported some type of physical or mental harm; most negative effects were reported at low levels (scores of below 4 on a scale from 1 (no negative effects) to 7 (great deal of negative effects). EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 9 Review of the 84 responses to surveys sent to 204 patients who made their first purchase in the first three months of the program and had a 2 -month pause in purchasing showed that 51% of respondents intended to continue medical cannabis treatment. Reasons for pausing trea tment included a variety of responses, though cost was the most common reason. Of the 16 (20%) patients who planned to discontinue treatment, most reported low levels of benefit from the treatment. Early survey results from the Minnesota Medical Cannabis Program suggest that many patients have experienced substantial benefit from medical cannabis through the program. Even if non - responding patients and HCPs had a much lower perception of benefit than respondents, still a high degree of benefit would be reported for a large proportion of the whole patient group. These data also suggest correlation between patient perception of benefit and HCP perception of benefit. Furthermore, reported negative effects from medical cannabis use were generally minor, sugges ting that medical cannabis treatment has been a safe option for most patients in the program so far. EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 10 Background In May 2014, Minnesota became the 22nd state to have a medical cannabis program. Distribution of extracted cannabis products in liquid or oi l form to qualified, enrolled patients began July 1, 2015. Minnesota's medical cannabis program is distinct from other states in its statutory design to study and learn from the experience of program participants. The program's online registry, which integ rates information from the patient, certifying health care provider and manufacturer, prov ides centralized data capture. The program registry is designed to have patients to complete a self -evaluation questionnaire detailing severity of symptoms related t o their qualifying medical condition, side effects related to medical cannabis treatment, current medication history, and other medical conditions. One goal of the research program is to build on this information through qualitative self -reporting by patie nts. Given that participating health care providers are required to maintain clinical follow -up with the patients they certify, the research program also aimed to collect their observations on their patients' experiences with medical cannabis. The survey d ata included in this report are among the data that will be used to describe program impact during the first year of operation as well as the program's long -term experience. Patient Experience Survey and Health Care Practitioner Survey Utilizing expertise within the Minnesota Department of Health, the Office of Medical Cannabis developed a Patient Experience survey, which captures information on benefits and harms of program participation. A parallel survey for each patient was developed for their certifying health care practitioner, which captures similar information from the clinician's perspective. The surveys include multiple choice and open- response questions; health care practitioners were also asked to provide any clinical observations they noted abo ut the patient's experience with medical cannabis. Healthcare providers familiar with the program provided feedback as part of the development process. Continued Use Survey In order to capture information on patients who may have chosen to discontinue medi cal cannabis treatment, a brief Continued Use survey was also developed. The Continued Use survey is distributed to patients after two months of no medical cannabis purchasing activity. This survey asks patients about the degree of benefit they received fr om medical cannabis, whether they plan to discontinue treatment, and about the nature of their reasons for either discontinuing or pausing medical cannabis. EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 11 Survey Methodology The surveys are provided through an online platform, three months after the patient's first medical cannabis purchase and are accessible through the subject's registry page and through introductory emails containing unique links. To maximize survey submission rates, the survey can be submitted with incomplete responses to any of the questions. Each of the surveys is available online to the recipient for 45 days. Patient recipients receive reminder emails after one week; after two weeks with no response, paper copies of surveys are mailed to the recipient. Survey Data Preparation Surv ey responses from patients and health care practitioners on perceived benefits and perceived negative effects were reported in free- text format; each response was individually reviewed and classified into a category of benefit or negative effects. Reported benefits typically included either direct improvement of symptoms related to the patient's qualifying condition (direct benefit) or health improvements not directly related to the symptoms of the patient's qualifying condition (indirect benefit). Based on the patient's qualifying condition, the patient and HCP reports of benefit were categorized as either direct or indirect benefit. In this report, we examine both overall perceptions of benefit, as well as direct and indirect types of reported benefit. Reported negative effects related to medical cannabis use typically included reports of physical negative effects, mental negative effects, issues related to accessing medication, and other complaints related to the Minnesota program. This report discusses th e different types of negative effects reported by patients and HCPs. EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 12 Patient Experience Survey and Health Care Practitioner Survey Results Surveyed Patient Population and Response Rate A total of 435 patients made their first medical cannabis purchase i n the first three months of the program (July 1 - September 30, 2015). These patients were approved between June 1st and September 28, 2015. Of these 435 patients who received surveys, 241 (55%) responded. Of the 345 health care practitioners (HCP) who cert ified these 435 patients, 94 (27.2%) completed surveys for 169 (39%) patients. Since program enrollment, 29 (7%) of these patients passed away; these patients were included in this report, as in some cases caregivers or relatives and HCPs completed surveys, reflecting on the patient's experience for whatever duration the patient did use medical cannabis.

Response rates for the Patient Experience and HCP surveys varied widely across age group, qualifying condition and race and ethnicity (Tables 1 -3). The numbers of survey responders for some conditions were very small (including glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, ALS, Cro hn's disease and terminal illness); thus, the inferences that can be drawn from their experience are limited. EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 15 Patient and HCP Perceptions of Benefit from Medical Cannabis The Patient Experience and HCP surveys both ask respondents to report how much bene fit they believe the patient received from using medical cannabis, on a scale from 1 (no benefit) to 7 (a great deal of benefit). Figures 1 -20 show the distribution of benefit scores on this scale, as reported by patients and HCPs, for patients of all qual ifying conditions and for each qualifying condition. A note on how proportions were calculated: the number of responses reflected in Figures 1 -20 show only patient and HCP survey responses with completed benefit scales; this excludes 3 patient surveys and 27 HCP surveys (HCPs could respond to this question by selecting a \"0\" option which indicated that the HCP did not have enough information about the patient to answer the question of benefit.) Also, Fig. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 represent pat ient responses within the group they describe and therefore report on a different group of patients than the corresponding figures representing HCP responses (Fig. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20, respectively) with some patients excluded and added i n from the HCP response sets. A later section will analyze separately the patients with completed survey responses from both patient and HCP (Table 4). As shown in Table 4, the majority of patient and HCP responses in each condition report some benefit fro m medical cannabis, though the degree of benefit varies widely across conditions. Furthermore, comparison of patient reports and HCP reports of benefit for each condition shows that health care practitioners and patients have different perceptions on degre e of benefit.

Proportion of Patients and HCPs Reporting a Benefit Score of 4 or Greater Condition Patient HCPs Muscle Spasms 88% 50% ALS 100% Percentages were calculated based on the total number of patient or HCP survey responses which contained completed benefit scores. This excluded 3 patient surveys and 27 HCP surveys. EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 17 All Qualifying Conditions Figure 1 represents all patient responses (n=241); figure 2 represents all HCP responses (n=169). Overall, the majorit y of both patient and HCP survey respondents report some degree of benefit from medical cannabis treatment; the differences in distribution of the benefit scores between the patient reports and HCP reports is partially explained by the fact that Figure 1 a nd Figure 2 represent different patient populations. Nevertheless, it appears there is generally more conservative reporting of benefit among HCP respondents. Figure 1. Patient -Perceived Benefit: All Conditions (N=238) Figure 2.

Of the groups of patient and HCP respondents who were certified in the program for severe muscle spasms, 88% of patient resp ondents and 79% of HCP respondents indicated a benefit score of 4 or greater from medical cannabis treatment.

EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 19 Patients with Seizures Figures 5 and 6 show patient -reported benefit scores (n=75) and HCP -reported benefit scores (n=38) for patients certified in the program for seizures. In this group, 79% of patient respondents and 37% of HCP respondents for the seizure condition group indi cated a benefit score of 4 or greater from medical cannabis. Among the three largest condition groups represented in the survey results (along with muscle spasms and cancer), seizure patients represented in the survey responses seemed to have the lowest di stribution of benefit scores associated with medical cannabis treatment. Comparison of benefit between patients with seizures 25 years old or under to older seizures patients can be found in Appendix A: Comparison of Benefit in Older and Younger Seizure Patients.

Ninety -five percent of patient respondents and 71% of HCP respondents for the seizure condition group reported some benefit from medical cannabis. Among the three largest condition groups represented in the survey results (along with muscle spasms and seizures), cancer patients represented in the surve y responses appear to gain the greatest benefit from medical cannabis treatment.

EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 27 Patient Versus HCP Perceptions of Benefit from Medical Cannabis As previously noted, 98 patients (23%) who made their first medical cannabis purchase before 9/30/15 had submitted a Patient Experience survey and their certifying HCP had also submitted a survey. Of these 98 patients, 78 had complete patient and HCP reports on perceived benefits. Table 4 shows the intersection of patient benefit scores and HCP benefit scores in three categories of benefit: scores of 1 or 2 were considered \"no or little benefit,\" scores of 3 -5 were considered \"mild or moderate benefit\" and scores of 6 or 7 were cons idered \"significant benefit.\" Of the 78 patients with both types of benefit scores, 49 patients (63%) show agreement between the patient benefit score and the HCP benefit score: 3 patients (4%) have scores in agreement over no or little benefit; 11 patient s (14%) have scores in agreement over mild or moderate benefit and 4 patients (5%) have scores in agreement over significant benefit. Table 4. Distribution of patient -reported benefits and HCP -reported benefits on patients for whom both surveys are complete (n=78).

These data exclude patient survey results for patients whose HCP did not complete a survey as well as HCP survey results for patients who did not complete a survey. Figures 21 -29 report aggregated data, but compare patient responses and HCP responses for the same subset of patients with both types of survey completed.

EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 37 Direct Benefits from Medical Cannabis Treatment In both the Patient Experience and HCP surveys, patients and their certifying HCPs had an opportunity to describe the most significant benefit to the patient that is associated with medical cannabis treatment. Each response was reviewed and classifi ed into broad cat egories of symptom improvement (by condition), or indirect benefit, which included all health benefits unrelated to the relief of symptoms directly associated with the patient's qualifying medical condition(s). Table 5 summarizes the repor ted \"most important benefits\" which could be considered a direct benefit (defined as a benefit which directly affects the symptoms related to the patient's qualifying condition) from reports of both patients and HCPs. For patients with severe muscle spasms , reports of spasm reduction or pain reduction were considered to be direct benefits. For patients with seizures, reports of fewer seizures, less seizures, or both, were considered to be direct benefits. For patients with cancer (regardless of whether their condition was associated with severe/chronic pain, nausea or severe vomiting, cachexia or severe wasting, or some combination), pain reduction, nausea and/or vomiting reduction, and weight gain and/or appetite improvement were considered direct benefits of medical cannabis treatment. For patients with Crohn's disease, pain reduction, weight gain and/or appetite improvement, and reduction in related symptoms including stool frequency were considered direct benefits. For patients with ALS, reduction in pain or spasms were considered direct benefits. In patients certified for glaucoma, reduction in intraocular pressure or reference to treatment of glaucoma \"symptoms\" was considered a direct benefit. For patients with terminal illnesses, reduction in nausea an d/or vomiting and weight gain and/or appetite improvement were considered direct benefits. For patients certified for HIV/AIDS, reduction in pain, nausea and/or vomiting, and weight gain and/or appetite improvement were considered direct benefits. Finally, in patients with Tourette syndrome, reduced tics or specific mention of reduced Tourette symptoms were considered direct benefits.

Percentages in each cell are based on the total number of patient or HCP survey responses within each condition group. EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 41 Patient responses and the patients reflected in HCP responses were different groups; thus a direct comparison cannot be made between the proportions of patients and HCPs reporting any given direct benefit. However, it is worth noting that direct benefits to the patient's qualifying condition are being seen at relatively high degrees of benefit (most scores are above 4). Among patient respo ndents certified for muscle spasms, 26% report spasm reduction at a high degree of benefit (scores of 6 or 7) and 19% of HCP responses for patients with muscle spasms report spasm reduction at a high degree of benefit. Among responses of patients certified for seizures, 42% reported reduction in seizure number or severity at a high degree of benefit; among HCP responses for patients with seizures, 16% reported seizure reduction (severity or frequency) at a high degree of benefit. Among patient responders ce rtified for cancer, 23% reported pain reduction at a high degree of benefit; 13% reported reduced nausea or vomiting at a high degree of benefit and 9% reported weight gain or appetite improvement at a high degree of benefit. Among HCP responses for patien ts certified for cancer, 9% reported pain reduction at a high degree of benefit and 11% reported reduced nausea or vomiting at a high degree of benefit. Indirect Benefits from Medical Cannabis Treatment Table 6 summarizes responses to the Patient Experienc e and HCP surveys about the most significant benefit to the patient that were classified as indirect benefits (namely all health benefits unrelated to the relief of symptoms directly associated with the patient's qualifying medical condition(s)). Indirect benefits reported by patients and their certifying HCPs included improvement in quality of life, improvement in sleep (whether or not explicitly tied to reduction in symptoms related to qualifying condition), improved mobility and/or ability to function o r perform regular tasks, reduced anxiety or increased calmness, improved alertness and/or cognitive functioning, and reduction of dosage and/or reduction in side effects (presumably due to reduced dosage) of other medications. As with Table 5, the proport ion of patients reporting a type of indirect benefit cannot be directly compared to the proportion of HCPs reporting a type of indirect benefit to the patient because each group of responders is different. However, in general a higher proportion of the patient responses report an indirect benefit as the primary benefit from medical cannabis than HCP responses and generally indirect benefits are reported at a relatively high degree of perceived benefit (scores of 4 or greater). A few notable indirect benefi ts are improved sleep for patients certified for muscle spasms (reported by 11% of patients as most significant benefit); improved cognitive functioning and/or alertness for patients certified for seizures (13% of patient reports); improved quality of EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 42 life for patients certified for cancer (27% of patients) and improved sleep for patients certified for Crohn's disease (31% of patients).

EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 45 Patient and HCP Perceptions of Negative Effects from Medical Cannabis The Patient Experience and HCP surveys both ask respondents to report the degree, or severity, of any negative effects they believe the patient received from using medical cannabis, on a scale from 1 (no negative effects) to 7 (a great deal of negative effects). Table 7 shows the distribution of negative effects in three broad categories: physical side effects (including dry mouth, fatigue, headache, dizziness, blurred vision); mental side effects (including mental clouding, paranoia, sedation or symptoms related to \"high\"); and issues related to accessing the medications (long distance to distribution center, inconvenient operating hours for distribution centers, etc.). Based on anticipated reports on the high cost of medication, patients were asked to report on the affordability of the medication separately. However, a number of patients and HCPs included cost in their estimation of the most significant negative effects related to medical cannabis; these reports (18(7.5%) patient reports and 17 (10.1%) HCP reports) are excluded from Table 7 but included in Appendix D: Patient -Reported Negative Effects and Appendix E: HCP -Reported Negative Effects . Finally, see Table 8 for a summary of patient perceptions of medication affordability. Generally, reports of negative effects were minimal. Forty -seven patients (20%) reported physical or mental negative effects. Other than four (one score of 7, three scores of 2) who reported an increase in seiz ures, responses mirrored side effects reported in clinical trials of medical cannabis 1, 2. For the highest levels of negative effects, the reports were as follows: 7 (n=1): hives; 6 (n=5): stomach pains, increase in seizures, burning in mouth, dizziness, s edated, and high; 5 (n=3): lightheaded, paranoia, sleepiness. There were 27 (16%) HCP reports of physical or mental negative effects resulting from medical cannabis treatment; as with patient reports, these generally mirrored side effects described in clinical trials. Two exceptions were a report of worsening symptoms of Parkinson's disease (with reported negative effect score of 4) and a report of worsening some seizure types while mitigating other types (with a reported negative effect score of 4). For t he highest levels of negative effects, the reports were as follows: 7 (n=1): abdominal discomfort; 6 (n=1): sedation; 5 (n=2): and lethargy, with the comment \"too strong for patient.\" A full report of all negative effect comments from patients and HCPs can be found in Appendix D: Patient -Reported Negative Effects and Appendix E: HCP -Reported Negative Effects .

Patients who are certified for more than one condition are represented in the table for each condition for which they are certified. EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 47 Clinical Observations from Health Care Practitioners The HCP survey provides space for providers to share any insights on the patient's medical cannabis treatment in the context of their clinical knowledge. Providers used this space to report on a variety of observations, from lack of efficacy (n=4) to difficulties in the patient obtaining other pain medications due to medical cannabis use (n=2). Of 169 HCP responses, 12 (7%) reported that the patient reduced their pain medication dosage due to medical cannabis use; six of these reports specifically referred to decreased opioid use. Another three (2%) reports indicate reduction of non -pain medications. A full report of all clinical observations can be found in Appendix F: HCP Clinical Observations . Patient Perceptions of Affordability Medical cannabis is not available through the traditional prescription model which is amenable to insurance reimbursement; therefore patients are required for cover medication costs completely out of pocket. The Patient Experience survey asked patients to rate the cost of the medication on a scale from 1, or very affordable, to 7, or very prohibitive. Responses to this question are displayed in Table 8. A total of 215 patients, or 89% of all patient respondents, reported that they found medical cannabis to be at least somewhat unaffordable (score of 4 or greater). Table 8.

EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 48 Comments and Suggestions from Patients and Health Care Practitioners The Patient Experience and Health Care Practitioner surveys provided space for patients and HCPs to offer suggestions or comments directed toward the Office of Medical Cannabis. A full report of these comments can be found in Appendix G: Patient Suggestions and Comments and Appendix H: Health Care Practitioner Suggestions and Comm ents . Patient Perceptions of Online Registry Patients were asked how easy or difficult the online registry system, through which the Minnesota Medical Cannabis program is administered, is to use. Patients were asked to rate usability on a scale from 1, or very difficult to use, to 7, or very easy or intuitive to use. Responses were generally positive (Figure 30) , with 52% of patients reporting high scores of usability (6 or 7). Figure 30 . Online Registry Ease of Use Patient reports on the ease of use of the Medical Cannabis Registry online system (1=very difficult to use; 4=neither difficult nor easy to use; 7=very easy/intuitive to use).

EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 49 Patient Perceptions of Office of Medical Cannabis Call Center Patients were asked to rate the helpfulness of the Office of Medical Cannabis Call Center (also known at the Support Center), which provides support for patients, caregivers and providers in navigating the registration and enrollment process as well as assisting with other program - related inquiries. The Patient Experience survey asked patients to rate the helpfulness of the call center on a scale from 1, or not very helpful, to 7, or very helpful. Generally respons es were very positive (Figure 31 ), with 56% of all patients, including those who did not interact with the call center, reporting high scores of helpfulness (6 or 7). Figure 31 . Call Center Helpfulness Patient reports on the helpfulness of the Office of Medical Cannabis Patient Support Center (1=not very helpful; 4=somewhat helpful; 7=very helpful).

EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 50 Patient Perceptions of Office of Medical Cannabis Website Patients were asked to state their level of agreement with the statement: \"The Office of Medical Cannabis website provides me with the information I need to understand and participate in the program.\" Patients generally indicated agreement that the website provides necessary and useful information (53% of patients agreed and 27% of patients strongly agreed); however 11% of patients expressed that they did not feel the website met their needs for program participation (Figure 32 ). Figure 32 . \"The website pr ovides the information I need to understand and participate in the program\" Patient agreement with the following statement: \"The Office of Medical Cannabis Website provides me with the information I need to understand and participate in the program.\" Not e: percentages are based on total number of patient responses; 19 patients did not complete this question and are not represented in the figure. EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 51 Continued Use Survey Surveyed Patient Population and Response Rate Of the 435 patients who made their first m edical cannabis purchase in the first three months of the program (July 1 - September 30, 2015), 208 patients (48%) had a two- month pause in medical cannabis purchasing before 12/30/16 and received a Continued Use survey as a result. Of these 208 patients r eceiving surveys, 84 (42%) responded. Response rates by age group, qualifying medical condition and race/ethnicity are shown in Tables 9 -11. With the exception of the youngest patients, little variation in response rate was seen by age (Table 9). Response rates did vary by condition, however, with the fewest responses seen from cancer and terminal illness patients (Table 10). Patients identifying as black or Hispanic were underrepresented in the respondents. Table 9. Continued Use survey r esponse rates by age group.

Stopping or Pausing Medical Cannabis Treatment Of 82 patients who completed the Continued Use survey, seven (9%) surveys were completed by caregivers or family members of deceased patients. Sixteen patients (20%) reported that they planned to stop medical cannabis treatment; 17 (21%) reported they were unsure whether they planned to continue treatment and 42 (51%) reported that they plan to continue treatment. Table 12 shows the distribution of patients who are stopping, continuing or unsure of continuing treatment, stratified by the degree of benefit they believe they gained from medical cannabis (scale from 1, or no benefit, to 7, or a great deal of benefit). Generally, patients intending to continue medical cannabis treatment reported a higher degree of b enefit than patients who were unsure about continuing or who planned to stop (Table 12). Among patients indicating they plan to discontinue treatment, the majority (n=10) cite ineffectiveness or lack of cost -effectiveness as the reason for stopping. Among patients unsure if they plan to continue medical cannabis, the most often reported reason for pausing treatment is the cost of medication (n=9). Among patients who stated they plan to continue treatment, cost of medication was also the most prevalent reaso n for pausing treatment (n=26), along with a EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 54 variety of other issues including using medication more slowly than expected (n=5); undergoing other treatments which interfered (n=2); out of state travel (n=3).

The survey process described in this report is no t a clinical trial or a formal observational study, and it answers different questions than these other types of studies. The survey response data can provide a general understanding of positive and negative effects perceived by patients and their certifyi ng health care providers from participation in the program. It cannot provide an answer to questions like, \"does medical cannabis work for this condition?\" Unlike in clinical trials and some formal observational studies participation is not limited to patients who pass a set of screening criteria and treatment drug and dosage is not set in advance for all participants. Finally, the program design does not include any type of comparator group, such as an alternate therapy or placebo; patients and their HCPs may note specific effects of medical cannabis as compared to other courses of treatment while narrating the patient's individual experience but these experiences once again cannot be generalized to demonstrate any superiority or non- inferiority with placeb o or other standard -of-care treatments. Beyond the limitations of data generated within the framework of Minnesota's program, there are limitations in understanding the survey results. Reporting bias is likely, the patients with completed surveys might differ in important ways from patients without completed surveys. The sample sizes for most conditions represented in the program are quite small and preclude statistical comparison at this point. Furthermore, the qualifying conditions for the program do not all translate to specific or homogenous clinical diagnoses and therefore one condition group may include a variety of underlying etiologies. Finally, perceptions of benefits and negative effects related to medical cannabis from patients and HCPs were asse ssed through a simple EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 56 Likert scale without outside validation; the intention of capturing this information was to gain a qualitative and holistic understanding of the patient's experiences in the program. Patient and HCP Perceptions of Benefit from Medica l Cannabis Overall, even with a conservative approach to understanding reported benefits from medical cannabis, the early survey results show a strong impression of therapeutic benefit for some patients. Among patient responders certified for severe muscle spasms, cancer, HIV/AIDS, terminal illness, Tourette syndrome, ALS and glaucoma, over half of the patient responses indicated benefit at the highest level (score of 7: a great deal of benefit). Even if non - responding patients had a much lower perception o f benefit, there would still be a large group of patients perceiving a high degree of benefit. While HCP reports of benefit tended to be lower compared to patient reports, a substantial amount of agreement was seen between patient reports and HCP reports for the same patient (Table 4). In patients certified for cancer and terminal illness, comparison of aggregated patient -reported benefit to aggregated HCP - reported benefit shows conflicting reports; however, matching benefit reports for patients with both patient and HCP survey data reconciled the differences (Figures 23 and 26). Differences in the aggregate reports of patient -perceived benefit from aggregate reports of HCP -perceived benefit are therefore at least partially due to different patient populatio ns being covered in the aggregate patient surveys and HCP surveys. Another lesson that comes from comparing patient perception of benefit to HCP perception of benefit is that patients generally have a broader definition of benefit that extends beyond direct treatment of symptoms related to their qualifying condition(s), to other health benefits including improved sleep, mobility or general quality of life. For example, Figure 22 shows that the discrepancy between patient- perceived benefit and HCP -perceived benefit in patients with seizures persists even in a direct comparison between benefit scores for the same group of patients with both patient and HCP surveys complete. This discrepancy can be somewhat explained, however, by the reports of indirect benefi t in this group: 17% of patient responders report an indirect benefit as the primary benefit from medical cannabis, as opposed to 4% of HCP responders. In the same group, improved alertness and/or cognitive functioning (10 patient reports) is only reported by patients. Among cancer patients, 35% of patient reports cite indirect benefits as the most important benefits, compared to 1% of HCP reports. These data and reports from other conditions suggest that HCPs may use different metrics when considering the overall beneficial impact of medical cannabis. Another general observation from the early survey results is that overall, both patients and HCPs report mild physical or mental side effects from medical cannabis use. Combined with a cautious reading of the reported benefits by patients and practitioners, this suggests that medical cannabis has been safely tolerated by most patients in the forms approved for use in Minnesota thus far, and that it is providing substantial benefit to many, but not all, patien ts with qualifying conditions under Minnesota law. EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 57 Patients Stopping or Pausing Medical Cannabis Treatment One of the main points from the Continued Use survey data is that only a small proportion (16 of 82 responses) patients are discontinuing medical cannabis, and generally they do so because of lack of therapeutic benefit. Another major theme which emerged w as the cost of medication as a barrier to accessing it, even when a high degree of benefit has already been appreciated. Finally, limitations were observed from the data: the number of responses within each condition group were few enough to prevent any me aningful analysis by condition. Future Directions The Office of Medical Cannabis plans to build on these observations as the base of survey data continues to grow; eventually survey results will be integrated into other analyses that integrate information on medical cannabis product type, patient -level medical history and symptom reporting, and other data available in the online registry system. By early 2017 a comprehensive look at the first year of program experience will be available on the Office of Medical Cannabis website. References 1.

The fact that the oil makes me too high, mellows me out too much; regular cannabis lets me function on a normal level EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 82 The nay -sayers tire me out. Two [medical facility] employees (my sister/aunt of my son and a [medical facility] doctor friend of our family) insisted that there is no proof that medical cannabis helps. \"You might as well give your son dirt\". Was a comment I heard from the [medical facility] MD friend. I typically, patiently, point out that our son is on 4'heavy duty anti seizure medicines, has been most of his life, that can't be increased due to ill effects, has a VNS, yet is still slammed to the ground, on to his face, from seizures many times a day, or can't breath for up to 30 seconds during a tonic seizure. So are we not to try anything that might help?! Now, 3 -months in to starting medical cannabis, I can show anyonemwho,asks how,it is,going his seizure diary, where there are far fewer entries for daily seizures. Just a glance at my son's monthly calendar these past 3 months tells it all. Is medical cannabis perfect? No, it is not as fast acting as anti seizure mess (for those that work), it is a very slow process, ramping up the oil, trying to get it just right. The beauty of medical cannabis is that we are seeing no negat ive side effects! No shortening of his QT waves, no lowered white blood cell counts, no rage and attacks on family. Just a slow improvement on seizures, making all of our lives so much easier. Tiredness We noticed the combination of CBD/THC worsened seizures for [name]. CBD also seems to be upsetting on her stomach with changes/increases in dosing. 3 In the beginning he seemed very lethargic, now that is better but [name] still has lack of appetite often Saw great results with Violet, but when we added Indigo at night, [name] sleep/wake cycles were disrupted. 3 weeks in a row after adding Indigo he would stay awake for 24 hours, then sleep for 24, & it would take a few days before he could get back on tra ck. That was the only change we made so I think the very small amount of THC in it had adverse effects for him. Went back to Violet only. 4 (Some Negative Effects) Driving so far away to get meds.

Need to get the cost down, it's much more efficient to go out and buy it on the street, however wanting to be legal I would rather pay the higher price. But if I could not afford it I would definitely buy it on the street , which is what a lot of people are doing because of the costs ... It is helping tremendously with my back pain and muscle spasm's , I feel better and everybody I talk to says they can tell I am much better off being on medical cannabis compared to the heavy duty narcotics I was on . Thank you. 1. Add more qualifying conditions, *chronic pain* 2. Add other forms of using medical cannabis 3. More manufacturers need to be added a large amount of medicine required to achieve symptom control and that costs a lot of money. there needs to be a dispensary i n central in northern Minnesota. Its a four hour around trip and two days after in bed resting for me to get my medicine. not all cannabis is the same, some strain have different cannabinoids and terpenes that work better for certain conditions its a sha me we don't get that options. as patients even our doctors have no access to what type of marijuanna is being used. is it sativa is it indica? I'm guessing it's indica cause it puts you to sleep where sativa does give you that i'm glued to the couch fee ling. the cost of the medicine is too high. the two privileged companies seems more interested in trashing each other or just boasting that they got the best product. [Profane comment regarding a manufacturer.] im glad the commissioner saw the writing on the wall that the program needs more patients to survive and he added intractable pain. the lack of support from doctors and clinics for use of medical cannabis; numerous doctors denied by health freedom, laughed at me for even asking. I have heard fr om other patients of doctors treating them saying they can not use medical cannabis and still get pain pills from them. EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 97 the amount of misinformation and bias against that is put out there about this program is amazing. from headlines like ' pot is approv ed for pain' MPR,org to may that believe there is no THC in the products being sold which very well could be true considering the non- transparency of the companies involved. A patient \"login\" on the main page would have been nice. I had to click two different links from the main page before finding the \"login\" in the upper right corner of the page. I missed it twice before finally spotting it there. It's not bad, I just feel it could have been a little more obvious, especially for the less tech savvy folk s. Overall though, it's a well designed easy to use site. additional locations for availability of medical cannabis. Became difficult to obtain cannabis as the [Cannabis Patient Center] kept cutting back on their hours (I understand the low demand). Most importantly, even if I could not speak with them directly in the clinic, the pharmacists were always helpful and patient and seemed to really make the effort to work with us as we adjusted medication and dosages. I have been very impressed with their prof essionalism and appreciate their time. Cannabis has always only helped me, it's the only drug I would choose if I couldn't get the other pills/medication I am prescribed to and could just have one kind of medicine. Chronic pain needs to be added. No one ov erdoses on medical cannabis, but narcotics are a huge problem. Concerns about theft of vaporizer pens, ignorance from other people about the program Cost Are way too high! Accessibility is too difficult Cost of the medicine is very high. I'd like the man ufacturer to list the other cannabinoids present in addition to THC and CBD. A terpene profile as well as the strain origin of the medicine, ie: indica, sativa, hybrid is also quite important to me. Thanks for all you do. Cost, Quality. Potency for a variation of strains, for effect on specific people ailment's, would be nice too, just saying if your asking... But thank you. Cuz the new stuff youz have made with the number's different of the medicine, has been helpful I think too so that is good. easier wesite navigation would be help full. some protacohl between and From the state on products from both suppliers being the same Everyone at [manufacturer] is beyond supportive and we are treated as equals in our efforts to control our son's seizures...we fe el like a team working together...the whole experience has made us feel like someone cares and there is hope...and that is such a big piece that we did not have. Expanding dispenseries to the northern suburbs to have easier accessibility For my Crohn's my appetite has increased, intestinal disorder has reduced (not eliminated) and I have gained weight. I am still working with dosage adjustment but so far my experience is positive. Get more offices and make it totally legal good job very helpful people EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 98 Have more information available at participating hospitals. He has not actually used the cannabis at this time. Started feeling better after we picked it up. Will keep on hand in case needed in the future weeks/months. Hoping that stores can have hours opera tion. I live in [city],mn and hours of operation make it very difficult to obtain my meds due to my work hours usually keeping me busy during their hours of operation. Just hoping for more availability. How grateful our family is for you; for the kindness , intelligence, empathy, humor and total dedication to what you do. Thank you from all of us. I am great full for the opertunity to get The cannabis to treat my condition the first time it relieved my symptoms in over 15 years it brought tears to my eyes I hope someday soon that insurance will start to pick up the cost as it would be cheaper than the other prescriptions I would take that have super bad side effects putting me in the hospital and are not effective at all. I appreciated talking to Tom Arneso n today over the phone. I would rather talk to someone about my experiences than fill out surveys. I have benefited by using medical cannabis and hope to become a big supporter of the program once I am no longer a state employee myself. Thanks for all of y our efforts on behalf of the citizens of Minnesota that benefit from this helpful program. I believe that my last paragraph said it all. We are following the recommendation from the MN Epilepsy Foundation, \"Start low, go slow.\" And [manufacturer] pharmac ist, [name] is a great resource for help and information. I don't know if medical cannabis will stop my son's seizures, but we are willing to try, especially since our on,u other option is to add a 5th anti seizure med. We've been doing the 'seizure danc e' with our son for 23 years, and I finally feel good about trying a new medicine with him. I hope that medical cannabis continues to help my son, one seizure at a time. I feel that the cost of the product right now is going to drive a lot of people away from trying cannabis as a treatment option. I think that the few conditions and people allowed in the program has an effect. But also only having two suppliers I think will drive prices up. I feel there needs to be a registry of health care provider s in all fields of care. SOOO many people (with a qualifying condition) cannot find a provider to refer them to program. Very frustrating. I have stop coming so much because I cannot pay for the medications all the time,insurance isn't helping much but I 'm sure you guys already know that at the office. I need to try and find out which delivery system works best for me to get the best treatment for my condition ? Vaporizing works well but want to try capsules and see if I benefit from something that is a little longer acting. I think edible forms of the medicine would be helpful, rather than just oils, pills or liquids. It would give another avenue for taking the med. Im thankful though that we have what we have here. My quality of life has improved. It h as not only helped my spasms, but has helped me sleep, and helped with depression. I think it is ridiculous that insurance will cover SYNTHETIC medical cannabis, but will not cover the natural GOD given plant medical cannabis. It really is about the mone y and not about the needs of the people who need it!!!!!! EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 99 I wish this would have been available sooner. We have had so many positive effects from the CBD oil! If it does this for Epilepsy, what other benefits for other disorders or diseases have we been mi ssing out on. I wish we could could get legal access for more illnesses. We need more patients using the cannabis. I would like to restart the cannabis soon. [Details of medical treatment] Getting the implanted device working properly had to come before me ssing with medicine to get a fair trial of medicine. He is still having seizures at his more usual frequency. I plan to contact [manufacturer] in January to restart. He does have a follow up appointment with his neurologist in late January. Thanks If sta te legalizes cannabis your insurance should cover it. If you lower the cost and put a little more recreation in it you will have a better product to market.right now the reputation of the program on the street is the no fun program, I find my self advocati ng for the program of other benefits it offers. I'm a full- time student. I use cannabis daily, and I'm making all A's :) I'm glad I tried it. I did receive two prescriptions. I think the second was a placebo. I tried two max doses, and felt absolutely no thing. And with the cost, some paranoia, and the second prescription. I'm letting this experiment sit. In happy [name] has had this opportunity increase diseases so price can go down. MN has a great program and has made life much better for my patient It is a blessing in disguise to finally have access to this modern medicine. Versus painkillers, this medication has almost erased my use of narcotics to treat pain. it works It;s nice to feel human again! Just by stating the price is a problem and as a patie nt we should be allowed to grow are own medicine strain that works in leaf/bud form. I know this would work best for me financially and physically in getting the best relief from medical cannabis. Just make it more user- friendly and cheaper. Just that I greatly appreciate all the staff that work there for the noble cause and all the great assistance and all around help I was given by great and caring, committed people!!! I'm worried about this talk of the panel not impressed that pain is a valid condition to add to the list of acceptable conditions for cannabis treatment . I'd like to be up to date on any and all upcoming hearing on this issue and I want to be a pro active patient for the pain inclusion as a condition and please don't be bashful in letting me know of upcoming events / hearings. I missed one in Nov due to being in Calif. until a few days ago . Thank u all, for what you do!! G -d Bless... Keep up the good work Keep up the good work!!! Let me know what proportions of CBD or THC I would most li kely benefit from. Let people grow there own and get rid of the monopoly of the plant. Lower cost lower cost and improve the quality of the vaporizer. I bought the low -end model. EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 100 Lower cost - better availability Better advise about doseage - timing Minnesota has made great strides, but the medicine is still very difficult for people to access. [Name of manufacturer] IS AWESOME & THE MEDICINE IS WORKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [Name of manufacturer] products only co ntain THC and CBD as their active ingredients. Recent studies have shown that the therapeutic and medicinal qualities of cannabis are a result of what's referred to as the \"Entourage Effect\". The \"Entourage Effect\" is the inclusion of many different vital chemical compounds in a plant which work together to produce a desired effect. A series of studies have revealed that terpenes/terpenoids play a much more important role in creating the \"Entourage Effect\" than was previously thought. Also, it was discovere d that terpenes/terpenoids are more responsible for the overall experience than the specific variety of plant (Indica vs Sativa). Cannabis products containing only THC and CBD lack the necessary ingredients needed to create the \"Entourage Effect\". THC and CBD alone, or mixed together have some medicinal qualities, but their full potential is not reached without certain cannabinoids, terpenes/terpenoids and other vital chemical compounds. As a result, [manufacturer] products do not provide adequate therapeutic and medicinal relief. I found this to be the case with the oil for vaporization as well as the capsules. The lack of certain cannabinoids, terpenes/terpenoids and other vital chemical compounds in [manufacturer] products dramatically increases the negat ive side effects of THC such as anxiety, paranoia, confusion and disorientation. The inclusion of CBD alone does not adequately reduce the side effects of THC. Dr. Jeffery Hergenrather, President of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians and Dr. Raphael Mechou lam of Hebrew University in Jerusalem both have a great deal of expertise studying the cannabis \"Entourage Effect\" and have released their findings. Need to get the feds to change the classification of medical cannabis Next to imposiable to find primary do ctor to work with you because of cannabis laws for doctors and new opioids laws extremely frustrating and painfull Not happy that there isn't an office closer to where I live.

Way too expensive. I don't like being taken advantage of. Other states have affordable cannabis in plant form because in other states care about patients and understand most patients can't afford to pay for expensive oils. It is an absolute disgrace that the only known way to afford this medicine is to start a gofundme account. Parents are having to beg strangers online for money to pay for this medicine! It breaks my hea rt but I EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 101 doubt you guys can fix this mess you've made. Many of us need to smoke the plant. The [name of manufacturer] vape oils have propylene glycol. Terrible! Propylene glycol or not the oils just don't work the same. Something's missing! The oils ease SOME of my symptoms by 60%, smoking the plant eases ALL of my symptoms by 98%. I'd much rather consume my medicine in natural plant form. My dr certified me for legal medical cannabis but medical cannabis in MN is far inferior to smoking it in plant form and is impossible to afford for the vast majority of us. What a mess! Thank you for helping me get my appetite back, and getting rid of the grumps and nausea. Thank you for taking the time to hear patients thoughts and concerns. Medical cannabis is a literal God send for me. Unfortunately, the cost is so prohibitive that I am not able to participate in the program nearly as much as I would like. Thanks again for listening Thank you! That I'm not discontinuing my medical cannabis card. Also would like to k now when I'm supposed to receive a physical med card to show my apt and job to ensure I am backed by the states laws.. the 250 dollar fee to the doc and the state The application forms are messy - vape pipes clog and product is too thick to put into pipe easily. Oral oil is messy. Result is product wasting and expense of waste. The benefit on my over all treatment of my cancer has been incredible, after the first month without it then the last four months with it has been %100 better, and the added benefit of pain relief has been a huge impact. Any doctor who has a patient that has trouble with nausea and lack of appetite that does not try cannabis is doing a giant disservice to their patient. The cost involved is crazy high and limits my use of the medicin e. The cost is too high, but the benefits so far have made it affordable.... but as I am now on permanent disability this may not be and option down the road and I may have to give it up. The cost of the medication is preventing my friends with qualifying conditions to register with the program. I am the administer of an internet group with hundreds of patients/caregivers and potential patients The costs are unsustainable The enrollment fee is very expensive. The law as written isn't relieving people as much as it can because the processing requirements and methods are not adding back the critically important terpenes that are removed during processing. They either need to be added or allow patients flower. The legalization for medical cannabis for the entire USA and health plan coverage and being able to travel outside of Minnesota is very important to me. The [Cannabis Patient Center] has the best staff ever all workers are great in every way please give those guys the credit they deserve you have an e xcellent staff please keep them all.. The patient survey that is done prior to appointment is too general in regard to seizure activity. More specific questions such as length & severity of seizures would be helpful in EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 102 determining the success of using cannabis. The nurse assessment prior to refill doesn't seem to be thorough. The relief, mentally and physically have been positive. My only concern is the cost factor. Your staff in [Cannabis Patient Center location] are very helpful. Thank you The staff were very helpful when we first registered.That was very appreciated. There are many more people who could benefit from medical cannabis. Opening the program to treat more conditions would better serve Minnesota. In doing so, it would also drive costs down. This medication is priced to high and will make the medication unavailable to me in not to long of a time. I am glad to have it for now, and hope to be able to continue to have this available to me. This medicine has made every single day better. treatment for pain for all ages needs to be included as a qualifing condition. Very effective, I appreciate that it's there. Other people that go into the office are relieved that they have something. We are SOOOOO appreciative to have this program in MN!! Last year [name] had NO quality of life, he laid there and did nothing and had seizures. No eye contact, no interaction with us or toys, he could not even sit up on his own and was wheelchair bound. We are originally from WI. My mom and I moved to CO an d CLOSELY watched MN progress on their cannabis bill. Then we (my husband, [name], his [sibling] and I) made our official move to MN this past June. We are TREMENDOUSLY THANKFUL to be so close to the rest of our family in WI. We want to thank the MN dep t of Health & Cannabis for all your work to keep this program in MN!! p.s. today [name] walks, laughs, plays, hugs and enjoys life again!! :) He is also down to ONE anti- eleptic pharmaceutical (down from 4 and almost daily rescue medication) and his can nabis oil! We are very appreciative to have the medical cannabis available for [name] and the improvements to his quality of life and significant reduction in seizures. We need more participation in this program. We also need the plant available in its raw form. Only having high potency oil products available is somewhat over kill for what patients need. The concentrate will raise tolerance immediately since the oil from [manufacturer] is tested at 48 -95 % THC. Cannabis in its raw form ranges from 5% to 43% . I just think that some patients may be over medicated with the few options available. We should use the actual plant. This would also help cost, which is currently too high. We were led to believe a center would be opened in St. Cloud. It is very inconv enient and expensive to have to drive to Minneapolis and only be able to obtain not even quite a month's amount. Also the cost has become so out of line that we are not sure if we can continue for our son. This brings about a very hard ethical choice to ma ke now that we have begun the therapy and would discontinuing cause a relapse in the severity of the seizures or an increase in their frequency? Our son has life threatening seizures and we are spending close to $1000 per month not including travel costs and caregiver expenses. [Name] Hospital will not allow us to give the cannabis while our son is admitted so we have been keeping him home after seizures events so we can keep giving him the therapy. Not a EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 103 perfect system, probably should have thought throug h these obstacles prior to starting this program. Thanks When I first registered it was not made clear if I had been accepted to the program and also what the next steps were in the process. The page that s used for registration is not conducive for peopl e to know what steps to take and if they have been accepted. I had to call the OMC call center to see where I stood and what the next steps were when I went to MN med, no one told me that the levels of my son's seizure meds could be affected by the oil. I would have liked to know this. It seems very important. Whole plant is better. Work at reducing cost of medicine. It would be helpful if there were more academic research reports available. Work on finding a way to reduce the cost. Or find programs to he lp patients be able to afford it. Finally I found something that works great against my crohns except that I can not afford it. Would like a branch CPC to open closer to home, or be able to receive cannabis delivered to our local pharmacy or to local HCP as an alternative to the current travel troubles to the [location] CPC. would like to see the symptoms covered, to include pain. Yes - by continuing to share the positive benefits that patients have, we need to also continue to work towards allowing the us e of medical cannabis for conditions such as Autism, ADHD, Anxiety, etc. I believe there are many Minnesotans who could benefit from this program just as our son has - the difference being that our son has Tourette's as well some of these other conditions . Additionally, we need to move towards removing the rule that public schools in MN are not allowed to distribute medical cannabis even if a patient is on the registry (even a registered school nurse) - it's hurtful to those who could benefit from a dose during school hours. Yes, I guess I should not have been honest with the person I spoke with about Dr [name] and how I was approved as it now appears you are trying to get me kicked off the program. Why am I seeing Dr [name] again less than a year of bei ng approved and what is that fee? How many other people have a check up within 3.5 months with Dr. [name]? It seems coincidental that I speak to the gal at MDH on friday and by Monday I have a letter telling me to address these issues and see the same Dr.? It seems you are questioning my qualifications to be in the program. If you look at my medical records, You will see I suffer from Wasting Disease from no stomach etc. I have cancer and depression as both my folks died within 5 yrs of each other etc. I de serve and need to be on this program. You should use me to stop the abuses in other states from happening here unless it is in your master plan. I am not for full Legalization or recreational Marijuana. But medicinal, I now it works or I would not be alive today. I would have an ileostomy bag and feeding tubes as I did before I began smoking the leaf material years ago. You must provide some Dr.'s! Lower the price I can't keep spending approximately 350$ every month. EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 104 Supply more options such as the med i n food or pills. Help patients understand how much to use. The assistance at the service station downtown is great but they don't have the medical knowledge to truly help. Get research from other states and country's that are using Medical Marijuana. Separate how people see medical and recreational as the same thing. Get the federal government to help. you use highly refined products to transport the marijuana. why can't you use the unrefined products like coconut oil which can be measured out by the person. our son can't sleep on the alcohol and the refined coconut oil given 3 times a day he can't tolerate digestively and we tried the pills and that made his seizures more sever. we need a more natural product as it does decrease pain but the side eff ects he can't tolerate in the dosage needed. Do you have organically grown cannabis? Do you think people are going to abuse the natural cannabis after they have gone through all the hoops to be registered and the expense of it all? We would like to be abl e to try the pure product. Our son has been off additives and preservatives for many years so these products he does not tolerate well.

Brackets have been used to explain words redacted to prevent individual identification or for other reasons. Allow those with chronic pain to be certified.

EARLY RESULTS OF OFFICE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS SURVEYS MAY 2016 106 Cost has been a concern, so in my opinion cost control wi ll be important for future success of th program. Cost is a big factor. I have other patients who would benefit from medical cannabis but would not be able to pay for it. It is my hope that this will change. I would like to see an expansion in the number of diagnoses that are approved for medical cannabis use, particularly in the pediatric population. This patient has an apt in a week and I have received nearly weekly reports from his parents on the effect of medical cannabis on his and their quality of l ife. cost is almost a prohibitive barrier Cost is prohibitive for most Cost of the medication for the patient Cost reduction if at all possible. Better communication by dispensaries with providers. Could medical marijuana provider/dispenser provide update of plan on this website accessible my certifying providers? Demonstration of dosing on website and summary of dose and changes over time Education of the patient. Patient states she had trouble getting her husband recertified as a care giver Expand c riteria to include chronic pain Feedback from his supplier regarding doses, adjustments, their recommendations and conversations w the pt, etc. would be beneficial. getting federal approval for supervised treatment I appreciate that most of the prescriptio n issues are handled by the pharmacist I feel it is working Include chronic pain as a certifiable medical condition Include chronic pain syndrome in the list of indications. Insurance coverage! Well, one can dream... It would be helpful to have more physicians involved in medical cannabis certification List all qualified conditions and information about cannabis clinics in pamphlets and distribute to clinics Lowering the cost to the end user and increasing the amount of locations. Make it easily available toaccess mg/ml of each form on bottle4 mg/ml of product on each bottle please. mg/ml on each bottle.... More information for the cerfitying physician - I learned the details of the program, formulas, routes, etc from my first patients. my experience i s limited to this particular pt. Seems to be expensive which will limit access. My experience is too limited to offer meaningful suggestions need mg/ml on each bottle and bottles should be labeled with contents more clearly none.

There is evidence that it works best with some THC. There is no scientific basis for these comments! Price is high for medication Program is good. Rate of increase in dose is far too slow. This is costly for families. We can increase the dose much more quickly and if no benefit after 2 wks, pts can wean off. reduc e cost reduce cost reduce cost Reduce cost Many pts that are eligible are unable to afford this treatment. Streamline the certification process. The addition of other chronic illnesses and chronic pain would be beneficial to potential users. Cost is a ba rrier for my patients. Street prices are far below medical prices. The cost and distance is a significant factor. The cost can be quite prohibitive. I've heard pts state, \"I can get it on the street for way less\". Cost clearly needs to be reevaluated. The cost still is going to be prohibitive for some patients. The patient's family was just frustrated with the cost. The monthly dosage cost was $700 and she is a brain injured patient that is cared for at home and they could not afford this high cost s o they discontinued the program The same as question 8, just better info on the different forms of the medication and data on those.

I did not know that by certifying a patient that they automatically get medical cannabis prescribed. If I had known this I would not have certified the patient. "}
