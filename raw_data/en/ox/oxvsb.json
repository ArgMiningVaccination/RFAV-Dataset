Some children and adults experience side-effects that last a few days. Serious health problems are rare. - Effective: COVID-19 vaccines are effective at helping protect against severe diseases and death from the virus that causes COVID-19, including known variants.

Vaccines work by stimulating your immune system to produce antibodies. No. COVID-19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way. No. None of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines in the United States contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. Because the vaccines teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19, this process can sometimes cause symptoms such as fever, chills and fatigue. Yes. The authorized COVID-19 vaccines for children and adults have undergone thorough evaluations by both the FDA and CDC. Yes. You can get both vaccines at the same visit to a clinic, pharmacy or doctor's office. Yes. Vaccination helps protect you even if you've already had COVID-19. *If you were treated for COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Adults and children with a history of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-A or MIS-C) should consider delaying vaccination until recovered from being sick and for 90 days after the date of diagnosis of MIS-A or MIS-C. COVID-19 Boosters Yes, vaccine effectiveness at preventing infection or severe illness wanes over time. An mRNA booster increases immune response, which improves protection against getting a serious COVID-19 infection. CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccines for everyone ages 6 months and older, and boosters for everyone 5 years and older, if eligible. You are up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines if you have completed a COVID-19 vaccine primary series and received the most recent booster dose recommended for you by CDC. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine after you recover from COVID-19 infection provides added protection against COVID-19. Updated COVID-19 boosters can both help restore protection that has decreased since previous vaccination, and provide broader protection against newer variants. The updated, or bivalent boosters, target the most recent Omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5, that are more contagious and more resistant than earlier strains of Omicron..

I was listening to everyone on both sides. My whole family got vaccinated, but I was still refusing. Then, I did my own research and talked to my doctor. I chose to get a vaccine and didn't feel a thing when I got the shot. Now, I have freedom again and it definitely made life so much better.\" -Stephanie Chase of Berlin, New Hampshire Strafford County Resources [Access resources about COVID-19 from the Strafford County Public Health Network.](http://www.scphn.org/covid19/) \"For anyone who has not yet been vaccinated or who is hesitant, I would certainly urge you to talk with your friends and family members who have been vaccinated, just about what their experience was like. At least for me, it was very simple, very easy. It's free. It gives you a much better sense of being safe and prepared to be in a world during a pandemic.\" -Shawn Menard, Seacoast Eat Local "}
