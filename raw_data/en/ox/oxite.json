It is a state of well -being in which individual s realise their own abilities and can cope with the stresses of life and contribut e to community life. Mental health is a precondition for a productive econom y and inclusive society and goes beyond individual or family matter s. Mental health or ill -health does not happen in a vacuum, it is conditioned by personal and external factors . It reflects and is influenced by the state of our society, our economy, our environment and also by the state of world affairs around us. The E uropean Union (EU) and the world have undergone unprecedented crises, such as the COVID -19 pandemic and Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, energy crisis and inflation, shaking everyday realit y, the expectations and the confidence of people . The triple planetary crisis (climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution ) is worsening. Increased digitalisation , demographic change and radical shifts in the labour market bring challenges alongside opportunities. Beyond tackling these crises, a ddressing m ental health challenges is key to boosting the resilience of individuals and of the population . Better mental health is both a social and an economic imperative. Before the COVID -19 pandemic , mental health problems affected around 84 million people in the EU (one in six people ), at a cost of EUR 600 billion or more than 4% of GDP1, with significant regional, social, gender and age inequalities. When it comes to the workplace, 27% of workers have reported experiencing work -related stress, depression, or anxiety during the previous twelve months, which increases the chances of ab senteeism with serious impact on workers' lives and business organisation. The cost of non -action on mental health is already significant and unfortunately, it is forecasted to rise even more, in line with global stressors . Already in 2019, more than 7% of people in the EU suffered from depression2 and 13% felt lonely most of the time. The pandemic was a serious threat to mental health, especially among young people and those with pre -existing mental health conditions. During the pandemic, people in the EU affected by loneliness doubled compared to pre -pandemic years, reaching 26% across some regions3. Increased loneliness and reduced social interacti ons, concerns about one's own health and that of loved ones , uncertainty about the future , anxiety caused by fear and loss4 all generated post-traumatic stress disorders. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people (15 -19 years of age )5 after road accidents . In the EU , the annual value of lost mental health , in children and young people is estimated at EUR 50 billion6. 1 Health at a Glance : Europe 2018. 2 Eurostat News - Eurostat (europa.eu) . 3 New report: Loneliness doubles in Europe during the pandemic (europa.eu) . 4 The consequences of the COVID -19 pandemic on men tal health and implications for clinical practice | European Psychiatry | Cambridge Core . 5 The State of the World's Children 2021 : On My Mind - Promoting, protect ing and caring for children's mental health, Regional Behind these statistics lie millions of personal stories. Stories of children and teenagers for whom tablets and smartphones, along with social media platforms and messaging apps, have become integral to the ir lives, sometime s at the detriment of physical and mental health. Stories of socially excluded people facing discrimination. Stories of elderly people feeling lonely, of workers experiencing burnout ; parents no longer able to cope and of people feeling isolated, because of who they are or where they live . According to the EU Charter of fundamental rights, everyone has the right of access to preventive health care and the right to benefit from medical treatment under the conditions established by national laws and practic es. According to the European Pillar of Social rights, everyone has the right to timely access to affordable, preventive and curative health care of good quality. Part of a healthy society must be that people know that help can be found, and that support and affordable high -quality treatment can be accessed. It should be a major public policy goal to ensure that no one is left behind, that citizens have equal access to prevention and mental health services across the EU, and that reintegration and social i nclusion guides collective action addressing mental health illnesses . Effective guidance, coordination, reinforced support and targeted action are needed to bring Europe closer to that goal. The analysis of demographic change can inform targeted interventi ons, as d emographic factors can help to identify high -risk groups that may require specific support or resources, and tailor policy accordingly. Respond ing to this reality and to the citizens' call for action on mental health in the context of the Conference on the Future of Europe , President von der Leyen announced a new initiative on mental health in the EU . As part of the Commission's priority 'Promoting our European way of life', this initiative mark s a turning point in the way mental health is addressed in the EU. The Commission is also responding to the call for action from the European Parliament following its resolution from 2022 on mental health in the digital world of work7 calling on the EU institutions and Member States to recognise the scale of work -related mental health problems in the EU and to act accordingly . This Communication is the beginning of a new strategic approach to mental health , cross -sectoral in nature, g oing beyond health policy . It focuses on how to bring relief to people suffering from mental health and on prevention policies. It draws on three guiding principles that should apply to every EU citizen : (i) to have access to adequate and effective prevent ion, (ii) to have access to high quality and affordable mental healthcare and treatment , and (iii) to be able to reintegrat e society after recovery. These guiding principles inform all aspects of th is initiative and are directly mirrored in the chapters therein. Today's comprehensive approach to mental health calls upon national and regional actors, health and non -health policy sectors and relevant stakeholders, ranging from patient and civil 7 https://www.europarl.europ a.eu/doceo/document/TA -9-2022 -0279_EN.html . 3 society organisations, to academia, and industry, to work toge ther. It aims to put tools in place to drive change, including at global level, boost existing structures and monitor actions. It will support Member States in their efforts to achieve the World Health Organization (WHO) targets for non -communicable disea ses by 20258 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)9 by 2030, including on mental health. a. Integrating mental health across policies A comprehensive approach must recognis e the influence of biological and psychological factors , as well as the importance of the family, community , economy, society , the environment and security . This inclu des the role of the combination between work and care , the school and workplace settings as well as the digital world , the social (e.g. levels of violence experienced , gender , behaviour, education10), economic (e.g. instability, inflation, poverty and unemployment ) and commercial (e.g. pressure from aggressive marketing ) determinants of health . Consequently, p olicies in areas such as education, youth, arts and culture, environment, employment , cohesion, research and innovation, social protection, sustainable urban development, and the digital world, are needed to improve mental health and support mental health resilience. Obstacles to good mental health cannot be overcome within the health system alone11. Determinants of mental health interact with existing inequalities in society, putting some people at a higher risk of poor mental health than others. When discrimination based on gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation , violence and hate act as cause for poor mental health, promoting equality in our societies is an important tool for prevention. The Commission adopted five equality s trategies12 in 2020 and 2021 to make progress towards a Union of Equality . All strategies stress the risk of discrimination leading to poorer mental health. Childhood is a crucial stage in life in determining future mental health, as stressed in t he EU Strategy on the rights of the child13, which calls for a comprehensive approach to prevent and protect children from any form of violence. The 2022 European Year of Youth focused on re -establishing a positive outlook for young people and included activiti es supporting the mental health and well -being of young people. 8 On the road to 2025 (who.int) . 9 SDG Target 3.4 | Noncommunicable diseases and mental health: By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non -communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being. 10 Education: a neglected social determinant of health - The Lancet Public Health . 11 Fitter Minds, Fitter Jobs : From Awareness to Change in Integrated Mental Health, Skills and Work Policies | Mental Health and Work | OECD iLibr ary (oecd -ilibrary.org) . 12 Gender equality strategy ; LGBTIQ equality strategy ; Roma strategic framework ; Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disability . 13 The EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child and the European Child Guarantee (europa.eu) . 4 The European Year of Skills will promote during 2023 investment in training and upskilling to increase life opportunities and improve the adaptability of people and workers to change, which is of relevance to the promotion of a comprehensive approach to mental health. A mental health policy that delivers for all needs to work across relevant policy areas . For instance, t here is a growing body of research pointing to the insight of inter-connectedness and reconnection to nature as having a positive impact on mental health. At the same time, the impact of pollution on mental health is widely recognised, including through air pollution or citizens' exposure to toxic chemicals. The targ ets and actions under the European Green Deal to promote clean environment, re -naturalised and restored sites and urban greening, positively affect our physical and mental health. To remedy the risks related to the use of digital services , including risks related to mental health , the Digital Services Act14 (DSA) creates a wide set of due diligence obligations applicable to online intermediaries. To allow targeted remed ies and address public policy concerns effectively, the DSA recognises the specific risks related to serious negative effects on a person's physical and mental well -being, as well as consequences at physical and mental development of children potentially caused by using these platforms. The largest platforms and search engines, i.e. those having more than 45 million of users in the Union, are obliged to assess the systemic risks that their services pose on mental health and adopt measures to mitigate the ident ified risks15. The Commission is already supporting the transfer of relevant best practices from Member States and stakeholders to promote mental health across all policies in communit ies16 through the Expert Group on Public Health17. A study to analys e the effectiveness of upscaling policies on mental health and well -being in the Member States18 is underway to better support policy -making . FLAGSHIP INITIATIVES 1. EUROPEAN MENTAL HEALTH CAPACITY BUILDING INITIATIVE In 2023 , the Commission will allocate EUR 11 million under the EU4Health programme to support Member States in building capacity for an approach that 14 Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Single Market for Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital Services Act), https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal - content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32022R2065 . 15 This might include, for example, mitigation of negative effects of personalised recommendations and correct ion of criteria used in their recommendations, discontinu ation of advertising revenue for specific information or adapt ation of the visibility of authoritative information sources . 16 Such as EAAD's Best Practice Model to Improve Depression Care and Prevent Suicidal Behaviour in Europe funded under EU 3rd Health Programme: EUR 2 million. 17 https://heal th.ec.europa.eu/non work programme : DP -g-07.2.1 Collection and support for implementation of innovative best practices and research results on non -communicable diseases: budget reinforced by redistribution of fun ds: EUR 1 million . 5 promotes mental health across all policies together with the WHO19. The Commission will allocate EUR 10 million20 to support the role of stakehol ders in promoting mental health in communities focusing on vulnerable groups, including children and young people and migrant/refugee populations. In 2024, the Commission will launch a blueprint (toolkit) for a multi -disciplinary approach to mental health capacity building . 21 Member States are urged to adopt an approach that promotes mental health across all policies . Particular f ocus should be placed on promotion, prevention22, early intervention , addressin g stigma , ensuri ng the social inclusion of people living with mental health problems . In addition, Member States should s upport programmes to help people for employment or take part in return -to-work programmes. The digital domain, including at the workplace, brings psychosocial risks significantly affecting people, organisations and economies23. Particular attention to the promotion of work -life balance is needed. b. Promoting good mental health, prevent ion and early intervention for mental health problems People experiencing mental health issues need to know where to ask for help. Today, available services and tools are scattered and vary largely across the EU. Also, they are not sufficiently visible and known to people. This needs to change. The p romotion of good mental health , prevention of mental health problems and early interventions are more effective and cost -effective than treatment . Economic evidence for the effectiveness of investment s in this approach is strongest for early interventions focusing on maternal and infant health, children and adolescents, mental health in the workplace (see chapter e) , and the prevention of suicide and self -harm24. Research needs to be strengthened in this area to better recognise early signals of concern and Horizon Europe has an earmarked budget for this25. People's health is influenced by their life experiences and environments in which they spend their lives . Health determinants , from nutrition and physical activity, harmful consumption 19 Through a contribution agreement with the WHO (budget rei nforced by redistribution of fun ds: EUR 11 million) under the EU4Health 2022 work programme : DP-g-22-07.02 Addressing mental health challenges . 20 Financial support under EU4Health 2022 work programme : DP-g-22-07.01/03/04 Call for proposals on promoting mental health: EUR 10 million. 21 Capacity -building on mental health : multidisciplinary training programme and exchan ge programme for health professionals: EUR 9 million 22 Joint Research Centre's Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Knowledge Gatew ay (prevention of depression, work -related stress, and dementia ). 23 Communication on an 'EU Strategic Framework on Health and Sa fety at Work 2021 -2027' acknowledg es the importance of addressing psychosocial risks at work, including in the light of the digitalisation transition. 24 https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev -publhealth -040617 -013629 . 25 Horizon Europe Hea lth Calls 2023 - The Silver Deal - Person -centred health and care in European regions (Destination 1) (europa.eu) . 6 of alcohol, tobacco and drugs, as well as environmental, social and commercial determinants , including living conditions, better housing, clean air, access to sport, culture, and green areas, and a better work -life balance , as well as risks of violence all have an important impact on mental health. Physical activity and sports play an important role in the promotion of good mental health . The EU will continue to promot e sport and health -enhancing physical activity , via the EU work plan for sport and the European Week of Sport . Early intervention can ensure timely support and may prevent further deterioration of wellbeing and mental health, especially among young people26. For example, early intervention can be key in recognising and addressing risk factors and signs of various forms of distress people may be experiencing . Also, a variety of settings , such as schools, workplace s, elderly homes and prisons , are key places for mental health promotion , prevention and early identification and intervention . School -based progr ammes to promote mental health and well -being and involving a variety of actors and services27 in the community , for instance, can identify and address problems at an early stage . The Commission will launch a call in 2023 for Member States and stakeholders to submit best practices on mental health promotion, prevention, early detection and early intervention, via the EU Best Practice Portal28. It will develop , together with Member States , initiatives to address the key behavioural, economic, social, environmental (including pollution) transgenerational and commercial determinants of mental health through collaborative work, under the 'Healthier Together' initiative 29. It will support the d evelopment of guidance on early detection and intervention and the screening of vulnerable groups in key settings to be piloted by Member States30. The Commission will step up its work on brain research with the launch of new projects , including through the use of digital health data31, computing and simulation infrastructures32. FLAGSHIP INITIATIVES 2. EUROPEAN DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION INITIATIVE The Commission will dedicate EUR 6 million to reducing the risk for people to experienc e severe mental health issues by support ing the development and implementation of depression and suicide prevention policies in Member States 26 Preventive psychiatry: a blueprint for improving the mental health of young people (nih.gov) . 27 In line with Pathways to School Success Council Recommendation . 28 BP Portal (europa.eu) . 29 Through actions funded under the EU4Health Pr (2021 -2027) . 30 Through funding under EU4Health 2022 work programme (technical support for expert groups). 31 The Proposal for a Regulation on the European Health Data Space aims to facilitate better access to health data for research and innovation, including in the area of brain re search. 32 European Research Infrastructures (europa.eu) . 7 based on the exchange of best practice (2023). 3. HEALTHIER TOGETHER INITIATIVE - MENTAL HEALTH The Commission will allocate EUR 8.3 million to strengthen the mental health strand of the 'Healthier Together' EU non -communicable diseases initiative , with the aim to support Member States' actions on promoting mental health, creating supportive environm ents and policies , enhancing social inclusion and tackling stigma and discrimination associated with mental health issues33. 4. ACCESS GATE FOR PEOPL E EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES The Commission will create a n EU repository under the EU Best Practice Portal34 compiling Member States ' best practices to learn from each other and guide people towards effective care (hotlines, help points, etc). To help people navigate through available support services, Member States will be invited35 to create national w ebsites for people to have one point of reference to improve access to treatment , support and care . 5. EUROPEAN CODE FOR MENTAL HEALTH The Commission will dedicate EUR 2 million36 to empower people experiencing mental health issues to take better care of their own and their famil ies and carers' mental health by provid ing a set of evidence -based recommendations that will be actively promoted and available online . 6. DEVELOPING JOINT ECOSYSTEM FOR BRAIN RESEARCH The Commission will strengthen research on brain health, including on mental health, by working closely with Member States to create an ecosystem. This ecosystem would bring researchers and stakeholders together to facilitate and coordinate activities in order to maximi se EU and Member States' research investments . Member States are urged to use EU funding opportunities and to collaborate to implement initiatives and best practices on mental health promotion and prevention , to address the links between inequalities and mental health by increasing efforts to combat stigma, discrimination, hate speech and violence , and to provide a dequate training, upskilling and reskilling of the health and social care workforce in the promoti on of mental health and well - being . Countries should also deal with the challenges related to the prevention of mental health problems of vulnerable communities , reinforce early recognition of mental health issues, provide early interventions and support , and address the links between exclus ion, inequalities and mental health by increasing efforts to combat discrimination, hate speech and violence. 33 Expert Group on Public Health . 34 EU Best Practice Portal: BP Portal (europa.eu) . 35 Under the Expert Group on Public Health's subgroup on mental health. 36 2023 EU4Health Work Programme (europa.eu) . 8 c. Boosting the m ental health of children and young people Europe is witnessing a worsening of the mental health of our younger generations . During the COVID -19 pandemic, most children were kept out of classrooms and deprived of social interaction and physical activity, and depression among young people more than doubled37. Loneliness , an important component of well -being and mental health, has reached alarming levels. In 2022, o ne in every five people aged between 16 and 25 report ed feeling lonely most of the time38. Child poverty can have detrimental effects on mental health. The Coun cil Recommendation establishing a European Child Guarantee39 addresses some of those challenges. Bullying prevention programmes in schools40 are an effective way to support the psychological well - being of children and young people. Young people are increasingly dealing with anxiety, sadness or fear, self -harm, low self - esteem, bullying and eating disorders. Forcibly displaced and migrant children, including those who have been forced to flee Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine, and children who are victims of sexual exploitation, other crime and abuse, are particularly at risk. Children are affected by different interconnected health, environmental, social and commercial determinants, and also by the consequences of online crimes such as online child sexual abuse. There are instances when children and young people face adversities during some of the most vulnerable and formative years of their lives, which can shape their health and mental health t hroughout their entire lifetime . Young people are also strongly preoccupied by climate change and biodiversity loss . A recent survey41 concluded that 75% of children and young responde nts saw their future as \"frightening\" . At the same time, the study revea led that c limate anxiety and distress were correlated with perceived inadequate government response and associated feelings of betrayal. The EU's commitments to reaching climate neutrality by 2050 and to the Kunming -Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework are therefore are also importan t for our children 's mental health. Digital tools can have a positive impact on mental health (e.g. by pr oviding access to information, support groups, and therapy services) but can also affect mental health negatively . A move towards a safer and healthier digital space for children42 is needed. This includes: protecting them from inappropriate content, the in trusive harvesting of information and aggressive online marketing of unhealthy food , beverages, beauty standards and alcohol and tobacco , a prudent use of social media, addressing online child sexual abuse, access to illicit drugs and new psychoactive substances, with safeguards against 37 From pre -pandemic (2019 or nearest year) to pandemic levels (April 2020 - August 2021): Health at a Glance: Europe report, 2022 . 38 Loneliness publications (europa.eu) . 39 Council Recommendation establishing a European Child Guarantee . 40 Well -being at school | European Education Area (europa.eu) . 41 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519621002783 . 42 Creating a better Internet for k ids | Shaping Europe's digital future (europa.eu) . 9 cyberbullying, hate speech, excessive screentime and the digital editing of images; a well - balanced use of gaming, which helps to prevent compulsive use and negative effects on daily life. In relation to physical and men tal development of children ,43 the Digital Services Act44 (DSA) recognises certain systemic risks stemming from the design or functioning of the service and systems , including algorithmic systems, of those services designated as \"very large online platforms\" or \"very large online search engines\". Such risks may arise, for example, in relation to the design of online interfaces which intentionally or unintentionally exploit the weaknesses and inexperience of minors or which may cause addictive behaviour. For those platforms that are not designated as \"very large\", the DSA also imposes targeted measures to better protect minors online by, for example, designing their interface or parts thereof with the highest level of privacy, safety and security for minor s by default, adopting protection standards or participating in relevant codes of conduct. Furthermore, the DSA prohibits providers of online platforms presenting online advertising on their interface, when they are aware with reasonable certainty that the recipient of the service is a minor. The Better internet for children (BIK+) strategy45, complementary to the DSA, offer s support for children's mental health when online via the Safer Internet Centres and the BIK portal which offers a wealth of age -appropriate resources for children, families and teachers. These helplines of the Safer Internet Centres offer practical support and advice to children facing problems online, such as cyberbullying, grooming and disturbing cont ent, and to their parents or guardians . Children are in a more vulnerable situation than adults to express their worries. In line with the EU Strategy on the rights of the child , the Commission will present in 2024 an initiative on integrated child protection systems, which will encourage all relevant authorities and services to better work together in a system that puts the child at the centre. Children will be consulted in its preparation, including on the mental health dimension, under the newly created EU Children's Participation Platform. The voice of children should be heard , and for this , targeted tools and initiatives are necessary. The Commission will support the implementation of the EU strategy for a more effective fight against child sexua l exploitation and abuse46 by improving prevention, assistance to victims, and investigation and prosecution efforts. To address the specific challenges of children and youth living in rural or remote areas and particularly affected by insufficient mental health support services, the Commission will include dedicated actions under the EU rural action plan. It will ensure that the European Solidarity Corps will continue to support activities related to prevention, 43 Article 34(2)(b) and (d). 44 Digital Services Act . 45 A Digital Decade for children and youth: the new European strategy for a better internet for kids (BIK+) COM/2022/212 final . 46 EU Strategy for a more effec tive fight against child sexual abuse (europa.eu) . 10 promotion and support in the field of health, in line with the HealthyLifeStyle4All47, with a special focus on supporting vulnerable or disadvantaged population groups. Prevention and early interventions by professionals in contact with children, such as teachers, can promote the mental health resilience of children and young people and mitigate potential harms, in particular by giving them a voice. Nurseries and s chools represent an ideal setting to equip young children with the skills to regulate their e motions and develop their understanding of mental health, developing skills, like empathy and building self -awareness and self -confidence. This requires adequately trained staff , a worthy investment that can help reduce stigma around mental health issues a nd build a more resilient and cohesive society. School -based initiatives, including holistic approaches to mental health have been demonstrated to improve student's mental health, cognitive skills, attention span, academic outcomes and resilience to stress ors48. The Child Helpline International49 provides mental health support to children which can include emotional, psychological and sometimes legal support to children who contact the helpline. The Commission will support Member States in implementing the European Child Guarantee , in line with their national action plans and through EU funds, in particular European Social Fund Plus, and by facilitating the exchange of good practices between the Child Guarantee Coordinators . Countries will also be supported in their effort to strengthen national capacity building for health care and other professionals , and invited to use the financial opportunities of the EU budget to increase action on prevention and early intervention s outside the health sector, namely in the educational setting. The Commission will also monitor progress via the European Semester . The Commission will continue to implement the EU Youth Strategy (2019 -2027)50 to achieve better mental health and well -being and end stigmatisation . The Commission will strengthen mental health promotion in educational settings by supporting the implementation of the Pathways to School Success initiative51. The Commission's e xpert group on supportive learning environments for groups at risk of underachievement and for supporting well -being at school will develop guidelines in 2024 on a systemic, whole -school approach for well -being for policy -makers at local, regional and national level and for schools52. The Commission will propos e a self -assessment and self - improvement toolkit on well -being at school and will put forward recommendations for awareness raising activities at national and EU level .

CHILDREN HEALTH 360 In 2023, t he Commission will develop a prevention toolkit focus ing on prevention , early intervention of children at risk and addressing the interlinks between mental and physical health and key health determinants54. Special attention will be paid to the risks of bulling in educational settings. 9.YOUTH FIRST FLAGSHIP (A TECHNICAL SUPPORT INSTRUMENT 2023 FLAG SHIP55) In 2023 , the Commission will develop tools for children and young people to actively address , for example, healthy lifestyles and the prevention of mental health problem s in close cooperation with children and young people56 (EUR 2 million) . 10. HEALTHY SCREENS , HEALTHY YOUTH The Commission will support the following activities: continuation of implementation of the Better Internet for Kids strategy (BIK+)57; practical guidance for authorities on improving the protection of children in the digital world , complemented by a monitoring of the impact of the digital transformation on children's well -being through the Better Internet for Kids portal; code of conduct on age -appropriate design58 to be facilitated by the Commission building on the new rules in the DSA ; facilitate continuation and reinforcement of the work under the code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online , under the DSA59.

The Commission invites Member States to identify children as a priority target group in their national mental health strategies and build up networks with families, schools, youth, and other stakeholders and in stitutions involved in mental health of children. Member States are urged to ensure that children have better access to mental health services, as well as equal and easy access to healthy nutrition and regular physical activity, live in safe and supportive environments, and are protected from consumption of alcohol , tobacco and drug - use problems and negative impacts of digital use . Member States are invited to implement innovative approaches and best practices identified in the 'Healthier Together ' initiative on the mental health of children and young people and participate in the initiative's collaborative work to address the impact of health determinants , including economic, commercial , social and environment al determinants, and the impact of the digital transformation on children and young people's mental health and wellbeing . d. Helping those most in need Mental illness is associated with many forms of inequalities and special attention must be paid to people in vulnerable situations . Individuals may belong to one or more vulnerable groups at the same time , such as for example single mothers in poverty or disabled people recovering from severe illness. In the context of challenging demographic changes mental health, social and long -term care services must be accessible , affordable, integrated60, community -based and user friendly. Older people61 should be empowered to lead a healthy and active lifes, manage their own mental health and to increas e their social interactions62 and reduce loneliness . Creative solutions such as intergenerational housing, are to be encouraged . The Commission is raising awareness on the need to address loneliness and social isolation to promote good mental health63, and will support Member States through the collection and transfer of best practices via the EU Best Practice Portal. Women are almost twice as likely as men to experience depression . This is due to a multitude of factors such as biology, life circumstances and cultural stressors.64 Victims of gender -based violence (GBV) are particularly vulnerable . The Commission will enhance the protection and support to victims of gender -based violence, including cyber violence, through the implementation of the EU's upcoming obligations under the Istanbul Convention65 and the EU's future directive on violence against women and domestic 60 An integrated care system for older people means that older adults get the health care they need, where and when they need it: Ageing and Health unit (who.int) . 61 In 2021 over 20.8% of the EU population was over 65 years, a figure that is projected to rise to 30.3% by 2058: Council Conclusions on Mainstreaming Ageing in Public Policies . 62 Council Conclusions on Human Rights, Participation and Well -being of Older Persons in the Era of Digitalisation . 63 Loneliness (europa.eu) . 64 WMH REVIEW FINAL (who.int) . 65 Istanbul Convention: Action against violence against women and domestic violence . 13 violence66. The Commission will address the prevention and combating of harmful practices against women and girls67 and establish an EU network on the prevention of gender-based violence and domestic violence. Postnatal depression and other mental health issues that can arise during pregnancy and afterwards must be addressed , to protect the mental health of both children and women . 68 The EU -funded HappyMums project69 will explore the physiological mechanisms to enable effective science -based, clinical interventions. Challenges such as unequal access to employment , including non -permanent contracts and/or to equal pay , unequal sharing of domestic and family care respon sibilities, and economic pressures and dependencies experienced by women must also be tackled . The Commission will contribute to improving the situation by ensuring that Member States fully and correctly transpose and apply the EU's legislation on equal op portunities and equal treatment of women and men in matters of employment and occupation, on work -life balance for parents and carers as well as on pay transparency. Discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity , gender expression , or sex characteristic s can also have a n impact on mental health, especially for young people . Psychological distress that comes from experiences of marginalisation, discrimination and stigmatisation ('minority stress') increases the risk of suicidal behavi our, self -harm or depressio n, and will be addressed in line with the LGBTIQ equality strategy 2020 -202570. The physical and sexual violence and threats e xperienced by victims of trafficking in human beings results in long -term mental health consequences71. The Directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings recognises the special needs of victims with mental health problems and provide s specialised health services, and long-term recovery and rehabilitation support. The Commission facilitat es and promot es programmes supporting victims in their recovery and re -integration72, such as health and psychological services, through the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund73. Many h ealth issues can lead to or exacerbate mental health problems , for ex ample among cancer patients considering it is the second leading cause of death . Cancer does not just affect your body, it also affects your mind and feelings and often leads to depression, anxiety and fear. Disabilities can often expose individuals to a higher risk of developing mental health problems and this may require that approaches are adapted in line with the strategy for the 66 EUR -Lex - 52022PC0105 - EN - EUR -Lex (europa.eu) 67 Commission work programme 2023 . 68 https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101057390 69 HappyMums project . 70 Union of Equality: LGBTIQ Equality Strategy 2020 -2025 . 71 Study on the economic, social and human costs of trafficking in human beings within the EU - Publications Office of the EU (europa.eu) . 72 In line with the EU Strate gy on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings (2021 -2025) . 73 Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (2021 -2027) (europa.eu) . 14 rights of persons with disabilities74, that refers to actions particularly relevant for people with mental and intellectual disabilities , such as promoting that Member States implement good practices of deinstitutionalisation in the area of mental health. Autonomy, independence and participation in society are relate d to mental health, which is especially relevant for older people and people with disabilities. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure physical, social and financial accessibility , including by impr oving access to labour market and facilitating their return to work. Two of the Disability Employment Package guidelines for employers are dedicated to working with chronic diseases and the return to work75. The Commission will also issue guidance to Member States with regard to independent living and inclusion in the community before the end of 2023, and in 2024, it will present a framework for Social Services of Excellence for persons with disabilities, including mental health. The symptoms of post COVID -19 condition , commonly known as long COVID , have been reported to have a negative impact on mental health76 and poor mental health can increase the risk of developing long COVID. The Commission will set up a network on long COVID with Member States' experts in 2023 . Refugees and displaced persons , notably those fleeing from war; persecution or conflict (such as displaced people from Ukraine) are more prone to develop mental health problems77 and early responses are needed to reduce distress . In this context, the Commission will continue to contribute to strengthen psychosocial support for displaced people and in particular to the provision of psychological first aid to people affected by the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine .78 The Commission will launch a call for proposals under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund79 aiming at reducing obstacles for migrants to access health services, including mental health services and psychological support. Mental ill -health is common among people experiencing homelessness80 and long -term and repeated homelessness reinforces mental ill -health and disability. Within the framework of the European platform on combating homelessness mental health challenges are being addressed. 74 In 2021, t he European Commission adopted the strategy for the rights of persons with disabilities (2021 -2030 ) in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to which the EU and its Member States are party. 75 Disability Employment Package . 76 Long COVID and mental health correlates: a new chronic condition fits existing patterns - PubMed (nih.gov) . 77 According to the WHO, an estimated 1 in 5 people who are now experiencing the ravages of w ar will be dealing with a mental health condition within the next 10 years, and 1 in 10 will have a severe condition like post-traumatic stress disorder or psychosis. 78 See flagship action on Mental Health support for Ukraine's displaced and affected peopl e. 79 Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (2021 -2027) (europa.eu) . 80 Nicholas Pleace (2023) Social and healthcare services for homeless people: a discussion paper forthcoming in European Platform on Combatting Homelessness. 15 Roma may be at a higher risk for mental health problems, given their often difficult situation arising from poor socio -economic income, circumstances and exclusion, lack of access to education and employment, inadequate housing , segregation , exclusion and discrimination, including in health -related aspects . The EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion and participation includes the sectorial objective of improving Roma health and increasing the effective equal access to quality healthcare and social services.81 Victims of crimes , in particular those who have suffered considerable harm due to the severity of the crime or because of their personal characteristics, such as victims of terrorism, victims of trafficking, victims of hate crime, child victims or any other victim in need of psychologica l aid, should have access to such aid free of charge and for as long as necessary. Within the upcoming revision of the Victims' Rights Directive82, the Commission is working on strengthening victims' access to psychological aid, notably by making psycholog ical aid free of charge for as long as necessary for all victims in need of such help. . People living in rural or remote areas, such as farmers, have particular mental health challenges associated with the risk of disconnection and lack of access to mental health services . Suicide rates among farmers are 20% higher than the national average in certain Member States83, which is why support will be offered to strengthen their resilience. CAP funds can support awareness raising activities including in the area of mental health for example via farm advisory services. In addition, other funds could also be mobilised, such as the European Social Fund+ or the European Fund for Regional Development, to enhance the investments into the social support services in rural and remote areas and thus guarantee that they are accessible to farmers and agriculture workers in need, regardless of their place of residence. 81 https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021 - 01/eu_roma_strategic_framework_for_equality_inclusion_and_participation_for_2020_ -_2030_0.pdf . 82 Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and o f the Council of 25 October 2012 establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA, OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 57 - 73. 83 2018 report by Public Health France 16 FLAGSHIP INITIATIVE S 11. PROTECTING VICTIMS OF CRIME By Q2 of 2023, t he Commission will seek to improve the access of crime victims to psychological and mental health support by revising the Directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime . 12. CANCER MISSION : PLATFORM FOR YOUNG CANCER SURVIVORS The Commission will provide young cancer survivors with a platform to help them to boost their mental health, via the Horizon Europe Cancer Mission84. The Commission will support collaborative work between Member States to provide psychological support to cancer patients, their carers and families (EUR 8 million)85. The Commission encourages Member States to improve access to digital tools with proven usability for older people to improve their mental health and help them participat e in social life. Member States are encouraged to collect data on the mental health status of people in vulnerable situations , including homeless people, and on accessibility of services in marginalised and remote and disadvantaged areas . The Commission urges Member States to ensure equal access without barriers to quality and affordable healthcare and social services, especially for those groups most at risk or those living in marginalised or remote localities86 and to address the specific situation for Roma, by improv ing access to mental health services and primary prevention measures, for example through awareness raising campaign s. In addition, the Commission ur ges Member States to implement good practices for de- institutionalisation , including for children, and to strengthen the transition to community - based services . e. Tackl ing psychosocial risks at work People spend a significant part of their time at work and a good work environment is crucial for health. Stress and psychosocial risks at work can impact mental health and lead to decrease d job satisfaction, conflict, lower productivity, burnout, absenteeism, and turnover . Mental health is a precondition for work ability , competence and productiv ity. However, around half of European workers consider stress to be common in their workplace and it contributes to around half of all lost working days . At the same time, p sychosocial risks and work -related stress are among the most challenging issues in occupational safety and health. 84 EU Mission: Cancer (europa.eu) . 85 Financial support under EU4Health 20 23 work programme: CR -g-23-19.01 action grants on mental health challenges for cancer patients and survivors . 86 For example, as set out in the Council Recommendati on on Roma equality, inclusion and participation . 17 New forms of work brought by digitalisation and accelerated by the Covid -19 pandemic (such as platform and remote work) have affected workers' mental health, even if the flexibility of such forms of work c ould also prove beneficial. Essential w orkers, and in particular health and social care workers, appeared to be the most at risk of being exposed to work -related psychosocial risks in the post -pandemic context87. Employers have a key role in ensuring the safety and health of workers as defined in EU Occupational Safety and Health (OSH ) legislation88. The Commission ha s addressed psychosocial risks and mental health at work over the years in its OSH strategic frameworks89. There is a particular focus on mental health and psychosocial risks in the Communication on a n \"EU strategic framework on health and safety at work 2021 -2027\"90. Moreover, the need to reflect on the way forward as regards the right to disconnect , as an integral part of reducing work -related stress and promoting a better work -life balance , the right to return to work after mental illness as well as a psychologically safe working environment are both crucial to promoting mental health and to creating a more inclusive society. The Commission welcomes the 2022 -2024 work prog ramme of the European cross -industry social partners and the ongoing negotiation of a new agreement on teleworking and the right to disconnect, intended to be put forward for adoption in the form of a legally binding agreement implemented via a Directive. The Commission will continue to support social partners in their endeavour to negotiate a new agreement on telework and the right to disconnect , facilitating discussions and the identification of best practices, and by assessing existing practices and rule s related to the right to disconnect. The on -going negotiations of social partners are linked to the resolution of the European Parliament of January 2021 on the right to disconnect on which the Commission is committed to follow -up. The Commission will ensure that EU -OSHA91 finalise s the overview on OSH and digitalisation which covers mental health at work and implements an OSH overview on psychosocial and mental health at work, including information on good practices on return ing to work and working with mental health conditions and of an overview on OSH in the Health and Care sectors . The Commission will ensure that EU -OSHA provide s updated guidance as a follow -up to the 2018 publication \"Healthy workers, thriving companies - a practical guide to well-being at work \"92, and that it carries out a project on good practices on supporting 87 See https://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/osh -pulse -occupational -safety -and-healt h-post-pandemic - workplaces . 88 Safety and health legislation | Safety and health at work EU -OSHA (europa.eu) . The OSH framework directive (89/391/EEC) lays down the employer obligation to evaluate the safety and health risks of workers, including psychosocial risks, and to put in place protective measures. The display screen equipment Directive (90/270/EEC), the workplace directive (89/654/EEC), and the directive on prevention from sharp injuries in the hospital and healthcare sector (2010/32/EU) also address aspects of work relevant to psychosocial risks. 89 For example COM(2002) 90 COM(2021) 323 final . 91 European Agency for Safety & Health at Work (europa.eu) . 92 Healthy wo rkers, thriving companies - a practical guide to wellbeing at work . 18 workers with a work - or non -work -related mental health condition to stay in work or successfully return to work following a sickness absence, wi th a report by 2024. The occupational safety and health (OSH) Summit, held on 15 -16 May 2023 by the Swedish Presidency and the European Commission, identified psychosocial risks and mental health at work as growing OSH issues that need intensified further consideration93. The Commission will follow up on the se conclusions of the Summit to improve mental health at work in full respect of the tripartism principle. It will also continue the work of the review of the Directive on the workplace (89/654/EEC)94 and the Directive on work with display screen equipment (90/270/EEC)95. Finally, the Commission will support the implementation of the European Care Strategy96 with actions that contribute to the mental well-being of carers and those being cared for. FLAGSHIP INITIATIVES97 13. EU-LEVEL INITIATIVE ON THE PSYCHOSOCIAL RIS KS The Commission will c onduct a peer review on legislative and enforcement approaches to address psychosocial risks at work in the Member States with a view, and subject to its outcomes and the input of social partners , to present an EU -level initiative on the psychosocial risks in the medium term . 14. EU WORK PLACE CAMPAIGN S EU-wide EU-OSHA Healthy Workplaces Campaign - Safe and healthy work in the digital age , including a focus on mental health at work (2023 -2025) ; EU-wide EU-OSHA Healthy Workplaces Campaign on psychosocial risks and mental health at work with a focus on new and overlooked occupational sectors, including agriculture and construction, and groups including low skilled, migrant or young workers (2026 -2027/28). Member States are encouraged to raise awareness of the mental health issues of farmers and populations in rural areas with support from the common agriculture policy and develop and implement policies and best practices to help focus on prevention and strengthen the resilience of essential workers, including health professionals, teachers and farmers. To help Member States, the Commission will ensure that EU OSHA produces a report that addresses psychos ocial risks in the agricultural sector. Member States are also encouraged to further promote the use of SLIC Guide98 with regard to prevention of psychosocial risks for increasing effective monitoring and inspections of OSH 93 https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langId=en&catId=89&furtherNews=yes&newsId=10582#navItem -1 94 Council directive concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the workplace . 95 Council directive on work with display screen equipment . 96 European Care Strategy . 97 Financial support provided by EU -OSHA obligations in this regard, as we ll as to participate in SLIC training events for labour inspectors. f. Reinforcing mental health systems and improving access to treatment and care Health systems need to reinforce their capacity to lead action on mental health, from prevention, to ear ly intervention, to diagnosis , treatment and management of care and support to the reintegration of patients. Reinforcing mental health systems and improving access to treatment and care is therefore a key objective. The right of everyone to timely access to affordable, preventive and curative care of good quality is one of the key principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights. People suffering from mental health problems in the EU do not often have easy and equal access to support and it often entails co sts that are not bearable for many. There are disparities between and within Member States as regards the capacity of health systems to meet the needs of people with mental ill -health99. Inequalities related to gender, ethnicity, geographical location, including the urban -rural divide , education, age and sexual orientation , gender identity or expression and sex characteristics have an important impact on the population's mental health and their access to adequate care. It is essential to identify best practices and innovative solutions to improve the availability, quality , accessibility and affordability of mental health care. To address inequalities , tailored care should be provided to people in vulnerable situations , including displaced people, refugees, migrants , persons with disabilities and LGBTIQ people. The special care needs of people with comorbidities should also be addressed to facilitate access to effective treatments, in particular for people with drug -use d isorders, in line with the EU Drugs Strategy 2021 - 2025 and the related Action Plan. Reinforcing the training of the health workforce will be essential to continue to improve skills and the quality of care but also to reduce stigma and discrimination and to increase the resilience of one of the most pressured sectors of the working population. The EU Year of Skills offers a unique oppor tunity for stakeholders to boost training of professionals in the mental health area. The use of d igital tools (e.g. telemedi cine, advice hotlines ) should be explore d for those people requiring better information and care , including in rural areas . Social prescribing is an innovative approach to improve well -being and health, including mental health . At the individual level, social prescribing gives a person the knowledge, motivation and confidence to better manage and improve their own health and well -being 100. This approach can be applied in the primary care setting , where doctors or other health 99 Health at a Glance: Europe 2022 report (see footnote 37 on page 8). 100 Global developments in social prescribing - PubMed (nih.gov) . 20 professionals can prescribe activities that match with the person's needs and interests, such as spending time in nature, sports , yoga or social and cultural activities101. The Commission will continue to develop actions to support Member States in address ing unmet needs for medicines and will review the potential of telemedicine for improving access to mental health services102. A mental health section will be included in the 2023 country health profiles , under the State of Health in the EU project . In addition, the Commission will launch a voluntary collaboration process with Member States (via the Open Method of Coordination ), to strengthen linkages be tween culture and mental health . Finally, the potential of new technologies for the prevention and treatment of mental ill -health will be explored via the Expert Group on Health Systems Performance Assessment103. Data collection and monitoring needs to be strengthened to facilitate informed decision - making. New statistics and indicators should be developed and gradually embedded into policymaking to reflect issues such as inequalities, physical and mental health and nature's value to people and to assess the impact of actions and funding. This will help to monitor the progress towards well -being, facilitate the communication of political challenges and the options to address them in a people - and planet -centred manner104. Member States already si gnalled strong need for support in the areas of mental health workforce planning and/or capacity building, monitoring and evaluation of mental health policy, and mental health promotion and prevention (Figure 1)105. Figure 1 - Priority needs of Membe r States for capacity building (27 EU Member States, Norway and Iceland) 101 Systematic review of social prescribing and older adults: where to from here? - PubMed (nih.gov) . 102 EUR -Lex - 52012SC0414 - EN (europa.eu) . 103 The e xpert group's report \"Mapping metrics of health promotion and disease prevention for health system performance assessment\" includes a case study on mental health and best practices on social prescribing 104 Strategic foresight (europa.eu) . 105 To support investmen ts and reforms in Member States through targeted capacity -building, a survey was carried out in April 2023 , through collaborative work between the Commission, the WHO and the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD), to provide a snaps hot of mental health policies in the Member States . 21 To address these needs, financial support at EU level will be mobilised to allow Member States to strengthen their capacity to act. This will include more and better trained professionals to deal with mental health problems. It will also imply a shift from institutionalised to community -based care . Several Member States have included under their Recovery and Resilience Plans measures to strengthen mental healthcare for their p opulation. This is in line with Country -Specific Recommendations adopted under the 2020 European Semester calling on all Member States to boost the resilience of their health systems. In the spring 2023, the Commission proposed Country Specific Recommendat ions advocating healthcare reform for six Member States. The country reports for an additional six Member States recognize d the need to further improve healthcare system to complement the Recovery and Resilience Plans. Moreover, all country reports adopted under the European Semester contain a thematic section covering population health and health systems in Member States, highlighting in selected cases mental health challenges and planned reforms. The European Semester will continue to monitor developments in healthcare at national level. FLAGSHIP INITIATIVES 15. INITIATIVE FOR MORE AND BETTER TRAINED PROFESSIONALS IN THE EU As of 2023 the Commission will strengthen training for healthcare and other professionals , such as teachers and social workers. A new cross border exchange programme for mental health professionals will also be launched through dedicated funding support under the EU4Health programme (EUR 9 million). This should allow to have a round 2000 profes sionals trained across the EU by 2 026 and o n average 100 exchanges per year. 16.TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR MENTAL HEALTH REFORMS ACROSS SEVERA L SECTORS 22 The Commission will : In 202 4, increase the availability and affordability of mental health services for people by offering , upon demand, technical support to Member States to design and implement reforms to improve the availability of integrated cross -sectoral mental health services through the technical support instrument106. 17. GATHE RING DATA ON MENTAL HEALTH As of 2025, the Commission will ensure that the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS) includes additional data on mental health to ensure strong monitoring and assessment of progress on mental health across the EU. The Commission encourages Member States to ensure access to affordable mental healthcare, including by telemedicine means and in cross -border settings. National authorities should colla borate on developing and implementing projects to improve mental health services and community -based care and de-institutionalisation107 and are invited to develop referral pathways to mental health professionals, also taking into account the work of other service providers . g. Breaking through stigma Stigma and discrimination exacerbate the p ersonal and economic impacts of mental ill - health. Discrimination towards people with mental health problems is common , especially in social media but also in workplaces with 50% of workers considering that disclosing a mental health condition would have a negative impact on their career108. The principles of re -integration and social inclusion of those affected by mental health problems have to guide our action. Investing in improving awareness and understanding of mental health , including mental health and empathy training in school curricula are key to improving the situation, with the involvement of all stakeholders. The annual European Mental Health Week (taking place in May) and World Mental Health Day109 (10 October) are occasions to specifically address stigma at EU level. Arts and culture are important in promoting the positive mental health and well -being of individuals and society in general by supporting social inclusion and reducing mental health stigma110. They may complement more traditional support for mental health problems and 106 TSI 2024 Flagship - Mental health: Fostering well -being and mental health (e uropa.eu) 107 In line with the United Nations - Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). 108 OSH Pulse (flash Eurobarometer survey, 2022): 'Occupational safety and health in post -pandemic workplaces'.

The Commission will support the Member States to raise awareness on the positive role of cultural and artistic activities in improv ing mental health and overall well -being, for example, through a dedicated event showcasing arts and culture as new instruments for well-being and mental health . FLAGSHIP INITIATIVES 18. TACKLING STIGMA AND DISCRIMIN ATION The Commission will allocate EUR 18 million to111: improve the quality of life of patients, their families and (in)formal carers , including cancer patients, with a particular focus on addressing stigma and discrimination by supporting Member States to identify and implement best practices ; with the same objective it will support stakeholders to implement projects , such as awareness -raising activities to break through stigma and address discrimination, ensure social inclusion , protect the rights of patients , focusing on vulnerable groups ; develop EU guidance on breaking through stigma and tackling discrimination with the Member States under the Expert Group on Public Health and stakeholder groups ; introduce communication activities to promote awarenes s in the fight against stigma. The Commission encourages Member States to develop communication campaigns to demystify and break through stigma , and to develop measures to counteract stigma and discrimination by helping individuals reintegrate into employment, empowering patients to access the services that best meet their needs and disseminating information on the use of legal instruments to tackle discrimination . Awareness should be raised (decision makers, employers, health care professionals, other professionals and the general public and healthcare professionals on mental health and stigma, especially o f people in vulnerable situations ) and community activities (sports, the arts, nature) should be supported that help to break through stigma and support mental health rehabilitation. Member States should support policies encouraging the integration of people with mental health in the community and on the labour market, includin g by social economy activities. 111 Funded under the EU4Health programme (EUR 18.36 million: budget under work programme 2023 dedicated to mental health activities). 24 h. Fostering mental health globally Safeguarding and promoting mental health is not just a priority for the EU , it is also a global issue and one where the EU can lead by example , making targeted contributions at international level and fostering convergence where appropriate . At the EU-US Trade and Technology Council of 30 and 31 May 2023, the EU and the United States expressed the shared view that online platforms should exercise greater responsibility in ensuring that their s ervices contribute to an online environment that protects, empowers and respects children and youth and take responsible actions to address the impact of their services on children and youths' mental health and development .112 The EU Global Health Strategy113 provides global , national and regional actio ns intended to facilitate achiev ement of the health -related UN SDGs, with a focus on three interrelated priorities : (1) deliver better health and well -being of people across the life course; (2) strengthen health systems and advance universal health coverage; and (3) ensure public health security , includ ing mental health and psycho -social support. The focus should be on strengthening primary health care where the availability of mental health services is essential. The Youth Action Plan in EU external action (2022 -2027)114, recognises health and well - being as a prerequisite for young people to reali se their full potential and participate in society. It puts forward health, mental and physical well -being at the core of its \"empower pillar\". In parallel, mental health and psychosocial support ( MHPSS ) should be an integral part of measures to strengthen national health systems in partner countries, if appropriate, supporting global public health interventions e.g. the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria115, the Spotlight Initiative on Gender -Based Violence116 or in the context of EU humanitarian aid. According to the WHO, more than one in five people in post - conflict settings suffers from depression, anxiety or post -traumatic stress disorder117. Mental health needs also arise in situations of displacement and natural disasters. There fore, MHPSS is an essential element of a comprehensive crisis response , integrated in the EU funded humanitarian aid operations with EUR 111 million dedicated to this priority since 2019. The EU also spur s others to action by mobilising and raising the awareness of donors and partners on the importance of providing quality MHPSS in humanitarian emergencies. Following the successful engagement in the Middle East and North African region, outreach and capacity building sessions will be organised in other regions, starting with Latin American and Caribbean, before the end of 2023. 112 Joint S tatement for the EU -US Trade and Technology Council of 30 and 31 May 2023. 113 EU Global Health St rategy to improve global health security and deliver better health for all (europa.eu) . 114 Youth Action Plan (europa.eu) . 115 Home - The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria . 116 The Spotlight Initiative | What we do : Ending violence against women and girls | UN Women - Headquarters . 117 New WHO prevalence estimates of mental disorders in conflict settings: a systematic r eview and meta - analysis - The Lancet . 25 Furthermore, the Commission is building the capacity of stakeholders through training and dissemination of the Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) Mi nimum Service Package on MHPSS118. This key reference tool was developed by the humanitarian community to set the minimum quality and facilitate the roll out of impactful and timely mental health interventions in crisis situations. In Ukraine119, the Commissio n already supports community centres for displaced children and their caregivers, and also children in institutions , to help them re -establish some level of normality and routine. However, the long duration of the aggression and its devastating effect is accelerating mental health impacts for people fleeing the war in the EU and for those displaced within Ukraine, which calls for determined and ambitious support . Ukrainian children are currently subject to the trauma of war, often leaving them with profound psychological scars. The Commission will, together with Ukraine, establish a specialised e -learning program for paediatricians and primary care medical staff. Through this initia tive, healthcare professionals will get equipped with the necessary skills to provide trauma care and improve children's mental health conditions. Specialised rehabilitation services will also be offered to distressed children in both Ukraine and the E U. The Commission also supports humanitarian partners to increase their capacit y to address the mental health needs of conflict -affected populations , including in the Under the EU4Health programme, in 2022 a contribution agreement of EUR 28 .4 million with the International Federation of Red Cross Societies was allocated to provid e psychological first aid, and four projects120 (total of EUR 3 million) are being carried out by stakeholders implementing best practi ces to improve mental health and psychosocial wellbeing in migrant and refugee populations . For 2023, over EUR 10.6 million is programmed under EU4Health to improve access to health care and for the prevention of non -communicable diseases, in particular me ntal health issues. The Commission will also support Member States and stakeholders in the implementation of the best practice iFightDepression121 which includes an online self -management programme that can help displaced people, including those from Ukraine , to self -manage their symptoms . As humanitarian assistance alone cannot meet the potential long -term needs of forcibly displaced people , including healthcare, the Commission supports its partner countries to integrate d forcibly displaced communities into existing national service delivery structures. This integration is done in a way that ensures equal and fair access of refugees to the services addressing their needs , including on mental health, post -traumatic -stress, and gender -based violence. The EU's substantial assistance to address the needs of migrants also includes psycho -social support, particularly for the most vulnerable, including children, victims of war, trafficking, stranded migrants and returnees. 118 IASC Minimum Service Package : Mental Health and Psychosocial Support. 119 Financial support provided under NDICI Eastern Partnership Regional Programme to provide psychological support in Ukraine. 120 EU4Health projects to provide mental health support to Ukrainian refugees. 121 https://ifightdepression.com/en/ : available in Ukrainian, and culturally adapted . 26 The Commission supports a comprehensiv e approach to the promotion and protection of mental health and psychosocial well -being of learners, and their teachers and caregivers through education actions. The Commission is a main donor of Education Cannot Wait that considers MHPSS a key priority of its work and of the Global Partnership for Education that invests in strengthening links between the health and education sectors. The Commission will continue to mainstream mental health in measures to strengthen health systems at regional, national and global level, in line with efforts towards localisation and the triple humanitarian -development -peace nexus, and ensure that refugees, people on the move and displaced people in post -emerg ency situations in partner countries have access to MHPSS at the same level as the host communities. FLAGSHIP INITIATIVE S 19. MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE ' DISPLACED AND AFFEC TED PEOPLE The Commission will contribute to the p rovision of psychological first aid to people affected by the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine deepening the collaborative work with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies122 (EUR 28 million) . The Commission will seek to reinforce its financial support to strengthen psychosocial support for displaced people from the war . Options for training (online) of first responders, teachers, and social workers in psychological first aid and psychosocial support will also be explored to better help those in need. An additional EUR 0.5 million will be allocated to strengthen psychosocial support for affected people in emergency settings. The Commission will, together with Ukraine, establish a specialised e -learning program for paediatricians and primary care medical staff to support Ukrainian children suffering from stress and anxiety because of the war . Through this initiative healthcare professionals will get equipped with the necessary skills to provide trauma care and improve children's menta l health conditions.
