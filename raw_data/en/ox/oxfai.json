There is great intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate, justify and defend not -for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address community health issues. During 2015 members of the community were a sked to complete a survey to help identify unmet health needs. Analysis of the primary research data and secondary research was used to identify health concerns a nd needs in the community. Community partners assisted with the development of an asset map that lists resources and assets that are available to address each need. A gap analysis and prioritization exercise was also conducted to identify the most signific ant health needs, and to further address these needs through the implementation strategies that are included in this document. Sanford Luverne has formalized strategy to address the following community health needs: Mental Health Physical Health In this report you will find the implementation strategies for 2017 -2019, information about what Sanford is doing to address the needs, assets and resources that are available in the community to address the needs, and a discussion on the impact from the 2013 imp lementation strategies.

The following strategies were implemented. 2013 Community Health Needs Assessment Sanford Luverne Implementation Strategy After Hours Access/Walk In Clinic Three -Year Plan (January 201 3 - January 2015) Complete after hours volume analysis by September 30, 2013 Complete proforma and business plan by December 31, 2013 Sanford Health Network level review of proforma and business plan: Decline/Approve by February 15, 2014 FY 14 budget developed to include initiative by February 28, 2014 Implementation by September 30, 2014 Lack of Knowledge on Services Available in the Community Three -Year Plan (January 201 3 - January 2015) Develop Rock County Collaborative of key stakeholders by July 31, 2013 Develop tool of available resources by December 31, 2013 Design/print resource materials with Sanford marketing by February 28, 2014 Share resource tool with key community stakeholders/access points to care by April 30, 2014 and at various events throughout FY 16 Impact of the Stra tegy to Address After Hours Access Sanford Luverne analyzed volume data and completed a financial analysis for a potential after hours clinic. The addition of a new provider in the clinic as well as E -visits through MyChart, impacted the demand for an extended hours clinic. Patients are currently able to access a video visit or E -visit with their provider through MyChart for after hours access without having to leave the community for urgent care needs. The new E -visits and MyChart access has addressed the need for additional options and access. 9 Impact of the Strategy to Address Awareness of Available Services The 2013 CHNA found that community members were not always aware of resources and services available to them. Sanford convened a Community Safe Transitions co llaborative that meets on a quarterly basis at Sanford Luverne . Team members include: Sanford Luverne Medical Center representatives, retail pharmacy, behavior health, nursing home, home care, services for the retired and aging, group homes, social workers , and transportation providers . The collaborative updated brochures and distributed them among group members. Group members will distribute the information as needed throughout community and area. Updated information was also uploaded to the \"resource tab\" of Sanford OneChart and the Sanford Health Coach will continue to update information on the chart as new information becomes available. The impact from the 2013 Implementation strategies has been pos itive and the work will extend into the future through new or co ntinued focus on the strategies. Final 4/2 5/16 018019-00184 3/16 "}
