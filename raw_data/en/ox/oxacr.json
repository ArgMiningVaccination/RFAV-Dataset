Its Differential Air Pressure technology applies a lifting force to the body that reduces weight on the lower extremities and allows precise unweighting - up to 80 percent of a person's body weight - so people can find exactly where the pain stops, and natural movement feels good again.

Exercise instruction is given by licensed physical therapists and physical therapist assistants who are trained in aquatic therapies. An order from a healthcare provider and a physical therapy evaluation at St. Luke's are required before participating in aquatic physical therapy.

It inserts a very thin sterile solid filament needle (.3 mm) into a myofascial trigger point to relieve pressure and pain. A trigger point is a local or tight band in a muscle fiber that can disrupt function, restrict range of motion, refer pain or cause local tenderness. When dry needling is applied, it can decrease banding or tightness, increase blood flow, and reduce local and referred pain. It's important to recognize dry needling is not acupuncture which treats along meridians and leaves needles in place longer. Dry needling treats myofascial trigger points/muscle knots of musculoskeletal conditions by eliciting biochemical changes and a local twitch response which breaks the pain cycle. How do I start Dry Needling? Dry Needling requires an order from a physician/provider that states, \"Evaluate and treat for Physical Therapy and Dry Needling.\" Patients are asked to sign a waiver and disclosure of current health. There are some contraindications (reasons) for why treatment may not be appropriate, which the therapist can discuss with you. Dry Needling is offered as a treatment option that supplements 'traditional' physical therapy. Does insurance cover Dry Needling? Currently, Dry Needling is not covered by most insurances. If it is not covered, you will be asked to sign a form that you still want the treatment and understand that you will need to pay for the service out of pocket. You can discuss costs for this treatment with a scheduling/billing specialist at one of the Therapy Plus clinics.
