Safe for all ages Heavy Metal Detox for the whole body. Detox Viruses and prevent bacterial and fungal growth SAFE - NON-TOXIC - 100% ORGANIC HOW CRYSTAL DETOX ZEOLITE IS DIFFERENT TO OTHER ZEOLITES Crystal Detox Zeolite is a highly micronised organic grade Australian Zeolite Clinoptilolite with organic and biologically mined certification from Australian Organics (this means it is super fine and it has been mined according to organic standards and biological farming practices with minimal impact on the Earth Mother.) It is finer and is the hardest Zeolite Clinoptilolite mineral on the Mohs geological scale of hardness. This offers higher drawing power, deeper penetration properties than other zeolites on the market. Like all my products Crystal Detox Zeolite is activated with high-frequency cosmic healing rays which further potentiate its energetic healing properties. additionally... Products are hand-made, filled or hand packed by healers who vibe love when packing them. You support local and Australian produced products. Small scale hand made manufacturing practices reduce wastage and environmental contamination of the Earth Mother. We have over 20 years of clinical experience using Crystal Detox Zeolite to share with you. Product packing is 100% compostable or recyclable preventing pollution. Yearly, we donate a % of Crystal Detox Zeolite profits to environmental and/or animal rescue causes. "}
