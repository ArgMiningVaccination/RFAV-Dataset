Prescriber Update 43(4): 56-57 December 2022 Microscopic colitis Microscopic colitis is an inflammatory disease of the colon that causes chronic, watery, non-bloody diarrhoea.1 Patients often experience between 4 and 9 watery stools per day, but in rare cases, this number can exceed 15.1,2 Whilst the origin of microscopic colitis is largely unknown, it is likely to be multifactorial. Medicines, tobacco and autoimmune conditions have been identified as possible causes.2 There is evidence that a mucosal immune response occurs in genetically predisposed individuals and may contribute to the development of microscopic colitis.1 Diarrhoea associated with microscopic colitis is likely caused by mucosal inflammation.1 Microscopic colitis predominantly affects females and should be considered a possible cause of chronic diarrhoea, especially in middle-aged and older adults.1,2There are two main subtypes of microscopic colitis, and each subtype is based on distinct histopathologic features:1-3 - collagenous colitis - a layer of collagen develops in colon tissue - lymphocytic colitis - the number of lymphocytes (white blood cells) increases in colon tissue.
