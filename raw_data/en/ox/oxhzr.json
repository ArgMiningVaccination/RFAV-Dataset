Unvaccinated Child With Autism Does anyone know an unvaccinated child that has Autism Spectrum? Does anyone know an unvaccinated child eating ORGANIC food only and has Autism? There is almost no Autism in the country I come from but there are only a few vaccines and no GMO. In America 1 in 50 children have autism and the number is going up every year. I work in the USA with children who have autism (child's nutrition specifically) and I can't understand how people don't see the link... Only in America... Does anyone know the above? I have yet to meet one over the past 10 years. [7 Similar Discussions Found](//www.whattoexpect.com/search?tab=community&q=Unvaccinated+Child+With+Autism) LOL I'm going to guess this question is a spinoff from that ridiculous link from our homeboard. My brother has an autoimmune disorder and his vaccine schedule is delayed. He's never received his MMR. He is on the spectrum. I would be very interested to read your sources that prove vaccines cause autism, of that eating organic does not cause autism. My unvaxxed son has autism. I haven't had any vaccines since childhood. We eat mostly organic. He was born with a midwife naturally. If I were you I would go back in this country where people are so healthy they don't need vaccines or have autism. Is it also the country with no jails because people are so sweet and honest? Is it that famous country where you can run with unicorns and dance with fairies? Troll, don't stay in America ... that bad country {} ... eye roll Ah ok that makes sense, thanks!! I've heard from many that they don't. They are pro disease for their pets too! Do anti-vaxxers also not give their pets rabies, parvo, or Bordetella shots? If so why do they? OP, is there a reason you won't identify your home country? I have been following this thread but have yet to comment. I think she was addressing the specific claim of \"autism/regression\" occurring following the MMR vaccine dose, of which the first dose is given around 12 months of age. I know for me, my son displayed (at least) two clear signs prior to that 12 month vaccination. 1) At 10 months old, I was asked by his day care ladies if we'd had his hearing tested, as he wouldn't visible react or respond to his name being called to him when he was playing with toys. 2) Around the same time, my mother and I had to teach him how to put food in his own mouth, as he never did. In fact, it wasn't until we had to do that, that we realised he never put **anything** in his mouth...which is normally a big concern and issue with mobile babies. Of course, these obviously aren't considered \"signs of autism\"...but he's 5 now, and in hindsight these were two clear things that stand out to me when I think back to when I first noticed anything \"different\" or \"atypical\". are you sure this is not just a (badly executed) veiled attempt to bash America? Because that's all I really see you doing, here. Just curious what the red flags were that you saw? Since the first round of shots is at 2 months that seems so early to see autism signs. I honestly don't know a ton about autism so I am genuinely curious. I promise I'm not an anti vaxxer and I hope this doesn't sound antagonistic!! \"What is your country of origin? You have been asked this several times and refuse to answer this very simple question.\" She can't provide it because then we'll all be able to look up statistics for diseases, chronic illness, autism, vaccines, and GMOs and prove her her wrong. Research has suggested that higher rates of autism in the developed world is due to increased awareness and interventions. If we lived in a different country without our access to so much medical treatment, it's quite likely that my son would not have an ASD diagnosis. He'd be considered quirky or weird with a difficult temperament. Also, regarding your statement about how diet cures autism symptoms... I'll tell you what has helped my sons autism symptoms. Therapy. Speech, OT, and behavioral therapy. Being identified at a young age when the brain is highly elastic. That is what has helped. Not non-GMO foods. If someone actually pays you money to cure autism through your dietary advice, I feel truly terrible for those parents. First, you know nothing about autism Jon Snow. Second, they could be potentially missing out on therapies that actually work because they believe your baloney. You are dangerous. If you're going to continue posting on here be prepared to back it up with real evidence, actually respond, and do so intelligently. No one can take you seriously when you refuse to say what country you're talking about, when you don't ever cite studies or research, and claim to diagnose autism by looking at a child. Your \"experience\" and what you see at the store doesn't count as evidence. Until you start providing real information, you're going to be met with nothing but sarcasm and harsh veracity. Of course there is autism all over the world. But nowhere as bad as the USA. I'm not talking about mild cases of autism but severe-and there are many. I see them very often. In stores, playgrounds, doctors office. Well, it's 1 in 50 so go figure. Is your vaccination side effect your ability to diagnose autism by just looking at people? I'm still waiting for your response on this. I'm encouraging you to consider that in your country of origin, which you've been asked to identity several times in this thread and won't by the way, that autism indeed exists but perhaps you didn't notice it because you can't diagnose someone by just observing them on the street. You would not be able to tell my son is on the spectrum at first blush. His symptoms are mild and are only apparent in certain situations, like when he's interacting with peers or his routine is disrupted. He does not \"look\" autistic. No no - we're *all* having to deal with your posts. That's what you mean by vaccination side effect, right? Oh, btw. I'm a person that has to deal with vaccination side effect. Probably for the rest of my life. That's interesting (the article you posted) - my 5 yo son is has mild autism and I know that I have the MTHFR gene mutation. I don't believe that vaccines have anything to with this at all (ie \"triggering\" autism from this gene), but I wonder if there's anything to the theory... I've been lurking on some of my other baby apps. Do NOT go to babycenter's non vax boards by the way. I sit there with my jaw on the floor, then end up getting pissed off at all the CRAZY crazy people. But anyhow, I took some screenshots of a different apps 'green parenting' discussion on vaccinating. Disclaimer: I DO vaccinate my kids and I do NOT believe there's any sort of link with autism. Just wanted to show you what I found here of yet another person spreading fear ((((huge eye roll)))) I notice those mistakes too but actually laughed out loud at pole. Hahah I don't know why but I find that mistake really funny. You are acting like autism would be the only outcome from vaccines. It wouldn't be. It would be a small percentage just like any other vaccine injury. The risks do not outweigh the benefits. You are acting like autism would be the only outcome from vaccines. It wouldn't be. It would be a small percentage just like any other vaccine injury. The risks do not outweigh the benefits. Because I rather have an autistic child than a dead one. It's simple. If research came out that it was indeed linked, then I would still vaccinate. Because the risk is small. Just like any other vaccine injury. I'm sure we would have scientists working to eliminate or change whatever it was in the vaccines that caused autism. I'm sure he is awesome and your very lucky to have such a sweet boy. My husbands cousin is autistic. He is an adult and never leaves his room. Doesn't like to talk to anyone and has tried to hurt himself a couple of times. I know his mom has suffered a lot. Everyones case is different. Again I'm not saying I believe there to be a link to vaccination. If there is, we shouldn't have to choose between a dead child or child with autism. They should find solutions to the problem. Agree with you there - my son's first discernible signs (in hindsight) were between 9-11 months old, before the first dose of the MMR vaccine. Ah excellent point as well. My family member with autism showed many signs before vaccinations also. And hers were even delayed a bit because she was so sick. I never said I thought there was a connection. I'm not against vaccination, my children are vaccinated. I simply disagreed with a comment that was made saying that if vaccination did indeed cause autism, what is so wrong with it. My child is on the spectrum. He's pretty awesome. He's very smart, funny, curious, and affectionate. I'd much rather he be not dead of a preventable disease. Also, OP: there were signs of his autism before he received the mmr vaccine. Autism is a manageable disability. Even at the \"worst\" end of the spectrum, autism is not as bad or as terrifying as people make it seem. In a lot of cases you can't even tell someone's autistic without training or just being acutely aware of what to look for, and even then there's plenty of times you can't tell. Having a child die of a preventable disease, or someone's lack of family vaccination leading to a preventable disease killing an immune-compromised child who cannot be vaccinated, is not a manageable situation. I did since she brought up the other thread first. Oh my goodness. Amniotic not monitor. Posted too soon. The Zika virus has been found in the a monitor fluid of babies born with microcephaly that gives a pretty clear connection. There is no clear cut connection to autism and anything else at this point. And that's not from lack of trying or studying. You really can't compare what is happening with Zika and autism. Oh goodness. Homeboards are so lovely! Thankfully, our Natural News antivaxxer got banned so it's been a little quieter on ours. I can imagine! My homeboard is currently overrun with breastfeeding marijuana smokers... It's quoted from a thread on our homeboard. We have had so many antivax links posted lately. All with zero sources cited, it's frustrating. \"It's unfair for people who don't have children with autism to make comments like that\" 1 of my 3 children has autism, and I still stand by comments like that. So it's \"fair\" for me to say so, yes? Well let's hope they are right. For now I will continue to vaccinate and have faith that I am doing what is right for my children. I just think it's crazy with autism being so common there is yet to be a clear answer to what causes it. Look how easy it was for them to discover that the Zika virus from infected mosquitos is messing with fetuses development. I'm sure if studies came out to prove there was a risk of autism at one year when the MMR is given they would alter the schedule/vaccination to make it safer. As of now, there is no research to prove this so I will not speculate. So it gets delayed... But that means the child is susceptible for 3 whole years with weakened immune systems. Yea.. Sounds like a great plan. I think I understand where you are coming from, but you're missing my main point. I don't think anyone who does not vaccinate wants their children to die. They are taking a risk though, and the risks of a vaccine preventable disease are increased when children are not vaccinated. I think anti-vax parents are not fully grasping the reality that not vaccinating can result in death for their child whereas vaccinating has absolutely no proven link to autism. They are ignoring a proven possibly of death because of a made up \"if\" from vaccinating. Does that make more sense? But it shouldn't have to be a choice. I'm sure they can find a way to delay it. \"Child development specialists have produced decades of research showing that the environment of a child's earliest years can have effects that last a lifetime.\" It's our job to protect our children from everything. If I have to delay a particular vaccine until an age where my 6 months old brain is not so delicate I would. Even if it means keeping him away from society until he is vaccinated. Haha well I knew what you were saying! \"f there is a link than its time to admit it \" but there is nothing to admit, that's the point. You don't have to say \"I'd rather my child die\" your actions say that for you when you don't vaccinate. We are so far removed from when these now-PREVENTABLE diseases wreaked havoc that people seem to have forgotten that they are deadly. So yes, when people's IRRATIONAL fear of autism causes them not to vaccinate, they are essentially saying that they'd rather risk the odds of death than autism. \"It's unfair for people who don't have children with autism to make comments like that.\" Anyone that pays attention to peer-reviewed scientific research has a right to discuss vaccines. Child or not, the decision to vaccinate impacts the entire population, not just the child in question. There is no link, it's been studied time and time again. So her point still stands, if someone isn't vaccinated because they think it can cause autism they are risking death from vaccine preventable diseases instead of autism. That's ridiculous, autism is not a death sentence whatsoever whereas whooping cough, measles, polio, etc are. I've never heard someone that questions whether or not vaccines are linked to autism say they rather their children die. If there is a link than its time to admit it and find a solution instead of having that \"I rather a child with autism than a dead one\" mentality. Perhaps delay that particular vaccines until after children turn 3, since we know the first 3 years are a period of incredible growth in a baby's brain. It's unfair for people who don't have children with autism to make comments like that. I don't know what it's like to have a child with autism, but what I do know is that constant therapy, appointments, special diets, are not part of a normal childhood and I would never want to rob that from my children. You explained this much better than I did. \"It seems that if it was proven that vaccines cause autism you wouldn't care\" Here's the thing, obviously even if we entertained for a moment the ridiculous notion that they do....obviously there are millions of vaccinated children out there without autism. So even if it *hypothetically does*, we are still talking a certain small percentage chance - not a statistical certainty. So essentially, you're weighing up the 1% chance of \"acquiring\" autism against the small chance of your child acquiring whooping cough, polio, rubella, etc. And as such, I don't find that statement offensive at all. Because that *is* what we are implying here. I wouldn't want to expose my child to a neurodevelopment disorder either, but vaccinations are not that. If it came down to vaccinating and risking that my child would be diagnosed with autism, I will choose to vaccinate every time. Having a vaccinated child with autism does not scare me as much as having an unvaccinated child who could contract a vaccine preventable illness and die. I don't think she's saying she doesn't care if vaccines cause autism. It's been proven that they don't. I think she's tired of hearing, \"I'd rather my kid risk death by preventable illness than potentially get autism [even though they wouldn't] because I'm crunchy and don't believe science.\" Personally, I agree. If there was a link between autism and vaccines, it would be important to get it corrected but I'm sick of watching people willfully leave their children unprotected from preventable disease because they are so afraid of autism. Autism [even though the fear is unfounded] > Death \"Can we PLEASE be done with these ridiculous links already? Even if vaccinations do cause autism, what is so terrible about autism? My brother is on the spectrum and I find it insulting that other would prefer a dead kid over an autistic kid.\" You brought up your home board, since I'm also in the July home board I wanted to read the thread. I'm all for vaccinations and I know how important they are. I have a 6 year old who is fully vaccinated and my 6 month old just got his round of vaccines last week. I really cant believe you would make a comment like that. It seems that if it was proven that vaccines causes autism you wouldn't care. I would certainly care and think twice. I would never want to expose my children to something that can cause them to develop Neurodevolpmental disorders. I know your pro vaccinations and your always providing us with useful link. That comment just rubs me the wrong way. *find *not *poll Educate yourself. I didn't say vaccines cause autism. I only would like to fond out how many children are out there that were no vaccinated and still have autism. Simple pole. Glad to have my popcorn ready. This forum poll is in no way going to validate any theory. Not how statistics work. I have 3 teens to young adults who recently were added to my caseload that are unvaccinated with varying levels of autism. I work specifically with people with intellectual disabilities. Perhaps you should check out some broader populations or different populations served? ... Especially since it seems like your experience is limited Ok great to know. It is limited, I work with children without autism too, that's why I ask others. My 1st cousin whom I'm very close with, her share extremely different views with on vaccination, has a son on the spectrum. Her daughter was diagnosed at the age of 5, so when she had her son, she chose not to vaccinate him. He was diagnosed last year. I don't know any unvaccinated children so I can't answer your question.

Lmao that meme Oh my god, I have nothing useful to add but this picture made me laugh so hard! So, you're saying that vaccines and GMOs are somehow linked to autism. That must be a ground breaking discovery. Wonder why there's zero research on those two subjects? Must be trying to cover something up... I'm also very interested in hearing what country or place you come from that has no GMOs.? \"I'm also very interested in hearing what country or place you come from that has no GMOs.?\" I want to know the same thing.
