It is appropriate for work with defined and characterized strains of viable microorganisms not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adult humans. This includes organisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Vibrio harveyi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae or laboratory strains of E. coli. Laboratory Design - A dedicated handwashing sink is available in the lab. - Doors can be locked to prevent access. - All surfaces, including floors, chairs and benchtops are easily cleanable. - Benchtops are impervious to water and resistant to heat, organic solvents, acids, alkalis and other chemicals. - Windows in labs that open to the exterior are fitted with screens. Laboratory Procedures - Eating, drinking, handling contact lenses, applying cosmetics and storing food for human consumption is not permitted in laboratory areas. Food must be stored outside of the laboratory area in refrigerators designated for this purpose. - Wear appropriate PPE, including disposable gloves and lab coat. Add eye protection if a splash hazard exists. - Wash hands in a dedicated sink after working with potentially hazardous materials and before leaving the laboratory. - Never mouth pipette; use mechanical pipetting devices. - Limit access by janitorial and maintenance staff to lab spaces when handling BSL 1 materials. Personal Protective Equipment - Wear disposable gloves, preferably nitrile, to protect hands from exposure to hazardous materials. - Change gloves when contaminated or the integrity is compromised. - Eye protection - Never wash or reuse disposable gloves. - Long pants - Closed toe shoes - Wear aboratory coats, to prevent contamination of clothing. Do not launder lab coats at home. Equipment - Biosafety cabinets and containment equipment are not required for manipulation of BSL 1 materials but are recommended. Signs - Entrance to a lab where BSL-1 materials are handled must be posted with the international biohazard symbol. Request room door signs from EHS, Biosafety. - Equipment that is used in conjunction with biohazardous materials must be labeled with the universal biohazard symbol. Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) BSL-2 is appropriate for work involving agents that pose moderate hazards to personnel and the environment and where vaccines or post-exposure treatment is available. Many of the viral agents used in campus research, such as adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and other herpes viruses fall within the BSL-2 level of work. Microorganisms assigned to this containment level include salmonella spp., V. cholerae and S. aureus. In addition to BSL-1 conditions, this level of work also requires the following: Laboratory Design - Airflow is directional, single pass. - Lab work area is separate from public and eating areas - Access is restricted to authorized personnel only Laboratory Procedures - Conduct procedures with a potential to create aerosols in a biosafety cabinet (BSC). - Decontaminate work surfaces with an appropriate disinfectant at completion of tasks and after any spill or splash. Training - Lab staff and students who work in BSL1 and BSL-2 labs must complete Introduction to EH06 General Lab Safety Training and EH12 Biosafety training. Additionally, upon joining a lab, staff should be oriented to: - Procedures to follow a significant exposure - EHS PI-approval for working with biological material - Review of personal hygiene procedures (hand hygiene, permissible areas for eating/drinking) - Tasks that should be conducted in a biosafety cabinet - Proper use of a biosafety cabinet. - Operation and use of laboratory equipment and decontamination methods - Biological waste handling - Biological material spill procedures Equipment - Work in a biosafety cabinet when performing tasks that can create aerosols. - Autoclaves are available and should be used to decontaminate all potentially infectious waste. - Eyewashes are available within a 10 second walk from location of research. - Safety centrifuge cups/safety blenders are designed to prevent aerosols from being released during centrifugation or homogenization of infectious materials. Personal Protective Equipment Gloves, disposable nitrile - Lab coat - Face shield - Safety glasses or safety goggles - Long Pants - Closed Toe Shoes - Under certain circumstances, additional PPE may be required: - Sleeve covers - Shoe covers - Disposable gowns - Respirators (Certain respirators are designed to prevent inhalation of aerosols. EHS staff must conduct a risk assessment and all persons required to wear a respiratory must pass a medical exam and participate in training prior to use of a respirator.) - If a BSC cannot be used, PPE provides the primary barrier to prevent exposure to infectious materials. Signs - Entrance to a lab where BSL-2 materials are handled must be posted with the international biohazard symbol. Request room door signs from EHS, Biosafety. - Equipment that is used in conjunction with biohazardous materials must be labeled with the universal biohazard symbol. "}
