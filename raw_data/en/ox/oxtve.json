Just casually drop \"I'm vacationing in the Maldives this year\" into conversation, preferably in the dead of winter. Or better yet, go there without mentioning it to anyone\u2014then send them a \"Wish you were here!\" postcard.Read more - BaliBali is a living postcard, an Indonesian paradise that feels like a fantasy. Soak up the sun on a stretch of fine white sand, or commune with the tropical creatures as you dive along coral ridges or the colorful wreck of a WWII war ship. On shore, the lush jungle shelters stone temples and mischievous monkeys. The \"artistic capital\" of Ubud is the perfect place to see a cultural dance performance, take a batik or silver-smithing workshop, or invigorate your mind and body in a yoga class.Read more - KeralaIn this lush, tourist-friendly southern state, positioned between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats, beaches, waterfalls, rice paddies and verdant green hills create a postcard-perfect landscape. Houseboats traverse its many waterways, providing an intimate look at its rural terrain. Rejuvenation programs through Ayurveda (alternative, natural medicine) are popular here; the cool June and mid-October monsoon seasons are considered ideal for healing therapies.Read more - MauritiusMauritius is arguably Africa's wealthiest destination, a tropical paradise with tons to do. Port Louis, the modern capital of this 38-mile by 29-mile island, is a bustling port with a revitalized waterfront and a busy market. But most visitors gravitate toward resort areas such as Mont Choisy, quiet Trou-aux-Biches and the more bustling Flic en Flac, popular with scuba divers. Rivi\u00e8re Noire is ideal for those looking for great deep-sea fishing.Read more - GoaThe sandy coast of Goa is perfect for reclining by the sea. Nestle into a cushioned chair at a beach shack and savor a curry while you sip a Kingfisher beer, watching the sun slip lazily below the horizon. In Old Goa, the beautiful Basilica of Bom Jesus is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a fine example of baroque architecture. Visit during Christmastime to experience a fantastic religious and cultural mash-up of East and West.Read more - El NidoWhy settle for a beachfront hotel when you can stay right over the ocean in a cottage on stilts? And why settle for any old dive site when you can snorkel in an orchid-walled lagoon? El Nido is known as the Philippines' last frontier, and if you're looking for magnificent beaches in an unspoiled setting, it's a perfect place for you to vacation.Read more - Chiang MaiYou could spend your whole Chiang Mai vacation exploring the famous Night Bazaar. Once you've exhausted the art of the cheerful haggle, however, there's plenty more to explore. The National Museum and Botanic Garden are great places to soak up some local culture and to breathe in the delicate fragrance of Thai orchids. In the city's center, the remains of ancient walls embrace over 30 temples. Limber travelers can climb 300 stairs to Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep, an ornate Buddhist temple in the hills.Read more - MaharashtraRead more - SabahRead more No other properties match all your filters.
