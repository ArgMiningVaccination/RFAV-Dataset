Watch the story of the COVID-19 vaccine development unfold by following our treasure trail through the city, pausing to watch animations that reveal the science behind the vaccine. This event will cover the science behind how vaccines work, the steps taken by researchers to develop and test them, and the different vaccine types. It will also address some common questions about safety and usefulness. The tour requires one smartphone or tablet per group which has enough data to watch a series of short videos and interact with the tour. Captions and sound are provided for multiple access needs. The trail is accessible for wheelchairs/pushchairs and there are public toilets on the route. We recommend you allow about 90 minutes for this experience. Where possible we will update our listings to notify of cancelled, postponed and rescheduled events, however we STRONGLY ADVISE that you check with the venue/organiser in the first instance for updates.All information (whether in text or photographs) is supplied in good faith but should not be relied upon as being a statement of representation or fact.
