''Insufcient time'' was the most highly ranked barrier among survey respondents. Interviewees described innovative strategies to overcome bar- riers, including customized intake forms, MBM training for staff, MBM group visits, and discounted referrals forlow-income patients.Conclusions: While increased MBM and self-care training for providers may facilitate the integration of MBM into primary care, systematic changes are needed to decrease time pressures on providers and incentivize patientwellness. Despite barriers, providers are using innovative strategies to provide mind-body primary care indiverse practice settings. Introduction The National Center for Complementary and In- tegrative Health at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) denes mind-body medicine as a diverse set oftherapies that focus on the interactions among the brain, mind, body, and behavior, and on the ''powerful ways in which emotional, mental, social, spiritual, and behavioralfactors can directly affect health.'' 1Modalities that fall under mind-body medicine (MBM) include mindfulness- therapies, relaxation, meditation, yoga, biofeedback, chi , cognitive-behavioral therapies, group support, and spiritu- ality.2,3These therapies have now become part of our healthcare landscape4,5and have been the subject of numerous clinical trials.3,6-8 Although studies have evaluated primary care physicians' use of and attitudes toward MBM,9-12a literature review revealed no studies focusing on the experiences of primary care providers who have integrated MBM into their practice. The current study used qualitative interviews to better un-derstand the facilitators that enhance and the barriers that impede the integration of MBM into primary care.Increasing literature documents MBM's potential to en- hance the treatment of conditions that are poorly managedby biomedicine alone, such as chronic pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and insomnia. 4,6Furthermore, MBM offers a safe, low-tech, and potentially cost-saving complement to the man-agement of chronic diseases, pre- and postoperative care, and mental health disorders.3-5,13,14Many of the common primary care symptoms have strong psychoemotional components andare the same conditions for which the evidence for MBM is the strongest.2A recent study of older adults with low back pain, for example, demonstrated statistically signicant im-provement in physical function, improved pain acceptance,and sustained reductions in pain and sleep medication after an 8-week mindfulness-based meditation program. 15The current study focuses on the most widely used MBM modalities:mindfulness-based therapies, relaxation techniques, medita- tion, guided imagery, hypnosis, and biofeedback.3,5 Materials and Methods This study used semi-structured telephone interviews of providers who offer integrated MBM and primary care, or ''mind-body primary care.'' 1Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA. 2Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. 3Mount Sinai Beth Israel, New York, NY.THE JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE Volume 00, Number 0, 2016, pp. 1-6\u00aaMary Ann Liebert, Inc. DOI: 10.1089/acm.2016.0043 1 Recruitment Participants were recruited via email outreach to inte- grative medicine interest groups within family medicine, pediatrics, and internal medicine professional societies; an announcement in the Consortium of Academic HealthCenters for Integrative Medicine newsletter; and an adver- tisement in the online journal Mindfulness Research Guide . Invitations were also sent via personal emails to mind-bodyprimary care providers known to the study team. To en-courage participation, interviewees received a $10 Amazon gift card. To select interview participants, a maximum variation sampling strategy was used to select physiciansand nurse practitioners from the three major primary care specialties and diverse practice settings. Maximum variation sampling is a purposeful sampling strategy designed tomaximize the diversity and heterogeneity of the participants. Respondents were included if they consented to participate and met the inclusion criteria of being a healthcare providerwho has provided primary care and either provided or re- ferred patients to MBM within the past 6 months. Tool development To begin to understand the barriers and facilitators to MBM in primary care, a survey on this topic was sent viathe outreach avenues described above. The survey tool was developed through literature review9,16,17and informed by discussions with local mind-body primary care providers. Atotal of 68 responses to that survey were received, and thesedata and a literature review were used to create a priori hy- potheses regarding the research question. Interviews wereconducted using a semi-structured interview guide whose questions were based on these initial hypotheses. After a pilot interview, the guide was shortened and questions were re-ordered. The pilot data were not included in the analysis. Thesame nalized guide was used for all 12 interviews (Table 1). Data collection A co-principal investigator (C.M.) conducted most in- terviews; the research assistant (J.G.) conducted a minorityof the interviews. Verbal consent was documented before each interview began. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. The authors stopped after 12 providers wereinterviewed, having satised the requirements for variation and having reached a point with limited new themes emerging from the interviews related to the hypotheses. Allinterviewees were also asked to provide demographic in- formation (Table 2). Analysis and measurement The initial hypotheses was used as a basis for developing an a priori code set for the qualitative analysis. The authors hypothesized that the ability of primary care providers to integrate MBM into their practice would be enhanced orinhibited by such factors as time; staff support; reimburse- ment; attitudes of patients, staff, administrators and fellow physicians; availability of space and referral networks; andthe providers' condence in their MBM skills. In addition tothese preset concepts, which had emerged from the survey, the two readers (C.M. and J.G.) independently identied Table 1.Semi-Structured Interview Guide Questions Follow-up questions/Prompts Imagine one of your primary care patients comes to the clinic.

A senior qualitative researcher (B.K.) reviewed this coding strategy and commented on the appropriateness ofthe code set. The coders (C.M. and J.G.) then coded the rst two interviews. The data were coded using Dedoose,18an online qualitative data analysis program. The coders col-laboratively examined the coding of this rst set of inter-views for consistency and any discrepancies were discussed until consensus was reached on a denition for each code. A nalized set of codes and denitions was developed andused to recode the rst two interviews and to code all re- maining transcripts. C.M. and J.G. independently coded all interviews, with a high degree of consistency betweencoders. Once the coding was complete, the immersion/crystalli- zation approach, as described by Crabtree and Miller, 19was used to look for emergent patterns. After describing these initial themes, two of the authors reviewed the original in- terview material, searching for disconrming data. As a nalvalidation, two interviewees were invited to review andprovide feedback on the results. The institutional review board approved all research methods.Results Sample characteristics Of the 12 interviewed providers, 75% were older than age 45 years and 58% were male. The sample included 7 family medicine providers, 3 internal medicine providers, and 2 pe-diatrics providers; 2 participants were nurse practitioners and 10 were physicians (Table 2). Providers from all four major regions of the United States were interviewed-Northeast,South, Midwest, and West-and providers working in a varietyof socioeconomic settings were included. The most commonly offered type of MBM in the surveyed sample was brief breathing exercises (Fig. 1). Hypnosis was the most commonMBM referral. Ten of the providers reported to ''directly provide one or more MBM therapies to my patients during normally scheduled ofce visits,'' and 4 providers offer MBM''during specially scheduled clinic time (i.e. time reserved for MBM).'' Analysis The analysis of the qualitative data generated four specic themes. Theme I: MBM in the primary care setting can be understood in two main ways: (1) an ''approach'' to one's primary care practice or (2) a set of specic modalities offered in conjunctionwith or in addition to conventional primary care. A ''mind- body medicine approach'' to primary care can be understood as a holistic or a bio-psycho-social-emotional approach tohealing, which involves techniques such as generous lis-tening and attentive use of language during an interview and the therapeutic use of touch during a physical examination. It's a philosophical approach to the way that I approach my patients. I really engage them from a whole-person per- spective.[Nurse Practitioner 011] I try to be aware of the power of words to evoke responses [.] an awareness of the power of language and metaphor in the consult room.[Internal Medicine 010] MBM also often refers more concretely to specic thera- pies, such as biofeedback or clinical hypnosis sessions,which may be offered within the primary care visit, duringTable 2.Characteristics of Surveyed Providers Characteristics Interviewee (%) ( yr 25.0>45 41.7 Specialty Family medicine 58.3General internal medicine 25.0 General pediatrics 16.7 Profession Physician 83.3 Nurse practitioner 16.7 Practice type Academic 50.0 Private practice 8.3Hospital-based Practice 16.7Solo practice 0.0 Group practice 33.3 Other - health center 16.7Other - military 8.3Other - college health 8.3 Payer mix Uninsured (low-income) 18.4 Public insurance 32.9 Private/commercial 45.8Tricare 0.8Self-pay >10 yr ago 75.0 First integrated MBM <10 yr ago 50.0 10 yr ago 50.0 FIG. 1. Types of mind-body medicine (MBM) offered.INTEGRATION OF MIND-BODY MEDICINE INTO PRIMARY CARE 3 separately scheduled sessions, or by other providers through referrals: Myself, it's mostly the breath-work, and then I refer to our in-house mindfulness-based stress reduction(MBSR) or in-house yoga. Or outside, either to a more fullMBSR program, hypnotherapy, or t'ai chi . [Internal Medicine 08] This distinction was important because the majority of discrete facilitators and barriers were identied when theparticipant was referring to specic MBM modalities, as opposed to the ''mind-body approach to primary care.'' For example, when a particular MBM therapy, such as anMBSR class (which requires a group meeting room) or biofeedback (which requires space for the machine) is considered, availability of space emerged as an importantfactor. There are no space requirements, however, to takinga MBM approach to the patient encounter: You can do mind-body medicine anywhere. That is one of the benets of it. [Internal Medicine 012] Theme II: There was a clear consensus among partici- pants that time and reimbursement pose challenges to the integration of MBM into primary care. All interviewees expressed the great importance of having sufcient timewith each patient. Reimbursement was discussed as a sig-nicant factor in determining the amount of time a provider has with each patient because most primary care providers do not receive reimbursement for MBM and can bill only forthe time spent counseling patients: We are relying on insurance reimbursements for our time. We don't bill [ .] for mind-body treatments.[Pediatric Medicine 01] It doesn't make sense that we are tied to that number of visits [but] we still [ .] have numbers we have to meet.[Family Medicine 07] Providers shared several strategies that help them get around the time and reimbursement barriers. Those working inprivate practice may use a retainer fee as a way of covering their costs. Others offer group visits, provide resources for home practice or referrals, or schedule patients back forseparate MBM sessions: Patients pay an add-on fee once a year [ .] that extra rev- enue allows me to keep my schedule the way it is and nothave to see 50 kids a day.[Pediatric Medicine 01] The biggest way of overcoming that barrier is being com-fortable and trained in group visits, because you can seemore patients in the same amount of time. [Family Medicine 04] I will practice it with them in the ofce a little bit, and then steer them towards YouTube videos to try to have them continue it at home.[Family Medicine 07] Schedule them back for a dedicated MBM appointment.That's a way around the time barrier. The other thing is tohave a resource to refer them to. [Family Medicine 06] Five of the providers we interviewed work in settings where more than half of their patient population have public in- surance or are low-income and uninsured. Specic strategies for providing MBM to low-income patients included havingvolunteer staff, establishing agreements with outside MBM providers for discounted services, and acquiring grant funding to subsidize the provider's time: Having some programs here for free in-house denitely helps [.] and having relationships with people in the community who will do discounts.[Internal Medicine 08]We have good grant support for these integrative medicinegroup visits, which subsidizes my time and allows me to dothis kind of work. [Family Medicine 04] Theme III: The level of support by providers' administration, colleagues, staff, and professional community is a signicant factor in their success in integrating MBM. Lack of support from one's administration can make offering MBM moredifcult or can even prevent certain modalities from being offered: We were not allowed to do certain things because we really didn't have great support from the administra-tion. [Nurse Practitioner 09]Administrative buy-in is required, for example, to do mind-body training with clinic staff, to change an intake form, or to have more MBM services co-located atone's clinic: Have it introduced by the medical assistants [ .] [they] are more from their community, [ .] so if they say ''Oh, you're expressing that you're having this pain for months [ .] ask Doctor X, he knows a lot about techniques to help withthat, like meditation, ask him about that.'' Normalize it abit. [Internal Medicine 08] On [our] intake form, there is a whole list of stress reductionactivities that we ask if they do, including a number ofmindfulness interventions. [Family Medicine 05] One participant offered an analogy with onsite integrated mental health services as an already proven model that could facilitate greater integration of MBM in the primary caresetting: Having on-demand mental health care in a primary care clinic helps improve outcomes [ .] I would love to have that for mind-body medicine. [ .] Say ''I need to move on to the next patient, but [ .] my colleague Theresa does biofeed- back and since you and I discussed it and you seemed in-terested, you could go do it right now.''[Family Medicine 06] Theme IV: Providers who integrate MBM into their primary care practice have a deep commitment to MBM that comes from a place of personal conviction and experience. Pro- viders' commitment is largely rooted in personal experi-ences of healing or benet from mind-body practices, and this personal commitment is important in nding a way to overcome the obstacles: It was my own experience in medical school, I had depres- sion, severe, major depression, and mindfulness was per- sonally very helpful for me. [ .] I started, thinking, ''boy, this would be great for the patients too.''[Family Medicine 06] This is my dharma, if you will, to have a practice that reflects the values that I live with my family, that I believe in [ .] I could never really imagine practicing any other way.[Pediatric Medicine 01] Providers also spoke of a reciprocal benet of offering MBM; not only do patients benet from a MBM approach, but it alsohas a healing and energizing effect on the provider: I can't tell you what an amazing thing it is to get to see patients, take care of them, and also get to meditate withthem.[Family Medicine 04] I incorporate it more into my own life, because if I'mtaking care of myself, it's a lot easier to be fully pres-ent. [Nurse Practitioner 09] Mind-body medicine, practicing that and doing that with my patients, for me, has been the best way to really build and develop these relationships over time.[Pediatric Medicine 01]4 MCGUIRE ET AL. Discussion The potential of MBM to improve delivery of healthcare remains far from fully realized, especially within primary care. This study investigated a set of hypotheses about the most important facilitators and barriers experienced bymind-body primary care providers. Insufcient clinic time was identied as a signicant barrier by all interviewees, a nding that mirrored a 2007 study of the factors limit-ing physician interest in MBM. 17Participants described increasing time pressures on primary care, which are com- pounded by the push for meaningful use and patient- centered medical home certication, higher patient demandgenerated by increased insurance coverage by the Afford- able Care Act, and an avalanche of new preventive and chronic disease management guidelines to address in eachvisit. As one participant described it: '' [It's] just the stress that primary care is experiencing, there is more demand for our time, and more demand for our work in terms of pro-ductivity.'' [Family Medicine 04]The ndings related to reim- bursement for mind-body primary care were nuanced. Apart from one physician whose private practice charges a retainer fee, very few providers indicated that they receive any en-hanced reimbursement for offering MBM. However, one provider argued that when ''incorporating [MBM] as a foundational intervention [ .] there is no need to worry about reimbursement. It is just part of your visit.''[Family Medicine 05] This quote highlights the distinction described in theme I:MBM is both an approach to patient care as well as a set ofdiscrete therapies. How mind-body primary care is dened has important implications for the expansion of the eld. Should providers seek training in particular MBM modali-ties and offer those therapies as an expanded scope ofpractice? Or should the focus be on training more providers to take an MBM approach to all aspects of patient care, including how they interview, examine, counsel, and engagewith patients? Our data suggest that the ''mind-body pri- mary care approach'' may eliminate some of the potential barriers to implementation posed by the challenge of of-fering specic modalities in this setting. Eighty-three per- cent of surveyed providers offer MBM directly within their regularly scheduled primary care visits, whereas only 33%offer MBM in separately scheduled visits dedicated toMBM; this may suggest that the current trend is more to- ward the former approach rather than the latter. One of the encouraging ndings from the interviews was the abundance of innovative strategies providers use to overcome the identied barriers. Clinic-level strategies, such as developing customized intake forms that ask aboutstress management and the use of MBM, or training medical assistants to ask these questions, are both ways to help start the conversation about MBM with the patient even beforethe provider enters the room. Group visits, which may im- prove patient and provider satisfaction 20and nancial ef- ciency,21are an exciting strategy for mind-body primary care delivery. Providers also discussed several specicstrategies for providing MBM in underserved settings. The importance of developing referral networks with discounted services was one such strategy. This research suggests that a provider's dedication to MBM comes from personal experience with mind-body practices and also highlights the overlap between providers'commitment to MBM and their own self-care. Increasing the amount of combined MBM and self-care training in medical school, residency, and continuing medical educa-tion could build a foundation for targeting this key facili-tator identied. Importantly, teaching self-care through mindfulness and other mind-body interventions may also be effective in mitigating physician burnout. 22 Limitations Although the recruitment methods were designed to be as broad as possible, a limitation of the study is that the sample was nonrandom and potentially subject to responder bias. Conclusions This exploratory study provides some useful insights into the facilitators of and barriers to the use of MBM among primary care providers. The ndings suggest the need forsystematic changes to decrease the time pressures on pri- mary care and incentivize patient well-being. As we move toward value-based care, shared savings, and accountablecare, as well as the use of patient-reported outcomes mea- sures to evaluate quality of care, these changes will poten- tially become even more of a priority. Whether MBM isconsidered an approach to patient care or a set of specicmodalities, it is clear that time and reimbursement will continue to be a challenge until the healthcare system begins to truly incentivize wellness instead of diagnoses and pro-cedures. As noted by one respondent: ''We need to develop a healthcare system that values wellness [ .] and rewards patients for self-care. Until we do that, we are not going tohave success with mind-body.''
