While it means an end to \"the dog days of summer,\" it brings with it many possibilities. There are opportunities to meet new friends, learn new things and perhaps strap on a new backpack or put on a new school outfit! But with the start of a new school year also comes close contact with other students and the easy spread of germs. So how do you, as a concerned parent, ensure your child is best protected? Organizations like the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html) (CDC), the [American Medical Association](https://wire.ama-assn.org/ama-news/physicians-agree-vaccination-crucial-public-health) (AMA) and the [US Department of Health and Human Services](https://www.vaccines.gov/who_and_when/infants_to_teens/index.html) (HHS) recommend immunizations for school-age children as a matter of public health and safety. Let's take a look at the facts, like whether your child really needs to get shots - and, if he or she does, where can you go to get the needed vaccinations for school that fits easily into your hectic schedule. Are vaccines required for my child to go to school? States are responsible for establishing laws for vaccinations, and while all 50 states have a school immunization requirement of some kind for school entry, not all states require all vaccines. They are recommended however by most school boards. If your child enters kindergarten in Missouri, for example, five shots are required, whereas if he or she is starting school in Connecticut, count on getting nine shots, including booster doses, before school starts in late August or early September. In the last few years, schools have begun to send children home for so-called \"exclusion days\" from school until their vaccination records are updated. This is a safety precaution for other children, as an unvaccinated child may be carrying a communicable disease. Also, certain childcare providers may also require your child to have vaccinations before they are able to attend or possibly sign-up for daycare. Here's an overview of state-based vaccinations for your child and what diseases immunization prevents, as well as what could happen to your child should you neglect getting immunized. Table of Shots for School by Vaccine Type Annually, tens of thousands of Americans get sick from diseases that could be prevented with vaccines. To ensure that both their students and the larger community are safe, some schools and daycares have taken matters into their own hands. Because [research shows that outbreaks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5007135/) tend to cluster geographically in areas where immunization rates are low, many educational institutions require vaccinations as part of their admissions policy, regardless of state law. Religious and philosophical exemptions to these laws exist in some states - inquire with your local health authority or school for more details. Is it safe for my child to receive immunizations? We get it: your number one priority is your child's health. So it's reasonable to have concerns over anything you give your child. Before any vaccine is recommended for use in the U.S., highly trained scientists and doctors from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC perform a series of clinical trials over a 10-year span to make sure it's both safe and effective. Then, once it's licensed, these experts continue to monitor the vaccine to make sure there are no public health or safety concerns. Vaccines, like any medications, can cause side effects. But these are usually mild (e.g., soreness where the shot was given or [low-grade fever](https://www.gohealthuc.com/library/baby-fever-temperature)) and go away within a few days. Statistics from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) show that childhood immunizations are [90-99% effective in preventing disease](https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/immunizations/Pages/Immunizations-home.aspx) and [save 2.5 million children every year](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/security/immunization.htm) - or 285 children every hour - from preventable disease. Serious side effects are rare, with [only one in a million children having a serious allergic reaction](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm). Are vaccines only for babies and school-aged children? While immunizations might seem like they are just for the sake of your school requirements, getting pediatric vaccines can in fact help your child develop immunity against diseases before coming into contact with them, so get them well before school starts. They're especially important for babies and young kids who are at greater risk for infectious diseases since their immune systems haven't yet developed the defenses to fight invaded bacteria or viruses. However, vaccines are not just for the early years. Immunizations are recommended for people of all ages. One reason additional shots are needed is that vaccines wear off over time. While your child should receive doses of DTaP for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) before age 7, for example, a [booster TDaP shot is needed](https://www.gohealthuc.com/library/tdap-vaccine) at age 11-12. Also recommended around this age are HPV and meningococcal shots. HPV protects from the human papillomavirus, which 14 million Americans contract each year and can cause various forms of cancer. And the meningococcal vaccine helps prevent meningococcal disease, which can lead to infections of the fluid and lining around the brain and spinal cord as well as bloodstream infections. For adults, your lifestyle, job, travel, and health conditions can impact what [vaccines are recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult-schedule-easy-read.pdf). Shots that are needed for pregnant women differ from those needed for college students, the elderly, or those with chronic health conditions. Flu shots are also recommended for all people annually, starting at 6 months. Wonder what specific vaccines you should get? [Take this quiz](https://www2.cdc.gov/nip/adultimmsched/) to find out!
