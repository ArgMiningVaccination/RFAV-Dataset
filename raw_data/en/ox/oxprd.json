All rights reserved.Foreword The RACGP Curriculum for Australian General Practice 2011 builds on the strengths of the previous 2007 curriculum and The RACGP Training Program Curriculum 1998. It is a truly collective effort which codifies countless hours of general practice experience into a solid professional foundation for the high quality education and training of our future general practitioners. In February 2011, The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Council identified the need to renew the curriculum for Australian general practice training. The Council recognised that the previous curriculum was robust and sound, but would need to be updated to include the newer, contemporary core competencies that are necessary for practising within an evolving general practice environment. The rise of e-health, the requirements of leadership and management, quality and safety concerns and the increasing role of teaching and research in general practice within the context of multidisciplinary primary care, all present educational and training challenges. Updating the general practice curriculum is the first step on the path to incorporating these skills into the lifelong learning of GPs. Curricula are very much the domain of educators, and so the next step will be the development of curriculum learning supports for general practice registrars and teaching guides for educators to help meet training requirements. For this reason, an updated edition of The RACGP Curriculum Companion will be published. The College will seek input from registrars and general practice educators around Australia to assist in the production of these valuable resources. Future planned curriculum developments will include online interactive tools to assist learners and educators. This will ensure that the collective wisdom and professional expertise of generations of GPs are passed on effectively and efficiently. Curriculum renewal is an ongoing process because of the changing environment of medicine and general practice. Continual feedback is encouraged and we welcome feedback through the RACGP website. Ongoing maintenance of The RACGP Curriculum for Australian General Practice will be facilitated by the RACGP National Standing Committee for Education. The 2011 curriculum is the beginning of a renewal process that will provide continuing and relevant support to learners and educators to assist GPs in acquiring the necessary skills, knowledge and attitudes to provide high quality general practice care, training and research within the modern world that is Australian general practice. We recognise that our future achievements depend upon our past successes, and this contemporary curriculum could not have been achieved without the endless commitment of contributors to this, and past, curricula. For this, we thank all of those involved, but I suspect that their reward is the knowledge that our profession's body of learning will provide a sound basis for high quality general practice care to the Australian community. And this is the reason that we spend our lives learning.

The curriculum details the knowledge, skills and attitudes that GPs require for: competent, unsupervised general practice meeting their community's healthcare needs supporting current national health priorities and the future goals of the Australian healthcare system. The curriculum emphasises self directed learning, the development of critical self reflection and lifelong learning skills, and the maintenance of professional practice standards. Who is the curriculum for? The curriculum is an essential reference for general practice registrars, general practice supervisors, medical educators, regional training providers and anyone involved in the implemention of the training of future GPs. For this reason, the curriculum also details learning objectives for medical students and prevocational doctors. The acquisition of these skills may also be of interest to many medical specialists. Curriculum development The 2011 curriculum was developed by updating on the already significant achievements of the 2007 curriculum and the 1998 training program curriculum. Development of the 2011 curriculum took into account: the discipline of general practice as a medical specialty what GPs need to know ('the domains of general practice') the lifelong learning needs of GPs (from medical student through to prevocational doctor, vocational training and containing professional development) the reasons most people seek the services of a GP ('common patient presentations') the evolving general practice environment since the last edition of the curriculum. Using this framework, new curriculum statements were developed and existing statements revised, detailing the training and educational outcomes that relate to various populations, presentations and processes in Australian general practice. How has the curriculum changed since 2007? The RACGP Curriculum for Australian General Practice 2011 incorporates new educational and training needs that have risen out of the evolving Australian general practice environment such as: the increasing focus on competency based training in a move away from a traditional apprenticeship based model the incorporation of identified contemporary competencies that need to be added to the GP's traditional skill set, especially management, teaching, research, quality and safety, teamwork, e-health and leadership RACGP curriculum statement 2011 | vii the incorporation of updated information on the general practice environment, such as Australian general practice statistics, new RACGP initiatives and policies and changing Australian Government policies the incorporation of feedback and comments received since publication of the 2007 curriculum reformatting of the curriculum content. This was required to increase accessibility, utility and user-friendliness, especially for general practice registrars, general practice supervisors, regional training providers and general practice educational providers. Implementation of the curriculum update The RACGP Council appointed a Curriculum Review Working Group to systematically update the 2007 curriculum content to meet these aims. The RACGP Council recognised that the 2007 curriculum content was sound and robust, and that the main task was one of updating and not rewriting. The Curriculum Review Working Group reviewed each of the statements with respect to embedding these concepts throughout the curriculum. Each statement was then reviewed by expert reviewers prior to Censor-in-Chief approval. In addition, specific measures for each of the identified newer contemporary core competencies were incorporated into the curriculum and underwent expert general practice review prior to final RACGP Council review. Introduction of training outcomes The 2011 curriculum introduces a new section entitled, 'Training outcomes'. This section replaces the description of skills in the previous curriculum inline with the trend toward outcome based training. A training outcome is a specific focus on a particular attribute (skill, knowledge or attitude) expected of learners at the end of general practice training. This reformatting clarifies specific expected competencies by the completion of general practice vocational training. Most of these training outcomes were listed in the 2007 curriculum, apart from a small number of outcomes associated with the above identified newer contemporary core competencies. Each training outcome now has an associated code, as detailed in the section 'Guide to using the curriculum'. The new format of the 2011 curriculum is designed to enable and facilitate discussion and incorporation of specific educational requirements into training programs. The numbering of competencies and learning objectives will also assist in the mapping of the curriculum to training programs.viii | RACGP curriculum statement 2011Guide to using the curriculum Curriculum background The background to the curriculum provides the basis for the content, structure and development of the curriculum. The key areas of the 2011 curriculum are: Definition, purpose and development Context of Australian general practice Learning life of general practitioners The five domains of general practice The 'star of general practice' and development of a new curriculum framework. Curriculum statement areas General curriculum statement chapters There are two general curriculum statements: Common learning outcomes defines common training outcomes and learning objectives for general practice relevant to consulting with patients in unsupervised general practice Philosophy and foundation of general practice includes the philosophy, concepts and principles that define the roles of GPs and the discipline of general practice. Specific curriculum statement chapters The specific curriculum statement chapters are arranged into three major sections: People and their populations Presentations Processes of general practice. A full list of the statement chapters appears at the end of this section. Key features of each curriculum statement Each statement is divided into the following key areas: Definition Curriculum in practice Rationale and general practice context Training outcomes of the five domains of general practice Learning objectives across the GP professional life. Definition Defines the role of a particular area of health within the general practice setting. Curriculum in practice This section provides case studies that illustrate how the curriculum statement area relates to general practice. These may be used for teaching and discussion in conjunction with the curriculum.RACGP curriculum statement 2011 | ixRationale and general practice context This section documents how the statement area relates to the context of Australian general practice. It focuses the learning and training outcomes to meet the specific general practice needs of the Australian community. Training outcomes of the five domains of general practice The specific outcomes of general practice training are described in this section. It focuses on the attributes (skills, knowledge and attitudes) expected of learners at the end of each stage of training across the five domains of general practice. Training outcomes numbering The training outcomes are numbered for easy referencing and mapping across the broad range of general practice training, learning and assessment programs and processes. Each training outcome code/number consists of: a unique three letter code which identifies the statement area that the specific training outcome comes from followed by a 'T' to indicate that the specific curriculum code refers to a 'training outcome' this is followed by the domain number (see the five domains of general practice) which is followed by the curriculum item number. For example: DERT1.2 identifies the second training outcome of the first domain (ie. communication) in the Dermatology statement. Learning objectives across the GP professional life This section describes the objectives of education and training for each stage of the GP's learning life. The objectives in this section are stated in measurable outcomes for the educational benefit of learners and teachers. This enables lesson planning and assessing learning outcomes across the general practice learning life. Note that each learning objective level assumes a previously attained learning (as detailed in the previous level). For example, the vocational registrar level assumes that the previous learning objectives of the prevocational doctor and the medical student have been attained. Learning objectives numbering The learning objectives are numbered for easy referencing and mapping across the broad range of general practice training, learning and assessment programs and processes. Each learning objective code/number consists of: a unique three letter code which identifies the statement area that the specific training outcome comes from followed by an 'L' to indicate that the specific curriculum code refers to a 'learning objective' this is followed by 'M', 'P', 'V' or 'C' to indicate the learning life level of the objective (M = medical student, P = prevocational, V = vocational registrar, C = continuing professional development) which is followed by the domain number (see the five domains of general practice) and dimensions followed by the curriculum item number. For example: DERLM1.2 identifies the second learning objective at the medical student level for the first domain (ie. communication) in the Dermatology statement.x | RACGP curriculum statement 2011Curriculum statement by area Statement chapter name Code/abbreviation General curriculum statement chapters Common training outcomes Philosophy and foundation of general practiceCTOPHI Specific curriculum statement chapters People and their populations Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health Aged care Children and young people's health Disability Doctors' health Genetics Men's health Multicultural health Population health and public health Rural general practice Women's health AGE CYP DIS DOC GENMENMCHPOPRURWOM Presentations Acute serious illness and trauma Chronic conditionsDermatologyDrug and alcohol medicineEye and ear medicineMental health Musculoskeletal medicineOccupational medicine Oncology Pain managementPalliative care Sexual health Sports medicineACUCHRDERDRUEAEMHEMSKOCCONCPAIPALSEHSPO Processes of general practice Critical thinking and research Undifferentiated conditionsE-health Integrative medicineMultidisciplinary care Practice managementProcedural skills Quality and of medicineTeaching, mentoring and leadership in general practiceCTR UNDEHEINTMDCPMAPROQASQUMTMLRACGP curriculum statement 2011 | xiContext of Australian general practice General practice has a core set of clinical characteristics and practices unique within medicine. These characteristics and practices are defined by the general practice curriculum developed and maintained by the RACGP and reflected in the standards set for clinical practice and the award of FRACGP . General practice training is intended to equip graduates with core clinical skills and the ability to assess and address their learning needs over a professional lifetime. General practitioners encounter a wide range of clinical presentations according to social, demographic, cultural and epidemiological circumstances. In addition, GPs may need to develop, maintain and expand their skills as supervisors/teachers, mentors, researchers and leaders. These factors combine to form unique local practice characteristics, regional clinical trends and national characteristics. Definition of general practice The term 'general practice' is not consistently used in international literature. The terms 'family medical practitioner', 'family physician' and 'family doctor' are also used to describe the primary care medical practitioner. In Australia, The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners defines general practice as: 'General practice provides person centred, continuing, comprehensive and coordinated whole person healthcare to individuals and families in their communities'. 1 General practice involves the ability to take responsible action on any medical problem the patient presents, whether or not it forms part of an ongoing patient-doctor relationship. In managing the patient, the clinician, called 'general practitioner' in Australia, may make appropriate referral to other doctors, healthcare professionals and community services. General practice as a specialty in Australia In Australia, general practice is recognised as a specialty by a range of criteria, including by statute. Key events have led to the recognition of general practice as a specialty in Australia. In 1978, the National Specialist Qualification Advisory Committee stated that 'general practice is a specific and defined discipline in medicine' In 1989, general practice was established as a specialty with the introduction of the vocational register of recognised GPs2 In 1999, the Australian Medical Council (AMC) developed a model to assess recognition of medical specialties and recognised general practice as one of the then, 17 medical specialties in Australia. 3 In 1989, changes led to the establishment of a separate listing of GPs who met the RACGP training, experience and assessment requirements: - Fellows of the RACGP are specialists as they have met the RACGP requirements for entry into the specialty of general practice - recognised GPs are specialists as they have met the RACGP requirements prior to the cut off date in 1995 for vocational registration - since 1996, Fellowship of the RACGP (FRACGP) is the minimum standard of entry into unsupervised general practice and the only route to recognised general practice. In 2003, the AMC, in line with its national processes for the review and accreditation of specialist education and training programs, accredited the RACGP's education and training program. 4 xii | RACGP curriculum statement 2011Learning life of general practitioners Examining the steps to becoming a GP qualified for unsupervised practise in Australia helps define training needs at each stage of the path to becoming a competent GP . Prior to entering general practice vocational training, medical practitioners will already have had many years of training by a range of individuals, organisations and institutions. A uniform general practice curriculum from the earliest stage of medical education helps support trainers. This forms a solid foundation for general practice training. Learning life stages In Australia, the stages of the GP's learning life have been identified as: medical student prevocational doctor vocational general practice registrar continuing professional development. Some students may enter this training path at different stages of the learning lifecycle. For example, an international medical graduate may enter at various points in the cycle depending on previous levels of qualifications. Due to the comprehensive nature of general practice, some of these steps crossover with training pathways to other medical specialties and therefore have competing training priorities. Medical student A medical student is defined as a student who is enrolled in a primary medical degree and will undertake a general practice placement. Medical student teaching in Australia has undergone major change in recent times. Consistent with the principle of the journey of general practice, medical student teaching now emphasises active learning, learning of key principles and preparation for lifelong learning. 1 In addition, the places where medical students are trained have also changed, with students spending more time in community health settings, doctors' private rooms and private hospitals, small urban and rural hospitals, as well as the more traditional tertiary teaching hospitals. The content of medical courses has changed with the rise of evidence based medicine, the rapid increase in medical knowledge, new developments in areas such as molecular medicine and genetics, and the incorporation of issues driven by consumers and regulatory bodies. Medical students have also changed. About half of Australia's medical schools only admit students who have a degree in another discipline, resulting in a more diverse age group than in the past. More than half of medical students are female, medical schools are committed to a higher proportion of rural and indigenous students, and the cultural diversity of students matches the changing ethnic groups within Australia. In addition, some medical courses are undergraduate, while other courses are postgraduate. The term 'medical student' reflects the vocational nature of the medical course. Around 30% of Australian medical graduates are currently entering general practice and this is the largest proportion of students entering a medical specialty in Australia. 5 General practice teaching therefore has an obvious place in undergraduate medical curricula where the medical students are planning to become GPs. However, these learning requirements need to intersect and overlap with the needs of students planning careers outside of general practice, or for the many students who have not yet decided on their future career paths.RACGP curriculum statement 2011 | xiiiGeneral practice: the foundation discipline While there will be many undergraduates not planning a career in general practice, there will be many areas of curriculum overlap that will be of mutual benefit for all future graduates, regardless of their final vocation. There are many skills that are common to all medical specialties, and these generalist skills are the core values of the medical specialty of general practice. General practice training can provide the basic foundation, or at least a significant proportion, of the professional skills required for other medical disciplines, including the patient-doctor relationship, advocacy and decision making and dealing with uncertainty and difficulty in complex situations. Generalist skills involve a holistic approach to managing the health of individuals - a skill that should ideally cross all medical speciaties. Rather than just dealing with diseases, GPs manage health within biomedical, psychological and social contexts based on firm epidemiological foundations. Medical management decisions are patient centred; made jointly between the doctor and the patient while understanding the personal significance of illness. At the practice level, GPs are required to manage the complex micro-economy of a practice, deploying resources to maximum effect and to work closely with hospital colleagues, practice teams, community services and multidisciplinary teams. Doctors must build partnerships and advocate for patients and their profession, often in difficult and complex situations. Many of the defined general practice skills, such as those described across the domains of general practice, are mutually necessary training requirements for medical specialties. These include elements in which general practice training departments have considerable expertise, such as communication skills, healthcare ethics and the behavioural sciences (Figure 1). In addition, as general practice is the first point of contact for the majority of people seeking healthcare and often therefore the point of referral, knowledge of general practice is an essential part of the education of all multidisciplinary health team members. Medical specialist competencies Psychiatrist skills Physician skills General practitioner skillsGeneralist skillsAny other discipline skills, eg. paediatrician, geriatrician, radiologistSurgeon skills Competency areas Figure 1. Generalist training common to all medical specialties sits within the discipline of general practice training and provides the foundation for many medical specialtiesxiv | RACGP curriculum statement 2011This helps to develop better links between primary care, hospitals and community based care, given that quality of healthcare is increasingly concerned with continuity, co-operation and communication between different health services as medical practice moves to a multidisciplinary approach. 6 The prevocational doctor Prevocational doctors are defined as junior doctors who are undertaking supervised work in a hospital, but who have not yet enrolled in a specialty training program. Junior doctors undertaking postgraduate work while working in hospitals may enter specialist training paths at various times. General practice education training needs to recognise the multiple priorities and demands that affect prevocational doctors, as some may have chosen a future career in areas other than general practice. In Australia, the curriculum and learning needs of prevocational doctors are areas of much debate and work. The Australian Curriculum Framework for Junior Doctors developed by the Confederation of Postgraduate Medical Education Councils, 6 provides a common level of skills for junior doctors in Australia. Most of these skills sit well within the generalist skills required for general practice, although many junior doctors will start to acquire additional skills and competencies in preparation for entering other vocational training programs beyond those listed in the curriculum. This will usually involve self directed learning and mentoring as the prevocational doctor takes the step toward vocational training. The vocational doctor Completion of vocational training and the FRACGP equip medical practitioners with the core competencies required for unsupervised practise in Australia. A vocational general practice registrar can also be in training for Fellowship in Advanced Rural General Practice (FARGP). (See the Rural general practice curriculum statement.) For many GPs, the qualification of FRACGP or FARGP is only one more step in their learning life. Continuing professional development After qualifying as a vocational GP , and as part of professional learning life requirements, all GPs need to ensure ongoing professional development and continuing quality assurance activities in order to maintain core general practice competencies. As part of continuing professional development, many GPs also choose to become general practice educators and supervisors, or to participate in the ongoing development of general practice standards through the RACGP . General practitioners may also need to develop skills beyond basic vocational requirements. For example, a rural GP may need to maintain a level of obstetric and anaesthetic skills not required by an inner city GP . There may be intercollegiate committees that regulate these activities, and GPs may need to participate in designated ongoing professional development programs. An Australian example is the joint consultative committees that work across medical colleges. 7 In November 2008, the RACGP Council endorsed the creation of the National Faculty of Specific Interests (NFSI). This new faculty allows the RACGP to formally recognise those GPs with an additional interest and expertise in a specific area of clinical practice. The NFSI is charged with the role of conduit, allowing GPs with an interest in a specific area of general practice the ability to pursue their interest within the College rather than look outside the College for like-minded members and networking or educational opportunities. 8 In all of these situations, GPs need to self direct their learning requirements and may need to comply with regulatory requirements to be eligible to provide services, such as medical imaging, or to be eligible for medical indemnity cover. Other GPs may take further formal postgraduate training and the learning professional life of GPs needs to recognise the diversity of ongoing learning activities in which GPs participate. RACGP curriculum statement 2011 | xvPrinciples of the lifelong learning of GPs Over a GP's professional lifetime each level of learning builds upon the previous learning level and assumes that all previous requirements have been met. In reality, the path is continuous rather than consisting of discrete steps. Most learning levels will overlap to some extent (Figure 2), so that: a medical student may have a special interest in women's health and decide to study beyond the undergraduate curriculum a first year prevocational doctor may have already decided to develop a special interest in public health, but has decided to train as a vocational GP on their way to their final goal and may already have acquired high level skills in their special interest area. Adult learning principles and concepts The RACGP Curriculum for Australian General Practice 2011 is based on the following key adult learning educational concepts and principles that are applied across the GP learning life: needs focused training - directed toward meeting the healthcare needs and priorities of the Australian community learning as a continuum - integrates vocational training with undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education lifelong learning - encourages a commitment to continuous improvement of knowledge and skills throughout a GP's learning life experiential learning - emphasises training as a supervised 'real world' clinical experience of consulting with patients who present with common and significant conditions, typical to general practice Figure 2.

GPs as mentors and teachers The maintenance of high quality general practice education and training depends on the recruitment and training of medical educators in each generation of GPs. The nature of this teaching varies from informal settings to strictly regulated training programs with summative examination processes. In reality, each level is often involved in the education of those in earlier lifecycle stages. For example, a prevocational doctor may educate or mentor medical students, a third year junior doctor may teach procedural skills to a first year junior doctor, and a qualified GP may teach all levels of GPs. A good clinician does not necessarily make a good teacher, and attention to the levels of training and teaching skills required at each level of the learning life helps to maintain and improve ongoing educational skills levels. For example, as part of continuing professional development, GPs may consider their role in teaching medical students or general practice registrars and may need to examine their skill requirements. GPs as leaders The increasing complexity of primary healthcare and the increased role of multidisciplinary patient care and incorporation of quality improvement measures at the practice level require GPs to acquire the skills necessary to be effective leaders. General practitioners need to be able to set organisational values and strategic direction within a practice (which is different from management) that involves directing people and resources to achieve organisational goals. It also involves developing multidisciplinary team approaches to quality and safety within the practice. The acquisition of leadership skills, closely related to the skills required for teaching and mentoring, need to be incorporated at all levels throughout the GP's learning life. GPs as researchers 'Primary care research is the missing link in the development of high quality, evidence based healthcare for populations'. 9 General practice research not only improves patient care and enables teachers to contribute to their discipline, but also stimulates intellectual rigor and critical thinking, which is identified in this curriculum as a core competency. The rise of evidence based medicine and the concurrent need for equipping students with appropriate analytical skills means that skills that were normally only part of the domain of researchers are now commonplace among medical practitioners. In addition, the increasing use of clinical audits as a means to quality improvement in the general practice setting requires the application of basic research skills.RACGP curriculum statement 2011 | xviiPlanning and accountability A uniform general practice curriculum across the professional learning life provides a transparent process to ensure that, in addition to professional requirements, the community expectations and obligations of GPs are met. Defining requirements at each level provides a common ground for negotiating medical student curricula with other medical specialties to achieve cross-discipline curricular consistency. Such a process is likely to be iterative as knowledge and fields evolve. However, an explicit process will clarify mutual learning objectives, plan skills development and ultimately ensure that patient care needs are met. An explicit lifecycle learning approach also provides an open, transparent and robust process by which governments, regulators and other general practice stakeholders and community groups can influence the curriculum process across the entire field of medical education to ensure both professional and societal accountability. The five domains of general practice The five domains of general practice represent the critical areas of knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for competent unsupervised general practice. They are relevant to every general patient consultation. The RACGP Curriculum for Australian General Practice 2011 bases lifelong teaching and learning on these domains. The five domains of general practice Domain 1 - Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship (eg. communication skills, patient centredness, health promotion, whole person care) Domain 2 - Applied professional knowledge and skills (eg. physical examination and procedural skills, medical conditions, decision making) Domain 3 - Population health and the context of general practice (eg. epidemiology, public health, prevention, family influence on health, resources) Domain 4 - Professional and ethical role (eg. duty of care, standards, self appraisal, teacher role, research, self care, networks) Domain 5 - Organisational and legal dimensions (eg. information technology, records, reporting, confidentiality, practice management). The five domains of general practice provide a comprehensive, robust framework for ensuring that the key skill areas of general practice are included in education and training.xviii | RACGP curriculum statement 2011The star of general practice and development of a new curriculum framework Combining the domains of general practice with lifelong learning provides a powerful conceptual framework for positioning the 2011 curriculum in the Australian clinical context in which the knowledge and skills are applied. This can be represented as the 'star of general practice' (Figure 3). The framework enables educators to train GPs across the diverse and wide range of clinical presentations, which vary according to social, demographic, cultural and epidemiological circumstances. Even though local practice characteristics, regional clinical trends or national characteristics may vary, this model provides a common ground for the essential discipline of general practice knowledge across the learning life cycle and domains of general practice.

They outline the minimum skill sets required for competent practice as a general practitioner. This curriculum statement provides the required common training outcomes for general practice and was first developed by the RACGP for its vocational training registrars in 1999. It was subsequently updated for The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Curriculum for General Practice (2007). The name 'common learning objectives' has been changed to 'common training outcomes', although the actual training requirements of this section have not changed.24 | RACGP curriculum statement Common training outcomesRationale and general practice context The RACGP developed the common training outcomes after taking into account: what GPs need to know (the domains of general practice) why most people seek the services of a GP (common patient presentations) the health needs and priorities of Australia's population. Common patient presentations General practice primarily involves providing advice to individual patients in the diagnosis, treatment and management of medical conditions. General practitioners manage the majority of medical presentations in the community. The Curriculum for Australian General Practice reflects the type of patient presentations that come to the attention of GPs and therefore highlight: problems which significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality common presentations which exemplify general practice presentations requiring special skills health problems which present differently in different population groups presentations with a public health significance health problems that have been shown to be preventable. Key educational principles and concepts This curriculum for Australian General Practice is based on the following key educational concepts and principles: Needs focused training Directed toward meeting the healthcare needs and priorities of the Australian community. Learning as a continuum Integrates vocational training with undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education.Lifelong learning Encourages a commitment to continuous improvement of knowledge and skills throughout the GP's learning life. Experiential learning Emphasises training as a supervised 'real world' clinical experience of consulting with patients presenting with the common and significant conditions that exemplify general practice. Purpose driven learning Clearly states purposes and curriculum requirements to enable learners to make informed choices about learning pathways. Integrated training Balances and integrates experiential, information based and reflective learning.RACGP curriculum statement Common training outcomes | 25Adult learning Uses models of learning based on recognition of different learning styles and needs. Self directed learning Expects adult learners to exercise significant autonomy in making choices about their learning. Feedback Requires high quality and regular feedback to learners on their performance as an integral and critical part of teaching and supervision. Assessment Regular assessment of learner achievement of curriculum learning objectives during and at the end of training to determine satisfactory completion of training requirements. Related curriculum areas Refer also to the curriculum section: Learning life of general practitioners for further information on educational principles.26 | RACGP curriculum statement Common training outcomesThe five domains of general practice The five domains of general practice represent the critical areas of knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for competent unsupervised general practice. They are relevant to every patient interaction. Teaching and learning is based on the acquisition of these key knowledge, skills and attitudes. This section relates the five domains of general practice to the common training outcomes. Domain 1. Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Good communication skills enable a GP to develop a relationship with patients in order to understand both the illness and the patient's experience of that illness, and to move freely between clinical problem solving and the patient's experience of the problem. Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship includes the following areas: communication skills patient centredness communicating health promotion whole person care. Domain 2. Applied professional knowledge and skills The application of professional knowledge and skills requires a comprehensive, patient centred approach. This applies not only to health and disease, but also to the individual's experience of illness in terms of their culture, family and community. This approach includes analysis of the appropriateness and cost effectiveness of all clinical interactions. Applied professional knowledge and skills includes the following areas: physical examination and procedural skills medical conditions decision making. Domain 3. Population health and the context of general practice Population health, in the context of general practice, is an essential component of primary healthcare. The GP has an evolving role with the potential to create change at the individual patient, practice, and community levels within the healthcare system. This requires knowledge of the sociopolitical, economic, geographical, cultural and family influences on the health of patient groups and their communities. Population health and the context of general practice includes the following areas: epidemiology public health prevention family influence on health resources.RACGP curriculum statement Common training outcomes | 27Domain 4. Professional and ethical role The GP's professional and ethical role relates to their behaviour with respect to patients, colleagues and the community. Professional ethics are based on belief systems of the profession and the community. Professional and ethical role includes the following areas: duty of care standards self appraisal teacher role research self care networks. Domain 5. Organisational and legal dimensions Organisational and legal dimensions includes the following areas: information technology/e-health records reporting confidentiality practice management. 28 | RACGP curriculum statement Common training outcomesTraining outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1.

This foundation defines: what is involved in being a GP how this role is different from other disciplines within medicine the role of general practice in the lives of individual patients, their personal context, their communities, and the health system. For medical students and prevocational doctors, an understanding of this foundation will improve understanding of the place and significance of general practice in their working life. For vocational trainees, this foundation will provide a framework for building a detailed and comprehensive understanding of their chosen profession of general practice. For established GPs, this foundation provides an external reference as a basis for reflection on the knowledge, skills and attitudes developed in training and from clinical experience. The philosophies, concepts and principles of general practice permeate all aspects of general practice. The learning objectives of this statement should therefore be borne in mind in relation to all the priority learning areas. Curriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the philosophy and foundation of general practice curriculum applies to general practice: As an experienced GP supervisor you have been invited to address the graduating year of the University Centre of Excellence. Positioned on either side of you are professors whose names you recognise from journal articles as international experts. Your topic is the changing role of general practice and you see this as an opportunity to inspire the next generation. As you wait your turn to speak, you reflect on the highs and lows of 25 plus years of practice. You are well aware of the changes that have already taken place, yet cannot help but think that the core elements of general practice have remained the same. Listening to one of the other specialists talking about exciting new technology, you decide to focus your talk, as you have your career, on the care of each person who walks through your door. 'Let me tell you the story of Mikaela ...'36 | RACGP curriculum statement Philosophy and foundation of general practiceRationale and general practice context General practice is the primary focus of the Australian healthcare system. General practitioners provide ongoing patient centred healthcare for all members of the community based on an understanding of health and illness as a uniquely personal experience, shaped by past experience, cultural, social and contextual dimensions. General practice manages patient health and illnesses grounded in knowledge from biomedical, psychosocial, intrapersonal and interpersonal perspectives. At both a systemic and consultation level, general practice is the interface between medicine and the community, science and humanity, evidence and creativity. Australian general practice in the 21st century is the continuation of a millennium-long tradition of caring for the sick, and the central place of general practice will continue to evolve as part of a dynamic, diverse society, which it will reflect and influence. The discipline of general practice has evolved through historical, cultural, social, political and contextual influences, but certain core characteristics relating to the relationship between patient and doctor, and doctor and community, have remained immutable over time. These include: the patient as the centre of concern the patient-doctor relationship as the basis of the therapeutic process the distinctive problem solving skills of GPs primary care management a holistic perspective to care comprehensive scope a community based context. The patient-centred approach to general practice care General practitioners have the breadth and depth of knowledge of disease as covered by this curriculum, but integrate this knowledge with an understanding that the presence or absence of disease does not necessarily correlate with a health-to-illness continuum, being patient focused, rather than disease focused. '... the kind of commitment I am speaking of implies that the physician will \"stay with\" a person whatever his problem may be, and he will do so because his commitment is to people more than to a body of knowledge or a branch of technology. To such a physician, problems become interesting and important not only for their own sake but because they are Mr Smith's or Mrs Jones's problem. Very often in such relations there is not even a very clear distinction between a medical problem and a nonmedical one. The patient defines the problem.'1 Managing complexity and uncertainty in general practice The relationship GPs have with their patients, together with the importance of the context in which patients and their doctors live, mean that GPs need to be skilled in managing complexity and uncertainty. The challenge of managing complexity and uncertainty is also increased by the natural epidemiology of disease in the community and changes in medical care technology.RACGP curriculum statement Philosophy and foundation of general practice | 37Issues contributing to complexity and uncertainty in these areas include: early presentation of disease relatively infrequent occurrence of serious illness recognition, integration and management of multiple issues, often in a single consultation, but also over time influence of comorbidities on each individual health problem ongoing management of the increasing prevalence of chronic illness in the community ability to manage complex illness based on advanced and developing technologies constantly evolving boundaries between other healthcare providers and general practice based care, including issues of access and affordability, which may be practice and/or location specific understanding of the structure and the dynamics of the community collaboration with patients in drawing on and developing their self care skills. General practitioners as patient advocates in complex health systems In contrast to specialist practice, in which patients are selected to match the service provided, GPs need to be flexible and able to draw on an extensive range of knowledge and skills in meeting the health needs of individual patients, both in the short term and over a long professional relationship. General practitioners incorporate the expertise of other healthcare providers as appropriate, and this includes the essential role of acting as patient guide and advocate in an increasingly fragmented healthcare system. Good general practice primary care improves the health of populations Health systems firmly based on primary healthcare have been shown to achieve better health outcomes, improve health equality and be cost effective.2 Integrating the foundation skills of general practice into a comprehensive care approach - key principles The foundations of general practice need to be understood in the context of a complex, integrated totality that reflects the whole patient, their environment, and how these interact with each other. The following key principles are the specific skills necessary for quality general practice care. The quotes after the key foundation principle expresses this concept as a GP might describe them, followed by the key skills required to demonstrate these principles. While the skills are listed individually, every element needs to be integrated into the whole of general practice to meet the aim of comprehensive care. The patient is the centre of concern 'It is important to know my patients. I am more concerned about patients as individuals than about the disease. I take my patients' beliefs, circumstances and concerns into account when deciding what to prescribe or when and where to refer them.' This principle requires GPs to: demonstrate respect for patient autonomy work in partnership with the patient as determined by the needs of the patient negotiate management plans in terms of the patient's preferences and priorities.38 | RACGP curriculum statement Philosophy and foundation of general practiceThe patient-doctor relationship is the basis of the therapeutic process 'It is important that patients can trust their GP . Sometimes more good is done by just listening.' This principle requires GPs to: develop communication skills to underpin effective diagnosis and management (eg. listening, reassuring, explaining, interpreting) develop effective communication skills to build and maintain a therapeutic relationship develop more specific counselling skills in different situations foster continuity of care as determined by the needs of the patient develop self awareness and boundaries. Distinctive problem solving skills 'I know the community. I know the \"horses and zebras\". I often need to juggle several problems at a time. General practice is an art and a science.' This principle requires GPs to: relate the diagnostic process to the community context (eg. disease prevalence) recognise serious and urgent problems use time as a tool tolerate uncertainty collaborate with patients on acceptable management plans integrate comorbidities into management decisions use investigations and technology appropriately integrate scientific evidence and other relevant factors toward a solution move from one mode or role to another (eg. diagnostician, counsellor) as required by the problem at hand or by the patient's needs engage in reflective practice. Primary care management 'I am the first port-of-call. I have colleagues I can call on when I need to and I know the available services in the community.' This principle requires GPs to: deal with unselected and undifferentiated presentations triage appropriately work in teams integrate the expertise of other healthcare providers practise ongoing management of patients with chronic health problems. Holistic perspectives 'I know this patient's background and it really influences how he is suffering now. I also know whether he can afford treatment.' This principle requires GPs to: take into account social, psychological, cultural and existential dimensions be integrative rather than reductionist. RACGP curriculum statement Philosophy and foundation of general practice | 39Comprehensive scope 'You never know who walks through the door. General practice care is more than dealing with the presenting complaint. At times it's difficult to know where to start.' This principle requires GPs to: recognise that the range of patients are not limited by age, gender, culture or health problem diagnose and manage disease at any chronological stage in the process including: -health promotion -prevention -case finding -acute presentations -chronic illness -palliative care know how to diagnose and manage a broad range of health conditions across multiple systems diagnose and manage multiple morbidities or concerns in the one patient. Community based context 'I meet patients where they live and take our community into account when planning their care.' This principle requires GPs to: be limited only by what may be managed in the particular community (not just primary care) respond to the needs of community adapt to the political context mediate between medicine and community understand the private practice context work effectively within the healthcare system (eg. legal requirements for prescribing and legislative regulations).

These terms are contested and need to be considered in local contexts. The following definitions are offered as a way to understand these concepts in the context of this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Curriculum Statement. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting This phrase is used throughout this document to refer to any professional interactions with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people, or to discussion about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health issues in any professional setting. Aboriginal community controlled health service Today there are community controlled health services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO) describes an aboriginal community controlled health service (ACCHS) as: 'a primary health care service initiated and operated by the local Aboriginal community to deliver holistic, comprehensive, and culturally appropriate health care to the community which controls it (through a locally elected Board of Management).' 1 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health The National Aboriginal Health Strategy Working Party defined health as: 'Not just the physical well-being of the individual but the social, emotional, and cultural well-being of the whole community. This is a whole-of-life view and it also includes the cyclical concept of life-death-life.\" 2 This is the definition used in this curriculum statement. Consistent with the holistic approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, as well as with the World Health Organization (WHO) model of primary healthcare,3 delivery of healthcare to Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander patients is more than just a clinical service. The learning objectives in this curriculum statement reflect this approach of broader healthcare delivery by being closely linked across the domains of general practice, and by referencing the individual patient. Community control The 1989 National Aboriginal Health Strategy describes community control as: 'the community having control of issues that directly affect their community... Aboriginal people must determine and control the pace, shape and manner of change and decision-making at local, regional, state and national levels.' 2 Cultural advisor This term is used in this document to refer to those who provide advice to assist healthcare professionals working in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting. Most commonly and appropriately these people will be Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. Culture This term has a wide range of meanings but for the purposes of this document the following is used: 'Culture, for us, then, is more than \"a people's way of life\". Culture tells us what is pretty and what is ugly, what is right and what is wrong. Culture influences our preferred way of thinking, behaving and making decisions. Most importantly, culture is living, breathing, changing - it is never static.' 4 Cultural safety This term describes: 'an outcome of health practice and education that enables safe service to be defined by those who receive the service.'4 The RACGP National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health www.racgp.org.au/aboriginalhealthHealthy Profession. Healthy Australia.Empowerment This term describes the state of being empowered.5 Empowerment cannot be 'given'. Individuals and groups can only empower themselves when they make informed choices, determine their own fates and acquire resources to support their decisions. Empowerment, then, is part and parcel of self determination.4 Partnership A term used in this document that refers to a mutually respectful relationship with equity that seeks to achieve agreed outcomes having regard to legal, ethical, cultural and policy considerations. Self determination This term is used to refer to: 'a process where Indigenous communities take control of their future and decide how they will address the issues facing them.' 6 Social determinants of health These are defined by the WHO as: 'The poor health of the poor, the social gradient in health within countries, and the marked health inequities between countries are caused by the unequal distribution of power, income, goods, and services, globally and nationally, the consequent unfairness in the immediate, visible circumstances of people's lives - their access to health care, schools, and education, their conditions of work and leisure, their homes, communities, towns, or cities - and their chances of leading a flourishing life. This unequal distribution of health-damaging experiences is not in any sense a 'natural' phenomenon... Together, the structural determinants and conditions of daily life constitute the social determinants of health.' 7 In the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting this includes the processes of colonisation, dispossession, racism, marginalisation, oppression, stigmatisation, paternalism and prejudice. 8 World view This term is used in this document to describe the perception and experience of existence as shaped by the culture, history, spirituality, belief systems, and political and social interactions of the individual. Rationale The health of Australia's first peoples is this country's most pressing and important health priority. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people are among the most disadvantaged indigenous peoples in the developed world. 7,9,10 The available evidence suggests that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people continue to suffer a greater burden of ill health than the rest of the population. Overall, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people experience lower levels of access to health services than the general population, are more likely than non- Indigenous Australian people to be hospitalised for most diseases and conditions, and are more likely to experience disability and reduced quality of life due to ill health, and to die at younger ages than other Australians. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people also suffer a higher burden of emotional distress and possible mental illness than is experienced by the wider community. 11 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health inequity occurs across all health indicators and many areas of health continue to worsen. Whilst there have been recent gains, the gap is widening as the health of other Australians improves faster. 12 General practitioners have a key service delivery role in addressing this inequity in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, either within an ACCHS or other GP settings.53 The RACGP National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Healthy Profession. www.racgp.org.au/aboriginalhealth Healthy Australia.54 General practitioners are also important advocates in improving the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Australian governments have not only failed to deal with the ongoing consequences of colonisation but in some cases, they have actively promoted racism for political ends. Key health policies such as the National Aboriginal Health Strategy 2 remain largely unimplemented.8 It is time that Australia dealt with its history of suppression and oppression of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in accordance with international best practice in the field of human rights.8,13 It is time that the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, including their inalienable rights to self determination and community control are not only recognised but given full expression. Empowerment is central to this critical process in the maturation of modern Australia. To overcome Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantage requires political will and leadership. It requires the recognition of the profound, diverse and dynamic cultures of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It requires the generous provision of appropriate and sustainable resources and the commitment of those in leadership roles in our community. To most effectively assume these roles of health service provision and advocacy, GPs require relevant knowledge, skills and attitudes. The National Aboriginal Health Strategy (1989) 2 recommends that: 'Tertiary institutions for undergraduate and postgraduate medical, nursing, and paramedical courses be approached to include the compulsory study of Aboriginal culture and history and health issues as part of formal course work,' also recommending that: 'Aboriginal people should be involved in the development and teaching of these units.' This is the guiding principle by which this document was developed. This curriculum statement sets out a framework of essential attitudes, skills and knowledge required by GPs in order for them to work respectfully and appropriately in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health settings and to advocate for equity in health and related outcomes with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The five domains of general practice - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Culturally safe communication skills are fundamental to the GP's effective engagement in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting. There is a diversity of cultural beliefs and practices, world views and behaviours among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. General practitioners should respect and be sensitive to this. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' views of health and wellbeing differ to, and are more holistic than, those encapsulated by the biomedical model. They include diverse aspects such as social and emotional wellbeing, community relationships and connection to land. General practitioners who incorporate this into their practice will be better able to understand their Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander patients' needs and motivations. Trust plays a very important role in the development of a therapeutic relationship in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting. A GP may find that they are unable to achieve their desired outcomes until a certain level of trust has been established. General practitioners working in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting must ensure at all times that they avoid a paternalistic approach when delivering healthcare. A partnership approach is more empowering and is more likely to lead to successful outcomes. Applied professional knowledge and skills 'Applied professional knowledge and skills', contains further learning objectives relevant to 'Communication skills and the doctor-patient relationship'. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people are more likely to The RACGP National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health www.racgp.org.au/aboriginalhealthHealthy Profession. Healthy Australia.have a complex interaction of significant health issues including risk factors and medical conditions as well as underlying social and emotional issues. General practitioners require comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge and skills across the spectrum of these health issues. Management strategies should incorporate an understanding of the views of health and wellbeing, and the social determinants of health and their influence on health behaviours of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people and communities. They should be consistent with the comprehensive patient centred approach outlined in the RACGP Common learning objectives 14 curriculum document. A key component of assessment and management in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting is recognising and incorporating the knowledge and skills of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander health workers, liaison officers and cultural advisers. The capacity to work in a multidisciplinary team partnership approach is a GP key skill for better health outcomes. There are related learning objectives in domains 4 and 5. Population health and the context of general practice Colonisation and government policy decisions have had and continue to have a profound effect on the wellbeing of past, current and future generations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. General practitioners need to understand that the healthcare they deliver is affected by these policies and the social determinants they have influenced. General practitioners working in an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting require a sound knowledge of the epidemiology of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and relevant preventive and other population health strategies. Family and community can have a powerful influence on the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the healthcare of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people needs to be understood in the context of family and social relationships. Effective primary healthcare in an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting requires the provision of equitable access to holistic healthcare that addresses the social determinants of health and the right to self determination. Professional and ethical role Cultural advice is a key component of working in an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting. Each GP needs to be conscious of their worldview and its influence on their work within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting. This is an ongoing process across the learning life of the GP and includes openness to feedback from cultural advisors. Self care strategies are important in order for GPs to overcome the personal impact of the level of disadvantage and inequity in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting. General practitioners have a role to play in advocating for their patient group and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health equity. In the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health setting, academic roles including those of teacher and researcher have the potential to contribute to reducing health inequalities. These roles require an awareness of ethical considerations specific to this setting. Organisational and legal dimensions There are many models of health service delivery to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The ACCHS model has a pivotal role in the delivery of primary healthcare to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and is an expression of self determination.55 The RACGP National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Healthy Profession. www.racgp.org.au/aboriginalhealth Healthy Australia.56 Learning objectives across the GP professional life Medical student Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship Compare Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander views of health and wellbeing with the prevailing models of healthcare Define culturally safe communication with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people Demonstrate an understanding of the diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and their relationship to identity in contemporary Australian society Explain the importance of establishing trust when communicating with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people Discuss the differences between a paternalistic approach to health service delivery and an empowering approach and demonstrate how they might influence outcomes in the provision of healthcare to Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander patients.

Although aging is associated with increasing levels of disability, most older people have a positive view of their own health with the majority of Australians aged 65 years or older (66%) rating their health as either good, very good or excellent, while 34% report their health as being fair or poor.1 The term 'frail aged' is used to describe aged people in need of substantial level of care and support. The definition of older varies between individuals, communities and cultures. For example, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a lower life expectancy than the non-indigenous population and are therefore likely to need aged care services earlier. The gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is smaller at older ages. For example, life expectancy at age 65 years is estimated to be 10.7 years for indigenous males and 12.0 years for indigenous females, around 6 years less for men and 8 years less for women than for non-Indigenous Australian males and females. 1 Because of this life expectancy difference between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and the low proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 65 years and over, the terms 'older indigenous person' or 'older Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander person' is generally considered to include all those who are aged 50 years and over. In 2006, 11% of Indigenous Australians were aged 50 years and over. Women made up 53% of Indigenous Australians aged 50 years and over, and 55% of those aged 65 years and over. 1 Curriculum in practice A typical presentation that illustrates how the aged care curriculum applies to general practice is: Walter, 92 years of age, is a veteran who moved to your area when his wife died 3 years ago. He lives in a converted garage behind his son's house and rarely socialises as he is reliant on others for transport. He has a history of degenerative joint disease, particularly affecting the lower back and right knee, for which he takes regular paracetamol, and hypertension for which he is taking a diuretic. He drinks a stubby of beer each evening, but has never been a heavy drinker. He used to smoke during the war, but hasn't for many years now. He wakes several times each night to use the toilet, which wakes the entire family when he enters the house. Despite this, his bed is often wet in the morning due to nocturnal enuresis. His daughter-in-law is at her wits-end and requests sleeping tablets for Walter. Walter is usually a well dressed man, but on this occasion you notice he is not cleanly shaven and his cardigan has food stains over it. He is vague and forgets your questions. He also appears under-nourished. RACGP curriculum statement Aged care | 6364 | RACGP curriculum statement Aged care Rationale and general practice context Australia has an aging population. In 2010, 13.5% of the Australian population was aged 65 years and over compared to 12.4% in 2000.2 Around 34% of general practice patient encounters are with adults aged 65 years and over, and general practitioners are seeing an increasing proportion of older patients, particularly those aged 75 years or over.3 This presents significant challenges for clinical care, population health and economics of healthcare. The underlying pathologies among the elderly are the same as among the whole population, but at higher rates. However, there are specific features in the diagnosis and management and the functional and social ability of elderly patients, for example: symptoms with no clearly identifiable aetiology altered patient presentations impact of aging on people with pre-existing conditions, particularly intellectual impairment, mental illness or physical disabilities difficulties in cognition and communication multiple pathologies multisystem disease that often involves chronic disease management problems of polypharmacy decreased reserves in elderly people (physiological, psychological, financial) the importance of functional assessment and support sensory deficits such as impaired vision, hearing and balance nutrition, physical activity, continence and pain the need to relate to carers, relatives and other health professionals the need to be aware of community resources the importance of continuity of care. A knowledge of the physiology and epidemiology of aging helps manage conditions that have special significance in the elderly, such as dementia and atherosclerosis. Quality aged care in general practice requires: positive attitudes toward empowering elderly patients to take an active part in maintaining their health the ability to deal with and prioritise the numerous problems that the aged may present with, including associated diagnostic and management dilemmas feeling comfortable when working with the aged, their families, carers and friends working within multidisciplinary healthcare teams recognising the special issues (including discrimination) facing older people from diverse backgrounds, including issues of gender differences, ethnicity, poverty and issues of sexuality including sexual preference assessment of carer stress to allow early intervention including the possible need for respite care.RACGP curriculum statement Aged care | 65Factors affecting general practice aged care management Familiarity with government policies and programs that have an impact on the aged4 and knowledge of the increased burden of disease in the elderly helps plan general practice aged care. These policies aim to promote health and to prevent and reduce the loss of function from illness, injury and disability. Examples of such policies and programs include rational prescribing practices, such as the Quality use of medicines guidelines,5 which consider the cost and benefits of prescribing medications to individual patients, helps incorporate public health initiatives into daily clinical practice, and health promotion and preventive care in the elderly. Costs of different care options, such as home support versus institutional care, may influence general practice management options. Patients may need to be treated outside of the general practice setting, eg. at home, at hospital or in an aged care facility. Cultural and linguistic diversity, socioeconomic status, gender, family and community supports, and geographical location may affect the needs, acceptance and availability of services and activities for the aged. Cultural differences, perceptions and expectations of aging may affect levels of carer responsibility and involvement. General practitioners need to be aware of the special services available to help meet the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. General practitioners need to be aware of how age related discrimination can affect the management of older patients. Informed consent may be impaired in the elderly and the care of aged patients may involve carers, issues of power of attorney and regulatory administrative bodies such as guardianship boards. This includes discussing, formulating and documenting advanced care plans and decisions concerning the end-of-life. Older patients may require assessment for fitness to drive and laws may affect their licence eligibility. Other legal requirements which may require general practice involvement, include pension eligibility, taxi concessions, and death and cremation certificates including coronial obligations. Clinicians need a knowledge of legislative reporting obligations to state public health units that may involve older patients. Older patients are especially at risk of adverse patient safety outcomes, especially in relation to the inappropriate use of physical or medication induced restraint, missed diagnoses due to failure to evaluate vague or unclearly expressed symptoms, and failure to understand management instructions. General practitioners identifying elder abuse have legal reporting responsibilities. Multidisciplinary aged care and general practice The rise of multidisciplinary teams in primary care (eg. aged care assessment teams) is changing the face of the care of older people. General practitioners need to ensure that the appropriate continuity of care and coordination of management are provided to maintain older people in an optimal state of health in the best possible setting. General practitioners working as part of a multidisciplinary team need to understand the roles, knowledge and skills of each member of the aged care team including allied health professionals, support agencies and specialist aged care teams. General practitioners need to be aware that comprehensive care plans can result in complex referrals, service overlaps and gaps requiring accurate written health summaries for patients and carers to avoid confusion during continuity of care.66 | RACGP curriculum statement Aged care Related curriculum areas Most other curriculum areas have implications for aged care, including: Acute serious illness and trauma for managing emergencies Chronic conditions Disability Mental health Multidisciplinary healthcare Multicultural health for successful cross-cultural communication including the correct use of translators Oncology Pain management Palliative care Population and public health regarding disease prevention.RACGP curriculum statement Aged care | 67Training outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1.

The age ranges of childhood and adolescence overlap, reflecting that the developmental transitions through childhood, adolescence and adult life are not determined only by reference to chronological age. Physiological, psychological and social developmental milestones are also markers of maturation, and these vary considerably between individuals. The end of adolescence is usually marked by the acquisition of skills and responsibilities such as financial independence, entering the workforce and undertaking lifelong partnerships. More recently these skills and responsibilities have not been attained until a later stage in life.1 For international epidemiological comparisons, most authorities define adolescence as the period between ages 10-18 years.2-5 This statement uses the term 'young person' rather than adolescent. This reflects the current preference of professionals working in the field. Curriculum in practice Typical presentations that illustrate how the children and young people's health curriculum applies to general practice include: Annisa, 8 years of age, is brought in by her mother because the school is concerned she may have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. A bright child, she is not performing well academically and is frequently getting into trouble for disruptive behavior. The family has recently moved in with relatives due to financial difficulty. As her mother is explaining the situation, she is constantly reprimanding Annisa, who is prowling your room picking up and putting down multiple objects. Annisa appears to pay no attention and her mother rapidly escalates to raising her voice and grabbing her by the shoulder. At this point Annisa sweeps her arm sideways, knocking a tray of instruments onto the floor. She then sits in the corner scowling. Emily, 17 years of age, has been sent home from school, having fainted in the classroom. Her mother is at work but rang to say she is worried that Emily is over-stressed about her exams and has been uncharacteristically emotionally volatile at home. She is also concerned that Emily has not been eating well for a while and tends to have hot chips and soft drink for dinner, as both parents do not usually arrive home until late. Despite this, Emily looks healthy, with a slim build, but with an uncommunicative attitude.80 | RACGP curriculum statement Children and young people's health Rationale and general practice context The prenatal, childhood and adolescent phases of development strongly influence an individual's subsequent health, wellbeing and opportunities in life.6 Therefore the general practice care of children and young people takes on a special role in creating future opportunities, especially for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other disadvantaged communities.7-10 Families consult general practitioners and community nurses for problems arising in infancy more commonly than any other health professional.11,12 Many presentations that appear medical at first may be related to parenting issues such as parental exhaustion, lack of confidence or even guilt. For example, the single most common problem for families nurturing infants is poor sleep, which affects up to 45% of families. Sleep deprivation has a high impact on the family in a number of measurable ways. Inappropriate medicalisation of this and similar presenting problems may result in these families missing out on effective evidence based help.13-15 When the patient is a newborn, an infant or a child, the rewards of the work are enhanced when the doctor is able to establish a social relationship with the patient and their family. This includes insight into the child's view of their situation and managing parental concerns in a way that enhances the parents' understanding, self confidence and capacity to manage. Parents report that they value doctors who understand the complexities of family life.16 Recent evidence has indicated a rising prevalence of childhood neuropsychiatric disorders, which has resulted in an emphasis on the importance of healthcare providers supporting families in the early years of child-parent interaction for the long term promotion of mental health in children and young people.17,18 General practitioners often see the same young children as community nurses and other healthcare workers, and need to communicate appropriately for optimal patient care.19 Ten percent of consultations in general practice are with patients aged 15-24 years,20 but many young people do not feel comfortable raising certain important health issues with the doctor,21 while others experience barriers to accessing general practice care. General practitioners often find it challenging to provide optimal care for young people for a number of reasons.22-25 The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reports that among young people:26 there has been a large decline in death rates (mostly due to fewer injury deaths) asthma hospitalisations and notifications for hepatitis (A, B and C) have decreased and there is improved survival for cancer: survival for melanoma is now very high favourable trends are occurring in some risk and protective factors, such as smoking and illicit substance use most sexually active Year 10 and Year 12 students are using contraception the majority of young people rate their health as 'good', 'very good' or 'excellent' most young people are achieving national minimum standards for reading, writing and numeracy, are fully engaged in study or work, and have strong support networks most young people are able to get support from outside the household in times of crisis. These gains in the health of young people need to be contrasted against rising rates of diabetes and sexually transmissible infections, high rates of mental disorders and, for males, road transport accident deaths. Many young people are overweight or obese, not physically active or eating enough fruit and vegetables, and drinking at risky or high-risk levels. Many young people are also victims of alcohol or drug related violence, or are homeless. 26 General practitioners need to implement evidence based guidelines for developmental surveillance and early intervention strategies for children and young people, including immunisation, as documented in the RACGP Guidelines for preventive activities in general practice.27 RACGP curriculum statement Children and young people's health | 81Psychosocial factors affect the wellbeing of young people regardless of whether there is co- existing organic disease or disability. These factors include multiple and often conflicting cultural influences and pressures. Threats to adolescent health and wellbeing largely arise from psychosocial factors,16 yet healthy adolescent development often involves behaviours that constitute health risks. General practitioners need to be able to assess risk and protective factors in the context of the developmental tasks of adolescence.28,29 Communication difficulties between doctors and young people, either real or perceived, are barriers to young people accessing medical care in any setting.21-25 These arise in part because of the unique developmental processes that occur during adolescence which may make the young person self conscious, mistrusting or cautious about authority figures such as doctors. Young people often have critical concerns about privacy and confidentiality and may be anxious about dealing independently with systems of healthcare that are not familiar to them. Doctors' confidence in dealing with young people is improved by training in communication skills.30 Systemic counselling approaches are often used when managing children and young people's health, for example strengths based counselling, which seeks to recognise strengths of families, and/ or other systems to support the child/young person.31 General practitioners in Australia are becoming increasingly involved with the adult care of young people with chronic disease or disability, who face particular challenges when they become adults and need to move from tertiary paediatric care to adult models of care.32,33 Adolescent friendly practices can make a practice attractive to young people. Practices need to be child, family and young people friendly with a friendly atmosphere and ease of access. External practice systems need to enable communication and collaboration with the community, colleagues in general practice, and other health professionals. High quality information management enhances clinical practice, especially by supporting audits of clinical work involving children and young people. Capacity at the 'system level' refers to opportunities for working with others that can only be put in place as a result of negotiation by general practice organisations and government in collaboration with other stakeholder organisations in the community. Practices need to ensure that the multidisciplinary care of young people negotiates successful and high quality management plans. Health inequality in children and young people Inequalities in health status have been identified in Australian children when measured at school entry, which then continues to increase throughout primary and secondary education,34,35 which can then threaten long term health. This widening health inequality can result in cumulative health vulnerabilities in children of poorer socioeconomic status, challenging the effectiveness of one-to- one general practice consultations in improving health outcomes. General practitioners increasingly need to be able to work in teams within the practice and to collaborate efficiently with primary healthcare professionals in the community and other community resources in order to be able to support families most at risk.82 | RACGP curriculum statement Children and young people's health Training outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1.

Therefore, a person with an impairment may not necessarily be disabled or handicapped by it. Alternatively, inadequate supports in an environment may lead to an unnecessary handicap as a result of an impairment. This holistic concept of disability, which combines medical and social models, is reflected in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). 1,2 The concept of support needs - which can assist the person to overcome some of these limitations - has recently been added to the classification. There are three main types of disability. Physical disability - disability associated with physical impairment and physical activity limitation such as when performing day-to-day activities. Intellectual disability - the presence of significant limitations in intellectual functioning (usually defined as IQ less than 70), and in adaptive behaviour (conceptual, social and practical skills). This type of disability originates before the age of 18 years.3 Developmental disability - the presence of physical, intellectual and/or social (autism spectrum disorders) impairment with deficits in adaptive functioning, with an onset in the developmental period. Intellectual disability may be a prominent feature in people with developmental disability. Important note: unless otherwise stated, this curriculum uses the term 'disability' to include physical, intellectual and developmental disability. Some disabilities are often associated with comorbid conditions, for example, intellectual disability and epilepsy, cerebral palsy and vision impairment or epilepsy.4 These comorbidities, and their associated cognitive and communication difficulties, can present barriers to accessing healthcare. Clinicians should not let the disability distract from or overshadow these health problems, rather they should approach them as they would with a person without a disability. Other disabilities may also be acquired in adult life including sensory, psychiatric, musculoskeletal and neurological disabilities. These can have a significant impact on the affected person's life and as such need to be addressed. Curriculum in practice Typical cases that illustrate how the disability curriculum applies to general practice include: Joni, 18 years of age, has Down syndrome. She presents with her family who are concerned she has been spending a lot of time with her new boyfriend, whom she met through her workplace. Her parents say that they think that Joni may be sexually active and that she is not capable of making any decisions for herself. Zack, 38 years of age, has an intellectual disability. He has recently moved to new supported accommodation in your area and arrives with a disability support worker for treatment of a laceration, which occurred while preparing dinner. Zack has minimal medical records and you are not sure of when Zack last visited a general practitioner.98 | RACGP curriculum statement Disability Rationale and general practice context In 2003, an estimated 3.9 million Australians had some degree of disability. Of these 1.2 million (6% of the population) had severe or profound core activity limitations. These include increases in intellectually disabling conditions, sensory or speech impairment or psychiatric disability. The reported prevalence rates of disabling conditions associated with childhood, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism-related disorders, has substantially increased in the past decade.5,6 People with disability make up a significant part of most general practice populations. These people may have multiple comorbidities and GPs have a key role in the management of these disabilities and associated health problems.7,8 In addition, the disability itself can be a barrier to accessing health services, and the GP will often have a role in facilitating appropriate and timely access to services, as well as providing ongoing management of health issues. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, in 2007-2008, 46% of people aged 15-64 years with severe or profound disability reported poor or fair health, compared to 5% for those without a disability.5 People aged under 65 years with severe or profound disability had a higher prevalence rate of all types of selected long term health conditions than people without a disability. The prevalence of physical long term health conditions was higher for people with both mental health problems and severe or profound disability than for those with mental health problems but no disability.7 Australian GPs and registrars indicate that they receive inadequate training to care for people with intellectual disability and consider they need better training in the assessment of behaviour problems, mental disorders, communication, sexuality, neurological problems and an increased understanding of other common comorbidities - be they related to a syndrome or not.8-10 The vast majority of GPs are interested in improving their skills, knowledge and management of this patient population.11 In addition to disability related conditions, people with disability will have the full range of medical conditions affecting people without disabilities and will require access to appropriate services. This includes the need for access to the full range of preventive health services such as smoking cessation, nutritional and other population based health initiatives. People with disability come from a wide range of backgrounds. Practitioners need to recognise the special issues (including discrimination) facing people with disabilities from diverse backgrounds including issues of gender difference; ethnicity and poverty; and issues of sexuality, including sexual preference.RACGP curriculum statement Disability | 99Training outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1. Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship DIST1.1 Use communication to build the foundation of good general practice management of patients with disabilities. DIST1.2 Use appropriate additional communication skills and strategies when a patient with disabilities has significant communication difficulties, whether due to cognitive, social or physical impairment. DIST1.3 Ensure good communication between doctor and patient and, where appropriate, family and/or support workers. 2. Applied professional knowledge and skills DIST2.1 Understand that people with disabilities have the same medical issues as the rest of the population, although certain disabilities may be associated with an increased (or decreased) risk of particular medical conditions. DIST2.2 Know the cause or underlying pathology of the disability and use this to inform medical management. DIST2.3 Employ the same diagnostic and management strategies and standards that apply to patients without a disability when providing medical care to people with a disability, irrespective of the medical condition and underlying disability. 3. Population health and the context of general practice DIST3.1 Understand how people with disabilities often encounter barriers to participating in and accessing the services they choose and require. DIST3.2 Be aware of the social, financial and legal frameworks and services that support people with a disability and their families and carers within the community. DIST3.3 Know population based measures for disability prevention (eg. periconception folate supplementation). 4. Professional and ethical role DIST4.1 Ensure focusing the patient encounter on, and maintaining respect for, the person with the disability. DIST4.2 Be aware of the impact of the disability on the person's life and the need to employ the same standards of care that apply to patients without a disability. DIST4.3 Understand that patients and families come from diverse social and cultural backgrounds and how this may influence their attitudes and knowledge with respect to disability. 5. Organisational and legal dimensions DIST5.1 Understand how legislative frameworks empower individuals and protect those who are not able to advocate for themselves. DIST5.2 Ensure that good practice procedures, including those for regular review and follow up, underpin proactive medical management of people with a disability. DIST5.3 Understand that good practice procedures and systems are particularly important to the care of people including those with a disability, who find it difficult to understand and organise their medical care.100 | RACGP curriculum statement Disability Learning objectives across the GP professional life Medical student 1.

Doctors' health also includes the provision of appropriate healthcare to other doctors and their family members. Physician impairment is defined as any physical, mental or behavioural disorder that interferes with the ability to engage safely in professional activities. Curriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the doctors' health curriculum applies to general practice: Your practice partner has retired and so far you have been unable to recruit a replacement. Consequently, your usually busy week has become chaotic as you struggle to manage 12 hour days with hospital ward rounds and nursing home visits. You have started skipping meals and drinking too much coffee, which means that when you do reach home you are edgy and often enter into arguments with your family. You are worried your relationship with your partner is no longer stable. After dinner you have a glass of wine to unwind and fall asleep in the chair. Waking around midnight, you spend 2 hours on the internet answering emails before going to bed. At 6 am the telephone rings with a request for you to do a house call on the way to work. Your head pounds and you wonder what your blood pressure could be.112 | RACGP curriculum statement Doctors' healthRationale and general practice context Doctors, historically, have been reported to have high rates of mental health problems, alcoholism and drug-use disorders.2 This has often been reported in the context of disciplinary action taken against them. Doctors should see themselves as people who practise medicine, ie. people first and foremost, with all the human needs and weaknesses that apply to the rest of the population.3-5 Doctors and their families are a disadvantaged group within society by virtue of their poorer access to a doctor of choice, including medical families.6 They may have poorer health outcomes as patients in the health system due to under- and over-treatment and a failure to utilise their own referral networks when in crisis. However, in addition to maintaining health for personal wellbeing, doctors also have a professional obligation to maintain their own health in order to ensure they perform optimally when treating patients. The medical profession needs to support doctors in maintaining their own health by recognising the benefits both the doctor and the wider community. Doctors have both a personal and professional responsibility to ensure they are accessing and optimising quality healthcare. Doctors have difficulty accessing healthcare for many reasons. Education to ensure that doctors can effectively confront the barriers to effective health access is essential; these barriers may be personal or related to the culture of the medical profession. Minimising these barriers requires an understanding of what it is like to be a patient and what it is like to be involved in caring for a medical colleague. 7 Recent literature has focused on mental health issues affecting doctors including stress, depression and job satisfaction. Doctors' health encompasses more than this, and includes their physical health and the social supports they establish during their lives, both with their peers and outside their medical circle. Doctors' health includes many diverse issues: illness, impairment, the impact of medicolegal issues and the personal safety of the doctor in their work environment.8 Special issues may confront some groups of GPs. For example, rural practitioners may be confronted with issues of reduced access to independent care and longer working hours. Similarly, medical students have unique pressures, as do new medical graduates.9,10 As a profession, GPs have an obligation to all patients, including doctor-patients, to ensure they have access to appropriate care. Boundary issues are a significant component of doctors' health, and understanding the boundaries within the doctor-patient relationship is one aspect of this issue. Decisions regarding self treatment and the need for independent healthcare is another. Medical families may also suffer problems with their access to healthcare, and it is important that doctors and their families are educated on how to recognise the boundary issues involved. Doctors have a professional obligation11 to ensure the welfare of impaired colleagues by providing appropriate support in their access of care, ensuring the community is protected from potential harm and assisting those returning to the workplace. The doctor as a patient Doctors need to confront issues relating to being a patient at some stage in their life, and to be aware that some doctors find this transition difficult. Specific issues of confidentiality and participation in the process of shared decision making may need to be considered. Doctors should be advised of the advantage in having an independent GP to assist with their healthcare and should actively seek to develop rapport with their own GP before they develop any significant health issues.RACGP curriculum statement Doctors' health | 113Doctors need to understand the distinction between being ill and being impaired, and to be prepared to voluntarily withdraw from work in the event of impairment and to notify those who can assist. Doctors, like all patients, have the right to confidentiality and privacy, and should not have any of their details disclosed unless obliged ethically or legally to do so. Fear of lack of access to a confidential doctor is a fear disclosed by some doctors.2,8 Doctors have special issues relating to their own health, and treatment should be sensitive to these needs. For example, some doctors may have difficulty accepting a diagnosis when they have spent a large amount of their professional life treating the same or similar conditions. Denial of illness and vulnerability may be an important issue, and doctors may also self medicate, including adjusting dosages, without consulting their treating doctor. Like all patients, doctors should take responsibility for their own health and be proactive about professional and occupational health needs, such as immunisation and complying with legislative health requirements in the case of illness or impairment, which threatens patient safety, as well as being proactive about their own health (eg. exercise and other health promotion activities). Treating doctors - the doctor as a doctor's doctor All GPs are likely to treat a doctor as a patient during their career and will need to recognise there are some specific issues that may arise in such consultations. Doctors treating medical practitioners need to ensure that the same due care is offered when caring for doctors as for other patients. General practitioners should follow their usual method of history taking, examination and investigation, as they would with any other patient without taking shortcuts or making assumptions. Treating doctors should recognise that doctor-patients require the same explanations of investigations and management and be prepared to act as an advocate within the medical system as they would for all patients. Doctor-patients often need to be reassured that they have made the right decision in seeking medical care, even if the problem appears to be a minor one. The barriers that many doctors experience when they access healthcare need to be recognised, and issues of confidentiality are especially important. Doctor-patients need to be encouraged to follow routine preventive health screening and healthy lifestyle practices, just as other patients are encouraged to do. They need to be included in the routine recall system for follow up and screening and encouraged to develop a continuing regular relationship with their practitioner. Treating doctors should encourage doctor-patients to participate in a shared decision making process with the guidance normally offered to any patient. Doctor-patients should be allowed to be the patient and not be expected to make decisions without support. This therapeutic alliance should take into account the health literacy of the patient without making assumptions, but nevertheless acknowledging the doctor-patient's special knowledge. During this process the treating doctor needs to be aware of the issues of transference within the relationship.3,7 There is a need to actively negotiate the potential concerns of self treatment. If the treating doctor feels that the doctor-patient should take time off for illness, then this will need to be discussed and the appropriate certificates offered. When caring for an ill and potentially impaired doctor, treating doctors need to accept their professional and ethical responsibility to ensure that the doctor receives care and that the general community is protected.12 Related curriculum areas Refer also to the curriculum statements: Teaching, mentoring and leadership in general practice Quality and safety Practice management.114 | RACGP curriculum statement Doctors' healthTraining outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1.

Genetic counselling is a procedure by which patients and their families are given support and advice about the nature and consequences of inherited disorders, the possibility of being affected or having affected children, and the various options available for prevention, diagnosis and management of such conditions.1 Curriculum in practice Typical presentations that illustrate how the genetics curriculum applies to general practice include: Gary, aged 60 years, has been feeling tired and run down. He says he has been 'putting on a bit of weight' and feels uncomfortable in his upper abdomen, but is more troubled by recent joint swelling and tenderness. He has been a construction worker most of his life and believes this is all part of the aging process. He says: \"Even the old fella won't work as well as he used to.\" Examination identifies hepatomegaly, but you also notice his skin is a grey-bronze colour. What family history might you specifically ask for and what genetic testing would be appropriate? Anna, aged 23 years, is planning her first pregnancy. During her pre-conception counselling you discover her younger brother died when he was 16 years of age from complications of cystic fibrosis. Her husband was originally from the Middle East. Does this increase or decrease the risk that their child might be affected? What tests should she be offered prior to and following conception? Stephanie, aged 47 years, has a younger sister who has just been diagnosed with breast cancer. Her older brother commenced treatment for prostate cancer 2 years ago. She is now worried about her own risk of developing cancer and is keen to be tested for everything. Assuming she is currently well and her examination is normal, what advice is appropriate for managing her genetic risk?126 | RACGP curriculum statement GeneticsRationale and general practice context The last decade has witnessed significant advances in genetic medicine, such as the mapping of the human genome and the understanding of genetic causes of disease. These advances have increasing relevance to clinical care in general practice including the management of people with a family history of cancer and heart disease, carrier testing for common autosomal recessive conditions, and the diagnosis of inherited diseases such as haemochromatosis and thrombophilia. The role of the GP in genetics Australian2-4 and international5-8 studies have highlighted the need for general practitioners to develop genetic literacy and to understand the important role primary care plays in the management of genetic conditions. 9-11 This includes: taking and using the family history to determine the risks of common diseases such as cancer and heart disease identifying patients with specific genetic conditions who may benefit from referral to genetic counselling or specialist management services pre-pregnancy counselling from a genetic perspective, including discussion of prenatal screening and diagnostic tests for genetic conditions identifying, assessing and, when appropriate, referring children and adults with developmental delay, developmental disability or dysmorphic features for diagnosis and specialist services using genetic tests appropriately, including those listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule being aware of the growing field of genomics and the use of genetic markers to determine therapeutics discussing newborn screening programs with parents and managing children who test positive supporting families with genetic conditions and co-ordinating their care between clinical genetics services and other clinical specialties. Genetics can affect many areas of general practice care, and genetic issues may also occur in other curriculum statements.RACGP curriculum statement Genetics | 127Training outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1. Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship GENT1.1 Apply communication strategies (appropriate to those receiving the information), when discussing the implications of a genetic diagnosis or genetic test result, including the implications for family members.

Curriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the men's health curriculum applies to general practice: Anthony, 43 years of age, is the successful owner of a real estate business. He presents to the practice for a health check following the sudden cardiac death of his elder brother. Anthony's wife Jillian and their children also attend the practice (you know that Jillian has been worried for some time about how hard Anthony has been working). Anthony is considerably heavier than when you last saw him and now weighs 107 kg (height: 173 cm, BMI: 36). He has been working late and eating takeaway food 3 or 4 times a week, usually fried fish and chips or pizza. His alcohol intake has also increased, consuming a six-pack most nights and twice that on Fridays with his workmates. He has been worried at the downturn in the housing market and says the alcohol helps him to relax. He used to be a keen football player until he injured his knee, and knows he needs to exercise more but finds it difficult to get motivated. Anthony had not seen his brother for more than a year, but they were very close and he is tearful in describing the funeral. He has been sleeping poorly and wonders if he might need something to 'help him to just stop thinking about it'.138 | RACGP curriculum statement Men's healthRationale and general practice context Australian men are less healthy than Australian women, dying 5 years earlier than their female counterparts,2 especially in the 25-65 years age group - the main working period of men's lives. The median age at death of Australian men in 2004 was 79.0 years compared with 83.7 years for women, and this shorter life expectancy occurs when measured across every age group. Men also carry a significantly larger burden of illness and death than women. 2 General practitioners are well situated to address the specific healthcare needs of men. Good general practice men's healthcare not only includes the management of disease, but involves recognising that major improvements to men's health will be achieved by challenging the way masculinity is defined in Australian culture. This recognises the importance of how boys develop socially, explores ways of taking GPs and health teams to the men who under-attend general practice, as well as addressing the marketing of general practice services to men. Building these links between general practices and the community has the potential to enhance the relationships between men and their GPs. General practitioners are less likely to see males in patient encounters than females. In 2009-2010, BEACH reported that of 94 386 patient encounters surveyed, 43.1% of patient encounters were males compared with 56.9% females. This was reflected across all age groups except for children aged less than 15 years and was greatest among younger adults (15-24 years and 25-44 years). 3 This low rate of presentation of men across the decades of middle and older age has been linked to men's shorter life expectancy. Deaths in working age males are more common than in working age females. At age 25 years, male deaths are more than twice as common as female deaths, falling to 1.5 times as common at age 50 years, before beginning to rise again to age 64 years. Among younger working age males (aged 25-44 years), death is more likely to result from external causes rather than other causes. In 2007, the leading single cause of death for males aged 25-44 years was intentional self harm, accounting for 22.3% of deaths, followed by land accidents (15.3%) and accidental poisoning (9.5%); (26 deaths per 100 000 population) followed by transport accidents (14 per 100 000). 2 Although called 'working age people', relatively few deaths are formally work related. However, over 90% of work related traumatic injury fatalities are in males, with 30% of these deaths occurring in men aged 55 years or over. 4 Unhealthy behaviours are also more common in men than women. For example, in 2007-2008, 23.8% of men aged 25-44 years reported daily smoking compared to 19.3% in females and 16.3% of males were found to be more likely to drink daily compared to 11.5% of females. 2 Similarly, 43.2% of males have reported to have used illicit drugs compared to 36.5% of females, and 1.5 million males reported using illicit drugs in the previous 12 months compared to 1.1 million female users. In 2009, 86.3% of cases of newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS cases in Australia were in men. 5 Gender in healthcare Women and men experience health differently. Biological sex differences, such as reproductive health and sexuality, are responsible for health issues traditionally regarded as 'men's health' or 'women's health'. However, gender refers to the different social and cultural roles, expectations and constraints placed on men and women because of their sex. When analysing the experiences and impacts of health on men and women, differences relating to gender, in addition to biological sex, need to be considered. Gender differences can influence both women and men's health through: exposure to risk factors access to, and understanding of, information about disease management, prevention and control subjective experience of illness and its social significance attitudes toward the maintenance of one's own health and that of other family members RACGP curriculum statement Men's health | 139 patterns of service use perceptions of quality of care. Male socialisation and masculinity, social connectedness and work-life balance significantly impact on health. Masculinity has been identified as a key factor leading both men and boys to risk taking and self harming behaviours. Male emotional responses may deny access to the healing effects of emotional release and valuing their own physical, emotional and mental health. Knowledge of the impact of masculinity on health and healthcare is critical to the successful provision of effective general practice care. Masculine identity and behaviour vary over the course of a man's life and also vary considerably according to cultural and ethnic background, sexual identity, socioeconomic and geographical locations. An understanding of masculine behaviours and notions of maleness should take into account the wide range of masculinities that exist within multicultural Australia. For example: men living in rural and isolated areas, non-Australian born men, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men, older men, men with a disability, men affected by mental illness, war and armed service veterans, and men with other special needs such as divorced and separated men who may, or may not, be primary carers. The health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men is worse than any other subgroup in Australia. Excess morbidity and mortality relates to unemployment, poverty, incarceration and low self esteem. For the period 2007-2008 life expectancy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men was estimated to be approximately 12 years less than their nonindigenous counterparts. 2 Men are more likely to be both the perpetrators of violence and its victims. Violence is a significant health issue for Australian men for many reasons including the effect on victims, the health impacts of imprisonment on perpetrators and the deleterious effects on healthy relationships. Males are responsible for the vast majority of cases of domestic violence and GPs have a responsibility to deal with its effects. Exposure of boys to violence during their formative years contributes to a range of issues including homelessness, drug use, depression, relationship difficulties and perpetuation of the cycle of violence later in their lives. In addition to the clinic, GPs may become involved in community activities where men congregate to provide services, heighten the awareness of men's health issues and act as advocates for male patients. Male health promotion in Australian: the National Male Health Policy The Australian National Men's Health Policy6 was released in 2010. This policy encourages all males to take individual action to improve their own health as well as focusing on appropriate government action, cross-sectorial activity, and initiatives that can be undertaken by the health system and community to improve the health of Australian males. To achieve this, the policy identified six priority outcomes for improving the health of Australian males: optimising health outcomes working towards health equity between population groups of males working towards health equity between males at different life stages focusing on preventive health for males building a strong evidence base on male health access to healthcare for males. General practitioners are already involved in many of these activities and familiarity with the policy helps to guide men's healthcare in primary care.

The concept of multiculturalism in Australia is based on the principles of pluralism, which recognises, accepts and respects the rights of all Australians to express and share their individual cultural heritage within an overriding commitment to Australia, its people and the basic structures and values of Australian society. The key to Australian multiculturalism is inclusivity rather than division, with Australia's multicultural composition being 'at the heart of our national identity and intrinsic to our history and character'. 1 Terms often used within discussions of multicultural health include: NESB: Non-English speaking background (NESB) is used most frequently to describe people who were born in a country where the predominant language is not English. They are first generation NESB. Their children are second generation NESB. CALD: Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) refers to the wide range of cultural groups that make up the Australian population and Australian communities. The term acknowledges that groups and individuals differ according to religion and spirituality, racial backgrounds and ethnicity as well as language. The term 'culturally and linguistically diverse background' is used to reflect intergenerational and contextual issues, not only migrant experience. 1 Culturally and linguistically diverse background is a term used in policy documents but is often poorly defined. The term is commonly used to refer to people living within culturally diverse communities in Australia that may differ from the mainstream dominant culture. Specific general practice issues affecting people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in Australia are many and diverse. They include providing high quality, culturally relevant, appropriate and accessible services and information, recognising the potential for discrimination in services targeted toward mainstream dominant culture being inappropriate for people of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds; using language services to best effect and the specific needs of different communities; and promoting the benefits of a culturally diverse community. These are only a few examples of the many complex issues that impact on people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and Australian general practice. Ethnic: This term is no longer favoured and is not officially used in some states and territories of Australia. It is largely understood to refer to people born in a non-English speaking country or whose parents were born in a non-English speaking country. Ethnicity: This term refers to geographical and cultural origins, which are sometimes used when referring to specific conditions, eg. beta-thalassaemia is more common in Australian people of Greek ethnicity or background. Multicultural health recognises that the issues addressed in this curriculum are interconnected with many but not all indigenous health issues. Even so, users of this curriculum statement should not apply it directly in developing teaching and training materials for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, but instead should refer to the specific curriculum statement on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health.152 | RACGP curriculum statement Multicultural healthCurriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the multicultural health curriculum applies to general practice: Charuni, 28 years of age, has recently arrived from Sudan. She presents looking sweaty and unwell. Her husband Hasan has accompanied her as he is the only family member who speaks English, but he clearly appears uncomfortable and keeps his face averted. It transpires her problem has to do with pain and fever and something relating to 'women's troubles'. How will you proceed?RACGP curriculum statement Multicultural health | 153Rationale and general practice context A patient's presentation of illness is influenced by culture. The GP needs to understand how the cultural background of both the doctor and the patient influences the general practice consultation. Multicultural health in Australian general practice involves making a holistic assessment of the patient's needs and recognising the impact of cultural issues in the Australian environment. Every individual constructs the meaning of their experience of health from within their cultural background. The social group in which we live influences our interpretation of the meaning of our experience of health and illness and affects our understanding of what symptoms are significant. Cultures help determine the behaviours we use when presenting to the GP . The development of cultural competence is an integral skill in general practice.Cultural competence 2 is a set of congruent behaviours, attitudes and policies that come together in a system, agency or health service, or among professionals, which enable the organisation or those professionals to work effectively in cross cultural situations. Cultural competence is much more than awareness of cultural differences, as it focuses on the capacity of the health system to improve health and wellbeing by integrating the understanding and appreciation of different cultures. To become more culturally competent, a health service or professional or system needs to: value diversity have the capacity for cultural self assessment be conscious of the dynamics that occur when cultures interact institutionalise cultural knowledge adapt service delivery so that it reflects an understanding of the diversity between and within cultures. This involves challenging practitioner cultural assumptions, developing empathy for patients and colleagues with a different worldview, and developing the necessary skills to ensure that appropriate communication and interaction occurs within the consultation to result in quality care. Multicultural health issues impacting on general practice Multicultural health issues can present challenges to providing quality primary care and GPs are in a strong position to be advocates to improve the health of people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Australia's society is linguistically and culturally diverse, consisting of about 3% of Australians being of indigenous origin, while 97% have settled or are descendants of settlers over the past 200 years. 3 Since 1945, 7 million people have migrated to Australia and 1 in 4 of Australia's 22 million people were born overseas. Australians speak over 260 languages and identify with more than 270 ancestries. 1 Multicultural diversity in Australia is increasing. In 2001, 23.1% of people living in Australia were born overseas compared to 14.35% in 1991. Those born in the United Kingdom (5.6%) and Europe (11.6%) have been decreasing but those born in east, central or southern Asia (6.0%) have been increasing over the past 10 years. 4 Around 44% were born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas. Four million people (over 25%) speak a language other than English at home.1 Issues in multicultural health in Australian general practice are complex and exist at every level of the health system, community and individual social environments. These issues include: 154 | RACGP curriculum statement Multicultural health Access to healthcare - patients from a culturally and linguistically diverse background may find they have specific problems accessing healthcare. Poverty, poor education and difficulty with transport are likely to impact health opportunities for those from a culturally and linguistically diverse background. In addition to these well documented social determinants of health, those from a culturally and linguistically diverse background may not be aware of the care available in the community and may not be able to access what is readily available because of language, religion or other cultural barriers. Equity of healthcare access is important for all Australians and is difficult to achieve when access issues are not addressed. As well as these issues, some patients from a culturally and linguistically diverse background experience discrimination from the healthcare system due to their country of origin, cultural background and religious beliefs. Healthcare professionals need to recognise this potential and be prepared to advocate for their patients when necessary to ensure adequate care. Social discrimination in health is experienced by many people from a culturally and linguistically diverse background, as well as inequality in employment, education and other areas. Language difficulties can negatively impact upon the care received by those from a culturally and linguistically diverse background. Over 200 languages are spoken in Australia, and in addition, nonverbal communication, communication styles, use of family or a third person for communication support and differing understandings of English words and phrases can all impact on clinical care. Different cultures attach different meanings to parts of the body and types of illness, and this can impact upon the presentation of the illness or compliance with treatment. Culture encompasses many issues. There are significant cultural differences even between people who speak the same language or come from the same country. Cultural issues that need to be considered are: -cultural lens: 5 each person, including health professionals, needs to recognise that they have their own unique personal worldview influenced by the cultures that nurtured them. This 'cultural lens' may influence the way a health professional may judge and make assumptions about patients from a different background, and recognising this cultural bias is a necessary step for clinical effectiveness. A patient's cultural lens shapes beliefs about illness causation, the nature of a particular illness, and the appropriate treatment and expected outcome -diversity within diversity: within each culture group there may be differences in ideas about age, gender, sexuality and social issues. General practice care needs to acknowledge this diversity in its provision of healthcare -religious issues: can alter the management of a patient. Religion can determine the patient's and healthcare provider's worldview and has a major influence over a person's life, lifestyle and understanding of illness. It may affect diet and use of medications. All major religions are represented in Australia. Multicultural health in general practice involves tackling health inequalities and reducing barriers to accessing general practice care. The GP also has a role to play in breaking down cultural stereotypes through the provision of high quality care for all people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.RACGP curriculum statement Multicultural health | 155Training outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1. Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship MCHT1.1 Communicate with cultural competence. MCHT1.2 Understand how language difficulties complicate communication during the consultation, making an appointment, phoning for emergency care and reading health information. MCHT1.3 Understand that even when a patient speaks English, lack of English proficiency can cause communication problems, resulting in potentially serious medical situations. These may include not understanding how to take medications, subtle misunderstandings that can be critical in emotionally charged issues, and mental health issues and cultural assumptions. MCHT1.4 Use interpreters skilfully and effectively to help avoid potential problems encountered during interpreted consultations. This includes working with face-to-face and telephone interpreters and understanding how the gender and background of the interpreter may influence the interaction, eg. when discussing women's health, sexual health or other sensitive matters. MCHT1.5 Understand the importance of directing the conversation to the patient during the interpreted consultation and not to the interpreter. MCHT1.6 Ensure confidentiality, especially in small communities, and beware of the pitfalls of using families in this role. MCHT1.7 Understand how a lack of awareness of culturally specific religious needs, beliefs and practices may impede addressing specific cultural issues, such as female genital mutilation, domestic violence and sexual violence, as well as potentially offending patients. MCHT1.8 Be aware of the risk of mental health issues in culturally and linguistically diverse communities, which may result from trauma, torture, social isolation and language isolation, and how these may also impact on effective communication. MCHT1.9 Be aware of and use, where appropriate, relevant written materials. MCHT1.10 Understand how educational background and literacy levels may be difficult to assess when there is a language barrier. MCHT1.11 Understand that the relevance of educational materials will vary for each individual, eg. some people speak one language but read in another - this will have implications when determining which resources are appropriate for the patient. MCHT1.12 Be aware of the impact of a patient's own cultural lens. This includes beliefs about disease, health and healthcare; the impact of faith and religious beliefs; and pharmacology differences in different ethnicities. 2. Applied professional knowledge and skills MCHT2.1 Learn about illnesses that may not be common within the general community but occur among those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. MCHT2.2 Understand how social and environmental determinants of health influence quality multicultural general practice care, including: MCHT2.2.1 diseases from the country of origin of the patient - nutritional deficiencies; health effects of war, torture and trauma; infectious diseases156 | RACGP curriculum statement Multicultural healthMCHT2.2.2 diseases relating to migration; refugees may spend many years transiting countries MCHT2.2.3 diseases of settlement - nutrition and lifestyle diseases of host country MCHT2.2.4 mental health including conditions related to patients' pre-migration experiences of loss, torture and trauma; difficulties associated with settling into a new country; cultural stigma of mental illness MCHT2.2.5 specific diseases common to certain populations such as thalassaemia, sickle cell anaemia, haemochromatosis MCHT2.2.6 culturally specific practices such as female genital mutilation/cutting. MCHT2.3 Understand how the social, linguistic and cultural isolation commonly experienced by patients from a culturally and linguistically diverse background has the potential to escalate minor health problems into serious health concerns. MCHT2.4 Recognise there may be limited evidence related to the conditions encountered. An innovative approach may be needed, including relying on specialist multicultural agencies for advice and accessing online information. MCHT2.5 Understand the barriers that may limit access for culturally and linguistically diverse people, including refugees, such as individual health patient issues, complexity of family structures and health issues related to their communities, and adjusting to and having ongoing access to the Australian health system. MCHT2.6 Understand how a holistic approach helps address multicultural health including attention to factors at the level of the: MCHT2.6.1 individual - physical and emotional dimensions MCHT2.6.2 family - social and relationship dimensions MCHT2.6.3 community - cultural and political dimensions. MCHT2.7 Tolerate ambiguity, suspend judgment and develop empathy when meeting the health needs of patients from different cultures. MCHT2.8 Be prepared to deal with culturally specific conditions despite the lack of evidence based information for some problems faced within culturally and linguistically diverse communities. 3. Population health and the context of general practice MCHT3.1 Understand how language barriers and cultural acceptability are potential major barriers to accessing specific services such as breast screening, Pap tests, palliative care and immunisation. MCHT3.2 Understand how the experiences of people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in accessing healthcare in their country of origin can impact on their access to healthcare in Australia. MCHT3.3 Understand how the Australian health system has been set up for the majority culture, which may be culturally very different from some culturally and linguistically diverse communities. MCHT3.4 Understand how population health risks can change with time and acculturation and can impact upon subsequent generations. 4. Professional and ethical role MCHT4.1 Be aware of how a clinician's personal cultural beliefs and attitudes affect their management of patients from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Medical practitioners in many countries have been involved in the torture of political RACGP curriculum statement Multicultural health | 157detainees and this means the trust usually considered inherent within the patient- doctor relationship cannot be assumed, and therefore needs to be established. MCHT4.2 Respect and address any specific patient concerns about accessing services in a large government hospital if they had negative experiences in hospital in the country they left. MCHT4.3 Understand how important professional issues may be experienced or perceived differently by people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds including: MCHT4.3.1 privacy and confidentiality MCHT4.3.2 informed consent MCHT4.3.3 autonomy and adherence to treatment and treatment plans MCHT4.3.4 equality and partnership in management. 5. Organisation and legal dimensions MCHT5.1 Record necessary cultural information within the medical records in a culturally sensitive manner that still enables others within the practice to access the relevant information needed to enhance a patient's care. MCHT5.2 Engage within and beyond medical settings to enhance a practice's ability to care for these communities. MCHT5.3 Access patient health information in different languages. MCHT5.4 Ensure practice services are accessible and appropriate for family groups and culturally diverse populations. MCHT5.5 Ensure systems are in place for efficient access to face-to-face and telephone interpreters before and during consultations. MCHT5.6 Know how to gain access to interpreter services for routine and emergency consultations and be aware of the costs. MCHT5.7 Ensure appropriate opportunities are available for training to ensure effective service delivery to culturally and linguistically diverse background patients. MCHT 5.8 Know the legal issues related to consent when the patient is not proficient in the English language.158 | RACGP curriculum statement Multicultural healthLearning objectives across the GP professional life Medical student 1.

This recognises the social, cultural and political determinants of health. This is achieved through the organised and systematic responses to improve, protect and restore the health of populations and individuals. This includes both opportunistic and planned interventions in the general practice setting'.1 Population health is the study of health and disease in a population as specified by geographical, cultural or political guidelines.2 This includes defining health problems and needs, identifying the means by which these needs may be met, and providing the health services required to meet these needs. Other related terms commonly used in general practice include: community medicine, which tends to apply more to the integration of population based health interventions in a clinical context community health, which is often used to describe the application of broad based public health interventions at a community or individual level. Public health is the efforts organised by a society to protect, promote and restore people's health. Population health and public health are the combination of sciences, skills and beliefs directed to the maintenance and improvement of the health of all people through collective or social actions. There is considerable overlap between population and public health, and differing models of this interface have been developed. A continuum can be considered between population health activities within general practices, public health activities with the community and what have been termed 'new public health' movements. These include the engagement of communities, organisational development and specialisation or leadership in fields such as policy development. Some health professionals use the terms population health and public health interchangeably, but there are subtle nuances between these two disciplines.3-6 Preventive medicine is the application of preventive measures into medical practice by focusing clinical skills on the health of defined populations in order to promote and maintain health and wellbeing and prevent disease, disability and premature death. Health promotion is a range of practices including health education, community development, preventive services, policy advocacy and regulations that seek to better health at the individual and population level and goes beyond simple prevention. In general practice, population health represents an extension and expansion of existing clinical roles toward an emphasis on prevention and a focus on groups or populations, rather than on individual patients. This may involve activities such as immunisation, risk assessment and management, patient education and screening in which general practitioners are already engaged within their practice. General practice public health also involves notification of diseases of public health importance to the relevant government agency. 170 | RACGP curriculum statement Population health and public healthCurriculum in practice Typical presentations that illustrate how the population health and public health curriculum applies to general practice include: Max, 46 years of age, is a school teacher and active member of the local tennis club. His wife has sent him in for a check up. Max says there is nothing wrong, and that he rarely needs to attend the doctor. He does not smoke or drink, has a BMI of 23 has no relevant past or family history and has always been well. What is your management? Rhona, 21 years of age, is an Aboriginal woman who has been unwell for some time with vague abdominal aches and episodic diarrhoea. Stool testing had returned negative, possibly due to a delay in transporting the specimen to the pathologist, but her serology shows significant eosinophilia. In reviewing her notes, you discover her eosinophils have been progressively elevated for 3 years and an internet search of the causes of persistent elevation in the Aboriginal population lists strongyloides as a possible cause. Her serology is positive and following treatment her symptoms resolve. What are the implications of this for her and the community? Do you notify the health department?RACGP curriculum statement Population health and public health | 171Rationale and general practice context General practice care goes beyond the individual patient to involve patient populations. General practitioners are ideally placed to implement population based health activities because about 83% of Australians attended a GP at least once during 2009-2010.7 Integrating population health into general practice A population health approach means implementing these activities more effectively and consistently across a whole population. Population based health activities in general practice should include, as a priority, activities that are designed to meet the specific needs of at-risk population groups. General practice also has an important advocacy role around the structural issues that affect health status, especially for socially disadvantaged groups. The best outcomes from general practice population health activities result from: better integration across disciplines within primary care a partnership between general practice and public health services, and consumer and community organisations. Population based approaches to prevention and health promotion often require approaches across and beyond the health system. A useful strategic framework for strengthening and extending general practice involvement in population health at national, state, division and practice levels in Australia includes focus at the following levels8: organisational structures and roles - developing organisational and practice structures and systems to enable GPs to identify and undertake effective population health activities and interventions, and to facilitate collaboration with outside services and professionals communication - including community awareness, patient education and communication between population health and general practice agencies information management/information technology - developing population health data collection, dissemination and analysis, and relevant clinical tools and guidelines for information management and decision support workforce planning, education and training - developing materials to improve access by general practice staff to education, training and quality assurance programs; and increasing understanding and skills in relation to the population health role of general practice, patient risk assessment and effective interventions financial systems - implementing appropriate incentives and payment systems to support the engagement of GPs in effective population health activities both inside and outside the practice partnership and referral mechanisms - developing and implementing organisational supports to facilitate effective collaboration between general practice and others working in a population health context evaluation and research - participating in research and evaluating alternative models of general practice organisation, funding and integration.

For example, some rural doctors in smaller rural towns are based primarily at the local hospital, but the practice they conduct is still predominantly primary medical care, even though some secondary and tertiary care is also possible due to the hospital facilities. 2 Rural GPs often value: professional autonomy3 the range of medicine practised practising to the extent of their clinical knowledge and skills value the communities in which they work being valued by the community.6 In addition, rural GPs are more likely to experience professional and social isolation than their peers in urban contexts. While rural practice requirements conform to the core curriculum set for the Fellowship of the RACGP (FRACGP), they will also involve specific skill sets appropriate to the rural and/or remote health context. These skill sets may be practised at an extended or advanced level, depending on patient requirements. These characteristics and practices are supported by the RACGP Standards for general practices and a curriculum developed and maintained by the RACGP and reflected in the award of Fellowship of Advanced Rural General Practice (FARGP). Curriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the rural general practice curriculum applies to general practice: Emily, 23 years of age, has returned to your small country town following the breech birth of her fourth child, Ben. The baby has been identified with talipes equinovarus, which is twice as common in the children of smokers (like Emily). She has been told she needs to return for weekly assessment and treatment in the city, taking 2 days of travel each time. She tearfully asks if there is any way this can be avoided. The crop is about to be harvested and she will be desperately needed at home to run the financial part of the family business, as well as care for the other children. She also cooks for the contracted workers. The family simply cannot afford to have her absent, nor does she have anyone to stay with in the regional centre to help reduce the costs of travel and accommodation.184 | RACGP curriculum statement Rural general practiceRationale and general practice context Australia is predominantly an urban society. In June 2010, of the estimated 21 951 736 people living in Australia, 68.7% of the population was living in major cities, 19.7% in inner regional Australia, 9.3% in outer regional Australia, 1.4% in remote Australia and 0.8% in very remote Australia. 7 The supply of GPs per patient population is significantly lower in remote areas than in major areas, as is access to medical specialists. 8 Geographical isolation and social accessibility are significant factors in the decision to attend a GP for rural patients.9 Health outcomes, such as death rates, tend to be poorer outside major cities.10 The main contributors to higher death rates in regional and remote areas are coronary heart disease and other circulatory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, motor vehicle accidents, diabetes, suicide, other injuries and some cancers such as lung cancer - perhaps reflecting differences in access to services, risk factors and the regional/remote environment. Rural areas have lower rates of some hospital surgical procedures, lower rates of general practice consultation and there are generally higher rates of hospital admission in regional and remote areas than in major cities. 11 People from regional and remote areas tend to be more likely to smoke and drink alcohol in harmful or hazardous quantities than people in major cities.12 Environmental issues such as more physically dangerous occupations and factors associated with hazardous driving play a part in higher accident rates and related injury/death in country areas.12 Higher death rates and poorer health outcomes outside major cities, especially in remote areas, also reflect the higher proportions of the populations in those areas who are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. 13,14 Because rural communities in general have higher levels of morbidity and mortality, the rural GP has an important and evolving role, with the potential to influence change at the individual patient, practice and community levels within the healthcare system. Rural GPs are more likely to be key players in local hospitals and also be called upon by local authorities to play a public health role, such as a police medical officer. To optimise their effectiveness in providing primary healthcare to their communities, the rural GP needs to develop a detailed understanding of the particular sociopolitical, economic, geographical, cultural and family influences on the health of their patients. Rural general practice training in addition to the FRACGP All medical practitioners require an understanding of what may be helpful for working in rural and remote environments such as procedural skills and knowledge of Aboriginal health, hospital work and population health. A knowledge of rural health is an essential part of preparing a general practitioner for unsupervised practice anywhere in Australia. This curriculum will assist any general practitioner to understand the knowledge, skills and competencies helpful for unsupervised practice anywhere in rural Australia. Doctors with a particular interest in rural general practice can integrate enhanced rural training with general practice vocational training toward the FRACGP under the formal framework offered by the RACGP FARGP . These doctors may also wish to undertake advanced rural skills (ARS) training in curriculum shared with other medical specialties such as anaesthesia, obstetrics, emergency medicine and mental health. These have additional curriculum requirements to those of the FRACGP . Specific curriculum statements have been developed by joint consultative committees between the RACGP and relevant specialist colleges. These advanced rural skills are not required for attainment of the FRACGP , or included in this rural general practice curriculum statement. However, 12 months of training in accredited ARS posts is required for attainment of the FARGP . Doctors planning to undertake ARS training are encouraged to integrate these into their general practice vocational training, under the FARGP framework. Medical students, postgraduate doctors and general practice registrars are encouraged to undertake as much of their education and training in rural general practice as practicable. RACGP curriculum statement Rural general practice | 185Most RACGP curriculum statements will refer to rural and remote contexts. This rural curriculum statement serves both as the rural statement of the RACGP curriculum in general and as the baseline curriculum for the RACGP FARGP . As a qualification beyond vocational FRACGP , FARGP candidates, for which the full 12 months of ARS training is undertaken in the one ARS curriculum, can include that curriculum in their postnominals, ie. a 12 months ARS training post in obstetrics, the postnominal is FARGP (Obst). This assists the graduate in seeking visiting medical officer credentialing in rural hospitals. Please check the FARGP information available on the National Rural Faculty page of the RACGP website for specific educational and assessment requirements of the FARGP .186 | RACGP curriculum statement Rural general practiceTraining outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1.

Every month her 14 year old daughter becomes moody and aggressive, just prior to her menses, to such a degree that she has taken to keeping her home from school to avoid the otherwise inevitable detentions. She wants to know, 'Should Michelle start the pill?' Annalise is nearing 50 years of age and her periods have become irregular and very heavy. A regular blood donor, she was recently refused because her count was too low. Her serology confirms that her haemoglobin is 97 g/L with a picture of iron deficiency. What investigations are appropriate and which treatment options might be considered? Kylie, 31 years of age, has always been a large girl but lately you notice she has also become hirsute and you are able to confirm polycystic ovarian syndrome. Which treatments are most effective in preserving fertility? What other diseases is Kylie at risk of developing?200 | RACGP curriculum statement Women's healthRationale and general practice context As 57% of Australian general practice consultations are with women,4 the gender specific primary health needs of women constitute a significant proportion of the general practice workload. Women tend to make most healthcare decisions for their family, tend to request more information than men, expect a greater role in decision making, and often have higher expectations of timeliness and quality of healthcare provision.5 Barriers to accessing general practice may include: general access and equity issues such as financial restrictions, lack of available child care, lack of access to transport cultural issues impacting on access to healthcare related to a lack of availability of the appropriate gender or culture of primary health provider and language barriers fear of discrimination and disclosure of sensitive issues for a wide range of marginalised and vulnerable groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women; immigrant women; same-sex attracted women; and disabled, abused, homeless and refugee women. Gender specific health issues in general practice care across a woman's lifespan often involves accessing multiple healthcare providers, including those in relation to reproductive issues. Regular preventive healthcare is also a large part of women's health. 6 Specific health problems can be related to gender power differences such as lower income than men or being subjected to violence. The key principles for delivering quality women's healthcare in general practice include: 7,8 understanding key gender differences in health and illness responding to the particular health needs of women associated with their social roles, responsibilities and position, and reproductive health needs understanding the need for women to have access to sensitive healthcare and choices in healthcare providers being aware of common differences in practice styles of female general practitioners, including a tendency to provide longer consultations, more preventive health and mental health/counselling understanding the strengths, weaknesses and limitations of general practice in meeting women's health needs, including issues of equity and access to health information and services for women. National Women's Health Policy 2010 The aims of the women's health curriculum statement are consistent with and support the National Women's Health Policy 2010, 3 which outlines five key goals that aim to improve the health and wellbeing of all women in Australia by facilitating women's access to healthcare services and information, and to encourage the health system and government to be more responsive to the health needs of women. The National Women's Health Policy 2010 identifies that marginalisation and discrimination can affect access to healthcare resources and states that 'those who are discriminated against, or who cannot find culturally appropriate services, may withdraw from seeking help altogether'. 3 Specific marginalised groups of women highlighted as requiring particular attention for healthcare include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women; migrant and refugee women; and disabled, lesbian and bisexual women.RACGP curriculum statement Women's health | 201The policy goals highlight ways that gender inequality and health inequities can be addressed through: highlighting the significance of gender as a key determinant of women's health and wellbeing acknowledging that women's health needs differ according to their life stage prioritising the needs of women with the highest risk of poor health ensuring that the health system is responsive to all women, with a clear focus on illness and disease prevention and health promotion supporting effective and collaborative research, data collection, monitoring, evaluation and knowledge transfer to advance the evidence base on women's health.

The core skills required for the competent general practice management of acute serious illness and trauma presentations are similar to those required to manage emergency department presentations, including major trauma. Acute serious illness and trauma can occur in patients of any age. They may involve one or more body systems, and the context of the history may contribute to the required treatment response, for example, the collapsed patient or an accident site. Acute serious illness can be classified by body systems including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurological, the immune system, and dermatological and metabolic conditions. Presentations can also be classed into groups such as paediatric, obstetric, gynaecological, orthopaedic, surgical, general medical, psychiatric, ophthalmologic, eye and ear, and nose. Traumatic conditions, such as accidents and injury to self and others, can generally be divided according to cause, for example, road trauma, environmental, toxicological, envenomation, assault and occupational injury. Curriculum in practice Typical cases that illustrate how the acute serious illness and trauma curriculum applies to general practice include: A friend of Betty, one of your elderly patients with asthma, telephoned saying that 'Betty is having breathing troubles and could you come and see her'. Betty's asthma is usually well controlled and she is up-to-date with her vaccinations, but you know there is a nasty viral respiratory tract infection going around. Her house is only a block away and you have just finished for the morning, so you are able to go straight there. When you arrive, Betty is sitting up in bed, cyanosed and too breathless to speak. Both women are highly anxious. The local ambulance is on another call and a replacement will not arrive for half an hour. You have not brought resuscitation equipment with you, but your doctor's bag is in the car. You are late home from work after a full day and looking forward to dinner and a good night's rest. As you drive past the football oval you see a car has taken the corner too fast and hit a power pole. The left front tyre appears to have run into a ditch, running the car off the road with the car momentarily flipping up against the pole, crushing the cabin area. You pull up behind it with your hazard lights and headlights on to illuminate the scene. You see a terrified primary school-aged child struggling to get out the smashed passenger window. Her mother is unconscious with her head hanging half out the driver's window, resting on the doorsill. There is barely an inch between the side of her head and the crushed roof and it is apparent that at the time of impact she sustained a head injury. She is cyanosed and has an obstructed airway.214 | RACGP curriculum statement Acute serious illness and traumaRationale and general practice context Emergency life-threatening presentations in general practice are uncommon and the presentation of traumatic injuries to general practice has declined with hospital emergency departments being used as the first line of management for physical injuries.1 This creates a professional development challenge because general practitioners need to maintain skill levels for the management of rare life- threatening conditions, as well as for the more common conditions that present to general practice. General practitioners are more likely to see acute serious illness in the early stages when early recognition of warning signs, early investigation and referral may be life saving. Early treatment and patient education may help prevent disease exacerbations and avoid conditions deteriorating into more serious and potentially life-threatening conditions. The diagnosis of acute serious illness may be clearer in patients presenting later in the natural history of the condition, but these patients may bypass general practice and go directly to an emergency department. Trauma due to injury may vary in severity of presentation. Minor trauma such as musculoskeletal injuries and lacerations can be managed in general practice. As with serious acute illness, patients with major trauma are less likely to present to general practice. They may go straight to an emergency department, although these may be staffed by GPs, especially in smaller or more remote rural hospitals. General practitioners in rural and remote areas require a higher level of emergency care skills due to lower numbers of GPs, reduced access to specialist services, and the logistic and geographic difficulties of evacuating seriously ill patients. There is also a higher incidence of farming, mining, industrial and motor vehicle accidents, as well as greater access to firearms in isolated areas. General practitioners may also be required to treat acute conditions outside of the practice or hospital setting, such as a collapse on a street or an accident site. Acutely ill patients require stabilisation and transfer and admission to an acute care setting. This may involve advocating for the admission of the patient. Continuity of care for seriously ill patients requires the use of handover skills. Emergency situations may require GPs to provide clear instructions to staff, take control of situations and demonstrate the ability to lead the general practice or another team. This may occur outside the general practice setting, such as at an accident site, where leadership skills in sometimes chaotic and dangerous settings are critical to effective emergency management. Personal safety issues for the GP and practice staff are of more concern in emergency situations, such as the management of acute psychiatric conditions, or at the scene of an accident. General practitioners need to be prepared to manage complex medicolegal and ethical decisions in the acute care setting. These could include the management of the unconscious patient; the patient with impaired ability to give informed consent when ill; next-of-kin issues; and being sensitive to patient and next-of-kin choices, which may not accord with best possible treatment outcomes. General practices also need to be able to prioritise patients according to treatment urgency. Within the context of regular general practice appointment systems, this will require the time management and organisational skills of both the GP and the general practice systems. Acute serious illness may occur outside of usual practice hours. General practitioners require skills in after hours care, including telephone triage, to ensure that patients have access to appropriate levels of care.RACGP curriculum statement Acute serious illness and trauma | 215The management of acute serious conditions has the potential to cause fear, fatigue and stress, and may be a significant risk to the doctor's own health. It may also impair clinical performance. General practitioners need to ensure they have self care strategies in place to prevent and manage work related stress. They may also need to provide care for practice staff and others affected by emergency and acute care settings. Related curriculum areas Acute serious illness and trauma can occur in any medical specialty area, although there is a common set of management skills required in managing any emergency situation. For specific areas consult other curriculum statements including: Aged care for management of acute fractures in the elderly Children and young people's health for consent issues in an emergency if no accompanying parent is present Chronic conditions for medical emergencies Drug and alcohol medicine for drug overdose and trauma including legal implications Teaching, mentoring and leadership in general practice Men's health for traumatic injury Mental health for acute psychoses and follow up to manage post-traumatic stress disorder Multicultural health for the use of translators Multidisciplinary care for working in teams Occupational health for emergency workplace injuries Pain management for acute pain management principles Quality and safety for communication and handover issues Rural health for the range of skills required in this setting Sports medicine for acute musculoskeletal injuries Women's health for intimate partner abuse and pregnancy.216 | RACGP curriculum statement Acute serious illness and traumaTraining outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1.

For instance, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia are chronic diseases that require effective management and monitoring to prevent future cardiovascular events, but these diseases are unlikely to have as significant affect the daily wellbeing of the patient as for example, the chronic illness caused by, for example, rheumatoid arthritis. Curriculum in practice Typical presentations that illustrate how the chronic conditions curriculum applies to general practice include: Ted, 78 years of age, has ischaemic heart disease. who had a percutanous stent inserted into his left anterior descending coronary artery in June 2004. Three years ago he suffered a myocardial infarct which resulted in congestive cardiac failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 42%. He has a past history of smoking and a long history of type 2 diabetes with hypercholesterolaemia and moderate hypertension. He was recently found to have albuminuria. He has atrial fibrillation for which he is taking warfarin but he has erratic INRs because, as a keen fisherman, he does not keep regular hours or meals. Emily, 58 years of age, is still working to support her youngest child who currently attends university. She presents for a 'check up' as she is feeling tired all the time and becomes short of breath when climbing stairs. At the time of menopause about 4 years ago, she had heavy periods and became mildly anaemic. This was treated with iron supplements for 3 months. You suspect that Emily may be anaemic again as she appears quite pale and you wonder if this might be due to the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that she takes intermittently for arthritis of the knees and wrists. Emily had a mammogram and Pap test about 18 months ago and is not taking any other medication, however you notice that she has lost about 5 kg since her last visit. The only other symptom she reports is long term constipation and haemorrhoids. Emily's haemoglobin returns as 8.5 g/dL and a subsequent colonoscopy finds a 6 cm poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma of her ascending colon.230 | RACGP curriculum statement Chronic conditionsRationale and general practice context Chronic disease represents a substantial and increasing portion of healthcare expenditure and practitioner workloads.3 The burden of chronic diseases is rapidly increasing worldwide, with chronic diseases contributing to approximately 60% all deaths globallly.2 The proportion of the burden of noncommunicable disease is rising with 80% of these deaths having associated modifiable risk factors. 4 The rate of chronic problems managed by general practitioners has increased significantly between 2000-2001 and 2009-2010 from 48.2 to 54.1 chronic problems per 100 encounters, 4 resulting in an estimated additional 16 million chronic problems managed in general practice nationally in 2009-2010 compared with 2000-2001. Two chronic conditions, cardiovascular disease and cancer, constitute the two major causes of death in the Australian community. Most working age Australians consider their health to be good, but results from the 2007-2008 Australian Bureau of Statistics National Health Survey reported that the commonest problems were eyesight (52% of the population), arthritis allergic rhinitis (15%) and hypertensive disease (9%). Other commonly reported conditions were back pain and disc disorders (14%) and deafness (10%). 5 The prevalence of these diseases increases with age and nearly all people in Australia aged 65 years and over report at least one long term condition.5 The National Public Health Partnership (NPHP) identifies the following chronic conditions as having the largest affect the burden of disease in Australia: 6 ischaemic heart disease (also known as coronary heart disease) stroke lung cancer colorectal cancer depression type 2 diabetes arthritis osteoporosis asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) chronic kidney disease oral disease. The role of the GP Both in Australia and internationally, the traditional medical and social care based on the disease centred acute hospital model has not met the needs of people with chronic illness, particularly with respect to psychological and long term care management. General practice care models have been shifting in recent times from professional and service centred management to care that emphasises the individual managing and living with chronic disease, illness and disability. This has been identified as helping health outcomes. 7 In addition, the primary aim of chronic disease management shifts from cure to reducing the progression of symptoms and further complications. Patients with chronic disease will have varying needs for medical management and support, depending on the disease type, the disability associated with that disease, and the stage of disease. Health system responses, including general practice, will need to match the appropriate level of healthcare needed. 7 In addition, the primary aim of chronic disease management shifts from cure to reducing the progression of symptoms and further complications.RACGP curriculum statement Chronic conditions 231Lifestyle modification, general practice and chronic disease There are many complex determinants of chronic disease, including social, economic and cultural factors. While some strategies are needed to attenuate the effects of these factors such as income support or governmental population health initiatives, modification of lifestyle factors is particularly important in managing chronic disease in general practice. Important common lifestyle factors in the development of chronic disease identified for change in general practice are the SNAP risk factors: smoking, nutrition, alcohol and physical activity. 8 Lessening exposure to the risk factors of smoking and alcohol and promoting the benefits of good nutrition and physical activity, helps prevent and control chronic disease. A multidisciplinary approach to general practice chronic disease management Care for patients with chronic illness is complex and needs to be supported by a systematic approach to self management, information management and multidisciplinary teamwork.7 The increasing prevalence of chronic disease has led to major changes in the methods of healthcare delivery and the role of different health professionals in delivering such care. The role of the GP in chronic disease management varies over time but is central for most patients. General practitioners have ongoing relationships with their patients, which provides a central point of co-ordination for long term chronic disease management. Continuity of care, which is a key feature of general practice, has been shown to improve the quality of care and health outcomes for patients with chronic diseases. 9 This continuity of care is particularly important in the significant proportion of patients who have more than one chronic disease, resulting in relatively complex disease management. General practitioners can co-ordinate care and are able to provide more holistic care for patients than the primarily disease focused care of the secondary and tertiary healthcare sector. PReveNTIO N A CTIv ITIe S Figure 1. Levels of healthcare need to be matched to the care needs of chronic diseaseLeveL 3 High disease complexity requiring care co-ordination LeveL 2 High disease risk requiring disease/care management LeveL 1 Lower level of chronic disease (70-80% population) requiring self management support232 | RACGP curriculum statement Chronic conditionsThe healthcare team includes the general practice team (GPs and practice nurses), other primary healthcare professionals (eg. pharmacists, physiotherapists, psychologists) and healthcare professionals from the secondary sector. In particular, practice nurses have an increasingly important role in the delivery of systematic care for chronic diseases in the general practice setting, and are similarly becoming better placed to participate in holistic rather than just disease-specific care. In some locations and practices, for example in rural and remote settings, the boundaries between primary and secondary care may be less distinct, and the GP may be responsible for a greater proportion of in hospital patient care. Patients and their carers have an extremely important role in the management of chronic diseases. Therefore supporting and educating patients in their self management is a critical role for GPs and general practice staff involved in the care of patients with chronic disease.

Curriculum in practice Typical cases that illustrate how the dermatology curriculum applies to general practice include: Ian, 58 years of age, is a pig farmer. He rarely presents to the practice but today he comes in nursing one hand, which he has wrapped in a bandage. He can't remember injuring the hand, but it has now developed a large vesiculated lesion on the right thumb. Ian says he cannot work because his hand is too tender and that last night he felt 'shivery' cold. Today he is febrile with tender axillary nodes. Ian is surprised how rapidly the lesion developed, saying it was barely visible just 3 days ago. A culture is obtained and the result is Streptococcus pyogenes. Ian wants to know how long it will take to recover. Jack, 17 years of age, is a high school student. He presents for review of a rash on his face that 'just won't get better'. The rash started just a few days after returning from an intensive training camp and began with a few spots on his forehead which then spread rapidly to cover the right cheek. He thought it might be a friction rash from the mats they used at the camp. He had tried topical antiseptic creams without success. Jack was commenced on antibiotics a week ago, but today, the lesions appear to be more ulcerated in nature and consistent with Herpes gladiatorum. Katie, 6 years of age, has been sent home from school because she has an itchy rash. The school were worried it might be scabies. The rash is dry and scaly and predominantly involves the antecubital and popliteal fossa. There is hypo-pigmentation of the skin and her mother reports that Katie has had it on and off since she was a baby. There is a family history of atopy.252 | RACGP curriculum statement DermatologyRationale and general practice context Skin conditions account for 14.8 out of every 100 patient encounters in general practice and 10.4% of the total reasons for encounters, making them one of the most common presentations in Australian general practice. 1 In addition to being a major source of patient morbidity, skin conditions can be the first presentation of serious systemic disease, including infection and malignancy, with skin cancers being the second commonest reason for medical specialist referral in general practice. 1 Skin cancers are a major and increasing source of premature death in Australia,2,3 highlighting the importance of prompt diagnosis and management. While each patient presenting with a skin condition is unique, some significant skin conditions are more common among particular patient groups. For example, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are prone to streptococcal skin disease and to secondary renal disease. Also, the vulnerability to skin cancers, including melanoma, is increased in the highly immunosuppressed, especially transplant recipients. General practitioners also see skin conditions or dermatological manifestations of systemic diseases that, although uncommon in Australia, are seen in travellers, refugees and other people who have been to areas outside of Australia. General practice has a significant role in participating in public health measures aimed at reducing the significant health burden of adverse outcomes, including patient education, about the avoidance of environmental hazards that may cause skin problems and other public health measures such as disease notification. This includes screening for skin cancers according to evidence based guidelines and targeting specific high risk populations.

RACGP curriculum statement Dermatology | 253Training outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1. Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship DERT1.1 Must be able to take an accurate and complete history, as skin conditions may reflect serious systemic or psychiatric disturbance. This incorporates the need to assess skin diseases that may be influenced by lifestyle, work, psychological state, cultural practices, ethnicity, geography and travel. DERT1.2 Need to assess how skin conditions affect the patient's family and community. DERT1.3 Need to provide ongoing full assessment of skin conditions, especially chronic conditions, with close attention to the long term physical, psychological and social impact of the disease on the patient. This includes the patient's own conception of their disease, which can markedly affect management and outcomes. 2. Applied professional knowledge and skills DERT2.1 Require knowledge of regional anatomy relevant to skin surgery. Need to be able to describe skin lesions using standard dermatological terms. DERT2.2 Require knowledge of clinical and historical features of major common diseases including: DERT2.2.1 skin examination, choose appropriate investigations and perform appropriate dermatological procedures. Such procedures may include: fungal disease DERT2.3.6 skin swabs for bacterial or viral disease DERT2.3.7 dermoscopy.254 | RACGP curriculum statement DermatologyDERT2.4 Must be able DERT2.5 Recognise unusual skin conditions or dermatological manifestations of systemic diseases. DERT2.6 Recognise skin conditions related to drug reactions and environmental exposures. 3. Population health and the context of general practice DERT3.1 Educate patients about the avoidance of environmental hazards such as solar radiation, workplace or household exposures that may cause skin problems. DERT3.2 Practise public health measures that aim to reduce the health burden of adverse outcomes such as disease notification requirements. DERT3.3 Screen for skin cancers according to evidence based guidelines including targeting specific high risk populations. DERT3.4 Integrate knowledge of significant skin conditions which are more common among particular groups within Australia including Indigenous Australians. DERT3.5 Recognise unusual skin conditions or dermatological manifestations of systemic diseases uncommon in Australia that may present in travellers, refugees or other people who have been in areas outside of Australia. 4. Professional and ethical role DERT4.1 Manage skin conditions using a team approach that involves specialist colleagues in dermatology, plastic surgery or skilled nursing staff. DERT4.2 Acknowledge the limitations for treating dermatological conditions within general practice and refer patients in a timely and appropriate manner when necessary. DERT4.3 Use an empathetic and nonjudgmental approach that recognises the potential for psychological distress from skin conditions for the patient and others, including the potential lifelong misery and stigma of some skin conditions such as visible birthmarks, psoriasis, alopecia and acne. 5. Organisational and legal dimensions DERT5.1 Ensure that organisational strategies are in place for referring patients unsuitable for general practice management. DERT5.2 Ensure the accurate documentation of examinations, care and patient outcomes. DERT5.3 Ensure that the practice complies with the standards required for practical procedures (eg. infection control).RACGP curriculum statement Dermatology | 255Learning objectives across the GP professional life Medical student 1.

There are significant areas of overlap with mental health, as comorbidity is common among substance users. Pain management and addiction issues, as well as doctor's health, tobacco and gambling problems, are also part of this field. Curriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the drug and alcohol medicine curriculum applies to general practice: Mandy, 29 years of age, was on a methadone program for 4 years, but was discharged when she kept intermittently using heroin. She has not been receiving regular care for several months. She arrives today late in the afternoon asking to be fitted in as she is feeling very unwell. She is shivering and has a low grade fever with a heart rate of 95 bpm. Her main complaint is abdominal cramps and you note she also has dilated pupils and a runny nose. Although initially polite, she is asking for codeine for the pain and the longer you take to examine her, the more agitated and angry she becomes. She says the pain is so bad that she may as well go and kill herself as her life is worthless anyway. She also says that if you would just help her she is ready to turn her life around.268 | RACGP curriculum statement Drug and alcohol medicineRationale and general practice context Australia is a drug-using society. National household surveys demonstrate that alcohol is consumed by the majority of the population and that cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug.1 Two legal drugs - alcohol and tobacco, are the two greatest causes of preventable disease and death in this country. These causes include lung cancer, ischaemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from tobacco - while alcohol contributes to various cancers, alcoholic liver cirrhosis and road injuries. The role of GPs in drug and alcohol medicine General practitioners are increasingly being asked by government and public health authorities to become more involved in the diagnosis and management of drug and alcohol problems in their patients. General practitioners need a range of medical and psychological skills when managing drug and alcohol problems, as these substances can affect a wide range of physical and mental functions, which directly impact on successful management. Many GPs resist taking on this role.2-4 This may stem from lack of confidence and skills in the area, and a belief that intervention is doomed to failure. Other perceived barriers are lack of time, difficulties in raising the topic during the consultation, and having a negative attitude toward individuals with alcohol and other drug problems. Yet the results of interventions by GPs can be very significant.5 Brief interventions for alcohol abuse and opiate pharmacotherapies for heroin addiction are two common examples of effective GP initiated treatments, proven by multiple studies in Australia and overseas. General practice is well positioned to manage substance use disorders and the degree to which a particular GP will manage these conditions will depend on the level of skills they possess. The maintenance of clear professional roles and boundaries is a key principle in the management of drug and alcohol conditions in the general practice setting. Doctors may also need to treat and support drug-using colleagues and need to be aware of specific related treatment issues. Some drugs used for the treatment of alcohol and drug disorders are governed by strict legislative prescribing requirements, which practitioners need to work within. Drug and alcohol problems are a major public health burden, and GPs are also in an ideal position to help reduce drug related morbidity and mortality. The management of drug and alcohol conditions requires a multidisciplinary approach to patient management, often in conjunction with other medical and social service agencies. General practitioners need to know where and when to refer patients, and clinicians working in communities with a high rate of substance use disorders may consider incorporating more specialised skills into their everyday work, and this may involve further training in drug and alcohol medicine as required.

Curriculum in practice Typical presentations that illustrate how the eye and ear medicine curriculum applies to general practice include: Ewan, aged 29 years, has been having headaches lately and has noticed that his night vision is quite poor and wonders if he might need glasses. His visual acuity is normal, but visual field testing indicates loss of peripheral vision and his retina appears heavily pigmented on fundoscopy. How would you confirm a diagnosis of Retinitis pigmentosa? What dietary changes might you recommend while awaiting specialist review? What is the long term prognosis of his eye condition? Brodie, aged 24 years, is complaining that he hasn't been able to clear the water out of his right ear for a week, which has been becoming increasingly painful over the past 24 hours. He is a competition surfer and has already tried a range of over-the-counter preparations without success and wonders if his ear problem might be explained by his recent trip to Hawaii. His ear canal is oedematous and completely occluded by greyish slough. You note that he has significant exostoses. What is the likely diagnosis of his ear pain? What are the common pathogens causing his ear pain and how do these differ in tropical regions? What causes exostoses and how are they treated? How is his ear pain best managed currently, and how may recurrences be reduced?282 | RACGP Curriculum statement Eye and ear medicineRationale and general practice context Eye and ear problems are common general practice presentations. While this curriculum refers to 'ear' medicine, this term is used to include the more commonly accepted terms 'ear, nose and throat' medicine. Eye problems in Australian general practice The burden of visual impairment is not distributed uniformly throughout the world. The least developed regions carry the largest share 1 with 87% of blindness occurring in developing countries.2 Visual impairment is also unequally distributed across age groups, being largely confined to adults 50 years of age and older. 2 About 50 000 Australians are blind.3 General practice eye consultations account for about 2.3 out of every 100 consultations and about 8% of medical specialist referrals are to an ophthalmologist. 4 The blindness rate in Indigenous Australian adults is 1.9%, which is 6.2 times higher than in the nonindigenous population. Over the age of 40 years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have six times the rate of blindness of other Australians. 5 Low vision occurs in 9.4% of indigenous adults, which is 2.8 times the rate of the general population. Major causes of blindness in indigenous adults include cataract (32% of cases of blindness), optic atrophy (14%), refractive error (14%), diabetic eye disease (9%) and trachoma (9%). Indigenous adults in very remote areas have more cataract and are less likely to wear glasses, but diabetic eye disease, unoperated cataract and poor reading vision are problems across the whole of Australia. 6 Indigenous children, especially in remote areas, have better vision than their nonindigenous peers. Overall, low vision occurs in 1.4% of indigenous children (age-standardised rate), which is five times less common than in nonindigenous children. Indigenous children in very remote areas have better vision and less refractive error, but still suffer from trachoma. 6 General practitioners need to take into account their own skill level, the availability of specialised equipment that they are competent to use, the likelihood of patient injury from either the condition or intervention, and the appropriateness of referral before treating sense-threatening conditions. The ability for a GP to treat eye conditions also depends on the availability of equipment. For example, GPs in emergency departments may have access to slit lamps, but these may be limited access in other clinical settings. Similarly, rural and remote GPs may require a differing skill set to treat a different range of eye problems, depending on availability of resources. About 9.4% of Australians aged 55 years or older are visually impaired and about 1.2% are blind. Almost 170 000 Australians aged 65 years or over have visual impairment caused by eye disease. Of these, 51 000 people are classified as blind and almost 119 000 people have low vision. 7 There is a strong association between visual impairment and advancing age and vision problems will become increasingly important within the context of an aging population. Based on studies that have included an eye examination, cataract is the most common eye disease among Australians aged 65 years or older, affecting over 1.2 million people (almost half of that population). This is followed by age related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. A further 398 400 older Australians are estimated to have early age related maculopathy, which usually carries no symptoms, and are therefore at risk of developing age related macular degeneration. 7 The increasing rate of type 2 diabetes in the Australian population will also contribute to the total burden of eye disease in Australia. 3 A distribution imbalance is also found with regard to gender throughout the world, with females having a significantly higher risk of having visual impairment than males. 3 Notwithstanding the progress in surgical intervention that has been made in many countries over the past few decades, cataract remains the leading cause of visual impairment in all regions of the world, except in the most developed countries. 1RACGP Curriculum statement Eye and ear medicine | 283In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, the major eye conditions remain diabetic retinopathy, cataract, refractive errors and, for some regions, trachoma, trichiasis and trauma.5 Ear problems in Australian general practice In 2009-2010, ear problems constituted 3.7 out of every 100 general practice consultations.4 Of the 3.8 per 100 encounters, 1.0 of these encounters were due to acute otitis media/myringitis, and 0.8 due to ear wax problems. In addition, 6.1% of medical specialist referrals were to an ear, nose and throat specialist. 4 Latest available estimates indicate that about 3.5 million Australians have hearing loss.8 The early detection of hearing loss in children is critical for the development of speech and is a critical role for GPs. Around 3.5 of every 1000 children below the age of 14 years have some hearing impairment.8,9 The overall prevalence rates of hearing loss in Australian adults are 26.3% for males 15 years and over, 17.1% for females 15 years and over and 21.6% for the adult population. This equates overall to more than 1 in 4 men and more than 1 in 5 Australian adults who have hearing loss.8,9 Around 60% of adults with hearing loss are males, which is attributed to greater workplace noise exposure for men than women. Approximately half of hearing impaired people are in the working age population (15-64 years), and 74% of people over the age of 70 years have some hearing loss. 8,9 The level of ear disease and hearing loss among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people remains higher than the general Australian population, particularly among children and young adults. Ear infection otitis media, particularly in suppurative forms, is associated with hearing impairment, which affects language development and can cause learning difficulties in children. Permanent hearing loss can occur when not adequately treated and followed up. Otitis media can affect indigenous babies within weeks of birth and a high proportion of children will continue to suffer from chronic suppurative otitis media throughout their developmental years. 10 The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey (NATSIHS) 2008 reported that 1 in 10 indigenous children aged 4-14 years experienced an ear or hearing problem. Ear/hearing problems were reported by 12% of indigenous people who participated in the 2004-2005 NATSIHS. Complete or partial deafness was reported by 9% of indigenous people living in remote and nonremote areas, but the level of otitis media was higher for indigenous people living in remote areas (4%) than for those living in nonremote areas (2%). After adjusting for differences in the age structures of the two populations, otitis media was about 2.8 times more common for indigenous people than for nonindigenous people. 10 Related curriculum areas Refer also to the curriculum statements: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health Aged care.284 | RACGP Curriculum statement Eye and ear medicineTraining outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1.

General practice is also increasingly involved in the early intervention and prevention of mental disorders and the optimisation of mental health. 1,2 While general practitioners commonly see high prevalence disorders such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorders, most will also encounter a range of less common mental health problems including psychosis. In addition to obvious mental illness, GPs also see and manage lesser degrees of mental health conditions and distress as part of the full spectrum of mental health seen in the community. A mental disorder is a diagnosable illness that significantly interferes with an individual's cognitive, emotional or social abilities. 3 Mental disorders differ in type and severity and some major mental disorders are significant public health issues. These include depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, psychosis and dementia. Mental disorders are diagnosed by standardised criteria such as those contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4 and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (10th revision).5 The term mental illness is synonymous with mental disorder. A mental health problem also interferes with a person's cognitive, emotional or social abilities, although usually to a lesser extent than a mental disorder. Mental health problems are more common mental complaints and include mental ill health temporarily experienced as a reaction to life stressors. Mental health problems are less severe and of shorter duration than mental disorders, but may develop into a mental disorder. The distinction between mental health problems and mental disorders is not well defined and is made on the basis of severity and duration. Comorbid mental health conditions are defined as mental health problems that present in people with another condition. Patients may present with other complaints. For example, they may present with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, a disability or a substance use disorder for which their mental health problem is a comorbidity. People with mental illness have all of the conditions that people without mental health problems have, and so comorbidity is a common general practice presentation. For these patients, the mental health disorder can complicate the management of their other conditions, which needs to be understood and dealt with by the GP . Available evidence demonstrates that people with mental illness still struggle on a daily basis to access appropriate healthcare, or be treated with respect or dignity when they do enter our healthcare systems. 6 Patients whose primary problem is a mental health disorder also deserve the full range of care, including preventive services, offered in general practice.296 | RACGP curriculum statement Mental healthCurriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the mental health curriculum applies to general practice: Lachlan, 33 years of age, left school early to work as an apprentice in the hospitality sector. He slowly worked toward opening his own restaurant, and by the age of 28 years he achieved this. A talented chef, he had a number of signature dishes featured in the local media and appeared on track to become the region's most popular chef. Lachlan's private life was less rosy. His occupation meant he was working the opposite hours to most of his peers and he slipped into a pattern of sleeping until lunchtime. He commenced work then did not finish until around 2.00 am. Lachlan rarely cooked for himself and tended to eat leftovers or takeaway food. He had been in a relationship with a married patron of the restaurant, but it had ended 6 months before his visit to you. Lachlan's social life was reduced to drinking with his employees after the daily clean-up. Recently he had been arrested for driving under the influence after crashing his car into a fence post. Although his presenting symptoms are fatigue related, he is open about feeling depressed and reports that his life is lacking enjoyment. How do you assess Lachlan's mental state and develop a management plan?RACGP curriculum statement Mental health | 297Rationale and general practice context Mental health problems and mental disorders are estimated to affect almost half (45%) of Australians aged 16-85 years at some stage during their lifetime with about one in five (20% or 3.2 million) Australians affected during a 12 month period.7 In 2008-2009, there were an estimated 13.2 million mental health related general practice encounters.8 The burden of disease due to mental disorders is 13% of the total burden of disease in Australia - third in importance after heart disease and cancer. 9 Depression was the tenth most frequent problem10 managed in 1998-1999 and increased to the fourth most common condition requiring treatment in 2005-2006.11 Intentional self harm (including suicide) accounted for 36% of injury related deaths in Australia in 2010 and is a major form of death for people with mental disorders. In Australia, the rate of youth suicide peaked in the 1990s, but is now decreasing. However, after transport accidents, intentional self harm remains the leading cause of death for young people in the 15-24 years age group, accounting for 20% of deaths. 12 People with mental illness have an elevated risk of preventable natural and unnatural death13 with psychiatric outpatients being twice as likely to die from diseases such as ischaemic heart disease, which has often gone undetected.14 Despite a steady decline in cardiovascular mortality for most Australians, people with mental illness have received little or no benefit from this progress.15,16 Clinical depression also predicts increased mortality,17 with comorbid clinical depression and coronary heart disease being especially associated with increased mortality.18 Many other chronic disorders have been found to be associated with increased depressive morbidity.19 Health related quality of life measures suggest the effects of depression on the patient's quality of life are comparable to that of arthritis, diabetes and hypertension, and that depression and chronic illness can interact to amplify these effects. 20 Managing depression as a chronic disease has been shown to improve emotional and physical functioning reflecting the reality of high rates of symptom recurrence and sustained functional impairment. 21 Special mental health conditions (including effects of discrimination) affect people from diverse backgrounds including issues of gender differences, cultural and linguistic diversity, poverty and issues of sexuality including sexual preference. The role of general practitioners in mental health Mental health work is multidisciplinary, for which GPs are often the first point-of-contact for patients experiencing mental health problems. This includes patients who do not disclose their mental health problems. In addition, GPs are reported as the most common providers of mental health services. 8 General practitioners require skills to be able to: perform a behavioural, emotional and cognitive assessment within the context of a patient's physical findings. This includes a background chronic and current acute problems, with knowledge of their current personal and social circumstances, as well as past experiences identify early warning signs provide appropriate care provide continuity of care - a key factor in the successful treatment of people with mental illness effectively utilise and participate in a multidisciplinary approach to care. Successful general practice management of mental problems requires skills in chronic disease management22 and willingness to work in formal liaison with other mental health providers23 to enhance patient outcomes. Stigma is a key mental health issue for GPs. Many patients will be reluctant to disclose their mental health issues because they regard these problems as stigmatising and prefer not to discuss them. Often the GP may be the first health professional to identify a mental health problem in someone who is presenting with a somatic complaint and has been reluctant to discuss mental health issues.298 | RACGP curriculum statement Mental healthManaging such patients, including appropriate referral, may take time and effort for the GP . General practice patients require competence in instituting initial management, which may require using telephone advice from local mental health services, or national GP psychiatric liaison help lines such as GP Psych Support. 24 If accessing appropriate local mental health services is difficult, the GP may be required to both institute and continue management of mental health disorders. Many psychological disorders in general practice are self limiting physical illnesses and the GP's role in these situations is to explain, ease distress and act to speed recovery if possible.25 This requires background knowledge of normal and adaptive psychological reactions to life stressors, commencing from undergraduate education and updated over a GP's lifetime. Patients prefer to be assessed for mental health problems by their GP , rather than a mental health specialist. Patient improvement in depression has been linked to the strength of the therapeutic relationship26 and general practice continuity of care may be an advantage where a previous patient-doctor relationship may have been well established already. There is also continuity between communication styles in everyday general practice consultations and communication in consultations with patients presenting emotional problems and psychotherapeutic communication.25 Comorbidity of mental health conditions with drug and alcohol problems is another common general practice presentation. The majority of patients with serious drug and alcohol problems also have another mental health disorder and visa versa, which complicates the management of both sets of disorders. General practice factors that can inhibit a patient from presenting emotional problems in a consultation include poor GP interview behaviours, perceived lack of time, and believing that the GP can do nothing to help.27 The GP needs to learn time management skills to assist in managing patients presenting with mental health disorders who are often complex, involving considerable time and effort. Establishing the necessary rapport for effective patient management in these conditions also takes time. General practitioners may have difficulty accessing appropriate local mental health services, particularly in rural and regional areas. They may be required to both institute and continue management of mental health disorders in such areas, whether or not they have a particular interest in mental health. The use of multidisciplinary teams in mental health services creates communication challenges between the general practice and mental health services participating in case discussion and care planning. Establishing effective communication and better links between GPs and mental health services facilitates mutual patient care. The current trend for GPs to be leaders of primary health teams in their own practices will require teams that deal with mental health problems. The GP will need skills to lead such teams, including appropriate communication and the delegation of responsibility. General practitioners with more experience in managing mental problems and with relevant postgraduate qualifications have been shown to cope better with difficult mental health problems, including patients without medically explained symptoms, somatisation and hypochondria.

Musculoskeletal conditions may result from a wide range of processes including injury, inflammation, infection, metabolic or endocrinological conditions and the normal aging process. Musculoskeletal medicine incorporates aspects of orthopaedics, rheumatology, rehabilitation medicine and pain medicine. Musculoskeletal, or orthopaedic medicine, includes common ailments such as whiplash, back and buttock pain where findings on radiological investigation do not often correlate strongly with the clinical presentation, requiring a detailed clinical examination to assess biomechanical dysfunction and to interpret referred pain patterns. This subspecialty provides professional links between medical practitioners and allied health disciplines such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, osteopathy, chiropractic, myotherapy and exercise physiology. Musculoskeletal conditions cause a significant pain burden in the community that often involve complex psychological processes. Psychological conditions can result in somatic pain and many people with chronic pain have comorbid psychological diagnoses. The successful management of musculoskeletal conditions requires a holistic, patient centred approach. Curriculum in practice The following cases illustrate how the musculoskeletal medicine curriculum applies to general practice: Jack, 70 years of age, has recently retired. He now plays golf several times a week. He has developed pain in his right shoulder over the past couple of weeks that is progressively worsening and now wakes him from sleep if he rolls onto that side. He is otherwise well, with mild hypertension and a history of low back pain. On examination he has an element of pain consistent with rotator cuff injury and tendonitis. He wants to know his treatment options, but also how this could have been avoided. Louise, 32 years of age, presents with 1 week of swollen and painful finger joints, as well as feeling tired. On examination, she has swelling of her proximal interphalangeal joints on both hands, which are tender. She also looks tired.316 | RACGP curriculum statement Musculoskeletal medicineRationale and general practice context Musculoskeletal conditions are responsible for a major burden in the Australian health system, affecting around 31% of the population - more than 6 million Australians. Globally, one in four people report chronic musculoskeletal impairments in both less and more developed countries. These conditions consume enormous healthcare and social resources, representing almost 25% of the total cost of illness in western countries. 1 In 2008, the World Health Organization estimated that musculoskeletal diseases were the fifth largest cause of global years of life lost due to disability, accounting for more than 5% of the total. 2 Musculoskeletal conditions are the most common cause of severe long term pain and physical disability 3 and are major causes for work limitation and early retirement.3 Back pain, joint disorders (osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis) and osteoporosis make the greatest contribution to this burden and have been targeted as a national health priority area with a national action plan by the Department of Health and Ageing. A common misconception is that chronic musculoskeletal conditions are inevitable and an unavoidable consequence of aging. In reality, the burden of arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions can be reduced through intervention at various points along the disease continuum including prevention, early diagnosis, prompt initiation of treatment, ongoing management and timely access to joint replacement. 4 In addition, children and young people can be affected by chronic musculoskeletal conditions, such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. These misconceptions may lead to missed opportunities to address potentially modifiable risk factors, prevent or slow progression, improve management and optimise health related quality of life. 5 Musculoskeletal conditions and Australian general practice General practice plays an important role within the Australian healthcare system in the prevention, early detection and management of chronic disease, including musculoskeletal disease. Musculoskeletal conditions accounted for 15.4% of general practice encounters in 2009-2010, and were the third most common reason for presentation.6 Back complaints accounted for 3.1% of reasons for presentation, followed by knee (1.4%), foot/toe (1.1%), shoulder (1.1%), neck (1.0%), leg (0.8%) and other (0.7%). 6 The nature of general practice provides the opportunity for early screening for chronic disease and enables preventable risk factors to be addressed early. For example, the early diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis greatly reduces long term joint damage and improves outcomes. General practitioners need to be able to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis as early as possible in order to optimise outcomes for patients. 5 Up to 18% of women and 10% of men aged over 65 years have symptomatic osteoarthritis characterised by joint pain and mobility impairment. Comprehensive assessment leading to an early diagnosis and appropriate intervention can significantly relieve signs and symptoms and expedite joint replacement when required. 7 Half of all women and a third of all men will suffer minimal trauma fractures secondary to osteoporosis. 8 Early identification and management can prevent many of the longer term disastrous consequences.8 The impact of musculoskeletal conditions on quality of life is large, not only in terms of activity limitation and functional restrictions, but also from pain and self perceived state of health. For example, about 10% of people with rheumatoid arthritis reported very high levels of psychological distress. 4 Independent living of a large proportion of people with arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions is compromised and many experience psychosocial changes in their lives such as a change in marital status and employment as a result of their disease or condition.4RACGP curriculum statement Musculoskeletal medicine | 317Through both direct intervention and promotion of self management strategies, the GP clearly has a critical role in the management of these and other musculoskeletal conditions, which continue to increase in incidence and prevalence with our aging population and poor health, secondary to obesity and life style choices. Note: this curriculum statement is consistent with the musculoskeletal medicine educational requirements for Australian GPs according to the Australian National Musculoskeletal Core Competencies 9 and the global curriculum recommendations of the International Bone and Joint Decade Undergraduate Curriculum Group.3 In addition, this statement is also consistent with the musculoskeletal medicine syllabus of the Australasian Faculty of Musculoskeletal Medicine10 and the evidenced based Clinical guidelines for musculoskeletal diseases of The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. 11 Related curriculum areas Refer also to the curriculum statements: Integrative medicine Occupational health and safety Pain management Sports medicine Chronic conditions.318 | RACGP curriculum statement Musculoskeletal medicineTraining outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1. Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship MSKT1.1 Understand the particular importance of common presentations of pain and how the subjective nature of pain requires that the consultation process initially focuses on taking a good pain history. This includes, where appropriate, history taking from the patient's family members, carers, employers. MSKT1.2 Efficiently elicit information while simultaneously employing empathy and patience with patients suffering pain. MSKT1.3 Understand the need for careful detailed history taking for presentations of vague or non-specific symptoms common in many musculoskeletal general practice presentations. MSKT1.4 Use empathy and motivational interviewing skills to help develop a sound therapeutic partnership with the patient, especially as many conditions require long term treatment. MSKT1.5 Communicate where appropriate, and in conjunction with the patient, with the patient's family members, carers, employers and others to promote successful disease monitoring and plan rehabilitation options. MSKT1.6 Communicate prevention strategies for pain and dysfunction in common musculoskeletal conditions including benefits and risks of lifestyle factors, physical activity, minimising immobility and avoiding of specific risks. MSKT1.7 Use appropriate communication skills for patient education and enhancing self management which are key strategies in effective musculoskeletal general practice care. 2. Applied professional knowledge and skills MSKT2.1 Know the wide range of musculoskeletal conditions is necessary to successfully manage the diversity of musculoskeletal general practice presentations including assessment techniques, differential diagnosis and disease management. This includes a thorough knowledge of the basic sciences, normal versus abnormal function and a biopsychosocial/multidisciplinary approach to care. MSKT2.2 Understand that as pain is the most common symptom of musculoskeletal conditions treatment outcomes are directed at pain reduction, as well as improving function, modifying disease progression and decreasing the risk of future loss of function or recurrence. MSKT2.3 Understand the role of patient safety concerns in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions treatments, such as the overriding principle of 'first do no harm' because while evidence based medicine is critical to managing musculoskeletal conditions, many treatments in this area continue to be based on experience and empiricism.RACGP curriculum statement Musculoskeletal medicine | 3193. Population health and the context of general practice MSKT3.1 Understand that the early diagnosis and management of common general practice musculoskeletal presentations not only improves patient quality and quantity of life, but is a major public health intervention to reduce community morbidity and mortality, and their economic impact. MSKT3.2 Know the epidemiology and patterns of musculoskeletal diseases to help the early diagnosis of musculoskeletal conditions. MSKT3.3 Identify risk factors for musculoskeletal disease and disease prevention to help reduce musculoskeletal related morbidity and mortality. MSKT3.4 Understand how the chronicity and morbidity associated with many musculoskeletal conditions requires work, family and social factors to be considered in their general practice management. 4. Professional and ethical role MSKT4.1 Understand how musculoskeletal conditions often require the GP to work with other health professionals within a multidisciplinary team including, where appropriate, employers. This is done while maintaining appropriate professional boundaries (see curriculum statement Occupational medicine). MSKT4.2 Understand that patients with musculoskeletal pain problems often seek help from alternative and allied health practitioners using treatment paradigms that may differ widely from the traditional medical model. MSKT4.3 Develop strategies for working with patients using nonmedical paradigms to maintain patient-doctor relationships while maintaining an awareness of potential for harm as a result of other therapies. 5. Organisational and legal dimensions MSKT5.1 Understand that many general practice musculoskeletal consultations involve legal aspects such as work related, motor vehicle, and assault injury cases and have a basic knowledge of the relevant prevailing legal system within each jurisdiction.

General practitioners can bring medical expertise to the human interface of the workplace to help provide improved outcomes in both physical and mental health, assist in the reduction and elimination of preventable accident or injury, and reduce and prevent the potential for negative health impacts from the work environment. Curriculum in practice Typical cases that illustrate how the occupational medicine curriculum applies to general practice include: Ricko's hand was wrapped and elevated but his clothes were drenched in blood and sawdust when he presented to your practice. His face remained pale as his workmate described the accident with a bandsaw at the mill where they worked. Ricko was passing a slab of timber through the saw when he was momentarily distracted and ran his hand up the middle with the wood. Without removing the dressing, X-ray examination confirmed a massive injury to his hand with splintered metacarpals and one missing digit. Ricko is transferred to hospital for specialised hand surgery. Some months later he has completed rehabilitation and is keen to return to work but you are uncertain as to the risk of future wound contamination and the risk of further injury. How might a workplace assessment help? Alison has been working in the office of a construction company for several months but was recently relocated closer to the worksite. The new office has an exterior door that connects to the site, with the result that considerable dust enters the building and becomes airborne every time she moves a file. Alison's previously stable asthma has become problematic, with erratic peak flow readings. She has needed to use prednisone on several occasions and has needed several days off work. She wonders if this change in her previously stable asthma is due to the dust exposure in her work environment. Alison has also become highly anxious about job security as the company has commenced downsizing. She is concerned that further days off work might jeopardise her employment contract, which is up for review. What role does the workplace play in exacerbating Alison's respiratory and anxiety symptoms and what options are available to manage the situation with her employer? Col presents to the local hospital, greatly agitated, having drenched one arm in pesticide. He has brought the label from the pesticide container with him and you see it is an organophosphate. Like many small owner-operators Col had not been using protective equipment, including mask or gloves, while mixing the chemicals. What emergency measures should be taken by staff and what treatment should be administered? What is Col's prognosis?334 | RACGP curriculum statement Occupational medicineRationale and general practice context In Australia in 2009-2010, 1.6% of general practice encounters were work related,1 with men more likely to present with work related conditions than women.2 Nearly all of these patients (96%) were aged 15-64 years with half being in the 25-44 years age group.2 General practice occupational medicine activities traditionally include accident prevention, injury management, workers' compensation and pre-employment and occupational health medical examinations. In reality, the scope of occupational medicine in the general practice setting goes beyond these tasks. General practitioners are well situated to give advice on the most diverse of working environments, from a sterile laboratory in a large company to a farmer on the family farm to potential health outcomes of a manufacturing process. They may not only treat, but anticipate, biomechanical sequelae for operators of equipment, often specifically engineered for a particular process with little regard for the impact on workers' health. The list of potential occupational health and safety (OH&S) roles for the GP include: fitness to operate equipment such as forklifts or tractors; the effects of drugs, either legal or illegal, in the workplace; first aid including cardiopulmonary resuscitation; information seminars; safety drills; and interpretation of safety data information. Some GPs may be involved in monitoring the health effects of short and long term exposure to noxious substances, and all GPs have a role in the treatment of work related stress and implementing strategies to reduce its incidence. The workplace is one of the few places, outside schools, where people gather on a regular basis, often in large numbers. This provides an ideal opportunity for health promotion and wellness programs. General practitioners are ideally placed to play a pivotal role in brokering positive health outcomes and preventing the spiral into chronic incapacity with its attendant consequences. General practitioners are in a unique position to act as moderators between patient and employer to ensure the best possible outcomes for both parties. Specific occupational health skills are needed to maximise the special opportunities that GPs have to effect good health outcomes. Poorly managed work related conditions can cause great suffering, not only for the patient and the employer, but also the patient's family as a result of unemployment. General practitioners are also often employers and need to be aware of their own OH&S obligations toward their employees.

Curriculum in practice Typical cases that illustrate how the oncology curriculum applies to general practice include: A woman, 54 years of age, presents for a check up after her brother was diagnosed last week with bowel cancer. She says that an aunt had bowel cancer and that one of her grandfathers had died of the disease. She is now extremely worried about her risk of developing bowel cancer and is wondering what to do. One of your receptionists asks if you can fit in her 32 year old brother, Andy, who has noticed a lump at the angle of his jaw. The lump is firm rather than rubbery and adds a darkish tint to the overlying skin. Andy is an otherwise fit and active father of two who has been a keen surfer all his life. Although sporting sun damaged skin, he has no obvious malignant lesions and cannot recall ever having had a lesion removed. Due to the suspicious nature of the lump, you refer Andy to a surgeon and the resultant pathology is of a secondary malignant melanoma without known primary. The area is excised more widely, leaving him with significant cosmetic deformity. A PET scan is arranged and reveals multiple further small lesions in soft tissue and bone. He enters a research trial that requires him to undergo a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. After an initial improvement, his lesions progress and his care becomes palliative.346 | RACGP curriculum statement OncologyRationale and general practice context Cancer is responsible for around 30% of deaths in Australia,1 nearly 20% of the total burden of disease in Australia, as measured by death and disability.2 Malignant neoplasms account for 4.7 of every 100 general practice encounters, with skin cancers accounting for 1.1 of these encounters.3 The rate of general practice cancer related services is increasing.4 Skin cancers, including basal and squamous cell carcinomas and melanomas, are the most common cancers managed by general practitioners. The next most common cancers in Australia are prostate, female breast, colorectal and lung cancers.1 Excluding nonmelanocytic skin cancers, around 108 368 new cases of cancer (62 019 males and 46 349 females) were diagnosed in Australia in 2006.5 About 434 000 people are diagnosed with nonmelanocytic cancers each year.6 About two-thirds of the Australian population will develop at least one nonmelanocytic skin cancer in their lifetime6 and 1 in 3 men and 1 in 4 women will develop a major cancer before the age of 75 years.1 Cancer accounts for approximately 3 of every 10 deaths (29%) in Australia and although survival rates are improving, cancer accounts for nearly 40 000 deaths per year. In 2007, the risk of dying from cancer before the age of 75 years was 1 in 8 for males and 1 in 12 for females.5 While the number of deaths from cancer continues to rise, there is a decrease in the age standardised death rates in Australia.5 However, despite these improvements, cancer is now Australia's leading cause of death among 45-64 year olds and causes more premature deaths and overall disease burden than cardiovascular disease.1 General practitioners require a professional and patient centred approach to enable them to support patients across the spectrum of cancer prevention and management.

Control of pain and other symptoms, and psychological, social and spiritual issues, is paramount to provide the best quality of life for patients and their families.1 Palliative care is also by definition 'team care'2 and so careful assessment of symptoms and the needs of the patient should be undertaken by a multidisciplinary team. The World Health Organization3 defines palliative care as: 'An approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual. Palliative care: provides relief from pain and other distressing symptoms affirms life and regards dying as a normal process intends neither to hasten or postpone death integrates the psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death offers a support system to help the family/carers cope during the patient's illness and in their own bereavement uses a team approach to address the needs of patients and their families/carers, including bereavement counselling if indicated enhances quality of life, and may also positively influence the course of illness, and is applicable early in the course of illness, in conjunction with other therapies that are intended to prolong life, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and includes those investigations needed to better understand and manage distressing clinical complications'. Curriculum in practice The following typical presentation illustrates how the palliative care curriculum applies to general practice: Pete, 68 years of age, is a truck driver. He was forced into retirement due to lower back pain, which became severe enough to disturb his sleep. He managed his pain by increasing his alcohol intake, which led to marital problems culminating in separation. By the time he presented for review, he was living in a caravan and had several months of poor nutrition. Unfortunately his pain was found to be due to multiple myeloma, which proved resistant to treatment including bisphosphonates and a short course of radiotherapy. He has had a recent hospital admission for pneumonia and continues to smoke. His pain is currently well managed, however he does not take his other medications as recommended. This includes warfarin, which was commenced in hospital due to his limited mobility posing a risk of DVT. He rarely attends planned appointments, citing lack of transport, and you assess his psychosocial circumstance as placing him at high risk. As Pete's physical and emotional condition is likely to deteriorate as his disease advances, who can you involve in forward planning his future health needs?358 | RACGP curriculum statement Palliative careRationale and general practice context Palliative care requires a multidisciplinary approach, with the general practitioner playing a central and increasing role, especially in the management of domiciliary care. For example, in 2002, of the approximate 134 000 deaths that occurred in Australia, about 64 000 (almost 50%) of patients would have been cared for by a GP several times during their last 12 months of life.4 Most patients who die an easily predictable death from a diagnosed terminal illness want to be cared for at home (>50%). However, only about 16% are able to exercise this option, as most patients now die in hospital; only 20% of people die in hospices and 10% in nursing homes.5 The community sector is increasingly caring for people at home rather than in hospital, and GPs often coordinate sometimes fragmented and competing community services and advocate on behalf of patients, their families and carers for community based palliative care.6,7 Like other doctors, GPs are largely trained to work with curative or life prolonging models of health and many GPs have identified that they require further education in the skills that underpin the practice of palliative care, such as basic communication skills, symptom control and management skills, and skills for dealing with 'death and dying'.8 The provision of good general practice and community based palliative care requires GPs to organise their practices appropriately to help build and configure best use of community based health networks (eg. specialist hospital based to community based teams) to meet the palliative care needs of their patients, and their families and carers, for quality, comprehensive healthcare at the end-of-life in the setting of their choice. 9 Like any other area of medicine, GPs need to utilise evidence based clinical decisions when providing general practice palliative care and access current palliative evidence bases such as CareSearch10 and Therapeutic guidelines - palliative care.11 There are government initiatives in palliative care, and GPs need to work in conjunction with government health priorities and other organisations toward better palliative care services. What are the core elements of general practice palliative care? Core education requirements for the palliative care curriculum need to ensure12,13: physical aspects of care - close and detailed attention to symptom recognition and management, and knowledge of the pharmacology of medications, including dosing in elderly or renally impaired patients psychosocial aspects of care - emotional, social and spiritual aspects of end-of-life care, including developing specific communication skills needed to discuss end-of-life issues with patients and their families/carers cultural issues - crosscultural issues, appropriate use of independent interpreters ethical issues - state based legal requirements with death, wills and end-of-life issues, including managing requests for euthanasia and requests to hasten death with counselling and understanding teamwork - how to work in a multidisciplinary team, how to coordinate different models of care for best patient and family/carer outcomes practical issues - practice issues around 24 hour care rostering, and appropriate use of Medicare Benefits Schedule items to sustainably practise equitable palliative care for patients, determined on the basis of need RACGP curriculum statement Palliative care | 359 carer support - respite arrangements, depression screening and support, emotional support and bereavement care, and understanding and recognising risk factors that may predict the early onset of psychosocial distress and complicated grief reactions14 in family members and carers to enable appropriate referral for further psychosocial support career-long learning - critical appraisal of the evidence base used for own practice and developing primary palliative care research skills to update own evidence base, as well as developing community education, advocacy and health promotional skills complementary and alternative medicine15,16 - developing skills to help patients and their families/ carers to be able to assess their own use of complementary therapies from an evidence based and/or safe perspective audit, care pathway and outcome measurement - developing skills to measure own practice in the area of palliative care (eg. developing an end stage care pathway audit tool17) and be able to audit clinician use of symptom assessment lists and outcome measures (eg. pain scales).

Stimuli that cause pain may be associated with actual or potential tissue damage. While this sensation in itself may be unpleasant, there is also an accompanying emotional experience including fear. Patients who are unable to communicate verbally can still experience pain and may need appropriate pain relieving treatment. Some people report pain in the absence of tissue damage or any likely pathophysiological cause, which may indicate a psychological basis. Based on subjective reports, there may be no way to distinguish their experience from that due to tissue damage. If a patient regards their experience as pain, and if they report it in the same ways as pain caused by tissue damage, this should be accepted as pain. This definition avoids tying pain to the stimulus. Experiences that resemble pain but are not unpleasant, such as pricking, should not be called pain. Unpleasant abnormal experiences (dysesthesias) may also be pain, but are not necessarily so because subjectively they may not have the usual sensory qualities of pain. There is a wide range of terms to describe types of pain and pain related symptoms. 1 Curriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the pain management curriculum applies to general practice: Graham, 34 years of age, is a telecommunications linesman who injured his back 18 months ago when a colleague abruptly dropped a heavy coil they were jointly lifting. The pain was instantaneous and severe, but without motor weakness. He spent 4 days in hospital before being able to mobilise sufficiently to be discharged. Since then he has continued to have low back pain with morning stiffness and a sciatic referral pattern if he coughs or sneezes. Walking or standing for any length of time triggers muscle spasms so he spends most of his time lying on his back with a pillow under his knees. He is able to dress himself, but is unable to bend over to put on his shoes so wears slip-on thongs. Previously, he was a fit man, but is now overweight and his wife is concerned that he may also be depressed. As he was no longer able to take care of their yard they have moved to be closer to their son. Physiotherapy appeared to help initially, but Graham no longer believes it is beneficial. He hates taking analgesia due to constipation, but will use over- the-counter codeine medications for severe bouts, in conjunction with alcohol. 372 | RACGP curriculum statement Pain managementRationale and general practice context Pain is associated with many general practice conditions, and diagnosis and management is often poorly understood and undertreated. Patients in pain and their carers may feel hopeless, helpless, deserted and angry and doctors may experience frustration when pain fails to respond to treatment. General practitioners manage the majority of patients with pain in Australia for both front line and last resort in pain management. Expertise in pain management is developed through education and exposure to clinical experience. Specialist advice in pain management can supplement general practice competence but cannot replace it. Interdisciplinary approaches are often helpful. Pain is a very common general practice problem. 2 The National Health Survey 2007-20083 of adults over 18 years of age reported that 9.7% of participants said that they had severe or very severe pain; 19.3% said that they had moderate pain, and 39.1% reported mild or very mild pain. These levels of pain were associated with varying levels of disability as listed in Table 1. Level of reported disability associated with pain (%) Bodily pain experiencedProfound or severe activity limitationOther disability or restrictive long term health conditionHas no disability or restrictive long term health condition Total None 11.5 16.9 43.4 31.9 Very mild or mild 21.0 38.3 41.2 39.1 Moderate 29.0 30.2 11.4 19.3 Severe or very severe 38.6 14.6 4.0 9.7 Table 1.

Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. According to the World Health Organization working definition, for sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.1,2 As community based health practitioners, general practitioners are vital to the maintenance of individual sexual health. Curriculum in practice Typical cases that illustrate how the sexual health curriculum applies to general practice include: Luci was at a wedding last weekend and drank far more than usual, perhaps in excess of 15 standard drinks of mixed spirits and champagne. It was a warm night and several of the guests then wandered down to the beach with a couple of bottles of champagne. She comes to see you for something to settle her stomach but also for the 'morning after' pill as she has had unprotected intercourse. What is your management? Three days later Luci has developed a slight discharge and lower abdominal pain. A pelvic examination finds extreme adnexal tenderness and cervical excitation. What organism is most likely and what treatment should you use? Carol and her partner Kate have been in a relationship for 8 months and are contemplating moving in together. Carol has a long history of depression and self harm following a brief, previous relationship that was troubled by intimate partner abuse. She has been much happier since meeting Kate. The two share a love of hiking and spend their weekends bushwalking in the local national park. Carol is worried that once they live together it will be harder to keep her sexuality a secret and wants advice on how to raise the subject with her elderly parents. She is also worried that she may lose her job at the private school where she works, which has an exemption from anti-discrimination laws. In reviewing her record, you also realise Carol has missed several appointments and is well overdue for a Pap test. 386 | RACGP curriculum statement Sexual healthRationale and general practice context Sexuality is a basic human attribute and, as such, is a vital part of human health and wellbeing. According to the World Health Organization working definition1: 'Sexuality is a central aspect of being human throughout life and encompasses sex, gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy and reproduction. Sexuality is experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviours, practices, roles and relationships. While sexuality can include all of these dimensions, not all of them are always experienced or expressed. Sexuality is influenced by the interaction of biological, psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, ethical, legal, historical, religious and spiritual factors'. Attending to sexual health and its problems is a basic task of primary healthcare and a core part of general practice in Australia. Sexual health presentations are common in Australian general practice. According to BEACH activity data, 5.1 out of every 100 patient encounters in general practice were for issues regarding the female genital tract (including Pap tests/check ups and menstrual problems), 3.7 out of 100 encounters were for pregnancy and family planning issues (including oral contraception and pre- and postnatal check ups), 2.8 out of 100 encounters were urological, and 1.4 out of 100 encounters were for the male genital system.3 This does not include encounters for relationship counselling or other sexual health concerns. Unsafe sex was estimated to cause 0.6% of the burden of disease in Australia in 20034 and the rates of sexually transmissible infections (STIs) continue to rise, especially in young people.5 Sexual contact can transmit infections such as chlamydia, herpes simplex, human papilloma virus, hepatitis B, gonorrhoea, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis. Sexual activity has also been associated with an increased risk for specific cancers such as cervical and anal cancer. While in recent times sexual health services in Western countries have been provided by sexual health centres, family planning clinics and other facilities, there has been a global trend to integrate sexual health services into primary care.6 This aims to improve antenatal, perinatal, postpartum and newborn care; provide high quality services for family planning, including infertility services; eliminate unsafe abortion; combat STIs including HIV, reproductive tract infections, cervical cancer and other gynaecological morbidities; and promote sexual health. Due to the diverse nature of sexual practices, clinicians also need to be comfortable with discussing sex with a wide range of people including those of different ages, gender (male, female, transgender), sexual preference, culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, and people with disabilities. The Australian Study of Health and Relationships (ASHR), in a population based sample of males and females aged 16-59 years, indicated that over 7% of women and 6% of men had had sexual experiences with people of the same sex. Approximately 90% of women and 95% of men indicated that they were exclusively attracted to the opposite sex. Males who identified themselves as homosexual reported a higher number of lifetime sexual partners than lesbians or heterosexuals respectively.7,8 In addition, the ASHR8 indicated that the median age of reported first intercourse was 16 years of age. About 40% of males and one-quarter of females reported having had intercourse when they were below the age of 16 years, and so GPs must be able to manage sexual health concerns in young people where risks of unplanned pregnancy and STIs are high. Issues of nonconsensual sexual activity can also emerge at this time. General practitioners should be able to elicit this history and be aware of available support services and resources.RACGP curriculum statement Sexual health | 387Sexual health in general practice also involves a working knowledge of legislative public health requirements of STIs and mandatory reporting. This includes a working knowledge of disease and partner notification.

This involves the assessment and management of sporting people, the prevention of injury through the application of sports science knowledge and the application of exercise physiology knowledge to our community at large. The core elements for consideration are knowledge of: the prevention and management of common sport and exercise related injuries the role of inactivity in the aetiology of chronic disease, and exercise as a therapeutic tool. Curriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the sports medicine curriculum applies to general practice: Jemma, a slightly overweight 12 year old girl, joined a netball team to become fit. Almost immediately she began to experience anterior knee pain. The pain is worse with running and also with walking down stairs. Sometimes when she has been sitting still for a time the knee feels unstable when she first stands up, but she does not have significant swelling.400 | RACGP curriculum statement Sports medicineRationale and general practice context Competitive sport holds a prominent place in the Australian psyche and recreational physical activity is a key strategy in promoting healthy lifestyles and preventive medicine. Although many patients first present with an acute sporting injury to hospital emergency departments, 1 general practitioners provide a comparable or even higher number of sports medicine related services than hospitals.2 Therefore the assessment and management of sporting injuries is a significant part of the workload of general practice. The study and practice of sports medicine is a rapidly growing area of medicine, and athletes and recreational sports participants now expect a high standard of care which has had a direct impact on the practice of sports medicine by GPs. Patients present for a wide range of advice related to sport and exercise. The study of sports medicine also entails an understanding of the relevance of exercise to the general population and the aging Australian community. This includes the benefits and risks of exercise and the important role of exercise in the management of many chronic diseases. General practitioners are well situated to provide holistic care in these areas, 3 helping to avoid fragmentation of management. Related curriculum areas Refer also to the curriculum statements: Musculoskeletal medicine Occupational medicine.RACGP curriculum statement Sports medicine | 401Training outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1. Communication skills and the patient-doctor relationship SPOT1.1 Listen and understand the needs of the sports medicine patient. Athletes may have different expectations of outcomes compared to other recreational sports participants or someone using exercise for chronic disease management. SPOT1.2 Use empathy and supportive strategies to encourage the patient to show their emotions and express their needs and fears, for examples athletes with injuries will often have fear of their injury and develop an early grief reaction when seen for treatment. Patients with diabetes and obesity may be fearful of an exercise program, with different types of fears. SPOT1.3 Develop a partnership with the patient so that issues surrounding the injury and exercise can be assessed and explored more easily. It may be that the athlete has unrealistic expectations of their speed of recovery or has an eating disorder; or that the diabetic may have an underlying depressive illness. 2. Applied professional knowledge and skills SPOT2.1 Know the basis of musculoskeletal medicine, physiology and pathology that needs to be applied in an efficient and productive way to manage sports related conditions. SPOT2.2 Understand applied anatomy and surface anatomy to be able to assess sports injuries quickly and thoroughly. SPOT2.3 Know the concepts of injury causation (trauma versus repetitive microtrauma). SPOT2.4 Know the difference between types of exercise and their effects on the body, the beneficial effects of exercise on the body (both normal body and diseased), and have a basic understanding of potential risks of exercise. SPOT2.5 Know the more common sporting injuries and conditions that need to be excluded for proper and safe practise of sports medicine. SPOT2.6 Be able to take a thorough history and apply a specific examination to elicit the information needed to make a proper diagnosis. SPOT2.7 Understand the available investigations and how and when to apply them. SPOT2.8 Have the appropriate skills in directing treatment to the athlete or injured patient which may involve other healthcare professionals as part of co-ordinated care. 3. Population health and the context of general practice SPOT3.1 Apply opportunistic injury prevention, for example, the assessment of obvious biomechanical abnormalities in young athletes to the expected level of knowledge of the clinician. SPOT3.2 Apply exercise physiology concepts to the general community and specific targeted groups including: impaired glucose tolerance/metabolic syndrome; type 2 diabetes; obesity and hypertension; prevention of ischaemic heart disease; fall prevention in the elderly; and mental health, including depression, anxiety and premenstrual dysphoria syndrome. 402 | RACGP curriculum statement Sports medicine4. Professional and ethical role SPOT4.1 Understand the ethical issues surrounding duty of care toward athletes and how this may have the potential to conflict with pressures from coaches and sporting clubs. SPOT4.2 Have a working knowledge of drugs in sport requirements to meet legal and ethical responsibilities. 5. Organisational and legal dimensions SPOT5.1 Recognise that sports medicine workplaces may involve sporting field/arena attendance and issues related to safety and security. SPOT5.2 Ensure appropriate equipment is available for any eventuality when treating in a sporting field/arena and ensure compliance with guidelines for existing minimum on field equipment. SPOT5.3 Ensure practice security, sound record keeping, confidentiality and safe handling practices when providing care in a sporting field/arena. SPOT5.4 Ensure that the practice and practitioner comply with occupational health and safety guidelines when assessing and managing injured athletes and other patients, including universal precautions and safe management of sharps. SPOT5.5 Know the legal requirements for the safe management of athletes including resolving the potential conflict of interest when the duty of care is to the athlete, when a sporting club may employ the GP and a knowledge and application of drugs in sport guidelines.RACGP curriculum statement Sports medicine | 403Learning objectives across the GP professional life Medical student 1.

It is also essential for evaluating and understanding the implications of research for clinical practice. Critical thinking involves a continual questioning of the assumptions underpinning all aspects of a general practitioner's professional life and consists of: critical appraisal \u2014 the process of assessing and interpreting evidence by systematically considering its validity, results and relevance2 \u2014 necessary for the evaluation of research results and their application to clinical practice critical evaluation of the context of general practice critical introspection to gain an understanding of personal knowledge, experience and values that influence the way medicine is practised.3 General practice and primary care research have been described as 'the missing link in the development of high quality, evidence based healthcare for populations'.1 Using a broad, conceptual definition, the research process can be summarised as deliberately asking questions within the framework of existing knowledge and seeking answers following a systematic process which includes: obtaining appropriate information in an ethical, transparent and reproducible manner appropriately analysing the information drawing conclusions on the basis of the validity and reliability of the information and meaning of the results, and comparing these results to other studies disseminating the implications widely, including to those who may effect change. The spectrum of research activities is wide and can include evaluation studies, intervention studies, clinical audits, large scale multicentre clinical trials, and patient satisfaction studies. Research activities can use qualitative or quantitative research methods, or a combination of both. However, each of these activities must be conducted according to the established 'rules' of the research process in order to be considered research. Curriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the critical thinking and research curriculum applies to general practice: There has been a local outbreak of pertussis and, sadly, a number of children from your practice have been admitted to hospital; one baby has died. In reviewing local data pertaining to children with incomplete vaccinations, the number of children with exemptions from vaccination appears to be higher than expected. There are concerns that the outbreak may relate to parental anxieties triggered by a local anti-vaccination lobby group. Research confirms incomplete vaccination may be due to parents disagreeing with immunisation rather than medical contraindications or issues of access. This results in the public health unit developing a public education strategy.412 | RACGP curriculum statement Critical thinking and researchRationale and general practice context GPs as critical thinkers Critical thinking and research promote essential lifelong learning skills throughout the general practitioner's working life. Both enable the GP to provide the best possible patient care by developing the GP's ability to: identify the many important clinical and research questions arising in their everyday clinical practice critically appraise research papers to confidently and accurately answer these questions apply this research evidence to patients and communities. To critically appraise a research paper, clinicians must have sufficient knowledge and understanding of a range of research methods, which can best be gained by undertaking formal and structured training in research methods. Critical appraisal skills are also important in assisting clinicians to implement or participate in research projects. Such clinicians need opportunities to do research, as well as to access appropriate mentoring and support, particularly through linking with research organisations or academic institutions including university departments of general practice. GPs as researchers General practice research aims to solve the problems that arise within the specific context of general practice. The context and the way in which the research is conducted characterises general practice research rather than the nature of the problem investigated. 4 General practitioners need to be researchers in order to pose relevant clinical questions for research, understand the complexity of the general practice context and therefore be able to facilitate research within this context. General practice research must be conducted within general practice to provide answers to the specific and unique problems that arise within this context, 5-9 in particular because: the general practice context is different from specialist and hospital contexts, especially regarding the holistic treatment of people with multimorbidities and undifferentiated illness within the context of uncertainty diagnostic delays lead to poorer outcomes for patients GPs play a pivotal role as gatekeepers to the health system and the absence of research evidence can lead to over-investigation, inappropriate treatment and diagnostic delay through inappropriate referrals decision about medication is significant and many patients take medication prescribed in primary care all their lives. 1 as a person-focused, applied discipline, general practice research concentrates on applied research that goes beyond the biomedical aspects of illness and incorporates issues that address psychosocial aspects of wellbeing, 10 which inherently requires multidisciplinary approaches and multiple methodologies.11 Why critical thinking and research are needed in general practice Critical thinking and research improve patient care in general practice. Research evidence is the fundamental way in which routine clinical practice is improved. Critical thinking and reflection are essential precursors for the incorporation of research evidence into practice. Training in these skills also cultivates an interest in undertaking much needed general practice research.RACGP curriculum statement Critical thinking and research | 413General practice research productivity is far lower than that of other medical disciplines, with an approximate publication rate of three publications per 1000 GPs per year compared to about 160 publications per 1000 physicians and 68 per 1000 surgeons. 12 Levels of engagement in critical thinking and research There are varying levels of engagement in critical thinking and research in general practice. Users and participants, as well as leaders, should be actively involved (Figure 1) at the highest order within each level of involvement. Figure 1. The levels of research engagement. Adapted from 'Glasziou's triangle'13 and reproduced from Australian Family Physician with permission Research leaders are those who conceptualise, design, find funding for, conduct and publish research. Research participants are those who participate in general practice research. Highest order participants are intellectually engaged in the research, understand and feel aligned to its purpose, could describe the project to a third party, and are interested in the results. Usually they are sufficiently part of the research to earn authorship. Lower order participants may just recruit patients for research projects conceptualised and instigated by others such as universities, specialist colleagues or pharmaceutical companies. Involvement in research at medical school and during general practice training is associated with increased ability and confidence in interpreting research findings in subsequent clinical practice, in addition to increased subsequent involvement in general practice research. 5,14,15 All GPs are research users, using research evidence (the base of the triangle) as clinical practice within general practice, and are informed by research from a myriad of health related fields ranging from biochemical to macrosocial levels. This research evidence is accessed in a range of forms from a wide number of sources such as journals, medical newspapers, formal educational activities and discussions with their colleagues, 18 and can lead to changes in practice. However, the critical thinkers consciously seek the best available research evidence, to appraise and combine with clinical experience and patient values to inform their clinical decision making (the principles of evidence based medicine [EBM]). The ability to critically appraise a research paper is a minimum entry level skill set for general practice. Increasing the numbers of GPs actively using research evidence (practising EBM) encourages critical enquiry within the discipline and highlights gaps in the evidence. Some GPs will want to address these gaps through leading or participating in research.Research leaders Research participants Research usersIncreasing degree of involvement in research414 | RACGP curriculum statement Critical thinking and researchSpecific research needs of general practice The specific needs of general practice research impact on all GPs, regardless of their level of involvement in general practice research. General practice has specific research needs with a high degree of contextual complexity (a broad range of relatively unevolved signs and symptoms, presented within the patient's psychological and social setting) compared with the technical complexity of the medical specialties (a narrower range of defined symptoms across single organ systems, more severe illnesses and limited reference to the patient's social context). There are gaps in the evidence that GPs need for making decisions, limiting the ability to provide the highest quality care. These gaps are: basic science: the lack of biomedical and psychosocial evidence. The gap in biomedical science is exemplified by the lack of knowledge about the pathophysiology and natural history of many of the diseases commonly seen in general practice. The limited understanding of help seeking behaviour is an example of a psychosocial gap (eg. why do some patients with upper respiratory tract infections present to their GP , while others with the same symptoms self medicate or take no action?) effectiveness: the lack of evidence demonstrating both the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions routinely used in general practice (diagnosis, treatment and service delivery) applicability: a lack of 'translation research' to ensure that evidence generated in nonprimary care settings is applicable in general practice implementation: the gap between identifying effective care and who should receive it, and what occurs in routine general practice. General practice research also focuses on the taxonomy of general practice itself. A better knowledge of the processes employed in general practice and successful models of healthcare delivery will support more effective, cost efficient and sustainable practice.RACGP curriculum statement Critical thinking and research | 415Training outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1.

The causes and management of undifferentiated conditions may become clearer through history, examination or investigations, or may become clearer over time as a disease process progresses. For example, a connective tissue disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus may first present as tiredness, but further investigation or the passage of time may result in the diagnosis becoming clearer. Similarly, the cause of an initial presentation of undiagnosed chest pain would become apparent if a dermatomal rash developed after 1 day, ie. herpes zoster. Some undifferentiated conditions remain undiagnosed despite thorough assessment and investigation. Some undifferentiated conditions may have a psychological origin, which presents potential challenges to patient safety because of the potential for missed, delayed or wrong diagnosis. Curriculum in practice The following presentation illustrates how the undifferentiated conditions curriculum applies to general practice: Mary, 55 years of age, presents feeling tired and run down but vaguely suggests that she may be lonely now that her children have left home. She finds herself heading to bed around 9 pm and sleeping through until 8 am but without feeling refreshed. With no family to cook for, she has lost her appetite, has began to skip meals and thinks she may have lost weight. She thinks that is why she now feels the cold more. Her periods have become progressively lighter and she has noticed she doesn't need to shave her armpits as often and puts it down to 'change of life'. She thinks she will take up exercise and has begun walking every morning and although her skin has become quite tanned she remains feeling unfit and lacking in energy. At work it is hard to concentrate and she catches herself just staring vacantly. She is wondering if she might be depressed. Her blood pressure is BP 95/60 mmHg and physical examination is unremarkable. 426 | RACGP curriculum statement Undifferentiated conditionsRationale and general practice context Undifferentiated conditions are very likely to present in general practice. For example, the presentation of nonspecific weakness or tiredness is common in general practice and is the fifth commonest reason for initiating further pathology investigations in Australian general practice. 1 General practitioners are primarily diagnosticians2 and are highly experienced at managing undifferentiated conditions. These conditions challenge diagnostic skills and clinical decision making processes, which aim to discover serious illness at an appropriately early stage while minimising over-investigation of patients.3 The expertise in dealing with undifferentiated conditions places general practitioners in an ideal situation to educate and train other clinicians in this skill area, especially patient safety and situations of missed diagnoses. Important differences exist between primary care and secondary/tertiary care medicine, with distinct differences between the patients, pathologies and presentations encountered by the GP compared to a specialist colleague. Conditions seen in general practice are often evolving, and text book descriptions and classifications often do not apply. Early presentations of many illnesses defy categorisation because they may be transient and self limiting, or are treated early, before reaching the stage of traditional diagnosis. General practitioners may also have a different focus from specialists, with a management plan often having to be formulated without a precise diagnosis. A diagnosis may be framed in terms of dichotomous decisions: treatment versus nontreatment, referral versus nonreferral, and serious versus nonserious. For example, back pain may be successfully treated empirically in the absence of 'red flags', without an expectation of ever investigating further or confirming a diagnosis. 2 The range of common undifferentiated conditions in general practice is large and includes such presentations as fatigue, insomnia, stress, dizziness, headache, anorexia, nausea, sexual difficulty, weight loss, apathy and abdominal discomfort. 4 Understanding the role of the passage of time and knowledge of the natural history of these conditions are key in managing undifferentiated conditions. 3 Undifferentiated conditions are commonly associated with clinical uncertainty and ambiguity, which presents management challenges for the clinician, including how to communicate these uncertainties to patients. 2,5 The role of uncertainty in clinical outcomes is not clear. Uncertainty in clinical decision making has been linked to potential and actual adverse outcomes in patient care in the prevocational setting. 6 While one study of uncertainty in primary care physicians did not demonstrate differences in patient outcomes, physicians changed their approaches to information seeking. 7 Clinical strategies for managing undifferentiated conditions need to adopt a 'fail-safe' strategy,8 including regular review of the presentation, and recognising that some symptoms and presentations may never be attributed to specific conditions. The potential for diagnostic uncertainty is compounded by somatisation, when psychological conditions present as physical symptoms. Clinicians need to remain alert to this potential and develop clear strategies for delineating physical and psychological components of the presenting conditions. Effective and appropriate management of somatisation may also require a multidisciplinary approach and professional support to ensure that diagnoses are not being missed. 9,10 Being clear about decisions and referring to evidence during the history taking, examination RACGP curriculum statement Undifferentiated conditions | 427and investigations help maximise diagnostic effectiveness and patient safety and minimise over- investigation. This includes familiarity with serious conditions that must not be missed, conditions commonly missed and conditions that may present with unusual or elusive symptoms. Evidence based approaches to assessment and management 10 can help to clarify and strengthen decision making. Develop familiarity with the disease patterns specific to the geographical areas of practice may help discern local variations in disease presentations and diagnoses compared with other regions. For example, higher than average presentations of hay fever in spring may be due to local pollen conditions. Communication skills are critical to characterising undifferentiated conditions and to communicating management outcomes to patients. Patients with limited capacity to give complete histories, for example, children, patients with dementia or some patients with disabilities, may need family, friends and carers to be consulted for further clarification. Clinicians need to observe confidentiality and the legal status of carers or guardians, and the potential for carers or guardians to abuse or misuse of the position by deliberately providing incorrect and misleading information concerning the patient. Uncertainty can be a source of considerable anxiety for patients, and learning to manage this is a key general practice skill. Communication skills are the key to successful outcomes in managing undifferentiated conditions of a psychogenic origin.

This information can include individual items such as referrals, test results, discharge summaries, vaccination history, medication history and diagnoses'. 3 E-health encompasses products, systems and services including tools for supporting healthcare. These tools are used by: health professionals health authorities patients the wider general community. 'E-health systems that securely and efficiently exchange data can significantly improve how clinical and administrative information is communicated between healthcare providers. As a result, e-health systems have the potential to unlock substantially greater quality, safety and efficiency benefits. E-health has the capacity to benefit all Australians - individual consumers, healthcare providers and organisations'. 3 The scope of e-health includes desktop to bedside and population health activities. These present complex information management challenges in supporting individualised patient care and present challenges for GPs in both clinical practice and practice administration. 'Telehealth' relates to the direct (eg. video conferencing) or indirect (eg. website delivery) delivery of health information or healthcare to a recipient. Telehealth essentially means 'healing at a distance' and involves both the electronic transmission and storage of health information/images in the delivery of both clinical and nonclinical health services utilising a range of telecommunications technologies. 4,5 This curriculum statement was formerly known as 'Health informatics', which refers to the interdisciplinary field that deals with the collection, storage, retrieval, communication and optimal use of health related data, information and knowledge using information science for the purposes of problem solving, decision making and assuring high quality healthcare in biomedical sciences. 6442 | RACGP curriculum statement E-healthCurriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the e-health curriculum applies to general practice: Barry, 42 years of age, injured his knee while yarding cattle. Determined to complete the job while he had the help of his neighbour, he used fencing wire and a post to make a splint to support his leg. His knee is grossly swollen by the time he presents for review, hours after the injury. Your small hospital has a digital X-ray machine and you access real-time reporting in consultation with a specialist at the base hospital. Together you make a diagnosis of complicated fracture of the tibial plateau. Barry is transferred to the base hospital for surgery. The surgeon accesses the electronic films and books the theatre. Before discharge, the orthopaedic team arrange a video consultation with you - the treating GP - and the local physiotherapist, to outline what will be needed to aid Barry's recovery and what outcome milestones are anticipated. Each fortnight the two teams meet with Barry and demonstrate, on camera, his slow progress in regaining mobility. Although Barry is frustrated at not being fit enough to yard cattle, he has already returned to driving a tractor on the farm. Barry's son tells you that Barry has taken over a large part of the family finances, which has enabled Barry's wife to take on a greater role on the farm. This has helped the family to meet production targets, which would have not been possible if the family had to travel to the city for Barry's many medical appointments.RACGP curriculum statement E-health | 443Rationale and general practice context The rise in computerisation of Australian general practice for patient and data records has changed the way in which practices operate, as well as the dynamics of the patient-doctor relationship. In 2009-2010, almost two-thirds (64%) of GPs reported using electronic records exclusively, 85% producing prescriptions electronically and 72% receiving pathology results on line.7 E-health is seen to be increasingly important in ensuring system efficiencies and improving quality of patient care,1 and the rise in computer use in general practice has been described as responsible for creating the largest electronic database of clinical information in the country.3 The introduction of new technologies into general practice presents challenges for GPs. Future developments in the areas of a national health record system, e-billing and telehealth will need to be monitored by GPs and practice teams. The use of information management can assist GPs to keep up-to-date with clinical advances through guidelines, summary services (eg. clinical evidence) and decision support. General practitioners must be mindful of the potential risks of information management, including security and privacy issues, and need to be familiar with computer security guidelines. 7-10 Effective use of medical records data can assist GPs to better understand their practice's patient base, facilitating the provision of services and deriving business benefits. Patients are referring to the internet for information and younger users are using web based technologies for routine day-to-day communication. The increasing use of social media requires general practice to be aware of the changing implications and standards of using such technologies. 15 Related curriculum areas E-health impacts on many areas of general practice, but in particular, refer also to the curriculum statements: Chronic conditions Population health and public health Practice management.444 | RACGP curriculum statement E-healthTraining outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1.

As patient needs may change with time, the composition of the team may also change to meet these needs.1 A strong culture of multidisciplinary care is seen as critical to improving the primary healthcare of Australia.2 Curriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the multidisciplinary care curriculum applies to general practice: Mick, 37 years of age, is an Aboriginal man who was diagnosed with diabetes at age 16 years. His urinalysis reveals 3+ proteinuria, his vision is poor and he has peripheral neuropathy along with an ulcerated rash of his lower legs. Morbidly obese, his sugar levels have seldom been recorded at less than 30 and yet he has refused all treatment on the basis that, 'Diabetes means I'm going to die anyway so what's the point?' He presents following the death of his sister, who had been on dialysis for several years for diabetic nephropathy. As he is now the carer for his nephew he is motivated to take more care of his health and wants your assistance.454 | RACGP curriculum statement Multidisciplinary careRationale and general practice context While multidisciplinary care provides a more diverse range of skills and experience than a single health professional does, co-ordination and continuity of care, and clinical team leadership is a primary function of the general practitioner,1,3 even though primary care participation in multidisciplinary teams may be initiated outside the general practice setting.1 Successful multidisciplinary care requires GPs to be able to build continuous, close and respectful therapeutic relationships with patients to deliver accessible, integrated patient care. This involves leading, supporting and co-ordinating flexibly configured clinical teams and engaging with diverse specialists and other sector services according to individual patient or family needs. In addition, the GP is increasingly the custodian of, and conduit for, key patient clinical information.3 While multidisciplinary teams enable a more comprehensive approach to meeting the comprehensive needs of individual patients, GPs still need to be able to provide day-to-day care of episodic and chronic conditions.1 The role of the general practitioner in multidisciplinary care The rise of care planning in many areas of chronic disease has resulted in an increasing role of GPs in multidisciplinary care.4 Team based care in primary care clinical areas such as diabetes, aged care, mental health and disability have led to the emergence of systematic approaches of team based care, both within and outside of practices1 as reflected in the role of co-ordinated and comprehensive care in the recently revised RACGP definition of general practice: 'General practice provides person centred, continuing, comprehensive and co-ordinated wholeperson healthcare to individuals and families in their communities'.3 General practitioners need to operate within teams across diverse clinical settings such as between primary healthcare services and hospital based and or practice based clinicians to provide comprehensive team based care. This implies differences in governance structure and funding models. However, GPs have a gatekeeping role within the multidisciplinary care team. Key GP skills for working within multidisciplinary settings include: identifying multidisciplinary team members and how they function especially when working with complex health needs and differing environments clear communication and interaction between team members mutual respect, trust and inclusiveness between team members the best use of the skill mix within the team good clinical governance.RACGP curriculum statement Multidisciplinary care | 455General practitioners need to be able to work to overcome common barriers to multidisciplinary care such as:8 time constraints lack of systems that promote teamwork including financing and infrastructure fragmentation due to a predominantly part time workforce lack of understanding about how teams function professional issues such as individual accountability General practice needs to be well organised to implement effective team based management of chronic disease9 requiring clinical leadership on the part of the GP .8 Related curriculum areas Refer also to the curriculum statements: Aged care Chronic conditions Disability E-health Mental health Population health and public health Practice management Teaching, mentoring and leadership in general practice.456 | RACGP curriculum statement Multidisciplinary careTraining outcomes of the five domains of general practice 1.

Integrative medicine, like general practice, embraces and encourages a holistic approach to practice that incorporates patient involvement in self healthcare, prevention and lifestyle interventions. Integrative medicine encompasses more than complementary medicine, although this integration is an important and obvious aspect of integrative medicine. Integrative medicine also describes a style of clinical practice and is best defined as 'the practice of medicine that reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare professionals, and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing'. 1 For the purposes of the RACGP curriculum, complementary medicine will refer to evidence based therapies and medicines that are not conventionally used by doctors, but may complement medical management and be successfully integrated into it - whether the therapy is delivered by a doctor or a suitably trained complementary medicine practitioner. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine classifies complementary and alternative therapies, regardless of any supporting evidence base, into five categories or domains. 2 Alternative medical systems Alternative medical systems are built on complete systems of theory and practice. Examples of alternative medical systems that have developed in Western cultures include homeopathic medicine and naturopathic medicine. Examples of systems that have developed in non-Western cultures include traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and Ayurveda. Mind-body interventions Mind-body medicine uses a range of techniques designed to enhance the mind's capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms. Some techniques, which were considered complementary and alternative therapies in the past, have become mainstream (eg. patient support groups and cognitive behavioural therapy). Other mind-body techniques are still considered complementary and alternative therapies. These include meditation, prayer, mental healing, and therapies that use creative outlets such as art, music or dance. Biologically based therapies Biologically based therapies in complementary and alternative therapies use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, and vitamins. Some examples include dietary supplements and herbal products. Some uses of dietary supplements have been incorporated into conventional medicine, for example, folic acid for prevention of neural tube defects and cholecalciferol when serum vitamin D levels are below normal for the prevention of osteoporosis. Manipulative and body based methods Manipulative and body based methods in complementary and alternative therapies are based on manipulation and/or movement of one or more parts of the body. Some examples include chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation and massage. 470 | RACGP curriculum statement Integrative medicineEnergy therapies Energy therapies involve the use of energy fields. They are of two types. Biofield therapies involve the existence of energy fields that have not been scientifically proven. Some forms of energy therapy manipulate biofields by applying pressure and/or manipulating the body by placing the hands in, or through, these fields. Examples include qi gong, Reiki and therapeutic touch. Bioelectromagnetic based therapies involve the unconventional use of electromagnetic fields such as pulsed fields, magnetic fields, or alternating current or direct current fields. Due to the changing nature of evidence and clinical practice there is a grey area about whether some particular therapies are classified as complementary or conventional. Curriculum in practice Typical presentations that illustrate how the Integrative medicine curriculum applies to general practice include: Malcolm, 38 years of age, is a financial controller who presents with problems sleeping. He says he is often tired and, after extensive investigations, you come to the conclusion that there are no serious illnesses contributing to his tiredness. He is now requesting assistance with sleeping, but he says that he doesn't want to take any pills. What approaches can you take? Helen, 52 years of age, is an active woman who presents to her general practitioner. For the past 3 months she has been experiencing mild, but frequent hot flushes and night sweats with associated sleep disturbance. Her last period was 13 months ago. She has been previously well and is taking no medications. She is keen to explore 'natural' management of her menopausal symptoms. What do you advise? Brenda, 28 years of age, is a bank officer. She has been taking warfarin and has a past history of valvular disease. She presents for a routine INR check. She says she is thinking of taking some 'natural supplements', and asks if any of them would interfere with her warfarin.RACGP curriculum statement Integrative medicine | 471Rationale and general practice context A significant driver for integrative medicine has been the rising community interest in complementary medicine. General practitioners need to be familiar with a number of areas within integrative medicine. This may be because the doctor: would like to take an integrative medicine approach to their medical practice needs to be able to discuss integrative medicine or complementary medicine with their patients, including finding out current patterns of integrative medicine use, if any may need to know where to find quality information to answer clinical questions. Nearly two-thirds of the community have used some form of complementary medicine and many do not disclose this to their doctor. Research has demonstrated as high as 57% of people taking complementary medicines do not tell their doctor and about 50% used conventional medicines on the same day. 3 These potentially unsafe situations needs to be addressed.2,4 Patients with chronic diseases are increasingly looking for healthcare outside conventional health systems. Some doctors may not be confident in dealing with complementary medicine-related issues and may have limited awareness of the evidence base and potential safety issues associated with use. Consequently, they fail to ask patients about use of complementary medicines. Nevertheless, an increasing number of doctors are using complementary medicine or referring patients for complementary medicine. 5 Australian general practitioners report6,7 high levels of interest in learning about complementary medicine and the evidence base for these therapies. Over 30% of Australian GPs in a national survey identified themselves as practising integrative medicine and the majority of doctors (>80%) surveyed requested more education and research in complementary medicine. 4 There is a higher acceptance of complementary medicines in other parts of the world than in Australia. For example, 64% of medical courses in the United States have content on complementary medicine. 8,9 Patients not satisfied with conventional medicine10 often self prescribe complementary medicines without professional supervision emphasising the need for GPs who use integrative medical approaches. General practitioners who want to pursue more detailed study in integrative medicine need to be familiar with the range, quality and standards, as well as education in this area. Integrative medicine in general practice General practitioners are ideally placed to assist patients with integrative medicine due to their broad-based scientific and generalist training and their regular contact with the community. Comprehensive integrative medicine training aims to: provide a greater range of therapeutic options to patients help patients make safe and balanced decisions regarding complementary medicine use avoid potentially harmful interactions between complementary and conventional therapies. 472 | RACGP curriculum statement Integrative medicineIntegrative medicine does not reject or compete with conventional healthcare and overlaps significantly with what is currently widely accepted as quality general practice. Integrative medicine seeks to broaden conventional healthcare by emphasising principles that some doctors and patients believe are undervalued in conventional medical practice. Integrative medicine emphasises a number of issues including: a focus on wellness and illness prevention being holistic in nature by focusing on physical, psychological, spiritual, social and lifestyle issues incorporating evidence based, safe and ethical complementary therapies individualising the approach to any particular patient or clinical situation using the best of all available modalities in conjunction with informed patient choice integrating all of the above into conventional medical care acknowledging that advances in healthcare will be dependent on scientific advances, improvements in healthcare delivery systems, cultural change as well as practitioner and patient education. A comprehensive approach to integrative medicine involves more than adding a little complementary knowledge to the 'kit bag' of the GP . Integrative medicine incorporates a philosophy of healthcare, as well as a way of practising. Prevention, holism and informed patient choice are obviously integral to the whole of general practice, and therefore the complementary aspects are often given the most attention when considering what integrative medicine is. For this reason, integrative medicine training is not seen as a separate or stand alone aspect of general practice training. Some aspects of integrative medicine may be taught as stand alone modules, or in integrative medicine seminars and case discussions, but are best understood and applied when integrated appropriately into other aspects of general practice training. For example, when a doctor is learning about the management of depression or cardiovascular disease, training and case studies should integrate important principles of integrative medicine.

An acceptable minimum level refers to the level of risk that is generally acceptable given the level of current knowledge, available resources and the context in which care is delivered weighed against the risk of having or not having treatment. Systemic errors are based on the concept that although individuals make errors, characteristics of the systems within which they work can make errors more likely. Error inquiry in patient safety then focuses on circumstances rather than on operator characteristics. More errors are likely to be eliminated by focusing on systems than on individuals. 2 Quality and safety initiatives in general practice often involve quite complex terminology and consistent use of language is required to enable constructive approaches to gaining skills in this area. This curriculum uses patient safety terms and language consistent with the World Health Organization and the taxonomy of the World Alliance for Patient Safety, 2 the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and the RACGP Standards for general practices.4 Curriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the quality and safety curriculum applies to general practice: Linda, 32 years of age, had a skin lesion removed from her back 6 months ago by a locum GP . She who now presents for a repeat prescription of the oral contraceptive pill. You notice that she has not been back since removal of the lesion. She explains that she had to urgently visit a family member interstate a few days after the lesion was removed, but that she has been well. You notice that the histology of the lesion was a malignant melanoma and realise that Linda has not received this result.484 | RACGP curriculum statement Quality and safetyRationale and general practice context Quality improvement in general practice Quality improvement is an essential general practice activity that involves examining practice structures, systems and clinical care. Improvement needs to be based on evidence produced by the practice's own data. This data can be gathered from patient or staff feedback, an audit of clinical databases or the analysis of near misses and mistakes. 2 The challenge of quality in general practice is demonstrated by the gap between what is known to be best practice care and the delivery of care (outside of patient factors and healthcare costs).3 Quality improvement focuses on the growing body of knowledge relating to effective quality improvement strategies within the general practice setting, 3 as detailed in the RACGP Quality Framework for Australian General Practice.3 The quality framework aims to improve quality in Australian general practice by incorporating the four levels of the general practice system of care: the individual general practitioner at the consultation level the setting of this care the regional level the national level. The framework is then divided into the six main areas that influence quality in general practice: capacity competence finance knowledge and information management patient focus professionalism. This framework provides a regulatory setting for quality improvement in general practice. Quality improvement processes are an increasingly important aspect of practice management processes and GPs need to be familiar with the key principles of quality improvement and its implementation. 3 Patient safety Although patient safety is only one aspect of quality improvement for general practice, it has been identified as an emerging core competency for GPs. 5 Patient safety incorporates all the elements that can contribute to an adverse event during the provision of healthcare. Safety covers events ranging from harm caused as a result of a wrong clinical procedure or decision, to the adverse effects of drugs, hazards posed by medical devices, substandard products, human shortcomings or system errors. These events may occur in hospital settings, primary healthcare clinics, nursing homes, pharmacies, patients' homes and in clinical trials.6 General practice can involve many invasive procedures, from seemingly simple actions such as immunisation to more complex tasks such as major skin flap surgery. Many of these activities can be subject to error which can result in patient harm. Because of this, there is a range of patient safety knowledge and skills across many general practice activities and contexts, such as the ability to identify causes of lapses in safety and processes for ensuring the correct procedure is done at the correct site on the correct patient. 7 Patient safety is achieved primarily through the development and implementation of strategies that reduce the risk of events that could cause harm to patients. Practices need to engage in quality RACGP curriculum statement Quality and safety | 485improvement activities to improve quality and safety for patients in areas such as practice structures, systems and clinical care.2 Collecting, classifying and aggregating data and information about these events, particularly with regard to preventive, mitigating and recovery strategies, is a central part of the process of improving patient quality and safety. Classification of patient safety data requires universal agreement and understanding of key terms and concepts as well as a standardised method for examining data. 2 Although by international standards the quality of Australian general practice is generally high, the risk of harm to patients, health workers, general practice organisations and their patient communities are always present. Research into the frequency and nature of error in primary healthcare has produced mixed findings. 8 This may be due to the different methods of collecting data about adverse events leading to differences in reported rates.9 However, incident monitoring techniques can be successfully applied to Australian general practice. These techniques could facilitate the identification of factors that contribute to adverse events, and facilitate development of preventive interventions. 10 Factors that influence safety and quality in general practice can be seen as a combination of personal, contextual and task-dependent factors, 11 suggesting the need for GPs to assess the risk attributed to clinicians, systems and patients.12 Although patients are usually seen as passive (ie. as the victims of error), there is considerable scope for them to play an active role in ensuring that their healthcare is appropriate, thereby preventing mistakes 13 and providing feedback to practice systems to improve general practice quality.4 Effective communication The importance of effective and open communication is a common theme in research about patient safety. Communication errors are reported to be the leading causes of patient harm. Communication occurs at a number of levels and can be verbal or written. The presence of effective communication tools such as briefings, handover, good record keeping, patient information materials and checklists and behaviours such as clinician assertiveness can reduce the rate of harm. 14 Poor communication after an adverse event (not just the original injury), can determine the decision to take legal action. Concern about the standards of care, the need for an explanation, compensation and the belief that staff and organisations should be accountable, are emerging as reasons for litigation. 15 The systems approach to quality and safety Research suggests that adverse events related to medicines are common in primary healthcare,16 that medication errors are widely distributed among doctors and that a reduction in medication errors requires a systems approach.17 Although there is a tendency for healthcare team members to define error as a breach of standards by an individual, 18 a systems approach that identifies contributing factors in the environment and builds defences against potential harm, regardless of the cause, is more appropriate. This approach takes a complementary role to competence in the individual. 19 Members of high performing teams generally have a clear understanding of their roles, and the demands on other team members, and work within a climate of openness and trust where team leaders are receptive to alternate views. 20 Risk management in the healthcare system involves all levels of an organisation and is concerned with the creation and maintenance of safe systems of care. 21 Systems utilised by the primary healthcare provider will vary, but may include tools such as monitoring and reporting, practice system audits, recall systems, incident logging and relevant continuous professional development activities. 7 Promoting a culture of safety and quality in healthcare settings is one of the pillars of the safety and quality movement. A patient safety culture recognises the inevitability of error and actively seeks to create safeguards for patients. 22 Quality improvement requires a collaborative effort of all general practice staff, and staff need to feel 486 | RACGP curriculum statement Quality and safetyempowered to contribute to quality and safety.4 Consistent use of risk management systems helps reduce clinical risk and ensures that practice errors are identified and processes improved to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. The journey of general practice can mean that as workplace situations and patient populations change, some knowledge and skills are enhanced, while other areas are diminished. This emphasises the role for ongoing vigilance of self and others in relation to competence, performance and maintaining the ability to refer appropriately. Advances in the 'science' of general practice, such as new medicines, new technology and improved evidence about efficacy and effectiveness, also mean that the risks to patients change. Therefore, key workplace attitudes that foster general practice patient safety promote: a just, supportive and transparent culture skills and knowledge in error awareness a systems approach. Clinical governance and clinical leadership Clinical governance and clinical leadership, as described in the Practice management curriculum statement, are central to reform in the areas of quality and safety.4 Refer to this statement when undertaking education in quality and safety.

The management of a medical practice requires understanding of the needs of the health professionals, patients, nonmedical staff and the community.1,2 Management processes involve planning, finance, technology application, information and, most importantly, people.2 Curriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the practice management curriculum applies to general practice: Jackie is a talented and enthusiastic GP who moved to a small town over a year ago. She quickly developed a busy practice and now finds she works longer hours than she would like. Her appointments are booked out 3 weeks in advance so people who are acutely unwell must be fitted in on top of an already heavy schedule. Consequently, Jackie regularly misses lunch and does not arrive home until after dark, by which time she feels too tired to walk her dog. Jackie works as a solo GP because she did not feel comfortable joining the other practice in town that has two older doctors, which meant she would be on call every night. She has a high number of pensioners whom she bulkbills. She knows she should be doing more care plans and health promotion work but doesn't have the time. She doesn't employ a nurse, but does have a great practice manager who also works at the front desk as a receptionist. Jackie needs a holiday, but can't afford to pay a locum as her cost structures and overheads are 80% of her income. She is feeling that it is getting too difficult to stay in the town.500 | RACGP curriculum statement Practice managementRationale and general practice context The effective delivery of healthcare to patients and the community depends on efficient practice management systems that address the needs of patients, the community and health professionals in a balanced, responsive and cost effective way. GPs as managers Involvement in management is not confined to practice owners and practice managers, but also requires the participation of all persons in the practice. General practitioners, as health professionals, need to learn and apply management knowledge and skills to ensure the best outcomes for their patients and themselves. This role of GPs as managers is becoming an increasingly important part of general practice training in relation to practice management and health needs of the community due to: the increasing move toward more multidisciplinary team community based care workforce shortages evolving funding arrangements of healthcare evolving health information management in the context of rapidly expanding e-health processes the application and accreditation of quality management principles, evidence based management and risk management to all areas of practice management. Organisational skills are the foundation of good practice management. While management skills have traditionally not taken a high role in medical education, they are essential to ensuring the viability of high quality general practice services and, therefore, the cornerstone of the Australian health system. While many individual issues require attention for effective practice management, they can be grouped into areas of financial management, working with people, managing facilities, practice quality and safety and information management. Practice management provides the medium for clinical practice and is a significant determinant in successful health outcomes. The application of practice management occurs across the five domains of general practice, and is critical in the working life of the GP and needs to be sensitive to the context of general practice. Wherever a clinical activity occurs there is a management activity occurring in tandem. For example, performing a Pap test requires a range of management activities including the provision of facilities and equipment, couriers for slides, information management, recall systems and staff. General practitioners need to effectively manage their professional role as a medical practitioner and organisational role as a member of a general practice, regardless of whether they have an ownership or an employee role. General practitioners are increasingly working as part of a multidisciplinary general practice team, presenting new challenges to practice management. Human resource management will become more complex including processes associated with recruitment and ongoing staff management. General practitioners practice in a range of clinical situations and the management processes involved will vary according to the setting. To enable all doctors to fulfil their clinical role, knowledge of management is needed. Further understanding is required for GPs who are running their own practice compared to being an employee GP . RACGP curriculum statement Practice management | 501Clinical governance and GPs as clinical leaders Health reforms in quality and safety mean there is an increasing role in clinical governance. The RACGP has defined this as a framework for clinicians and health service managers to be jointly accountable for patient safety and quality care. 1 Clinical leaders are appointed within a practice to help implement clinical governance through their role of: being responsible for safety and quality improvement systems within the practice ensuring accountability of all staff involved in monitoring and improving care and services developing a problem solving multidisciplinary team systemic approach that promotes a climate of safety and quality. The skills required for GPs to be clinical leaders include ongoing education, the use of clinical audits, implementing clinical effectiveness, managing risk, research and development, and promoting openness of management. 1 Clinical leaders need to understand their roles and responsibilities1 as part of their practice management training.

A procedure is a manual intervention that aims to produce a specific outcome during the course of patient care; it may be investigational, diagnostic, and/or therapeutic, and is usually able to be performed in the ambulatory primary healthcare setting thus excluding: manual skills which are part of routine clinical examination purely interpretive skills complex surgical procedures that require a general anaesthetic. Inherent in the term of medical procedure is the concept of invasiveness. This may involve discomfort for the patient and a risk of adverse effects and complications associated with the procedure in addition to those associated with the medical condition which initially necessitated the procedure. This aspect of invasiveness is not absolute, as some procedures are more invasive than others, for example, venepuncture compared with urinalysis. Procedures may require the use of equipment which, in turn, implies the need for appropriately equipped and resourced facilities with quality control processes in place for the successful completion of the procedure. Procedural skills requirements vary according to the context in which procedures are performed and according to the level of complexity of the required procedure. For example, general practitioners in rural and remote communities may be required to provide treatment such as emergency medicine procedures, 1 which entail a level of complexity different to that of their urban counterparts. The term advanced rural level skills has been developed to describe these requirements which include: major general surgery obstetrics (including management of the delivery, surgical or non surgical) anaesthesia (including general anaesthesia) orthopaedic surgery (including the management of dislocations and fractures requiring major regional or general anaesthesia) radiology (including personally performed X-rays, ultrasounds and/or echocardiograms with interpretation of results, not confined to limb X-rays) endoscopy (including colonoscopy or gastroscopy). Procedural skill competency is the type and level of behaviour required in relation to a specific skill to achieve a successful outcome. For example, the skill competency for one procedure (eg. dipstick urinalysis) may include the ability to explain and perform the task appropriately in an unsupervised fashion. Other procedures may require just the skill to be able to explain the procedure's principles to a patient without the necessary skill for the clinician to perform the procedure themselves, for example an abdominal CT scan. Clinicians need to be familiar with the professional, legal and jurisdictional requirements regarding eligibility to perform particular procedures. Procedural competency often involves the acquisition of specific psychomotor skills. Procedural skills training needs to provide the opportunity to perform and perfect the necessary psychomotor skills, taking into account that the acquisition of knowledge and skills takes place at an individual rate.516 | RACGP curriculum statement Procedural skillsCurriculum in practice The following presentations illustrate how the procedural skills curriculum applies to general practice: A 23 year old man presents for removal of genital warts A hearing impaired older person presents for an appointment for the surgical removal of a benign skin lesion Your registrar has read about a new way of establishing an emergency airway in a child and would like to see it demonstrated. How confident are you to arrange a simulation?RACGP curriculum statement Procedural skills | 517Rationale and general practice context Procedural medicine is an integral part of Australian general practice and is becoming more common. During 2008-2009, there were 16.7 procedural events for every 100 general practice encounters. This is a significantly higher number of procedures than the 12.5 procedures per 100 patient encounters in 1999-2000. 2 Patient safety and informed consent For many patients, a successful clinical outcome depends on having a well performed technical procedure. Therefore, technical competence is a key aspect for procedural training.3 The opportunities for learning and successfully performing procedural tasks necessary for unsupervised general practice need to be balanced with concerns of patient safety, which are of the highest priority during any medical procedure. The ability to educate and inform patients of the risks and benefits of each procedure and to ensure that informed consent is obtained is part of procedural skills competency. This includes discussing any discomfort or pain and how these will be managed. Acquiring proficiency in procedural skills requires skills in recognising and managing associated complications. Maximising procedural skill competencies not only helps to minimise any potential harm to patients, but may also help minimise potential medicolegal consequences. Continuing surveillance of reports from medical boards, alerts and bulletins from medical defence organisations and surveillance authorities for trends in procedural risk complications provides an important opportunity to identify and minimise adverse risk associated with medical procedures. Occupational health and safety Education on the potential hazards to the health of the clinician performing the procedure and their assistant(s) is critical for the prevention and management of procedural related harm. Clinicians and workplace managers need to be aware of their roles and responsibilities in maintaining a safe work environment during procedural tasks or procedural complications in accordance with workplace standards; for example, the safe handling of body fluids and substances, or the clinician's responsibilities regarding blood borne virus transmission and the management of needlestick injuries. Clinicians must also recognise that psychomotor impairment or medical conditions may affect the ability to successfully and safely perform technical tasks and must act appropriately in each particular circumstance. This may require limiting participation to those tasks for which they can demonstrate competence. Procedural skills and the general practitioner learning life Over the general practice learning life, varying procedural skill levels may be required. In general, procedural skills acquired as a medical student provide a basis for procedural skill acquisition later in the learning life, although career path changes can result in significant changes in procedural skill requirements and competency levels. General practitioners need to recognise their current procedural skill requirements and ensure that the appropriate skill competency level is maintained. Skill level requirements will often depend upon the clinical context. For example, a prevocational hospital doctor may have acquired specific procedural skills that may not be required when they commence working in an urban general practice. This lack of demand for the use of this skill may result in a diminished skill level. However, should the need arise for this clinician to practise in a remote area, they may need to undertake additional training to acquire appropriate skill competency levels.518 | RACGP curriculum statement Procedural skillsSome general practitioners will develop special interest areas, for example, dermatology or aviation medicine, requiring a different procedural skill set in addition to that of routine general medical practice. Clinicians in these situations need to be clear on their skill requirements and the ongoing requirements for procedural skill maintenance. Procedural skill requirements for the level of final year medical students are set by medical schools and the Australian Medical Council. 4 Procedural skill requirements for prevocational doctors (first and second postgraduate year and later) are set by the Australian Curriculum Framework for Junior Doctors. 5 Procedural skill requirements for general practice registrars for Fellowship are set by The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. General practitioners with a special interest area or undertaking additional procedural skills need to ensure that their skill levels meet the recognised standards/curriculum requirements for procedural skill competency acquisition and maintenance. Examples include: Standards for General Practice Education and Training Requirements for Fellowship items 6 Advanced rural skills training1 Fellowship of Advanced Rural General Practice7 RACGP Joint Consultative Committees8 Other specialist medical colleges Other jurisdictional requirements/standards, eg. the Australian Government requirements for yellow fever vaccination providers9 or RACGP guidelines for Implanon insertion.10 Procedural skills, advanced life support and the RACGP Fellowship Competencies in procedural skills related to emergency life support measures are critical for successful patient management. Advanced life support training is a requirement for Fellowship, and doctors must complete training in the early management of trauma and advanced life support (ALS) during vocational training (see Requirements V.12. and v.13). 6 Teaching of procedural skills Training in technical procedures through parts of a medical practitioner's learning life has been reported as being unsystematic and unstructured.3 This may be because the need for procedures which can then be used to observe, learn, and develop skill levels often arises randomly. Doctors at all levels of their learning lives are often involved in teaching procedural skills to their juniors: the medical student may learn skills from the first year intern or the registrar from the vocational doctor, reflected in the traditional expression, 'See one, do one, teach one'. Teaching can also be an important method of reinforcing learning in the teacher. Clinicians involved in teaching need to assess their teaching processes to ensure that they are teaching technical skills in a systematic manner. Use of simulation based teaching techniques to initially acquire and to practise skills is highly recommended.

This whole-health system view is necessary as general practice patients obtain their medications from a range of sources such as those initiated by themselves, other general practitioners, other medical specialists, pharmacists and complementary therapists. Quality use of medicines is one of the central objectives of Australia's National Medicines Policy and is a key criterion in the RACGP Standards for general practices. 3 Curriculum in practice The following case illustrates how the quality use of medicines curriculum applies to general practice: Roger, 39 years of age, is a builder who attends the practice irregularly, usually if he needs antibiotics for infected wounds such as his presentation today. You notice that he hasn't had a blood pressure check for several years and find it is 150/95 mmHg. He is otherwise well, does not smoke, drinks about 3-4 beers after work with his work mates, and is up-to-date with his vaccinations. Roger's family history is unremarkable; both his parents are alive and well, although his father is on medication for hypertension and high cholesterol. You recheck Roger's blood pressure on subsequent occasions, which remains elevated. All other investigations show no abnormalities. You discuss commencing antihypertensive medications with Roger, but he says that he is a well man and can't see why he should start lifelong medication when he has no symptoms. He starts work early in the morning and often works in high places where postural dizziness would be dangerous. Does he really need medication? If so, what medication would be best? How would you monitor his response?530 | RACGP curriculum statement Quality use of medicinesRationale and general practice context Every year there are more than 115 million general practice encounters in Australia4 and over 200 million prescriptions dispensed by pharmacies each year.5 This represents the equivalent of more than eight prescriptions per Australian per year.5 Medications are recommended or prescribed in 43% of Australian general practice consultations.4 There are also many over-the-counter medications resulting in nearly 70% of all Australians (and nearly 90% of older Australians), taking at least one medication per fortnight. Over 1.5 million Australians suffer an adverse event from medicines each year. This results in at least 400 000 visits to general practitioners and 140 000 hospital admissions.6 General practitioners need the required skills for the quality use of medicines in the practice setting, which include1,7: selecting management options wisely by: -considering the place of medicines in treating illness and maintaining health -recognising that there may be better ways than medicine to manage many disorders choosing suitable medicines, if a medicine is necessary, so that the best available option is selected by taking into account: -the individual and their understanding and expectations of medicines -their clinical condition -their risks and benefits -dosage and length of treatment -any co-existing conditions - such as other medical conditions - and individual factors such as age, pregnancy, impaired liver, kidney or heart function -other therapies especially polypharmacy -monitoring considerations -costs for the individual, the community and the health system. Rational prescribing skills are necessary for choosing the most suitable available medicine and include 7: prescribing within the limitations of the treating doctor's knowledge, skills and experience being clear about the reasons for prescribing and communicating these to the patient including the potential benefits and risks using medicines only when appropriate, with nonmedicinal alternatives considered as needed. This includes medicines which are prescribed, recommended and/or self selected using efficacious medications that aim to achieve the goals of therapy by delivering beneficial changes in actual health outcomes in accordance with accepted prescribing national guidelines where appropriate choosing the most appropriate medicine, taking into account factors such as the clinical condition being treated, the potential benefits and risks of treatment, dosage, length of treatment and cost taking into account the patient's ideas, concerns and expectations safety considerations (see 'using medicines safely and effectively'). General practitioners must have the knowledge and skills to use medicines to their best effect and must also have access to current and accurate information, electronic supports and education. This includes resources such as the Australian Medicines Handbook, Therapeutic Guidelines, Australian Prescriber, adverse drug reports and bulletins and the National Prescribing Service. General practitioners also have an ethical and professional obligation to manage the potential risk of other influences on the prescribing relationship such as from industry sources, advertising and the media. 8RACGP curriculum statement Quality use of medicines | 531Using medicines safely and effectively Using medicines safely and effectively in general practice is achieved by: writing or printing unambiguous legal prescriptions using the correct documentation monitoring outcomes including benefits and adverse events minimising misuse, over-use and under-use improving a patient's ability to solve problems related to medication, such as negative effects or managing multiple medications. Medication error in the community is a complex issue with no single factor being responsible. Minimising the risk of medications errors involves doctors, patients, the practice and broader system based approaches to promote patient safety. Quality use of medication education needs to address these broad aspects of medication safety. Medication errors are estimated to affect around 10% of general practice patients and up to 25% of high risk patients who report medicine adverse events. 9 The groups at highest risk are the elderly, those taking multiple medications and those taking high risk medications. Cardiovascular drugs, antithrombotic agents, analgesics, antibiotics, oral antidiabetic agents, antidepressants, anti-epileptic drugs and chemotherapeutic agents are the medications associated with the highest risk of adverse events in the adult population. In the paediatric population, respiratory drugs, antibiotics, antihistamines and analgesics are most commonly associated with adverse events. Antimicrobial resistance The rise of community acquired antibiotic resistance requires judicious prescribing on the part of GPs to slow down the emergence of antibiotic resistance.10 Key principles that GPs need to include: being aware of best practice antibiotic prescribing for each disease through the use of current guidelines evaluating antibiotic use within the practice (eg. through clinical audits) applying consistent prescribing practices educating patients about the best and appropriate use of antibiotics. 10 Issues of antimicrobial resistance go beyond antibiotics and can also be a problem for some viral,11,12 fungal and parasitic diseases.13 Managing adverse medication events General practitioners need to know how to manage medication adverse events including within the practice setting, and reporting adverse medicine reactions to the appropriate authorities. The role of communication in quality use of medicines As in all areas of general practice, effective and open communication with patients, members of the general practice team and the broader health sector are critical for achieving quality use of medicines. General practitioners need to clearly communicate why a medicine is, or is not, required and provide clear advice when recommending medicines to help minimise risks and maximise medicine safety. This includes addressing the patient's understanding of their management and identifying any barriers to effective communication such as cultural and linguistic diversity, disability and health literacy problems. This enables the doctor and the patient to arrive at a satisfactory mutually negotiated management outcome. Open communication is also required to identify other medications that the patient may be taking that were not initiated by the GP , including over-the-counter medications and complementary therapies.532 | RACGP curriculum statement Quality use of medicinesFor example, almost two-thirds of the community have used some form of complementary medicine and many do not disclose this to their doctor. Research shows that more than half of people taking complementary medicines do not tell their doctor and about 50% used conventional medicines on the same day. 14 This is a potentially unsafe use of medicine.15,16 For more information see the curriculum statement Integrative medicine. As highlighted in the Quality and Safety curriculum statement, communication errors are reported to be the leading causes of patient harm and this applies to quality use of medicines. Poor communication is the most commonly reported contributing factor in medication errors between patients and health professionals, GPs and pharmacists and health professionals at the transfer-of-care. Poor communication after an adverse event can determine the decision to take legal action. 17 Medication errors involving GPs currently account for about 8% of medical negligence claims.18 Errors have been shown to occur during all stages of the medication process including prescribing, supply, administration, monitoring and documentation. However, the highest risk of error is during transfer of care, with Australian and overseas studies finding that 52% to 88% of transfer documents contain an error. 9 Rates of prescribing errors were found to be as high as 32 errors per 100 prescriptions in overseas studies and up to 115 errors per 100 high risk patients in Australian studies.9 A prescription is essentially a type of handover document that needs to be unambiguously and legally written or printed using the correct documentation. Good patient handover skills are important to promote quality use of medicines for GPs and are covered in the Quality and safety curriculum statement. General practices need to be able to use communication tools such as briefings, clear handover procedures, good record keeping, electronic prescribing tools, patient information materials and checklists to improve quality use of medicines and reduce the rate of patient harm. 19 Systems to minimise medication errors therefore have the potential to significantly reduce patient harm in the general practice setting. Health promotion and quality use of medicines General practitioners can promote the quality use of medicines in the community through good treatment choices with patients. For example, this could be taking the time to explain that antibiotics are unnecessary in an upper respiratory tract infection, or the use of lifestyle measures instead of medication. Multidisciplinary care and quality use of medicines. Communication also needs to be clear with members of the practice team and the broader health sector to ensure continuity of patient care, especially regarding ensuring that any changes to medicines are carefully documented and communicated. Practice based systems and quality improvement Teamwork and practice systems are critical aspect of quality use of medicines. Accurate record keeping to ensure that all health providers are aware of a patient's current medicine use and ensuring that patient safety information is detected, recorded and shared such as allergies and drug reactions. Practice based systems are also becoming increasingly important as an aspect of quality improvement, using tools such as clinical audits to help improve patient outcomes. These tools have been demonstrated to be effective in improving care including the quality use of medicines. For more information see curriculum statement Quality and safety.RACGP curriculum statement Quality use of medicines | 533Cost effective prescribing While the first and overriding consideration of prescribing medications is evidence based, a responsible prescriber will also consider cost effectiveness. While there are a range of schemes to subsidise the cost of medication for an individual, noncompliance due to affordability remains an additional source of concern for quality use of medications. Although subsidies exist to improve medication affordability, 13.4% of Australians report not having a prescription filled due to cost in the preceding 12 months. 20 This indicates the impact that cost has on treatment adherence and patient safety. In the context of an aging population, cost effective prescribing is also a consideration in minimising the subsidised medication costs to the Australian community.

The Hippocratic Oath refers to the importance of teaching and mentoring.1 Even the origins of the word 'doctor' come from the Old French for 'teacher', based on the Latin 'docere' (Oxford English Dictionary). General practitioners possess many teaching skills that are often not recognised. All GPs educate their patients, and these teaching skills can be transferred to teaching medical students, general practice registrars, peers and health professionals. The skills for teaching can be acquired throughout the professional life, beginning in medical school. Related to mentoring and teaching is leadership, which is being increasingly identified as a key skill vital to the success of healthcare, including general practice. 2 Leadership involves setting a vision for people, and inspiring and setting organisational values and strategic direction.3 Leadership is different from management, which involves directing people and resources to achieve organisational goals set in place by leaders. 3 While distinct, both leadership and management are critical to achieving organisational success.3 Curriculum in practice The following scenarios illustrate how the teaching, mentoring and leadership curriculum applies to the general practice setting: Chris had believed the practice was too busy to become involved in teaching, until he was presented with a model that used vertical integration of curriculum between their registrar and a student who would be attached to the practice for 2 days a week for 12 months. The student was pre-trained in the use of medical software and presented cases through parallel consulting. This enabled the practice to maintain full clinical loads while still meeting the education and supervision needs of their trainees. The teaching is shared with an adjacent practice for some group sessions, which have enhanced overall collegiate relationships. Four years after arranging a practice swap, two doctors remain in a mentoring relationship separated by over 500 km. The experience has enabled a younger solo GP to remain in her small country town and to make changes that enable more sustainable practice. She has gone on to become a general practice supervisor and to mentor, in turn, a solo doctor in a more remote setting. The registrar in your practice is about to attend a clinical leadership event and wants to know your views on how leadership differs from management. Do you think there is also a difference between leadership in the hospital sector and in general practice? If so, why? Do you think that leadership is a skill that can be taught?552 | RACGP curriculum statement Teaching, mentoring and leadership in general practiceRationale and general practice context Professional codes of ethics highlight the professional obligation and tradition of passing on knowledge and skills to colleagues and students, for example, 'Honour your obligation to pass on your professional knowledge and skills to colleagues and students'. 1 Teaching, mentoring and leadership roles are becoming a more common part of the everyday life of a general practice in the following ways: universities are directing learning away from the more traditional wards and lecture theatres of metropolitan tertiary hospitals, toward more community based settings, including general practices the advent of university departments of rural health and rural clinical schools in the early 21st century has seen much medical undergraduate education moved out of metropolitan centres to rural centres general practice vocational training has become regionalised, requiring an increasing number of teaching practices and supervisors, trainers and mentors in regional and rural Australia the general practice infrastructure of divisions of general practice has mainstreamed local delivery of continuing professional development the decentralisation of general practice education and the rise in numbers of general practice Fellows has resulted in general practice teaching and mentoring becoming a significant career path for any GP , as either a supervisor or a medical educator the increasing complexity of primary healthcare, the rise of quality improvement and innovation, and the move toward multidisciplinary approaches to patient care require increasing levels of leadership skills at all levels of the general practice learning life. Educational and leadership skills of GPs General practitioners need to develop educational and leadership skills as an integral part of their professional repertoire. The skill sets detailed in this curriculum overlap and are required by all doctors throughout each stage of the learning life. The statement also provides a guide to extension skills and learning objectives to encourage those interested in furthering a career in teaching and mentoring in general practice, in addition to developing leadership skills. Examples of typical skill requirements that extend across teaching, mentoring and leadership (especially within a general practice clinical context) include: understanding the roles of teachers, mentors and leaders - when to teach and when to learn, when to lead and when to follow incorporating teaching, mentoring and leadership at all levels of the learning life and within an organisation assessment and evaluation skills understanding adult learning principles and different learning styles instructional and supervision skills providing feedback teaching and leading individuals, groups (small and large) and organisations ethical approaches to teaching, mentoring and leading skills for teaching, mentoring and leading in complex environments, especially within the context of primary care change management skills incorporating diversity into teaching, mentoring and leading, eg. in rural settings, the role of gender, culturally and linguistically diversity, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander settings.RACGP curriculum statement Teaching, mentoring and leadership in general practice | 553Medical students \u2014 teaching, mentoring and leading Equipping students with teaching and learning skills helps students to self direct their learning. Programs concentrating on clinically focused topics, evidence based medicine and physical examination skills in both conventional and problem based contexts have proven to be beneficial for all students, both teachers and learners. Peer tutoring is an educational strategy whereby student tutors - usually senior medical students - take on the helping role that facilitates first year students in activities by enabling them to support each others learning in undergraduate studies. This also helps develop team based work strategies, which lay the foundation for leadership roles, multidisciplinary care and teamwork. Prevocational doctors \u2014 teaching, mentoring and leading Prevocational doctors spend a significant proportion of their work time in teams leading and educating junior medical staff and medical students. Prevocational residents also demonstrate teaching style preferences that indicate the need for education in this skills area. Often didactic approaches are used, rather than developing learner problem solving skills, and feedback is rarely used for educational purposes. They prefer to question learners rather than engage in educational discourses, demonstrate techniques and procedures, and reference literature only minimally. 4 Several key features of teaching and mentoring skills required by graduates at this stage or hospital resident level have been identified. In particular, prevocational doctors: spend 20-25% of time teaching enjoy teaching and consider it vital for their own education, not only in clinical skills but also in their own self directed learning skills and motivation recognise the importance of teaching to the profession often have little formal instruction as educators would prefer to spend more time teaching than they do lack confidence teaching when they need education in areas taught demonstrate improvement in teaching skills when they are given formal tuition in teaching demonstrate improvement in clinical skills and knowledge, although this cannot be directly attributable to the teaching skills program alone. Teacher training is therefore recommended for all doctors in their postgraduate hospital years. The presence of leadership skills has been linked to the provisions of high quality care, especially within complex systems by helping ensure that the patient is the central focus of multidisciplinary care. Vocational doctors - teachers, learners and leaders Both the teacher and learner benefit from peer assisted learning. Universities are encouraging vertical integration of medical education, and general practice trainees are increasingly likely to experience roles in teaching medical students within the practices where they work. Some vocational trainees also choose to undertake an academic post at a university in which they are expected to teach medical students on campus. Apart from student teaching, vocational trainees may frequently be involved with teaching peers and other health professionals within the training context. This may occur in workshop settings, small study groups, in individual instruction or clinical practice. Vocational trainees are also a valuable learning resource for their supervisors.554 | RACGP curriculum statement Teaching, mentoring and leadership in general practiceLeadership styles in the general practice setting are diverse, as most leadership models have been developed in large organisations and may not directly apply to the smaller general practice setting. Vocational training provides an opportunity to explore personal strengths and weaknesses, appreciate the role of leadership in the general practice and adapt personal leadership qualities to the primary care setting within the context of increasingly team based and multidisciplinary approaches. Postvocational doctors - teachers, mentors and leaders General practitioners need to develop, maintain and expand skills as trainers, educators, mentors, researchers and leaders over their professional lifetime. Many GPs will be involved in a variety of teaching roles, eg. staff education or educating medical students (in their practice or in a more formal academic setting), postvocational doctors and colleagues in a peer education process or in 'train the trainer' settings. Effective teaching demands ongoing review of educational skills, and professional development programs need to consider and review the level of teaching skills required in order to develop and maintain teaching skills to the appropriate standards. Being involved as a clinical leader is seen as a critical aspect of continuous quality improvement within the practice setting Related curriculum areas Refer also to the curriculum statement: Philosophy and foundation of general practice.
