When is the booster available and how do I book an appointment? - Vaccinations will begin on 11 September for those most at risk, including adult care home residents and people who are immunosuppressed. - From 18 September, the NHS will start to invite people in priority order of risk and those eligible will be able to book an appointment on the National Booking Service. - Further information is available [here](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2023/08/nhs-flu-and-covid-vaccine-programmes-brought-forward-due-to-risk-of-new-covid-variant/). Why have you moved the starting date forward? - This year's autumn flu and Covid-19 vaccine programmes will start earlier than planned in England as a precautionary measure following the identification of a new Covid variant. - The precautionary measure is being taken as scientists from UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) examine the variant BA.2.86, which was first detected in the UK on Friday 18 August. - According to the latest risk assessment by the UKHSA, BA.2.86 has a high number of mutations and has appeared in several countries in individuals without travel history. - While BA.2.86 is not currently classified as a variant of concern, advice from the UKHSA suggests that speeding up the autumn vaccine programme will deliver greater protection, supporting those at greatest risk of severe illness and reducing the potential impact on the NHS. How does the JCVI define a clinical risk group?

Why should I get an autumn booster? - Vaccines help to protect against severe illness, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid. - People who received an autumn booster vaccine last year were around 53% less likely to go to the hospital with Covid in the two to four weeks after getting vaccinated, compared to those who didn't get a booster. - Last year's autumn booster programme saw almost 84% of over-80s vaccinated and more than 73% of 65-70-year-olds, protecting the most vulnerable and helping us to live with Covid.
