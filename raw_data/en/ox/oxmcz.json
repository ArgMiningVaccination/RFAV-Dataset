During a chiropractic adjustment, the vertebrae of the spine are put back into proper alignment and balance allowing the central nervous system to work more efficiently by sending clearer signals to the organs of the body. These signals can include boosting your immune system, fighting off disease, and telling your body to flush itself of toxins. When your spine is out of alignment, the communication that occurs through the nerves from the brain to the organs of the body is slowed or impeded. When the spine is realigned through chiropractic and these toxins are released, you may experience a little light-headedness, but really, your body is resetting and doing its job of fighting off unnatural substances. This is wy we always recommend drinking a glass of water after your adjustment. Toxins are all around us and can be represented by anything that may be unnatural to the human body. This can include tobacco smoke, asbestos, mold, chemicals from pesticides in food, and tiny metals that may be in drinks or food. Toxification can also occur when our body experiences too much of a specific substance such as sugar or caffeine. Research shows that sugar and fructose can cause obesity and chronic inflammation. Diet is one of the greatest causes of toxification. As the body experiences more and more unnatural toxins, it is forced to deal with these things in natural ways of flushing the body. This can even be in the form of a runny nose or diarrhea. Detoxification starts in your liver and eventually moves to your kidneys and lungs. The body is designed to rid itself of the bad things that don't belong. If the body experiences more toxins than it can handle, the kidney can become sluggish and eventually these toxins can spread to other organs of the body such as our stomach (slowing down metabolism) or our brain (causing slow thought process). Get started through Diet, Exercis e and Chiropractic drinking lots of water will help your body rid itself internally from toxins. Exercising and staying active can also help your body stay healthy. Sweat is a natural detoxification method and blood flow through movement can help your body and organs stay healthy. Toxins that build up in different locations around the body tend to accumulate around the spinal cord. CHIROPRACTIC adjustments break up the pockets of air in your joints and spinal cord, often releasing toxins in the process.
