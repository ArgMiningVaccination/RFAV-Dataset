Moreover, if your child needs health care for another medical condition, we have the specialists and subspecialists onsite to meet those needs as well. Dedicated Pediatric Epilepsy Monitoring One of the most important components of your child's epilepsy care is the diagnosis. We use the most advanced EEG technology to pinpoint the location, type, and severity of your child's seizures. In addition to neurological imaging studies, we use sophisticated tools to assess your child's brain function, including EEG monitoring and special electrophysiologic mapping techniques. We use the findings of these tests to plan surgery in children with epilepsy that cannot be adequately controlled with other therapies. Customized Therapy We tailor therapy to your child's needs, taking into account other factors \u2014 such as lifestyle, stress, sleep habits, and diet \u2014 that may serve as triggers for seizures. Available treatments include antiseizure medications, dietary therapy, vitamins, and surgery for those children whose seizures cannot be controlled with nonsurgical methods. Specialized Care for Children with Other Disorders Some disorders may predispose children to seizures, such as tuberous sclerosis complex, neurofibromatosis, and autism spectrum disorders. If your child has one of these disorders or another genetic disorder that can cause seizures, our dedicated specialists with expertise in these areas are available. Transitional Care to Adulthood We recognize that epilepsy is a lifelong condition and that children's needs change as they get older, particularly during their teenage years. We work with teens to help them understand their responsibility for their health and to hear what they have to say about their personal goals. We use this information to tailor their therapy as they get older to meet their current needs at each stage of life. As they get ready to leave their teen years, we work with them and with our adult epilepsy treatment specialists to facilitate the gradual transition from pediatric to adult care, ensuring continuity of treatment. Care for Your Family The needs of a child with epilepsy affect the entire family. We work closely with your family to address your child's needs and to assess how those needs influence your family's dynamic. For school-age children who require longer-term care, we have staff available to help children keep up with their educational development.
