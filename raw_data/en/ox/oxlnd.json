Given the urgent need to bring new vaccines to the market and after having first considered the establishment of a joint-venture, both partners decided that in order to avoid any unnecessary administrative delays in the establishment of a new company, the choice of a technology transfer was more appropriate. The vaccines will be produced by Jinyu Baoling and commercialized under the [Ceva](https://www.ceva.com/) brand. Commenting on the agreement Ceva CEO Marc Prikazsky said: \"We are delighted to be able to use our global expertise in the control of zoonotic diseases to help the people of Inner Mongolia and our partners, Jinyu Baoling, to better control brucellosis. With over 500,000 human cases reported around the world each year and probably many more that are undetected, [brucellosis](https://www.wattagnet.com/home/article/15506052/proposed-swine-disease-program-changes-up-for-comment) is a re-emerging disease that deserves wider attention. The long term commitment that the Chinese health authorities have made to control this major public health threat is critical, following their request we felt it was important to move forwards as quickly as we could to help meet their goal of eradicating brucellosis in this important dairy region.\" Ceva's \"Together, beyond animal health\" mission makes the control of zoonotic diseases one of its key elements. The company has recently worked with Governments and health authorities in controlling a wide range of potentially dangerous diseases in different countries including: Avian Influenza in Egypt, Salmonella control in the Unites States, a Q-fever outbreak in the Netherlands and Trypanosomiasis control in Africa "}
