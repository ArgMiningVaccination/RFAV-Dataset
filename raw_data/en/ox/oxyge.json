Untreated, or undertreated ADHD is associated with adverse sequelae, including delinquent behavior, antisocial personality traits, substance abuse and other comorbidities .2 Several central nervous system agents are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved for the treatment of ADHD, including the cerebral release (Intuniv\u00ae).3-23 The cerebral stimulant agents are classified as Schedule II controlled substances due to their potential for abuse.3-11,14 -21,23 Atomoxetine, clonidine extended- release and guanfacine as controlled substances.12,13,2 2 Clonidine and guanfacine, extended- release formulations, are approved as adjunctive therap y with stimulant medications as well as monotherapy.12,13,2 4 Some cerebral stimulant agents are indicated for the treatment of a variety of sleep disorders. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent manif estations of rapid eye movement sleep during wakefulness. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic disorder that often requires lifelong care. Cardinal features of OSA include obstructive apneas, hypopneas, or respiratory effort related arousals; daytime symptoms attributable to disrupted sleep (e.g., sleepiness, fatigue, poor concentration); and signs of disturbed sleep (e.g., snoring, restlessness, or resuscitative snorts). 25,26 Circadian rhythm sleep disorder consists of a persistent/recurrent p attern of sleep interruption. The shift work type occurs in individuals who work non- standard hours (e.g., night work, early morning work and rotating schedules) and is characterized by excessive sleepiness and/or insomnia.25 Modafinil to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, OSA and shift work sleep disorder. These agents are classified as Schedule IV controlled substances because they have been shown to have been shown to produce psychoactive and euphoric effects similar to stimulants. 27,28 Sodium oxybate (Xyrem\u00ae) is -hydroxybutyric acid, a known drug of abuse. It is approved for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. It is classified as a Schedule III controlled substance. However, non- medical uses of sodium oxybate are classified under Schedule I.28 Several generic ADHD agents and stimulants are currently available. Specifically, at least one short -, intermediate- , and long- acting agent is available generically.29 Table 1.

Evidence- based M edicine Data from several clinical trials demonstrate that the a ttention deficit/hyp eractivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants are effective in the treatment of ADHD, as measured by significant decreases in ADHD rating scale scores compared to placebo. Although comparative trials have been conducted, it is difficult to interpret the results of these trials due to design flaws (e.g., small population, short treatment duration, variable outcomes). Overall, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that one ADHD agent and stimulant is more efficacious than another for the treatment of A DHD. 31-107 The majority of efficacy data supporting the use of the ADHD agents and stimulants is derived from placebo- controlled trials. In addition, the majority of trials were conducted in the pediatric population. Limited data exists to demonstrate the efficacy of a variety of cerebral stimulants (amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, dexmethylphenidate, and lisdexamfetamine) and atomoxetine in Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 5 of 10 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03/28/201 3 Clonidine extended- release and guanfacine extended- release have been shown to improve ADHD symptoms scores both as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy to psychostimulants. These agents are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved for use in ADHD as monotherapy and as adjunctive treatment to stimulants.54,55,63-70 Armodafinil, modafinil and sodium oxybate have all been shown to be more effective compared to placebo in patients with narcolepsy, o bstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and shift work disorder, as measured by significant improvements in sleepiness scale scores. In addition, sodium oxybate has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of inadvertent naps and cataplexy attacks compared to placebo. Similar to ADHD, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that one ADHD agent and stimulant is more efficacious than another for the treatment of sleep disorders. 108-135 Key Points within the Medication Class According to C urrent Clinical G uidelines: o Guidelines recommend the use of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved agents for initial pharmacologic treatment of a ttention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) , and preference of one agent over another is not stated. o Stimulant medications remain the most effective treatment option for most children with ADHD, and response to one stimulant dose not predict response to another. Other factors associated with treatment decisions include presence of comorbid conditions, patient/family preference, storage/administration issues at school, history and/or presence of substance abuse, pharmacokinetics, and anticipated adverse events. 2,24,136-138 o With regard to the use of non stimulant medications in the treatment of ADHD, atomoxetine is recognized as a good option for patients with comorbid anxiety, sleep initiation disorder, substance abuse, or tics, or if initially preferred by parents and/or the physician. o Overall, atomoxetine, clonidine extended- release and guanfacine extended- release are effective in reducing ADHD core symptoms; however, these agents have a smaller evidence base compared to the cerebral stimulants. 24 o Methylphenidat e is recommended as first -line treatment of ADHD in adults, with atomoxetine and dexamphetamine recommended second line.137-13 8 o For the treatment of narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) , and shift work disorder , guidelines recommend the use of FDA -approved agents for the treatment of such sleep disorders, with modafinil recommended first -line for the treatment of narcolepsy. 25,139-141 o Even though guidelines were published prior to FDA -approval of sodium oxybate, the agent is the only one to be recognized as being an effective option for the treatment of cataplexy due to narcolepsy. Armodafinil, was FDA -approved in 2007; however, its role is not defined within current clinical guidelines. 25,139-141 Other Key Facts: o Armodafinil (Nuvigil\u00ae) is the longer half -life enantiomer of modafinil (Provigil\u00ae). o At least one short -, intermediate- , and long- acting stimulant is available generically.30 o Due to safety concerns and abuse potential, sodium oxybate (Xyrem\u00ae) is available only through restricted distribution, the Xyrem Success Program.

Page 1 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03/28/201 3 Therapeutic Class Review Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Agents and Stimulants Overview/Summary Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder often diagnosed during childhood; however, children with ADHD may continue to manifest symptoms into adulthood.1 The core symptoms of ADHD utilized in the diagnosis of the disorder include hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. There are three subtypes of ADHD, a predominantly inattentive subtype, a predominantly hyperactive- impulsive subtype and a combined subtype in which both symptoms are displayed.1 Untreated, or undertreated, ADHD is associated with adverse sequelae, including delinquent behavior, antisocial personality traits, substance abuse and other comorbidities2. There are several central nervous system agents that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved for the treatment of ADHD, including the cerebral stimulants (amphetamines and (Intuniv\u00ae).3-24 Due to the potential for abuse, the cerebral stimulant agents are classified as Schedule II controlled substances .3-11,14 -21,23 Atomoxetine, clonidine extended -release and guanfacine as controlled substances .12,13,22 Clonidine and guanfacine extended- release formulations are approved for use as both adjunctive therapy with stimulant medications and as monotherapy .12,13 Some cerebral stimulant agents are also FDA -approved for the treatment of a variety of sleep disorders. Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and intermittent manifestations of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during wakefulness. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic disorder that often requires lifelong care. Cardinal features of OSA include obstructive apneas, hypopneas, or respiratory effort related arousals; daytime symptoms attributable to disrupted sleep (e .g., sleepiness, fatigue and poor concentration); and signs of disturbed sleep (e.g., snoring, restlessness or resuscitative snorts).25,26 Circadian rhythm sleep disorder consists of a persistent/recurrent pattern of sleep interruption. The shift work type occurs in individuals who work non- standard hours (e.g., night work, early morning work and rotating schedules), and is characterized by exces sive sleepiness and/or insomnia.25 Modafinil (Provigil\u00ae) life enantiomer of modafinil , are FDA -approved to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, OSA and shift work sleep disorder. These agents have been shown to produce psychoactive and euphoric effects similar to stimul ants, as well as alterations in mood, perception, thinking and feelings. As a result, these agents are classified as Schedule IV controlled substances . 27,28 Sodium oxybate (Xyrem\u00ae) is -hydroxybutyric acid, a known drug of abuse. It is approved for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. It is classified as a Schedule III controlled substance; h owever, non- medical uses of sodium oxybate are classified under Schedule I .29 Several generic ADHD agents and stimulants are currently available. Specifically, at least one short -, intermediate- , and long- acting agents is available generically.30 The agents included in this review are listed in Tabl e 1 categorized by medication class and by generic name, as there are multiple branded agents contain ing the same active ingredient . Current consensus clinical guidelines for the treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD recommend that stimulants are highly effective for reducing core symptoms of ADHD in children.2,24,31 Although initial therapy with atomoxetine or extended- release formulations of clonidine and guanfacine may reduce core symptoms of ADHD, there is less evidence to support their use compared to stimulants. The selection of therapy should be based on comorbid conditions, adverse event profiles, compliance issues, risk of drug diversion and patient/parent preference.32 Stimulants, particularly methylphenidate, are recommended as first -line therapy in adult patient s with ADHD.24,33 Guidelines for the treatment of narcolepsy, OSA and shift work disorder recommend the use of FDA -approved agents for the treatment of such sleep disorders, with modafinil recommended first -line for the treatment of narcolepsy. Sodium Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 2 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03/28/201 3 oxybate is the only agent that is recommended as being an effective option for the treatment of cataplexy due to narcolepsy. Armodafinil, the R enantiomer of modafinil, was FDA -approved in 2007; however, i ts role is not been address in the current guidelines.25,34-36 Medications Table 1.

Although comparative trials have been conducted, it is difficult to interpret the results of these trials due to design flaws (e.g., small population, short treatment duration or variable outcomes). Overall, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that one ADHD agent and stimulant is more efficacious than another for the treatment of ADHD. 38-117 The majority of efficacy data supporting the use of the ADHD agents and stimulants is derived from placebo- controlled trials. In addition, the majority of trials were conducted in the pediatric population. Limited data exists to demonstrate the efficacy of a variety of cerebral stimulants (amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, dexmethylphenidate, and lisdexamfetamine) and atom oxetine in the adult population. 43,50,66,85,86,101 In a large study by Goodman et al (N=725), adults 18 years of age or older were adm inistered amphetamine/dextroamphetamine salts extended- release 10 to 60 mg daily for 10 weeks. By 10 weeks , the mean ADHD rating scale (ADHD -RS) scores significantly decreased in the amphetamine/dextroamphetamine salts extended- release group compared to baseline, regardless of dose ( P<0.0001).43 In a four -year open label study in adults diagnosed with ADHD, treatment with atomoxetine reduced mean Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale -Investigator Rated: Screening Version total ADHD symptom by 30.2% from baseline to endpoint ( -8.8; P<0.001). In a study by Weisler and colleagues, treatment with lisdexamfetamine improved ADHD- RS total scores as early as week one of treatment and continued throughout the eleven month treatment period ( P<0.001).85 In adult patients who were stabilized on immediate- release methylphenidate at baseline, switching to methylphenidate extended- release ( Concerta\u00ae) has had no effect on Adult ADHD investigator system symptom report scale (AISRS) after six weeks of treatment (11.2 vs 10.7; P=0.80).101 Clonidine extended- release and guanfacine extended- for use in ADHD as monotherapy and as adjunctive treatment to stimulants .12,13 In children with ADHD, treatment with clonidine extended- release 0.2 or 0.4 mg daily si gnificantly improved ADHD -RS from baseline at eight weeks compared to placebo ( P<0.001).62 In a six -week study evaluating the effect of guanfacine extended- release on psychomotor functioning, there were no significant differences between guanfacine Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 8 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03/28/201 3 extended -release and placebo groups on measures of psychomotor functioning or alertness on the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery -Choice Reaction Time scale (mean difference, 2.5; P=0.80 for choice reaction time, 2.5; P=0.84 for correct , 15.5; P=0.30 for movement and -8.2; P=0.72 for total time). Moreover, guanfacine extended- release was associated with a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms compared to placebo ( P=0.001).71 In a study by Sallee and colleagues, adolescents random ized to receive guanfacine extended- release 1 to 4 mg daily achieved statistically significant reductions in ADHD -RS-IV total scores from baseline compared to placebo. The placebo- adjusted mean endpoint changes from baseline the guanfacine extended- release 1, 2, 3 and 4 mg groups, respectively.72 Guanfacine extended- release was shown to significantly improve scores on the oppositional subscale of the Conners' parent rating sc ale-revised: long form compared to placebo over nine weeks of treatment ( P<0.001). The mean percentage reductions from baseline were 56.3% with guanfacine extended- release and 33.4% with placebo ( P<0.001).74 With regard to monotherapy, these agents have been shown to significantly improve ADHD rating scale scores compared to placebo. Both clonidine extended- release and guanfacine extended- release have only been evaluated in pediatric patients (six to 17 years of age).62,71 -76,79 Similarly, use of these agents as adjunctive treatment to stimulant therapy has been shown to significantly improve ADHD rating scale scores co mpared to stimulant monotherapy.63,77,78 Prior to FDA -approval of clonidine extended- release and guanfacine extended- release, the immediate- release formulations of these agents were evaluated, and demonstrated variable effic acy for the treatment of ADHD.61,70,104 Armodafinil, modafinil, and sodium oxybate have all been shown to be more effective compared to placebo in patients with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work disorder, as measured by significant improvements in sleepiness scale scores. In addition, sodium oxybate has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of inadvertent naps and cataplexy attacks compared to placebo . Similar to ADHD, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that one ADHD agent and stimulant is more efficacious than another for t he treatment of sleep disorders.118-149 Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 9 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03 /28/201 3 Table 5.

Improvement in CGI -I scores was significant in the guanfacine ER 2 mg group compared to the placebo group by week two ( P=0.0194) and in all guanfacine ER groups by week three continuing through week five ( P<0.05). Significant improvement in PGA scores at end point was shown in 23.08, 62.12, 50.82, and 66.10% of patients in the placebo and guanfacine ER 2, 3, and 4 mg groups, respectively. On the CPRS -R, placebo- adjusted LS mean day total end point changes from baseline were -6.55 in the 2 mg group ( P=0.0448), -7.36 in the 3 mg group (P=0.0242), and - 12.70 in the 4 mg group ( P<0.0001). On the CTRS -R, placebo- adjusted LS mean day total end point from baseline were the 2, 3, and 4 mg doses, respectively. The most commonly reported treatment -emergent adverse events were somnolence, fatigue, upper abdominal pain and sedation. The incidence of somnolence in patients who were receiving guanfacine ER 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg doses was 12.7, 11.4, 20.9, and 17.5%, respectively. SBP, DBP, and pulse rate decreased as guanfacine ER dosages increased, then increased as dosages stabilized and tapered down. The greatest mean changes from baseline in SBP and DBP for patients who were receiving guanfacine ER 2, 3, and 4 mg doses were - 7.0 mm Hg (week 3) and - 3.8 mm Hg (week 2), - 7.0 mm Hg (week 3) and - 4.7 mm Hg (weeks three and five), and -10.1 mm Hg (week four) and - 7.1 mm Hg (week four), respectively.

Mean changes in pulse rate and QRS intervals were generally unchanged across study visits. Hypotension was reported in 2.9% of patients and bradycardia was reported in 2.1% of patients. There were no unexpected changes in mean height or wei ght. Approximately 7.0% of patients reported weight increase possibly or probably related to study drug. Weight decrease was not reported. Appetite increase was reported by 2.1% of patients, appetite decrease by 3.3% of patients, and anorexia by 0.8% of patients. Secondary: The mean ADHD -RS-IV total score was significantly reduced from baseline to endpoint ( -18.1; P<0.001 vs baseline). Mean reductions in ADHD -RS-IV scores were significant for both the inattention ( P<0.001 vs P<0.001 vs baseline) subscales. For PGA scores, 58.6% of patients were 'improved' at endpoint compared to baseline of the preceding study.

Twenty patients have a decrease in BP judged to be of clinical interest. Twelve patients exhibited orthostatic BP decreases. None of the patients with BP decreases reported syncope or lightheadedness. At baseline, the mean PDSS score was 15.0. Decreases were observed at visit six ( - 4.8) and end point ( -3.1). During treatment, there was an increase from screening in the number of patients reporting clinically significant dullness, tiredness, and listlessness on the PSERS. There was a decrease in the number of patients with clinically significant loss of appetite and trouble sleeping. The psychostimulant subgroups were generally comparable. Significant decreases from baseline (psychostimulant only) to end point in ADHD - RS-IV total score were observed overall and in both psychostimulant combination subgroups, indicating improvement in ADHD symptoms (overall, - 16.1; guanfacine ER plus MPH group, - 17.8; guanfacine ER plus AMP group, - 13.8; P<0.0001 for all). The mean percentage reduction from baseline to end point in ADHD -RS-IV score overall was 56.0%. Improvement was significant for the mean day CPRS -R total score ( -19.8; P<0.0001), as well as for all three time points ( -23.2 at 12 hours postdose, - 18.5 at 14 hours postdose, and - 17.8 at 24 hours postdose; P<0.0001 for all). The percentage of patients showing improvement at end point on the CGI was 73.0%. On the PGA, 84.1% of patients showed improvement.

Similarly, more patients treated with armodafinil experienced an improvement in late- in-shift CGI -C at the final visit compared to placebo (77 vs 57%; P<0.0001). At the final visit, most patients in the armodafinil group were categorized as ' much improved' (33%) or 'very much improved ' (24%) on the late- in-shift CGI -C rating scale. For patients treated with placebo, 38% had 'no change ' in their condition compared to only 19% of patients in the armodafinil group. Secondary: The m ean ( \u00b1SD) improvement from baseline in GAF score at the final visit was significantly greater in the armodafinil group compared to the placebo group ( 9.4 vs 5.0; P<0.0001). Improveme nts in GAF scores w ere also significantly greater for armodafinil -treated patients at three week s (6.9 vs 3.7 ; P<0.0001) and six week s (9.8 vs 4.9; P<0.0001) compared to patients treated with placebo. A higher proportion of patients treated with armodafini l had GAF scores greater than 70 (\"normal function\") at each visit, with almost twice as many patients receiving armodafinil reaching GAF scores greater than 70 at final visit compared to placebo Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 68 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03 /28/201 3 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design, Study Rating, and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results (51 vs 28% ; P value not reported ).

Administration of amphetamines for prolonged periods of time may lead to drug dependence and must be avoided. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of subjects obtaining amphetamines for non -therapeutic use or distribution to others, and the drugs should be prescribed or dispensed sparingly. Misuse of amphetamines may cause sudden death and serious cardiovascular adverse reactions. Boxed Warning for atomoxetine37 WARNING Suicidal ideation in children and adolescents: Atomoxetine increased the risk of suicidal ideation in short -term stu dies in children or adolescents with ADHD. Anyone considering the use of atomoxetine in a child or adolescent must balance this risk with the clinical need. Closely monitor patients who are started on therapy for suicidality (suicidal thinking and behavior ), clinical worsening, or unusual changes in behavior. Advise families and caregivers of the need for close observation and communication with the prescribing health care provider. Atomoxetine is approved for ADHD in children and adults. Atomoxetine is not approved for major depressive disorder. Pooled analysis of short -term (six - to 18- week), placebo- controlled trials of atomoxetine in children and adolescents (12 trials involving more than 2,200 patients, including 11 trials in ADHD and one trial in enuresis) has revealed a greater risk of suicidal ideation early during treatment in those receiving atomoxetine compared to placebo. The average risk of suicidal ideation in patients receiving atomoxetine was 0.4% (5/1,357 patients), compared to none in placebo -treated patients (0/851 patients). No suicides occurred in these trials Boxed Warning for dexmethylphenidate37 WARNING Drug dependence: Give dexmethylphenidate cautiously to patients with a history of drug dependence or alcoholism. Chronic, abusive use can lead to marked tolerance and psychological dependence with varying degrees of abnormal behavior. Frank psychotic episodes can occur, especially with parenteral abuse. Careful supervision is required during drug withdrawal from abusive use because severe depression may occur. Withdrawal following chronic therapeutic use may unmask symptoms of the underlying disorder that may require follow -up. Boxed Warning for lisdexamfetamine37 WARNING Potential for misuse, abuse, addiction, and diver sion: Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is a Schedule II controlled substance. Stimulants, such as amphetamines and methylphenidates , are subject to misuse abuse, addiction, and criminal diversion. Misuse of amphetamines may cause sudden death and serious cardio vascular adverse reactions. Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 87 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03 /28/201 3 Boxed Warning for methamphetamine37 WARNING Methamphetamine has a high potential for abuse. It should thus be tried only in weight reduction programs for patients in whom alternative therapy has been ineffectiv e. Administration of methamphetamine for prolonged periods of time in obesity may lead to drug dependence and must be avoided. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility of subjects obtaining methamphetamine for nontherapeutic use or distributi on to others, and the drug should be prescribed or dispensed sparingly. Boxed Warning for methylphenidate37 WARNING Drug dependence: Give methylphenidate cautiously to patients with a history of drug dependence or alcoholism. Chronic abusive use c an lead to marked tolerance and psychological dependence, with varying degrees of abnormal behavior. Frank psychotic episodes can occur, especially with parenteral abuse. Careful supervision is required during withdrawal from abusive use because severe depression may occur. Withdrawal following chronic therapeutic use may unmask symptoms of the underlying disorder that may require follow -up. Boxed Warning for sodium oxybate37 WARNING Sodium oxybate is a gamma hydroxybutyrate, a known drug of abuse. Abuse has been associated with some important central nervous system adverse reactions, including death. Even at recommended doses, use has been associated with confusion, depression, and other neuropsychiatric reactions. Reports of respiratory depression occurred in clinical trials. Almost all of the patients who received sodium oxybate during clinical trials were receiving central nervous system stimulants. Important central nervous system adverse reactions associated with abuse of sodium oxybate include respiratory depression, seizure, and profound decreases in level of consciousness, with instances of coma and death. For reactions that occurred outside of clinical trials, in people taking sodium oxybate for recreational purposes, the circumstances surr ounding the reactions often are unclear (e.g., dose of sodium oxybate taken, the nature and amount of alcohol or any concomitant drugs). Sodium oxybate is available through the Xyrem\u00ae Success Program, using a centralized pharmacy (1- 866- 997-3688). The Suc cess Program provides educational materials to the prescriber and the patient explaining the risks and proper use of sodium oxybate and the required prescription form. Once it is documented that the patient has read and/or understands the materials, the dr ug will be shipped to the patient. The Xyrem\u00ae Success Program also recommends patient follow -up every three months. Health care providers are expected to report all serious adverse reactions to the manufacturer.

Drug Interactions -Anorexigenic Agents and Respiratory and to central nervous system stimulants. If an interaction is suspected, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of toxicity, and reduce the dose of the central nervous system stimulant accordingly. Guanethidine: central nervous system stimulants can reverse the hypotensive effects of guanethidine. Monitor patients. If there is a loss of blood pressure control, discontinue the central nervo us system stimulant or switch to alternative hypotensive therapy. Monoamine oxidase inhibitor: exaggerated pharmacologic effects Avoid coadministration. Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors: increased sensitivity to sympathomimetic effects and increased risk of serotonin syndrome. If these agents must be used concurrently, monitor for increased central nervous system. Adjust therapy as needed. Urinary alkalinizers: alkalinized urine may prolon g the effects of central nervous system stimulants. Avoid agents that may alkalinize the urine, particularly in overdose situations. Table 10b. Drug Interactions -Anorexigenic Agents and Respiratory may be reduced, decreasing the pharmacologic effects.

Clinical Guidelines Clinical Guideline Recommendations American Academy of Pediatrics: Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of Attention -Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents (2011) 24 Prescho ol-aged children (four to five years of age) The primary care clinician should prescribe evidence- based parent - and/or teacher -administered behavior therapy as the first -line of treatment. Methylphenidate may be prescribed if the behavior interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is moderate -to-severe continuing disturbance in the child's function. Elementary school -aged children (six to 11 years of age) The primary care clinician should prescribe Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for attention deficit -hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or evidence- based parent and/or teacher -administered behavior therapy as treatment for ADHD, preferably both. The evidence is particularly strong for stimulant medications and suff icient but less strong for atomoxetine, extended- release guanfacine, and extended- release clonidine (in that order). Adolescents (12 to 18 years of age) The primary care clinician should prescribe FDA -approved medications for ADHD with the assent of the adolescent and may prescribe behavior therapy as treatment for ADHD, preferably both. General considerations Stimulant medications are highly effective for most children in reduction of core symptoms of ADHD. Atomoxetine, extended- release guanfacine and extended- release clonidine reduce core symptoms; however, they have a smaller evidence base than stimulants. Extended- release guanfacine and extended- release clonidine have evidence to support their use as adjunctive therapy with stimulant medications. Before beginning medication treatment for adolescents with newly diagnosed ADHD, clinicians should assess these patients for symptoms of substance abuse. Clinicians should monitor symptoms and prescription- refill requests for signs of misuse or diversion of ADHD medications and consider prescribing medications with no abuse potential, such as atomoxetine, Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 100 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03 /28/201 3 Clinical Guideline Recommendations extended -release guanfacine, or extended -release clonidine (which are not stimulants) or stimulant medications with less abuse potential, such as lisdexamfetamine, dermal methylphenidate, or osmotic -release oral system methylphenidate). Primary care clinicians should titrate doses of medication for ADHD to achieve maximum benefit with minimum adverse effects. Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement: Diagn osis and Management of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Primary Care for School -Age Children and Adolescents (2012) 31 Medication trials Prescribe FDA -approved treatments for ADHD in children, including psychostimulants and/or non- stimulants. The decision to use medications should be made in conjunction with parents following a thorough discussion of expected benefits and potential risks. Factors such as the child's age, severity of symptoms and presence of comorbidity should also be considered and may involve decision- making regarding choice of medication. Obtain cardiology consultation for patients with known structural cardiac abnormali ties, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems that could place patients at an increased risk to the sympathomimetic effects of central nervous system stimulants and/or atomoxetine. Review the personal and family cardiovascular history, and complete a physical examination of each patient pri or to starting stimulant therapy and/or atomoxetine. Medication history or physical exam changes consistent with possible cardiac disease during treat ment with stimulant medication and/or atomoxetine may require additional evaluation by a cardiologist. Optimal medication management alone is superior to other modalities for the core symptoms of ADHD. Response to one stimulant does not predict response to the others. If a child is a non- responder to one stimulant, it is advisable to attempt a second or third trial with other stimulants. Treatment with psychostimulants is often safe and effective in managing many children with ADHD with mild to moderate tics. Nevertheless, frequency and severity of tics should be carefully monitored in these patients. No routi ne blood work is necessary before or during psychostimulant therapy. Current evidence does not support a higher risk of sudden cardiac death with stimulant medication compared to the general population; however, certain conditions may place a patient at hi gher risk for such an outcome. Atomoxetine is a good option for patients with comorbid anxiety, sleep initiation disorder, substance abuse, or tics, or if initially preferred by parents and/or physician. Atomoxetine is a non- controlled substance that may m ake it preferable in certain clinical situations. Extended- release guanfacine and extended- release clonidine are the first ADHD medi cations to achieve FDA approval as adjunctive therapy with stimulant medications. Extended- release guanfacine is the first ADHD medication to look for improvement of oppositional symptoms in addition to ADHD core symptoms. Alternative medications When adequate stimulant, atomoxetine or alpha adrenergic trials are unsuccessful due to either poor response or adverse effects, or if Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 101 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03 /28/201 3 Clinical Guideline Recommendations associated comorbidity is present, alternative medication trials should be considered. Second- line medications for ADHD Health and Clinical Excellence: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: Diagnosis and Management of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children, Young People, and Adult s (2008) 32 Treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD Methylphenidate, atomoxetine and dexamphetamine are recommended as options for the management of ADHD in children and adolescents. The decision regarding which product to use should be based on the following: o The presence of comorbid conditions. o The different adverse effects of the drugs. o Specific issues regarding compliance identified for the individual child or adolescent. o The potential for drug diversion. o The preferences of the child/adolesc ent and/or his or her parent or guardian. Healthcare professionals should consider the following treatment recommendations: o Methylphenidate for patients with ADHD without significant comorbidities. o Methylphenidate for patients with ADHD with comorbid conduct disorder. o Methylphenidate or atomoxetine when tics, Tourette's syndrome, anxiety disorder, stimulant misuse or risk of stimulant diversion are present. o Atomoxetine if methylphenidate has been tried and has been ineffective at the maximum tolerated dose, or the child or young person is intolerant to low or moderate doses of methylphenidate. Modified- release preparations should be considered for the following reasons: o Convenience. o Improving adherence. o Reducing stigma (because the child or young person does not need to take medication at school). o Reducing problems schools have in storing and administering controlled drugs. o Their pharmacokinetic profiles. Immediate- release preparations may be considered if more flexible dosing regimens are required, or during initial titration to determine correct dosing levels. Treatment of adults with ADHD Drug treatment is the first -line treatment for adults with ADHD with either moderate or severe levels of impairment. Methylphenidate is recommended as the firs t-line drug. If methylphenidate is ineffective or unacceptable, atomoxetine or dexamphetamine can be tried. Caution should be exercised when prescribing dexamphetamine to those likely to be at risk of stimulant misuse or diversion. American Academy of Child and Adolescent Initial pharmacologic therapy should be with an agent approved by the FDA for the treatme nt of ADHD. This includes dextroamphetamine, Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 102 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03 /28/201 3 Clinical Guideline Recommendations Psychiatry: Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Attention -Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (2007)2 methylphenidate, mixed salts of amphetamine, and atomoxetine. Stimulants have been shown to be highly effective for the treatment of ADHD in many clinical trials. Available evidence suggests that both methylphen idate and amphetamines are equally efficacious in the treatment of ADHD. Immediate- release stimulant medications have the disadvantage that they must be taken two to three times per day to control ADHD symptoms throughout the day. The long- acting formulat ions are equally efficacious as immediate- release formulations. Long- acting formulations may be used as initial therapy. There is no need to titrate to the appropriate dose on short -acting forms and then transfer children to a long- acting form. Short -acting stimulants are often used as initial treatment in small children (<16 kg in weight), for whom there are no long-acting forms in a sufficiently low dose. Once a medication is initiated, the dose should be titrated every one to three weeks until the maxim um dose is reached, the symptoms of ADHD remit, or side effects prevent further titration. It is recommended that the patient be in contact with the physician during the titration period and visit the physician after one month of therapy to assess effecti veness and determine long- term therapy plans. Some patients may respond similarly to different stimulant classes; whereas, other patients may preferentially respond to only one class of stimulants. There is no method to predict which stimulant will produc e the best response in a given patient. For the treatment of preschoolers, the available evidence suggests that the titration of stimulants be done slowly and that lower doses may be effective. This may be due to slower metabolism of methylphenidate in preschoolers. In studies published comparing atomoxetine to stimulants, greater efficacy was seen in those patients treated with stimulants. Atomoxetine may have less pronounced effects on appetite and sleep than stimulants, although they may produce relative ly more nausea or sedation. Atomoxetine may be considered as a first -line agent in patients with an active substance abuse problem, comorbid anxiety, tics, or in those who experience severe side effects while taking stimulants. It is the choice of the fami ly and the clinician as to which agent should be used for the patient's treatment and each patient's treatment must be individualized. British Association of Psychopharmacology: Evidence- Based Guidelines for the Management of Attention Deficit Hyperactiv ity Disorder in Adolescents in Transition to Adult Services and in Adults (2006) 33 Treatment recommendations for children Proven first -line treatments in children include psychostimulants and atomoxetine. Second- line treatment options include imipramine and bupropion. Clonidine and guanfacine may be used as adjunctive treatments. Qualitative assessments suggest that all agents are more effective than placebo and have similar efficacy; however, there have been few head- to- head comparisons. The agents are not equivalent in terms of adverse effects . The response to different agents varies between individuals and with different doses. Treatment recommendations for adults Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 103 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03 /28/201 3 Clinical Guideline Recommendations Drug treatment needs to be chosen and adapted to best fit the individual, including the patient's preferences and concerns. Use of methylphenidate in adults has been shown to demonstrate similar drug response effect to that seen in children. There is limited evidence suggesting that psychostimulants have better efficacy than other treatments for core symptoms. However, amphetamines, methylphenidate and atomoxetine are all effective but not equivalent, since they have different actions and hazards. Abuse potential Abuse potential is related to drug action and formulation. Abuse is generally lo w among patients but it can occur with stimulants. Slow - release preparations of these agents or atomoxetine are preferred for patients with a history of substance abuse, or who are at risk for substance abuse. American Academy of Sleep Medicine: Practice Parameters for the Treatment of Narcolepsy and Other Hypersomnias of Central Origin (2007)34 Most of the agents used to treat excessive sleepiness have little effect on cataplexy or other rapid eye movement sleep associated symptoms. Most antidepressants and anticataplectics have little effect on alertness. However, some compounds act on both symptoms. Compounds should be selected depending on the diagnosis and the targeted symptoms. Coadministration of two or more classes of compounds may be needed in some patients to adequately address their symptoms. Modafinil is effective for treatment of daytime sleepiness due to narcolepsy. Sodium oxybate is effective for treatment of cataplexy, daytime sleepiness, and disrupted sleep due to narcolepsy. Sodium oxybat e may be effective for treatment of hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis. Amphetamine, methamphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methylphenidate are effective for treatment of daytime sleepiness due to narcolepsy. Selegiline may be an effective treatment cataplexy and sleepiness. Tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and venlafaxine may be effective treatment for cataplexy. Scheduled naps can be beneficial to combat sleepiness, but seldom suffice as primary t herapy for narcolepsy. European Federation of Neurological Sciences: Guidelines on Management of Narcolepsy in Adults (2011) 35 Excessive daytime s leepiness and irresistible episodes of sleep Modafinil should be prescribed when excessive daytime sleepines s is present. Modafinil should be dosed as 100 to 400 mg/day, given once in the morning or twice daily . Sodium oxybate may be used when excessive daytime somnolence coexists with cataplexy and poor sleep. D epressed patients should not receive sodium oxybate . Sodium oxybate should be initiated with 4.5 g/night, increasing by increments of 1.5 g at four -week intervals and should not be used with other sedatives, respiratory depressants or muscle relaxants. Monitor patients for possible development of sleep- disordered breathing. Adverse effects may limit the dose, and require slower titration. The optimal response on excessive daytime sleepiness may take up to 12 weeks . Supplementation with modafinil is generally more successful than sodium oxybate alone. Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 104 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03 /28/201 3 Clinical Guideline Recommendations Methylphenidate may be considered if modafinil is insufficient and sodium oxybate is not recommended. The s hort-acting effect of methylphenidate is of interest when modafinil needs to be supplemented at a specific time of the day, or in situations where max imum alertness is required. Cataplexy First-line pharmacological treatment of cataplexy is sodium oxybate at a starting dose of 4.5 g/night divided into two equal doses of 2.25 g/night. The dose may be increased to a maximum of 9 g/night, divided into tw o equal doses of 4.5 g/night, by increments of 1.5 g at two -week intervals. Adverse effects may limit the dose, and require slower titration and the optimal response on excessive daytime sleepiness may take up to 12 weeks . Antidepressants are recommended as second- line pharmacological treatment . Tricyclic antidepressants, particularly clomipramine (10 to 75 mg), are potent anticataplectic drugs ; however, anticholinergic adverse effects are common. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are slightly less active but have fewer adverse effects . Venlafaxine is widely used but c linical evidence supporting its use is limited . Reboxetine and atomoxetine, also lack published clinical evidence. Given the efficacy of sodium oxybate and antidepressants, the place for other compounds is fairly limited. There is no accepted behavioral treatment of cataplexy. Poor sleep Sodium oxybate appears to be the most appropriate to treat poor sleep. Benzodiazepine or non- benzodiazepine hypnotics may be effective in consolidat ing nocturnal sleep, but objective evidence is lacking over intermediate- or long- term follow -up. The improvement in poor sleep reported by some patients once established on modafinil is noteworthy. Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) symptoms OSAHS should be similarly in narcoleptic patients and general population, although continuous positive airway pressure does not improve excessive daytime sleepiness in most narcolepsy subjects. There is usually no need to treat PLMS in narcoleptic patients. Antidepressants and psychotherapy should be used in depressed narcoleptic patients as in non -narcoleptic depressed patients. American Academy of Sleep Medicine: Clinical Guideline for the Evaluation, Management and Long -term Care of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Adults (2009)25 Weight reduction Successful dietary weight loss may improve the apnea- hypopnea index in obese obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) patients. Dietary weight loss should be combined with a primary treatment for OSA. Bariatric surgery may be adjunctive in the treatment of OSA in obese patients. Pharmacologic agents Modafinil is recommended for the treatment of residual excessive daytime Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 105 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03 /28/201 3 Clinical Guideline Recommendations sleepiness in OSA patients who have slee piness despite effective positive airway pressure treatment and who are lacking any other identifiable cause for their sleepiness. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, protriptyline, methylxanthine derivatives (aminophylline and theophylline), and est rogen therapy are not recommended for treatment of OSA. Supplemental oxygen Oxygen supplementation is not recommended as a primary treatment for OSA. Medical therapies intended to improve nasal patency Short -acting nasal decongestants are not recommended for treatment of OSA. Topical nasal corticosteroids may improve the apnea- hypopnea index in patients with OSA and concurrent rhinitis, and thus may be a useful adjunct to primary therapies for OSA. Positional Therapies Positional therapy is an effect ive secondary therapy or can be a supplement to primary therapies for OSA in patients who have a low apnea -hypopnea index in the non -supine vs that in the supine position. American Academy of Sleep Medicine: Practice Parameters for the Clinical Evaluatio n and Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders (2007)36 Shift work disorder Planned napping before or during the night shift is indicated to improve alertness and performance among night shift workers. Timed light exposure in the work environment and light restriction in the morning, when feasible, is indicated to decrease sleepiness and improve alertness during night shift work. Administration of melatonin prior to daytime sleep is indicated to promote daytime sleep among night shift workers. Hypnoti c medications may be used to promote daytime sleep among night shift workers. Carryover of sedation to the nighttime shift with potential adverse consequences for nighttime performance and safety must be considered. Modafinil is indicated to enhance alertness during the night shift for shift work disorder. Caffeine is indicated to enhance alertness during the night shift for shift work disorder. Conclusions There are several central nervous system agents that are Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)-approved for the treatment of a ttention deficit /hyperactivity (ADHD) , The cerebral stimulants are classified as Schedule II controlled substances, and are associated with Boxed Warnings regarding risk of abuse.3-21,23 Atomoxetine, clonidine extended- release and guanfacine olled substances .12,13,2 2 Clonidine and guanfacine, extended- release formulations, are the first ADHD medications to achieve FDA -approval as adjunctive therapy with stimulant medications , but are also indicated for use as monotherapy .12,13 Both agents are available generically in immediate- release formulations ; however, these formulations are not FDA -approv ed for use in ADHD. Furthermore, extended- release formulations of these agents cannot be substituted for immediate- release formulations on a mg- per-mg basis due to differences in pharmacokinetics .12,13 Atomoxetine is associated with a Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 106 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03 /28/201 3 Boxed Warning regarding an increased risk of suicidal ideation observed in short -term trials in children and adolescents with ADHD .22,37 Some cerebral stimulant agents are also FDA -approved for the treatment of a variety of sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA ), and modafinil) are both FDA -approved to improve wakefulness in adult patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, OSA, and shift work sleep disorder. These agents have been shown to produce psychoactive and euphoric effects similar to stimulants, as well as alterati ons in mood, perception, thinking and feelings. As a result, these agents are classified as Schedule IV controlled substances.27,28 Sodium oxybate (Xyrem\u00ae) is -hydroxybutyric acid, a known drug of abuse. It is approved for the treatment of excessive dayti me sleepiness and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. It is classified as a Schedule III controlled substance. Non-medical uses of sodium oxybate are classified under Schedule I. Sodium oxybate is associated with a Boxed Warning regarding associated important central nervous system adverse reactions. Furthermore, this agent is available though the Xyrem\u00ae Success Program .29 There are currently s everal generic ADHD agents and stimulants . At least one -, intermediate- , and long-acting agents are avai lable generically. 30 Several clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of the ADHD agents and stimulants in their respective FDA-approved indications. Evidence consistently demonstrates that these agents significantly improve ADHD and sleepiness rating scales compared to placebo. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that one ADHD agent and stimulant is more efficacious than another. In addition, there is limited efficacy data regarding the treatment of ADHD in the adult population. 38-147 Guidelines recommend the use of FDA -approved agents for initial pharmacologic treatment of ADHD, and preference of one agent over another is not stated. Stimulant medications are still recognized as the most effective treatment option for most children with AD HD, and response to one stimulant dose not predict response to another. Other factors associated with treatment decisions include presence of comorbid conditions, patient/family preference, storage/administration issues at school, history and/or presence of substance abuse, pharmacokinetics and anticipated adverse events.2,24,31-33 With regard to the use of non stimulant medications in the treatment of ADHD, atomoxetine is recognized as a good option for patients with comorbid anxiety, sleep initiation disorder, substance abuse, or tics, or if initially preferred by parents and/or the physician. Overall, atomoxetine, clonidine extended- release, and guanfacine are effective in reducing ADHD core symptoms; however, these agents have a smaller evidence base com pared to the cerebral stimulants .24 With regard to the treatment of ADHD in adults, methylphenidate is recommended first -line, with atomoxetine and dexamphetamine recommended second line.32,33 Guidelines recommend the use of FDA -approved agents for the treatment of such sleep disorders, with modafinil recommended first -line for the treatment of narcolepsy. Even though guidelines are published prior to FDA -approval of sodium oxybate, the agent is the only one to be recognized as being an effective option for the treatment of cataplexy due to narcolepsy. Of note, armodafinil, the R enantiomer of modafinil, was FDA -approved in 2007; however, is not addressed in guidelines published following its appr oval.25,34-36 Therapeutic Class Review: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) agents and stimulants Page 107 of 114 Copyright 2013 Review Completed on 03 /28/201 3 References 1.
