Recommended Reviews [Learn more about reviews.](https://www.yelp.com/reviews-trust-link-tree?l=en_US) Overall rating 5 stars 4 stars 3 stars 2 stars 1 star - 6/30/2023 My experience here has been nothing short of transformative. I was referred to Dr. Veronika Reznova by a friend who was glowing after just one of her treatments. I struggle with scarring left from cystic acne and have tried everything from laser treatments to topical creams without much success. I love Veronika's holistic approach, mixing acupuncture and micro-needling to heal the body from the inside out. The ambiance in her space is calm and nurturing, similar to Veronika herself. She is knowledgeable, compassionate and truly gifted, which is apparent through her work. I always leave feeling balanced and new. I am more in touch with my body, my emotional well-being and my road to healing (inside and out) because of her. As for my skin, I went from never leaving the house without a full face of makeup to loving my skin for the first time. - 5/3/2023 I had a very positive experience with Dr. Sanders during my session for lower back pain. He actively listened to my concerns and provided a comprehensive assessment of my condition. Dr. Sanders suggested using his dynamic stretching technique that proved to be highly effective in reducing my discomfort. He was attentive to my needs and took the time to explain everything he was doing and why. In my opinion, Dr. Sanders is a highly skilled and compassionate physical therapist. He clearly cares about his patients and goes the extra mile to help them feel better. If you're dealing with muscle pain or injuries, I suggest considering Dr. Sanders as a fantastic option for physical therapy. He also loves to dance and is happy to chat to you about it. - 9/7/2023 I highly recommend Dr. Veronika Reznova's services. I have been seeing her for my chronic hip pain, neck pain, and insomnia for the past few years. Since I started seeing her, my quality of life has improved significantly. Thanks to her treatments, I can now walk without pain, and her prescribed herbal formulas have greatly improved my sleep quality. Dr. Reznova is not only empathetic and a great listener but also genuinely cares for every patient who walks through her door. - 7/27/2023 Dr. Kim Drolet helped me massively with post-covid symptoms. After trying so much on my own, I just wasn't getting better. Nausea, cough, headache, fatigue, and phlegm wouldn't leave. Through herbs and acupuncture I've turned a huge corner. Don't wait, get the help. - 7/8/2023 I trust this place . Herbs are quality and they can custom make them for your patients needs... - 7/1/2023 I followed Vanessa Megulhao here and I cannot say enough about how amazing she is. I have been getting acupuncture regularly for about 5 years for various chronic pain, stress/anxiety, in my life - and Vanessa has an incredibly special intuition and practice of knowing where to best put the needles that activates the most \"chi\". I like strong needles where I can feel the process moving (Vanessa can also be gentle) and her cupping technique is similarly fantastic. She also incorporates essential oils, massage, sound healing bowls, etc. that sets the tone and mood. I recently started getting reiki with my session which has turned it up a notch - I truly feel like I am in a deep meditative state. She is very passionate about the practice, healing her patients, and about the emotional self. She also has experience and education in healing trauma. She is incredible! - 8/1/2023 I recently had my first acupuncture treatment here with Dr. Andres Velasquez. As a long time acupuncture patient, I can say my experience as a patient under his care was nothing shy of amazing. I felt heard, seen, and attended to. I have suffered with anxiety and depression since my teenage years. I've tried many solutions to find relief for this emotional distress but most things just don't cut it. One of Dr. Velasquez' specialties is treating mental/emotional disorders and it shows. Since our session I have felt a re-connection with my inner self. If you're looking for a nourishing treatment from a caring and skillful practitioner, this is your sign to see Andres ! I can't wait for my next appointment. - 6/20/2023 Dr. Kim is an amazing, compassionate and empathetic acupuncturist. She helped me calm my anxiety and helped the energy move in my body after I sustained a head injury and concussion. She did everything to make me feel comfortable and was caring and patient. 10/10 - 1/31/2023Updated review I came in to see Dr. Kelsi Sando with shoulder and back pain, for a cupping appointment. This was my first experience with cupping and Dr. Sando took the time to make me feel comfortable, explain the process, and discuss the areas I needed work on. After the appointment I felt significant pain relief in my shoulders and back. The treatment left me relaxed and tension free. Highly recommend!8/11/2022Previous review Dr. Kelsi Sando is amazing! I came in with neck and shoulder pain and she took the time to hear my concerns and tailor her treatment. My very first acupuncture treatment was with Dr. Sando, and she made sure to make the experience comfortable and informative. Highly recommend! - 4/28/2023 Been seeing Dr. Ram and Dr. Kim Drolet for years and they have helped me with issues that were deemed \"chronic and incurable\" by Western medicine standards. They are a incredible at what they do and I highly recommend them!
