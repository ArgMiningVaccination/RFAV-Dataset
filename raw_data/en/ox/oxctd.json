While the best way to prevent smallpox is to get vaccinated, the vaccine isn't available to the public unless an outbreak occurs. Steps Protecting Yourself from Contamination - 1Stay away from anyone who may have the smallpox virus. Smallpox travels through the air via coughing and sneezing. Typically, this occurs during face-to-face contact with someone who has smallpox. Additionally, it might also spread through contaminated items. If you suspect someone has symptoms of smallpox or may work in a lab that handles the virus, avoid contact with that individual.

[[4]](#_note-4)X Research source - Some facilities are still studying smallpox to try to find new treatments and preventative vaccines. - 2Wash new and used clothing and linens before using them. Fabrics may become contaminated if they're exposed to the virus or an infected person. Contact with contaminated items can transmit the virus to you, so always wash fabric items that you purchase before you use them. [[5]](#_note-5)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Keep in mind that the risk of you getting smallpox is almost non-existent, so try not to worry. However, washing new fabrics can protect you in the event of an outbreak or act of bioterrorism. - 3Wear gloves when caring for someone who has a suspicious rash. Smallpox is only contagious while the patient has a rash. While it's unlikely you'll encounter someone with smallpox, wear gloves while treating someone who has a rash so you have peace of mind. This may help you avoid coming into contact with infectious pus from the rash. [[6]](#_note-6)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - For instance, you might put on gloves while cleaning up common spaces if someone you know has a rash, or while applying cream to a family member who has a rash. - The pus that oozes from a smallpox rash can transmit the virus. - 4Check the news daily so you're aware of possible reports of an outbreak. Since smallpox is considered eradicated world-wide, any reports of infection will likely make the national news. Additionally, acts of bioterrorism will be widely reported. Review the news and current events daily so you're aware of smallpox concerns and can take action to protect yourself. - Try not to worry because it's unlikely that smallpox will reappear. However, there's no harm in being informed. Tip: Set a Google alert for \"smallpox\" so you're immediately notified of any reports about it.Advertisement Seeking Medical Care - 1Get vaccinated against smallpox if an outbreak occurs. The smallpox vaccine protects you from getting the disease and may help you get less sick if you've already been exposed to the virus. As of 2019, the smallpox vaccine isn't available to the public because the virus is considered eradicated. However, the vaccine does exist and is available in case of an outbreak. Visit your local public health department or check with the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to find out more about where to receive the vaccination. [[7]](#_note-7)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Smallpox vaccinations are not commonly carried by minute-clinics or standard hospitals. - If you get vaccinated before you're exposed to smallpox, you'll likely be immune to it. If you're vaccinated within 3 days of exposure, you may not get the virus and should have a minor case if you do get sick. If vaccinated 4-7 days after exposure, you may avoid getting sick or might have a less severe case. - You might experience side effects from the vaccine, some of which are serious. Typical side effects include a sore arm, fever, and body aches. Rarely, the vaccine may cause a life-threatening reaction. If you have a heart condition, ask your doctor if it's best to forego the vaccine, as it can cause heart complications. [[8]](#_note-8)X Research source Variation: If you may be considered high-risk for infection, talk to your medical provider to find out if you might be eligible for a new vaccine that prevents smallpox and monkeypox. Typically, military personal, medical providers, and other first responders are considered high risk.

While it's very unlikely that you'll ever contract smallpox, it's helpful to know the symptoms. If you notice symptoms of smallpox, get vaccinated immediately to potentially reduce the severity of your case. Here is the typical disease progression: [[10]](#_note-10)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Days 1-17: Incubation period with no symptoms. - Days 10-14: Fever, body aches, severe back pain, headache, severe fatigue, and possible vomiting. - Days 10-19: A rash of flat red spots appear on your face, hands, forearms, and torso. - Days 18-27: Blisters start to form on the red spots and eventually start oozing and scab over. - 3Visit your doctor if you suspect you have smallpox. Tell your doctor that you're concerned about smallpox to help them make a diagnosis. Healthcare providers are trained to spot the disease because they'll be the first responders in the event of an outbreak. If you do have smallpox, your doctor will need to quarantine you and notify public health officials.

Public health officials have a plan to protect the public against a possible outbreak. [[12]](#_note-12)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Many clinicians have not seen cases of smallpox since it's been eradicated, so they may not recognize the lesions. - Because smallpox has been eradicated, even 1 infection is considered a worldwide concern. Public health officials have a plan to protect the public against a possible outbreak. Responding to an Outbreak - 1Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) while treating smallpox. Protect yourself from the airborne virus by wearing a filtering disposable respirator. Cover your body with a disposable paper gown. Additionally, put on safety glasses and gloves to keep blood and bodily fluids away from your eyes and off of your skin. Then, remove your PPE and throw it away before you leave the patient's room. [[13]](#_note-13)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)US Occupational Safety and Health Administration U.S. government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards [Go to source](#) - It's important to wear your PPE even if you've been vaccinated. It provides you more protection from the virus and prevents you from spreading it beyond the patient's room. - 2Disinfect surfaces using a disinfectant that kills the vaccinia virus. While no disinfectant is approved for the smallpox virus, the vaccinia virus is similar to the Variola virus that causes smallpox. Choose a disinfectant that's labeled for use on the vaccinia virus, then follow the directions on the packaging to apply the disinfectant to surfaces that may be contaminated with the smallpox virus. [[14]](#_note-14)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - Make sure you apply the right concentration of disinfectant and leave it on the surfaces for the correct amount of time. - 3Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to clean carpets and fabrics. Run the vacuum over the carpet or fabric to clean it. Once you're finished vacuuming, place the bag in a sealable plastic disposal container. Then, place the plastic bag in your regular solid waste container. [[15]](#_note-15)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - If your HEPA filter is installed correctly, don't worry about disinfecting the vacuum. If you suspect the HEPA filter is not working properly, use the disinfectant to clean the vacuum. - 4Wash laundry in hot water and avoid shaking it around. Gently handle laundry touched by smallpox patients because shaking it can disperse germs into the air. When you wash the laundry, set the washing machine on the hottest setting. Ideally, the water temperature should reach 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C) to kill the virus. [[16]](#_note-16)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) - While handling the laundry, always wear PPE to protect you from the virus. - 5Package waste from smallpox patients in appropriate containers. Smallpox is a Category A infectious substance, so contaminated waste must be handled carefully. All waste, including PPE, must be packaged safely for disposal or disease inactivation. Follow your hospital protocols or call your local public health officials to ensure that you're properly handling waste materials. [[17]](#_note-17)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services [Go to source](#) Variation: You can also incinerate trash if you don't have access to appropriate disposal containers. - 6Limit access to healthcare facilities to people who are vaccinated. It's important to prevent the further spread of smallpox if there's an outbreak. Since the virus spreads through the air, it's essential that unvaccinated people avoid areas where patients are being treated. Place security outside hospitals and clinics that are treating smallpox patients to limit access to the facilities.
