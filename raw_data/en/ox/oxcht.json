Vaccines are now being distributed to stop the infectious spread and halt fatalities. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first mRNA-based vaccine introduced to boost immunity against COVID-19; however, it could lead to various adverse reactions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of Pfizer vaccine side effects among participants. Methods This was a multicenter cross-sectional study that was performed using a non-probability sampling method. The study period was about six months from March 1, 2022, to August 31, 2022. A total of 1000 participants who received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine met the inclusion criteria. Demographic details of participants, for example, gender, age, comorbidities, Pfizer vaccine with both doses along with booster dose, previous exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, and the incidence of any local and systemic side effects following the first and second doses of vaccine, were reported. Results The study findings showed that out of 1000 participants, 644 (64.4%) were males and 356 (35.6%) were females; their mean age was 43.06\u00b114.98 years. Among them, 280 (28.0%) had hypertension and 356 (35.6%) had diabetes. Following the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, burning at the injection site and fever were the most commonly reported side effects in 704 (70.4%) and 700 (70.0%) participants, respectively.
