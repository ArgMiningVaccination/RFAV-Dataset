Soon, I began to feel chills.....this prompted checking my temperature to find a slight fever. So, the usual response: a couple Tylenol at bedtime, follow Alison's advisement to begin megadosing with specific supplements, and the usual expectation of feeling fine in the morning. Over the past four years, due in very large part to Alison's naturopathic care and counsel, my health has been excellent and I feel more energetic on a daily basis than I did twenty years ago; so given that, my expectation was this was nothing to worry about. Getting up in the morning, I knew immediately that this was not going to be \"business as usual.\" The aching feeling was far worse and my temperature had climbed up overnight. So, \"Plan B\" was now in effect: cancel all my appointments, rest, hydrate, continue the supplements, and break out the chicken soup.....and my expectation now was this would all pass in a day. Since I had been to the bookstore over the weekend, I had a new book to read and so all seemed set for my day. I had no idea how the world around me was changing at that moment. Later in the day, I awoke from a nap and checked my temperature, which was still slightly above 100 and more or less unchanged. This was looking like a very atypical bout with something viral. Wrapped in a yoga blanket, I sat down to watch the news and catch up on what was going on.....and this is when I was bombarded with the news about the COVID-19 crisis coming to full bloom around me. School closures, event cancellations, and, unbelievably, the cancellation of \"March Madness\" (a former basketball player, one of my guilty pleasures is binging on the college basketball tournaments) were being given the kind of media coverage that always seems to be designed to hyperinflate the perception of the situation. Clearly, we had a different kind of \"March Madness\" on our hands now......and even though I had just posted an article on our website blog that was basically saying \"it is not time to panic\", I could feel those subtle tendrils of fear beginning to wind their way around my thoughts. I began second guessing every little symptom that I was feeling and checking them against the information on the CDC and WHO websites. Even though common sense was clearly indicating I was not experiencing the onset of COVID-19, the doubt that had crept in wouldn't go away. Clearly, it was time to act and so my appointments for the next two days were cancelled.....no sense in going \"day by day\" at this point and a more aggressive mindset was needed in order to not fall into \"victim thinking.\" I took stock of all my provisions and clearly there was no need for anything, so I was ready to do my own version of \"self-sequestering\" at home. I wiped down all the touch surfaces in my house, broke out the bottles of hand sanitizer, hand washed like I was scrubbing up for surgery, and became acutely aware of how much touching my face I was trying not to do. And throughout it all, that voice of doubt kept whispering in my ear \"what if I'm wrong?\" The next two days seemed to be like walking in molasses......everything slower than what I would like it to be and not making much in the way of discernible progress. Was this fever ever going to finally break? Why wasn't everything going the way I was expecting it to go? Was the fever persisting because this was more than just a virus? Should I go get tested? And watching the news on TV was not helping things as I could see the panic that was starting to creep in, not just far away somewhere else but right around the corner. Finally, some progress....as I entered into day four, my temperature was creeping down slowly, finally below 100. I wasn't aching anymore and felt pretty much okay, except for the temperature. Alison had been checking in on me frequently and now some of my clients were texting to check up on me. The fear and doubt were beginning to fade away. I began to understand the nature of fear and how it can get a hold on us and not let go easily. I was thinking a lot about a line from one of my favorite books, \"Dune\" by Frank Herbert. Specifically, it was a mantra that stated \"fear is the great mind killer....I will face my fear and pass through my fear.\" Writing has always been good therapy for me, so I wrote out our office COVID-19 response to be posted on our website. After reading it, I made some revisions and then texted it out to all of our clients. The biggest revision was that I expressed my thoughts, saying: \"The most important thing that we can do is step out in faith each day, maintaining a positive outlook and responding, not reacting to changes with common sense and good judgement. No one at this point can say with any assurance of accuracy as to how long this situation will last. Humanity has a pretty good track record for panic, but also in those moments of panic, our best self can emerge. Let us all take a moment to find that center within ourselves where our best self can be found and allow it to come forth.\" Finally, that night my fever broke. The next day I awoke to a normal temperature. I was going to stay home again; it was Saturday, normally a very full day in the office for me. But I was now thinking it was best to give myself 24 hours to observe and monitor the stability of my temperature: no sense in rushing to \"get back to normal\" and have that rebound on me and expose others to any potential risk. I cleaned my house and, since the weather was warm and clear, took several short walks to get some exercise, which I had not been able to do for the past four days. I had received several text responses from my clients who were saying they very much appreciated the message I had written at the end of of my text that I had sent out the night before. Now it is Monday. I feel fine, but the world is different. There still is that sense of fear and panic all about us. I have seen the barren shelves in my local grocery store where toilet paper, paper towels, sanitary wipes, and bottled water used to be. I watch as people attempt \"social distancing\" and find it awkward. I'm still trying not to touch my face. Where is this all going to go? I don't have a clue. My gut feeling is that in a month everything will be different....I just can't say in what way. Whatever the direction, I am resolved that I will face my fear and I will pass through it. And I send out my heart energy to surround and support humanity so that we may all do the same. "}
