She aspires to always create a relationship of trust, and works closely with her clients to develop a treatment plan that will ensure sustainable results. Sihem Baaboud's Education and Experience In 2017 Sihem graduated from the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Ost\u00e9opathie in Paris and the Centre d'Ost\u00e9opathie, Atman, in France. Her training involved a six-year Osteopathy program followed by a one-year research paper. Her chosen subject was pregnant people who suffered GERD and reflux during their pregnancy. The program included Manual Therapies, Cranial Osteopathy, Visceral Osteopathy, exercises, stretches and adjustments. Sihem Baaboud has had the opportunity to work with a large spectrum of health concerns both at the clinic within her school and in private practice following graduation. These include: Headaches Neck and back pain Whiplash Head traumas Sports injuries Postural issues Digestive trouble Stress, anxiety and depression Pre- and post-natal Pediatrics and more....

Sihem Baaboud's Journey Sihem grew up being fascinated by the world of health and with the desire to help people become pain free. She was drawn to pursue training in Osteopathy because this manual therapy allows her to care for all types of clients, at any time of their life. In addition, what interested her most at the time was that Osteopathy allows a holistic and global approach to the human body. Following her graduation, she practiced for one year in France before deciding to discover new cultures. Her goal was to open herself to new experiences in order to enrich herself, and to expand her osteopathic knowledge. She lived in Montreal for 3 years and discovered that Osteopathy is not so well known or appreciated here in Canada, and that it was necessary to promote this natural medicine for its enormous benefits. In 2022, wanting to live closer to nature, and discover other living environments, she made the move to Ottawa.

In this way we can truly thrive. Christine Hager - Natural Allergy Therapist Christine uses this in combination with manual muscle testing and dowsing to determine the underlying root cause(s) for her client's health concerns. From there, she uses a system of acupressure and laser acupuncture to calm the central nervous system in the presence of the allergen and release stagnant emotional barriers. This reprograms the body from the energy mismatch which no longer serves it. If the body is in need of additional support for underlying infections, nutrient deficiencies, structural imbalances or emotional blockages Christine Hager is equipped to evaluate and recommend the right match for your body's current healing needs. Christine Hager - Acupressure and Cupping Practitioner Her training in Acupuncture and Cupping at the The International Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine and in Holistic Nutrition are well used in her clinical analysis of health history, diet and presenting symptoms. Christine Hager discovered the International College of Healing Arts in 2011 whilst living in New York. Under the guidance of Ken Campbell (NP) she took courses in Energy Kinesiology, and perfected her skill in the muscle testing and associated modalities. The meridian system and related acupuncture points that she learned about during the Energy Kinesiology course at the International College of Healing Arts fascinated her. This led her to undertake the Acupuncture Practitioner program at The International Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Having graduated in 2019, her approach to treating allergies and to healing includes the 5 Element Theory, Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis techniques, Emotions and her extended knowledge of acupuncture points and the meridians.

He has become disillusioned with traditional medical approaches that provide a band-aid strategy to mask symptoms. His passion is in relieving symptoms now whilst discovering the underlying or root cause of those symptoms and, in so doing, educating his clients to bring about real, deep, permanent healing. Dominick Hussey - Osteopathic Manual Practitioner In 1997, he graduated with an honours degree in Osteopathic Medicine and a diploma in Naturopathy from the British School of Osteopathic and Naturopathic Medicine in north London. His first position was at the Aston Clinic in South West London. The clinic was owned by David Melrose, an Osteopath, Herbalist and Applied Kinesiologist. Watching David's work, he became fascinated by the Applied Kinesiology or muscle testing that David would use on his clients. This inspired Dominick to attend a course with the International College of Applied Kinesiology. The main reason why Dominick loved AK so much was that it gave him a window into how he helped his clients. Up until that point, he applied the osteopathic techniques, and they helped his clients, but he did not how exactly. Through AK, he had a tool to understand how and, even better, to explore the deeper reason why people developed their physical problems. Over the next 12 years Dominick honed his AK skills. He learnt how to test for food allergies, nutritional deficiencies and emotional issues. Later he incorporated NAET Allergy therapy into his practice. NAET is a technique that uses AK and acupressure to diagnose and treat food and environmental allergies. Dominick Hussey - Functional Medicine Practitioner Dominick had always been interested in the Root Cause of his client's issues. He has studied with many sources, online and in-person, including Dr. Dan Kalish, Dr. Michael Ruscio and Dr. Mark Hyman. Dr. Jared Gerston of Restore Chiropractic introduced him to Proprioceptive Deep Tendon Reflex (PDTR) therapy, based on Functional Neurology. In 2019 he added this to his osteopathic practice. PDTR uses muscle function testing to diagnose and treat the effects of physical and emotional trauma on the body. The technique has given Dominick the tools to help people in a much deeper way than before. Dominick Hussey at Home He lives in the country with Sue. He loves to listen to music, good food, spending time with friends and with his rescue cats.

She believes that there is never just one way of working with clients. While dealing with her own health issues she found great benefits from an integrative approach to medicine. In particular, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Acupuncture and herbs, Shiatsu, Massage Therapy, Cranio-Sacral Treatments and Clinical Hypnotherapy. To understand how all of these modalities work and what they do, she has studied them extensively and brings them to her practice with clients. Her belief is that healing involves conscious living and that taking responsibility for personal growth and health is our privilege. Magda Leszczynska - Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Magda Leszczynska is a Registered Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner and Acupuncturist, and Registered Massage Therapist. She practices CranioSacral and SomatoEmotional Therapies. The aspect of energy or Qi (including emotions) as a source of disease and healing was always fascinating to her. In order to properly treat their patients, in ancient China, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Doctors diagnosed not only the physical body for physical blockages that create pain and discomfort but the Spirit and Psyche. According to TCM, the Spirit, known in the Western World as Mind, lives in blood, and the Psyche, according to TCM is a Spirit that lives and is different in each vital organ. These Spirits can be understood as personality types in modern psychology. By addressing and diagnosing the body, mind and spirit it is possible to offer deeper healing on the physical level and to prevent the mind from having a negative influence on our DNA. Qi is known in other cultures simply as energy. Magda is practicing Energy Medicine in various forms of this wide range modality. Magda Leszczynska - Intuitive Life Coach She is Medical Intuitive and offers consultations in person and via Zoom based on readings of chakras, the energy field inside and outside the body, mind patterns, lineage, traumas, past lives, emotions, etc. Magda Leszczynska studied Inka Shamanism under the patronage of Dr. Alberto Villoldo of The Four Winds Society. She was born with natural gifts of intuition, communication with the spirit world, and all living beings. Magda offers her clients to understand the connection between thoughts and feelings and where they are coming from. This is the process to understand ancient wisdom and healing by energy only. Book with her for an Intuitive Life Coach session and discover this powerful approach to healing. Magda Leszczynska - Teacher Magda is passionate about her work and sharing TCM knowledge in the last 10 years. She was a faculty member and TCM Program Director at the International Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, currently, she holds the position of Acupuncture and TCM Herbal Medicine program coordinator.

Sandra Schwerzmann will help you improve your body's health, mental health, soul's, and spirit's well-being. She wants you to regain your optimal health, so you can recover your full potential and cope with all aspects of your life; physical, psychological and emotional. Sandra Schwerzmann's Approach Together you will holistically assess your health concerns. She believes that body, mind and soul are interconnected, and to achieve true healing, they must be addressed and balanced. To look at only one area will not bring long-term healing. With the help of Applied Kinesiology (Muscle Testing), Sandra can identify the underlying causes of your health concerns and the best approach to resolve them. This testing is a tool to access the subconscious and the body's wisdom. Sandra then discusses the findings with you, and you determine the best approach together. Please note: While Sandra is qualified and experienced in various Applied Kinesiology techniques, she is not a licensed Kinesiologist in Ontario. Training and Experience Sandra Schwerzmann is a Certified and Registered Complementary Therapist in Kinesiology with the OdA KT in Switzerland.

Utt - Integrative Kinesiology of Rosemarie Sonderegger - Touch for Health of Dr. John F. Thie - Brain Gym of Dr. Paul Dennison - Wellness Kinesiology of Dr. Wayne Topping Who is Sandra Schwerzmann? Born in Switzerland, Sandra was an active, highly motivated child. She loved to paddle, be outside, ski, and be with her friends. She also has a passion for reading, handcrafting and gardening. As she entered her teens, her canoeing became more serious. She started to compete almost every weekend, training intensively, investing a lot of energy into her performance, and learning to deal with both success and failure. During her career, she was several times Swiss champion, won medals at European and World Championships and participated twice in the Olympic Games. When not competing or training, she worked as a High School teacher for children 10-13 years old, finding it both inspiring and demanding. Sandra then married and gave birth to 2 children, a boy and a girl, born prematurely. She left work to become a full-time mum. After 17yrs, her marriage ended, and she decided it was never too late to follow a new path to stand by her dreams and passions. Discovering Applied Kinesiology, she found a meaningful system to help others in a way that made so much sense to her. She founded her clinic in Switzerland and continued to work part-time as a teacher. She was also integral to a search and rescue team with her highly trained Belgian Shepherd dog, Yuma. Sandra met and married her second husband, a Western Medicine Specialist in Switzerland. They came to Canada in 2023 when he was offered a hospital position in Ottawa.

She gains great satisfaction in seeing her clients grow, heal and improve their quality of life. Using a combination of Functional / Root Cause Medicine, Natural Allergy Therapy and Energy Healing she facilitates her clients' journeys to health. Sue has been interested in the healing arts from a young age. She is also intensely interested in energy medicine, and has a long time, deep curiosity about the spiritual world, the natural world and all aspects of nature. Her parents were both in the Western medical field so she was exposed to healthcare from the day she was born. She also soon came to realize that Western medicine did not have all the answers. Her introduction to health beyond Western medicine came when, in 2001, she started having a series of health issues including digestive upset, sinusitis, extreme fatigue, palpitations and then panic attacks. Her family doctor diagnosed Irritable Bowel Syndrome and low thyroid (hypothyroidism)... she asked what causes it, he simply said \"could be anything..\" And gave her meds. Not very helpful... A friend suggested allergies. A simple test identified a number of allergens. Once avoided her symptoms greatly improved. Sue has also completed a degree in Environmental Sciences before becoming a front line police officer in the Royal Parks in London, England. Sue Taylor - Natural Allergy Therapist The next step of her journey came in 2003 when Sue Taylor met her future husband, Dominick Hussey. He was undergoing NAET allergy treatment, and went on to complete the training and to treat her for her allergies. Amazed by the way in which the treatment cleared her allergies, and knowing it was time to leave the police, she decided to attend training in 2004. She has been practicing as a Natural Allergist since then. The next big change came in 2005 when, at the age of 39, she was diagnosed with breast cancer requiring surgery and some additional treatment. This experience brought her up short, and made her re-evaluate herself and her life. She met it with no fear or anger, deciding this was not a battle or a war to be fought and won. It was a wonderful learning opportunity, a gift to be met with thanks, gratitude and an open mind as to what she could learn. She still sees this as a gift, the best thing that ever happened to her. And so her inner work began. Sue Taylor - Energy Healer Sue Taylor's intense curiosity about the spiritual world and energy medicine would have to wait until she relocated to Ottawa in 2009. There she met her long time mentor, a Shaman and teacher of Eastern Tantra. He opened the door onto a whole new world and she continues to see him regularly for her own healing and for her learning. Since then she has studied various energy modalities, achieved Reiki Level 3 and spent time with a First Nations Elder and Healer. She continues with her own inner journey, and to work to improve her feel with energy medicine. Sue Taylor at Home Sue lives out of town with her husband and their rescue cats. She enjoys the outdoors, walking, yoga, skiing, spending time with her horses Dragoon and Kenzie, cooking and socializing with friends.
