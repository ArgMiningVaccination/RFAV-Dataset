[Science & Tech](/Science-Tech) compounds](https://www.britannica.com/science/organic-compound), [derivatives](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/derivatives) of which are used in modern [medicine](https://www.britannica.com/science/medicine) primarily as [skeletal muscle](https://www.britannica.com/science/skeletal-muscle) relaxants, being administered concomitantly with general [anesthesia](https://www.britannica.com/science/anesthesia) for certain types of [surgeries](https://www.britannica.com/science/surgery-medicine), particularly those of the chest and the abdomen. Curare is of botanical origin; its sources include various tropical American [plants](https://www.britannica.com/plant/plant) (primarily Chondrodendron species of the family Menispermaceae and Strychnos species of the family Loganiaceae). Crude preparations of curare have long been used as arrow [poisons](https://www.britannica.com/science/poison-biochemistry) to aid in the capture of wild game by the Indians of [South America](https://www.britannica.com/place/South-America). The name curare is the European interpretation of an Indian word meaning \"poison\"; the Indian word has been rendered variously as ourara, urali, urari, woorali, and woorari. dark brown to [black mass](https://www.britannica.com/topic/black-mass) with a sticky to hard consistency and an aromatic, [tarry](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/tarry) odour. Crude preparations of curare were classified according to the containers used for them: pot curare in earthenware jars, tube calabash curare in [gourds](https://www.britannica.com/plant/gourd). Tube curare was the most toxic form, typically being prepared from the woody vine [Strychnos toxifera](https://www.britannica.com/plant/Strychnos-toxifera). In modern medicine, curare is classified as a neuromuscular blocking agent\u2014it produces flaccidity in skeletal [muscle](https://www.britannica.com/science/muscle) by competing with the [neurotransmitter](https://www.britannica.com/science/neurotransmitter) [acetylcholine](https://www.britannica.com/science/acetylcholine) at the [neuromuscular junction](https://www.britannica.com/science/neuromuscular-junction) (the site of chemical communication between a [nerve fibre](https://www.britannica.com/science/axon) and a muscle cell). Acetylcholine normally acts to stimulate muscle contraction; hence, competition at the neuromuscular junction by curare prevents nerve impulses from activating skeletal muscles. The major outcome of that competitive activity is profound relaxation (comparable only to that produced by spinal anesthesia). Relaxation begins in the muscles of the toes, [ears](https://www.britannica.com/science/ear), and [eyes](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-eye) and progresses to the muscles of the [neck](https://www.britannica.com/science/neck-anatomy) and limbs and, finally, to the muscles involved in [respiration](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/respiration). In fatal doses, death is caused by respiratory [paralysis](https://www.britannica.com/science/paralysis). The principal alkaloid responsible for the pharmacological action of curare preparations is [tubocurarine](https://www.britannica.com/science/tubocurarine), first isolated from tube curare in 1897 and obtained in crystalline form in 1935. Tubocurarine chloride (as d-tubocurarine chloride), isolated from the [bark](https://www.britannica.com/science/bark-plant-tissue) and [stems](https://www.britannica.com/science/stem-plant) of the South American vine Chondrodendron tomentosum, was the form initially used in medicine. It was first used for general anesthesia in 1942, as the commercial preparation intocostrin. A purer product, tubarine, was made available several years later. Although highly effective as a muscle relaxant, tubocurarine also caused significant [hypotension](https://www.britannica.com/science/hypotension) (a drop in [blood pressure](https://www.britannica.com/science/blood-pressure)), which limited its use. It has been largely replaced by various curare-like drugs, including atracurium, pancuronium, and vecuronium. In addition to inducing skeletal muscle relaxation under general anesthesia, certain curare alkaloids are widely employed as relaxants to [facilitate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facilitate) endotracheal intubation (the insertion of a tube into the windpipe to keep the upper airway open in a person who is unconscious or unable to breathe on his or her own). The drugs have also been used to relieve various muscular contractions and [convulsions](https://www.britannica.com/science/convulsion), such as those that occur in [tetanus](https://www.britannica.com/science/tetanus-disease). Patients with neuromuscular disorders such as [myasthenia gravis](https://www.britannica.com/science/myasthenia-gravis), in which acetylcholine activity is already reduced, are highly sensitive to the effects of curare-like drugs. Curare alkaloids produce their effects with a minimal concentration of [anesthetic](https://www.britannica.com/science/anesthetic) agent, which allows patients to recover promptly and reduces the risk of postoperative [pneumonias](https://www.britannica.com/science/pneumonia) and other complications associated with surgery under general anesthesia. Their effects also can be reversed by the administration of an [anticholinesterase](https://www.britannica.com/science/anticholinesterase) such as neostigmine, which prevents the destruction of "}
