Launched/branded in 2007 Originally composed of the IPWG Has evolved from a single program to an umbrella of multiple programs, IBI, KBI-ENG, KBI-FR, Club Boost employs 15 staff/contractors, including nursing, teachers, tech, social media experts, marketers, creative design, editors, fundraisers Definitions Information - knowledge obtained from investigation, study, or instruction Misinformation - incorrect or misleading information - AKA Fake News Disinformation - false information deliberately and often covertly spread (as by the planting of rumors) in order to influence public opinion or obscure the truth - AKA Fake News Infodemic - too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak Sources of Misinformation - Pre COVID Internet Video sharing, Social Media - YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Healthcare Professionals (less likely) Peer group - friends, family, Interest groups Public forums - reddit comment section Schools/academia (limited) Independent Media (varying) Industry (to market products) General media communication - one-off reports (very limited) Sources of Misinformation - Pandemic Era Everything from Pre-Pandemic X100 + Foreign national PH agencies/governments Government/ Public Health - Politicians/officials Main Stream/Independent Media = INFODEMIC Examples of Misinformation Examples of Misinformation Examples of Misinformation Examples of Misinformation Examples of Misinformation Examples of Misinformation What is the root of misinformation Historically abundant - \"History is written by the victors\" 'Fishing tales' - EXAGERATION Time In the absence of gov't/public health transparency, the People, will seek answers, find truth, look ... ...and if left without correction can cause serious societal harm Misinformation is born from bad communication Conscious and subconscious Are we guilty? OUR INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGE Canada has no infrastructure, policy or plan to address misinformation in the health sector Nationally Coordinated strategy and related activities in response to the COVID-19 infodemic is spread across multiple government departments and agencies (Health Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada) Provide resources on COVID-19 disease, track misinformation and its impact on vulnerable populations, monitor attitudes and behaviours as well as trust factors in government, fund interventions at the P/T level Provincial and Territorial Jurisdictions Jurisdictions have coordinated their own responses to the infodemic Stakeholders (NGOS, academic institutions etc.) Professional health and patient-centered organizations have addressed COVID-19 misinformation though communication strategies and coordinated responses CANADA'S PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATION CHALLENGE Public health does what it knows best - \"Let's talk about the facts\" Approach based on the knowledge deficit mode Repeatedly present the most rigorous scientific evidence available until the science wins over the intended audience Faced with a problem use rational solution and presented as the best science Infodemic - What does the future hold? WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE? HOW WE DEVELOPED POLICIES AROUND IMMUNIZATIONS? Our research was based on a review of past and recent health policies around immunization in Canada, North America ,Europe and Australia/NZ. Some of the conclusions around vaccination refusal or hesitation put the emphasis on the lack of dialogue and communications to allow patients to express their opinions or concerns. A continuum, from a compulsory model to a Canadian model that provides information and encourages immunization. SOME QUESTIONS T elling someone what to do is not enough How do we communicate? What is the way to convey important information? SOME INSIGHT FROM RESEARCH ON\" THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DRIVERS OF MISINFORMATION \" From :The psychological drivers of misinformation belief and its resistance to correction \"Misinformation has been identified as a major contributor to various contentious contemporary events ranging from elections and referendums to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not only can belief in misinformation lead to poor judgements and decision-making, it also exerts a lingering influence on people's reasoning after it has been corrected \u2014 an effect known as the continued influence effect. MISINFORMATION FLOW CHART Embrace the complexity of misinformation! What are some of the reasons out there... Conspir acies Distrust in g overnment Alterna tive Health Science Deniers Vaccines cause diseases Vaccines cause autism Vaccines contain mercury Vaccines contain 5G brain chips Immune system gets weaker Vaccines don't work Vaccines cause infertility Vaccines cause cancer Eating well is all you need to do to prevent diseases Too many vaccines in schedule Homeopathy Vaccines shed viruses Authorities are lying, we're not at risk Rushed. Not tested properly Government spying Big pharma gains Vaccines are used to control population Monetary profit Infringement on freedom Vaccines caused AIDS Diseases are not real Contain aborted fetuses Personal choice Vaccine safety/risks Negative personal, family, community experiences Guillain Barre Syndrome HPV vaccine promotes sex Lack of information Political agenda Against my religion Against my culture Historical influences Distrust in health care system New vaccine Vaccine ingredients are dangerous Cause developmental delay What are the responses to our current solutions? -We can analyze online debates to see how people will think through and incorporate pro-vaccine arguments -Findings: -Two kinds of misinformation -We aren't doing enough to combat both types T wo kinds of vaccine misinformation... Factually incorrect misinformation -\"Ivermectin cures COVID\" Misinformation that erodes trust -\"The CDC is hiding the real ecacy results of ivermectin\" -Can't fact check, distorts facts themselves -The deeper you go, the more the rst type of information also erodes trust -We identied 4 pillars of trust 1 2Four pillars of vaccine hesitancy 4 categories (+ religion) What can we do? Different Audiences, Different Needs 8 dierent types of vaccine deniers (extreme vaccine hesitancy) Unique motivations and beliefs Requires unique interventions and messages A solution came from embracing the complexity. Preventative focus How can we prevent individuals from being deceived by the second type of misinformation? How can we prevent people from developing a worldview that is supported by the four pillars? Everyone is vulnerable. This has been made clear through the pandemic. The causes of vulnerability to misinformation vary from individual to individual, are often complex and multi-factored\u00b9 Individual dierences impact how we reason with information and evidence, and how we evaluate - accept or reject scientic consensus\u00b2 Current solutions are not enough Presenting facts Teach how to check your sources How to identify misinformation Pause before you share A possible idea Solutions need to be reasonable, ideally adopting something that can be a simple habit Target people when they are most vulnerable to misinformation which erodes trust Focus on the four pillars Provide information that tailor's to the individual's needs Ideal: Relatively short Easy to learn Fun Interesting enough to share What can we do? Proposed approach Emotion drives misinformation which erodes trust What if we recognize our emotional reaction (contrary to suppressing or regulating emotion)? There is signicant value in focusing on emotion when it comes to science related misinformation Hypothesize that n oticing our emotions and taking them into account, is one possible way to improve our judgment as a preventative strategy Supporting evidence Emotion can influence attitudes and how individuals process scientic issues and information\u00b9 Emotions have a tendency to activate our cognitive biases \u00b9 Previous research on information persuasiveness commonly suggests emotion as the origin to decision-making, judgement, and actions\u00b9\u00b9 Emotion is a strong driving force for believing and sharing information of any kind Emotional Appraisal Approach (EAA) The concept https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Newspaper-Headline STEP 1 Participants will go through a chosen set of various social media posts, headlines, stories, images etc. Each question will be based on each of the categories (4 overarching pillars) with some questions being a combination of the four together as well (eg. distrust in government plus conspiracy theory sentiment) STEP 2 Individual chooses one or more emotional reactions experienced AND level of emotion (eg. strong -> low) STEP 3 Participants will be placed under a vulnerability stream(s). This will be accomplished by adding the number of any given emotional reactions to a specific category (type of emotion does not matter). There can be multiple vulnerability streams a participant shows emotional reactions to (not limited to just one). STEP 4 Lastly, participants will be given further details regarding the results, explaining the particular vulnerability stream(s), and emphasizing EAA as a prevention opportunity for individuals to recognize emotions when reading and hearing information from any source or origin (eg. headlines, face-to-face interactions, news outlets, social media, etc.) EAA is an approach to be used in concert with other established interventions Presenting facts Teach how to check your sources How to identify misinformation Pause before you share Limitations For a certain audience this may not work (eg. those with strong opposing beliefs) Still at hypothesis stage Focuses on one aspect (emotion) that impacts individual's susceptibility to misinformation (thus recommended to be used in conjunction with other interventions) Embracing opportunity Least vaccine hesitant, but vulnerable Extreme vaccine hesitancy Opportunity Thank you!
