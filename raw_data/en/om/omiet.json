So much energy being released and at the same time we are trying to hold on to a stable frame of living and feels as if its all being dismantled. But is it paradoxically growth and chaos which are very similar in its process, change requires disruption, and how we manage it determines to what degree it can affect the quality of our lives. I mean our subjective scale of discomfort is not necessarily a standardized one. So, what I am saying is that there is a part in all of us, that when we are able to be there, we can let go of the stress in a fluid manner, then stress can be transient, situational or even with chronic situation we might be capable of distancing ourselves from the stress itself. There is part of our inner being that automatically does this for us, however most of us do not reside or have access to this part. Here might be some ideas to awaken that part in us. Please note, it is not easy, and even if we do experience it, it remains an impermanent state. One we need to practice frequently. Here are a few exercises to get us started. BALANCING THE BODY First, stand with eyes closed (5 seconds, 3 times) just become aware of the body coordinating itself to remain balanced. If you find yourself off balance, then stand by a chair and support your balance with one hand. Second, lift one leg up while holding on to a chair with two hands, then move to one hand and then, if possible, no hand while lifting your leg and knee upward and being still. NOW ITS ABOUT BREATHE The Yogic art of breathing is referred to as PRANAYAM, serves as a bridge between the physical (body) world to the intangible (spiritual) world. Simply put, breathe is life and our breathing is an intimate part of our living. Deep breathing is part of relaxing, shallow breathing can be associated with tension and fear. Many studies have shown that by regulating our breathing we can restore balance, create harmony, calm our fears reduce symptoms of anxiety and overall improve our health. In this brief exercise you may discover the variation with emotions and tension. 1. Sitali Pranayam is a form of breathing with our tongue curled. We breathe as if drinking through a straw, the cool breath serves to cool us down while adding moisture to our system. Sit in a comfortable pose. Breathe with the tongue curled (a \"U\" shape should be sticking outside the lips slightly), inhale through the rolled tongue(place tongue back in mouth) and exhale through the nose, continue for 3 minutes. Notice the difference and stay with the difference for one minute after completion. 2. Pranayam Breath to improve immunity. Sit in a comfortable pose, put your chin in and our chest out. With this exercise stick your tongue all the way out and keep it out as you rapidly breathe in and out through your mouth (this is called Dog Breath). Continue panting diaphragmatic breath for 3 minutes then inhale and hold your breathe for 15 seconds, exhale and repeat this sequence 2 more times. These exercises will help you to physically and mentally let go and will psychologically help to dissolve stress. PLEASE TRY! MORE ON BREATHE WORK next time. May your internal love, guide you in all you do. "}
