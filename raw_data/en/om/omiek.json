Workplaces, restaurants, and events are all safer when those who inhabit them are vaccinated. Fewer and fewer states have vaccine mandates (you can find an [updated list on AARP](https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/government-elections/info-2020/coronavirus-state-restrictions.html)), but nevertheless, some states offer mobile solutions to store proof of vaccination on your phone. The white cards that are issued with your first vaccination and updated for each successive one can be easily misplaced. And while there are many ways to [carry your card on your phone](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-carry-your-vaccination-card-on-your-phone), healthcare or state workers who have to follow regulations might be in need of an official state-approved app. Here's a list of the ones we've found; in some states, lawmakers and governors have moved to ban so-called vaccine passports. In states that have them, some let you store a digital copy of your card in the app, some give you a digital copy that you can save in other apps, and some give you access to a record that says you're vaccinated, which may or may not be accepted by a venue or workplace. Regulations that affect digital records change frequently. We'll do our best to keep this list updated, but if you want the latest information, it's a good bet that [your state's department of health website](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) has what you need to know.
