The results of human trials in Melbourne and San Francisco have been described as a \"game changer\" - not only because the drug woke up dormant HIV cells but because it was tolerated at high doses by patients. Having established how to wake up the HIV cells, researchers can now concentrate on the best way to kill them off: most likely by manipulating the body's immune system so it recognises and attacks infected cells. Dean Camilleri was among the 30 HIV-positive patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy who took part in the trial. The patients were given the drug Disulfiram, typically used to treat chronic alcoholism, in varying doses over three days. Mr Camilleri, 31, received the highest dose of 2 grams a day. The Doherty Institute's director Sharon Lewin said that was four-times the normal drug dose. However, the results, published in [The Lancet HIV](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/issue/current) on Tuesday, did not reveal any negative side effects. \"We saw that with participants who received the highest dose, the virus inside the cells increased and the virus inside the blood increased as well,\" she said. Professor Lewin said any treatment which resulted from the research would need two parts: one to \"wake up\" the dormant HIV cells and another to kill them off. She said the second stage was likely to involve a vaccine which triggered the immune system into action or a drug that boosts immune function such as Keytruda, better known as the drug [Ron Walker credits with saving his life](http://www.theage.com.au/national/health/ron-walkers-150000-cancer-drug-keytruda-approved-for-melanoma-patients-20150420-1more8.html?stb=twt) after a melanoma diagnosis. \"This is an important step as we have shown we can wake up the virus without significant toxicity,\" she said. Diagnosed 11 years ago, Mr Camilleri said the results were exciting. \"You don't want to get people's hopes up but I do hope that it helps people down the track,\" he said. Disulfiram works by blocking an enzyme involved in metabolising alcohol intake. It also produces unpleasant side effects such as a shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting and a headache when combined with alcohol in the body. Professor Lewin said using a drug already on the market had benefits to researchers because clinical trials can begin much sooner. \"Usually the time between a drug discovery and a clinical trial is about 20 years,\" she said. Head of clinical research at The Alfred's department of infectious diseases, Julian Elliott, said the findings were an important step towards finding a cure for HIV, which he described as \"a very smart virus\". An estimated 5722 Victorians live with HIV, according to the [Victorian AIDS Council](http://www.vac.org.au/hiv-fact-sheet), with most recent figures showing there were around 280 new diagnoses in 2011.
