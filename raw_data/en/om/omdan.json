The award goes to \"the teams behind the teams\" that make Friday nights special in Texas. Aldine High's training staff, under the direction of Head Athletic Trainer Kelly Smallbeck, will receive a commemorative plaque and $250 to buy supplies for the squad. Texas Children's Hospital partnered with Dave Campbell's Texas Football Magazine to make this program possible. Aldine High School head football coach Cirilo Ojeda said Smallbeck and her student trainers deserve the award. \"Our athletic training staff is the best in the business,\" Ojeda said. \"There is a huge balance of keeping our players safe, maintained with prehab and rehab, and ensuring they can compete to the best of their abilities. Our athletic training staff specializes in preventing, diagnosing, and treating muscle and bone injuries and illnesses at a very high level. The communication with student-athletes, parents, and administrators is phenomenal. Since coming to Aldine, we have worked collaboratively with the strength and conditioning program, and our number of season-ending injuries has decreased due to their level of knowledge and skill. We are fortunate to have this staff with Kelly Smallbeck as its leader.\" The student training includes senior Victoria Ochoa, juniors Carina Castillo, Crystal C\u00f3rdova, Nataly Ochoa, Keira Semien, Jocelyn Zepeda, sophomore Elennah Arce, and freshman Ariel Rodgers.
