Professional and consumer information helps you counsel with confidence.Natural Standard The Authority on Integrative Medicine Company Background Natural Standard was founded by clinicians and researchers to provide high quality , evidence-based information about complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to healthcare facilities and academic centers. Natural Standard includes contributors from hundreds of eminent clinical and research institutions. Natural Standard uses the most up-to-date, comprehensive systematic review methodology available. Rigorous fact- checking and multiple rounds of blinded multidisciplinary peer review are employed to assure information is accurate and unbiased. Natural Standard is the trusted resource of thousands of hospitals, government agencies, universities, manufacturers and retailers worldwide. Product Overview More than 1/3 of patients use CAM, yet many patients do not disclose their use of supplements or complementary modalities (e.g., chiropractic, acupuncture) because they doubt their healthcare providers' professional knowledge of the subject. The Natural Standard Professional Database helps promote a patient centered care model by providing high quality information on these therapies including statistical analysis of available clinical trials. Natural Standard offers patient handouts and comparative efficacy charts to aid clinicians, open lines of communication, and encourage patients to actively participate in their healthcare. Natural Standard helps providers obtain complete patient medication history profiles, which lead to better adherence to treatment regimens, patient awareness of health risks, and positive health outcomes. Healthcare organizations gain unique market advantage having this resource as evidenced by the growing number of integrative medicine centers within hospitals and retail pharmacies.
