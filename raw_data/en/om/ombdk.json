It doesn't seem to bother them that no homeopathic remedy has ever been shown to have a provable clinical effect. Or that responsible doctors think they're dangerous and prevent people from having proven treatments that would help them. Oh, they do have an effect on about one third of people susceptible to the placebo effect. But unlikely homeopathic beliefs such as treating illnesses with water that has \"memory\" has led the head of the [NHS](https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nhs), Simon Stevens, to ask the health service Professional Standards Authority (PSA) to drop the Society of Homeopaths from its official register of professional organisations. He believes its inclusion sends a false message to patients that homeopathic remedies are as safe and effective as clinically-tested medicines.

In a letter urging the PSA not to re-accredit the society in its annual review, he says he has \"serious concerns\" about the society's inclusion because the practice of homeopathy remains \"fundamentally flawed\".

He says: \"This is a vital issue at a time when there is a rise of misinformation about vaccines - some of which are apparently promoted by homeopaths - and which poses a significant danger to human health.\" The Society of Homeopathy's official stance on vaccinations is that homeopaths shouldn't advise patients against the use of jabs, as this would be \"unethical\". But some clearly frighten people enough to become vaccine-hesitant, a dangerous practice where parents and children are affected. The PSA, which reviews the accreditation of all organisations on its register every 12 months, said it would not comment on any \"live cases\" involving \"applications under assessments\". But Michael Marshall, of pro-science charity Good Thinking, said: \"Any organisation or any practitioner who is spreading anti-vax myths is particularly dangerous right now. \"There's no such thing as an effective homeopathic vaccine - so for homeopaths to advocate them leaves patients criminally vulnerable to potentially "}
