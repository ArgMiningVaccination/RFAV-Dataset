Reducing the spread of the flu is more important than ever. Flu shots can be safely given at the same time or at any time before or after a COVID-19 vaccine for individuals six months and older. There is an increased risk of influenza spread and severity due to reduced exposure and lack of acquired immunity in the previous two seasons, and reduced COVID-19 measures. It is important to stay [up-to-date](http://www.york.ca/COVID19Vaccines) with your vaccinations including a COVID-19 booster and flu vaccine when eligible for the best protection against getting very sick from COVID-19 and influenza. The Influenza (flu) vaccine Getting the flu shot each year provides the best protection against becoming ill with the flu. Since the viruses causing the flu can change every year, an annual flu shot is needed. The flu vaccine: - Reduces the risk of serious flu complications - Is recommended for all persons six months of age or older - Is provided for free to anyone who lives, works or attends school in Ontario - Effectiveness can change each year depending on how well the vaccine strains match with circulating types/subtypes of influenza viruses, as well as the health and age of the individual receiving a flu shot. Even when there is a less-than-ideal match or lower vaccine effectiveness against one strain, it is still important to get vaccinated and be protected - It takes nearly two weeks after receiving the flu shot for the vaccine to take full effect - Does not cause the flu The flu vaccine is especially important for individuals who are at high risk of developing complications from the flu, including: - Pregnant individuals (the vaccine is safe in pregnancy) - People who are residents of nursing homes or other chronic care facilities - People 65 years of age and older - All children six months to five years of age - Indigenous peoples - Adults or children with chronic health conditions (e.g., asthma, heart disease, diabetes, and others) Those who live with or have close contact with high-risk individuals as listed above, are a priority for getting the flu shot since they can spread the flu to high-risk people. They include: - Those that live with people at high risk of flu-related complications - Health care workers and other care providers in facilities and community settings - People who provide care to children under five years of age - Individuals who provide services within a closed or relatively closed setting to persons at high risk (e.g., crew on a ship) Health Canada also recommends people who provide essential community services and people who are in direct contact with poultry infection with avian influenza during culling operations get the flu shot. When to wait before getting the flu vaccine Unlike previous influenza seasons, during the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should defer getting the flu shot until they have no have no fever and symptoms are improving for at least 24 hours (or 48 hours if you have gastro-intestinal symptoms) as they pose an unnecessary risk to others and health care providers if they have COVID-19 when seeking to get the flu shot.

If soap and water are unavailable, use a hand sanitizer (gel or wipes) with at least 70% alcohol - Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and throw the tissue out immediately. Wash hands afterwards. Cough in your upper sleeve if you don't have a tissue - Don't touch your face - Clean (and disinfect) surfaces and shared items Important!
