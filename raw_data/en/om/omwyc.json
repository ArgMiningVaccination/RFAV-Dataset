Here are 12 simple steps you can take right now to support your immune system naturally.", "sitename": "Global Healing Center, Inc", "date": "2014-09-15", "cleaned_text": "Your immune system is your frontline defense against environmental toxins, viruses, bacteria, and other harmful microorganisms. Unfortunately, the toxins present in today's world are weakening the human immune system at an ever-increasing rate and there's only so much we can do to control what we're exposed to. On the flip side, certain tools and supplements can help support your immune system. What Is the Immune System & Why Does It Need Support Your immune system is your body's security system. It's your natural defense against harmful organisms that cause sickness and contagious outbreaks. You come in contact with these agents every day and most are neutralized by your immune system without you even knowing it. However, if your immune system is weak, it may not win the battle against invading organisms, and that's when you can get sick. The quality of your immune system relies on you what you eat, what you're exposed to, your physical health, and even your mental health. Suffice to say, you can support your immune system with nutrition, you can support it by bolstering your defenses and reducing the invading microorganisms it has to defend against, and you can support it by having good physical and mental health. 12 Ways to Boost Your Immune System Naturally A healthy diet devoid of refined sugar and processed foods is one of the best ways to support your immune system and [physical exercise is also important](https://explore.globalhealing.com/9-reasons-exercise-best-medicine/). While these methods are helpful, they aren't always enough. In a world where toxins run rampant and exposure is difficult to avoid, we really need to take extra precautions. Here are 12 ways to support your immune system naturally. 1. Probiotics The good bacteria in your gut are known as probiotics and are responsible for supporting digestion, combating harmful organisms, and keeping your immune system in check. Considering that 70 percent of your immune system resides in your gut, maintaining a balance of probiotic bacteria is essential for nurturing your immune defenses.[ [1](#references), [2](#references)] [Probiotic-rich a high-quality, probiotic supplement can help balance your ratio of good to bad bacteria. A probiotic supplement like [Latero-Flora](https://globalhealing.com/latero-flora-probiotic-supplement?icn_ghc=lft1_4_091514_12wsy&ici_ghc=lfnha) is another effective way to encourage good balance. 2. Intestinal Cleansing Whether you're on the road, at your computer, eating, or sleeping on a [toxic mattress](https://explore.globalhealing.com/dust-mites/), it's a safe bet that [you're exposed to toxins](https://explore.globalhealing.com/toxin-cleanse-which-toxins-are-disrupting-your-health/) 24 hours a day. Most toxins take up residence in your intestines to wreak havoc on your health by degrading your immune system and weakening your defenses. Regular intestinal cleansing with an oxygen-based colon cleanser like [Oxy-Powder\u00ae](https://globalhealing.com/oxy-powder) can support your immune system by providing a balanced, clean environment for probiotic bacteria to thrive. The positive benefits of intestinal cleansing with Oxy-Powder\u00ae are enhanced when it's paired with a good probiotic supplement. 3. Organic Oregano Oil [Oregano oil](https://explore.globalhealing.com/10-uses-organic-oregano-oil/), one of the most antioxidant-rich oils on the planet, is extremely beneficial for immune system support by defending against dangerous organisms.[ [3](#references)] Organic oregano oil's potency is due to a compound called [carvacrol](https://explore.globalhealing.com/what-is-carvacrol-8-facts-to-know/), which has been shown to promote a healthy balance of good to bad bacteria.[ [4](#references)] 4. Enzymes Enzymes are essential for digestion and metabolic function and research even suggests they're beneficial for your immune system.[ [5](#references)] Part of the reason for this is because, as you get older, your body produces less of its own enzymes. Supplementing that gap can help you absorb more nutrients from your food to better support your immune system, and overall health. As mentioned, your gut is where 70 percent of your immune system originates, so introducing enzymes to support gut health and digestion only makes sense. I recommend [VeganZyme\u00ae](https://globalhealing.com/veganzyme?icn_ghc=vzt1_4_091514_12wsy&ici_ghc=vznha), it's the most advanced full-spectrum systemic and digestive enzyme formula in the world. 5. Colloidal Silver [Colloidal silver](https://explore.globalhealing.com/5-things-must-know-colloidal-silver/) has a long history of use as an immune booster and a defense against harmful organisms. Historically, humans have used silver for water purification, wound care, and medical equipment.[ [6](#references)] Colloidal silver has received a lot of bad press, mostly due to sensationalist reporting of a condition called argyria, a condition that turns the skin a bluish-grey color. Colloidal silver has unjustly received the brunt of the blame for this condition. Argyria is a result of colloidal silver abuse, not normal use. Regular small doses of iodine are absolutely essential to human health, but in large enough doses, iodine becomes toxic. Colloidal silver is a similar case of \"less is more.\" The small number of people who managed to turn themselves blue were using a home-prepared solution daily. That's not only suspect quality, but that's also way too much. When prepared properly in a controlled, sterile environment, colloidal silver actually has a very low level of toxicity. When you buy a colloidal silver product from a reputable company and use it in moderation, the risk is practically nonexistent.[ [6](#references)] Do your own research, make your own decision, and don't believe the hype. 6. Purified Water with Raw, Organic Apple Cider Vinegar Mixing [raw apple cider vinegar](https://explore.globalhealing.com/the-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar/) (ACV) with purified water is a helpful tonic for supporting your immune system. Raw ACV is loaded with enzymes and beneficial bacteria that promote intestinal balance. ACV also helps to balance your body's pH and transition it into a more alkaline state - which is absolutely crucial for a healthy immune system response. Mix one to two tablespoons of raw ACV with eight ounces of purified water and consume daily, preferably using a non-toxic straw so the acidic ACV avoids contact with your teeth. 7. Reduce Your Stress Levels Emotional, mental, and physical stress takes a toll and can age you \u2014 and your immune system \u2014 beyond your years. Immune system activity drastically decreases when you're stressed. Finding productive ways to deal with it is important for keeping your body strong and resilient.[ [7](#references)] While stress is part of life and can never be totally avoided, meditation, exercising, and eating a healthy diet can really help ease its effects. 8. Sleep The [importance of sleep](https://explore.globalhealing.com/why-sleep-is-important-to-your-health/) simply cannot be overstated. Sleep resets your entire system and provides an avenue through which you can relieve stress and improve not only your immune system but your overall health.[ [8](#references)] Without adequate sleep, your immune system will suffer and be far more susceptible to invading microbes and harmful organisms. In general, seven or eight hours of sleep a night satisfies most people. 9. Juicing One of the most powerful ways you can revolutionize your health is by juicing raw vegetables and fruits. This is an awesome way to give the cells in your body the most concentrated, live, bioavailable nutrients and antioxidants available \u2014 nutrition required by your immune system. Make sure leafy green vegetables are a foundation in each recipe as they are a great source of vitamin C, a much-needed antioxidant and nutrient that supports immune health.[ [9](#references)] 10. Vitamin D [Vitamin D](https://explore.globalhealing.com/vitamin-d/), AKA the sunshine vitamin, is another nutrient that keeps your immune system strong. In fact, vitamin D deficiency has been directly linked to a compromised immune system.[ [10](#references)] Exposure to sunlight is the best way to encourage your body to produce vitamin D, but it's not always accessible. Vitamin D supplementation is an easy way to fill the gaps and make sure to choose [vitamin D3 over vitamin D2](https://explore.globalhealing.com/vitamin-d3-vs-vitamin-d2/). 11. Turmeric A yellowish spice popular in Indian dishes, turmeric has a number of proven health benefits for the human body. It's high in antioxidants to protect immune cells from free radical damage. In addition, the active ingredient in turmeric \u2014 [curcumin](https://explore.globalhealing.com/turmeric-and-curcumin-benefits/) \u2014 may be responsible for supporting the action of T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells.[ [11](#references)] This immunomodulatory effect seems to provide support for the body against a wide range of viruses, fungi, and pathogenic bacteria. Add one-half to one teaspoon of turmeric to your meals, or take a [high-quality turmeric supplement](https://explore.globalhealing.com/turmeric-and-black-pepper/) to provide further nutritional support. 12. Iodine Iodine is a fantastic one-two punch for supporting your immune system. First off, there's no bacteria, virus, or other microorganisms that can survive or adapt to an iodine-rich environment. It's why people put it on cuts; it's why it's swabbed onto your skin before surgery \u2014 it's an incredible defense against harmful microorganisms. Second, your iodine is the best nutritional support for your thyroid. Your thyroid controls your metabolism and the efficiency of your metabolism is directly related to that of your immune system.[ [12](#references)] If you're not getting enough iodine in your food, and most people aren't, I highly recommend [supplementing with nascent iodine](https://explore.globalhealing.com/iodine-supplements/), the strongest, and most bioavailable form of iodine available.
