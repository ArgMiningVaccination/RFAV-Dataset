They emphasize prevention of disease, maintenance of optimal health, and promotion of the individual's inherent self-healing process. Naturopathic medicine accomplishes health care using: clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathic medicine, physical medicine including acupuncture, and lifestyle counseling. We use science-based natural medicine solutions to solve health issues quickly. Our Philosophy Our philosophy is based on the six principles of Naturopathic Medicine: THE HEALING POWER OF NATURE Vis Medicatrix Naturae First Do No Harm Primum non nocere Find and Treat the Root Cause Tolle causam TREAT THE WHOLE PERSON sicut corpore sanitas esse non Patient's Health Pricipiis obsta: seromedicina curatur Dramatic positive change After many years of deteriorating health, nine miscarriages and many doctors telling me to take another pill or it's \"just something you have to live with\". Dr. Farhang Khosh completely changed mine and my family's life! This included a dramatic positive change in my health, supposed \"incurable\" issues cured and three sweet babies and still going! My family will always go to Natural Medical Care to truly be taken care of! ~Jen Guidance & understanding In 2013 I was struggling with yeast overgrowth, chronic psoriasis, and complications with food intolerances. Dr. Deena Beneda was so helpful in explaining what was going on within my system and gave me guidance & understanding that I was not receiving with the other doctors. (In ways I could understand!) After starting my protocol with Dr. Beneda, I was able to stop taking autoimmune suppressants I had been on for more than a year. ~ Jane Comprehensive and individualized care The comprehensive and individualized care we've received from NMC has been so central to turning around persistent chronic issues for everyone in my immediate family that extended family members living elsewhere became patients as well. They, and our children now grown and far away, make appointments when they visit, and have phone consultations otherwise. We run everything by Dr. Khosh\u2014even and especially about treatments and procedures elsewhere\u2014and we are always extremely grateful for such astute and kind guidance. ~ Christy Connecting the dots We have been patients of Dr. Farhang Khosh for 13 years, and he is the best at putting all of the pieces together and connecting the dots in order to find the root cause(s) of our symptoms. He consistently finds the answers when other doctors do not, and he treats us like we are part of his family. We are healthier and feel more genuinely cared for than we did before we came to Natural Medical Care. We cannot say enough nice things about Dr. Farhang Khosh and the entire Natural Medical Care practice! ~ Jen and Jeff J. Very blessed I have been seeing Dr. Mehdi Khosh since November 2005 when I was diagnosed with Leiomysarcoma of the Vena Cava which is a very rare cancer. I started getting comprehensive care including acupuncture, homeopathy, micronutrients and nutritional therapy from Dr. Khosh. I feel I would not be here to see my grandkids if it was not for Dr. Khosh. I am very blessed to have met him and to continue to receive treatments from him. Dr. Khosh is a very good doctor and I very kind soul. ~Sherrie Hugunin Excellent care For 20 years Dr. Farhang & Natural Medical Care have taken excellent care of me & I feel younger every day. They are the best doctors and their staff is excellent. God bless you all with happiness & good health. Sincerely, ~Eugenie She changed my life I first met Dr. Beneda after being diagnosed with Breast Cancer & I feel she saved my life. She is the most compassionate, kind, positive, and knowledgeable naturopath that I know. Dr. Beneda gave me a variety of natural therapies that boosted my immune system so that I could fight the cancer battle. I have learned & continue to learn so much from Dr. Beneda. So I leave you with this; if Dr. Beneda is able to get you through cancer don't you think she can get you through anything? She will be beside you every step of the way. I hope that what I have said will honor Dr. Beneda for what she does and what she is all about.
