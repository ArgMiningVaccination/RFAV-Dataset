Here's more info on the art of combining adaptogens. The ancient art of combining healing herbs Even before your balance is set askew, the science ('Veda') of life ('Ayur') has you covered with a panoply of adaptogens - plants that may aid in resistance to stressors of all varieties: emotional, biological, chemical and environmental. Much like vitamins, minerals, and even pharmaceutical drugs, there's rarely a single 'magic bullet' ingredient; combinations of certain Ayurvedic herbs seem to enhance and support each other. Many of these mixes have a history longer than Western medicine's, but their synergistic and collaborative powers are only now being bolstered by modern science and research. These herbal concoctions were developed through the traditional system of samyoga - the ancient but precise combining of healing herbs. Ayurvedic herbal mixtures are often made up of a primary ingredient, along with a supporting cast of components to balance and strengthen the principal element. The concepts of wholeness and interconnectedness are extended to produce a combination that is more than simply the sum of its parts. Secondary herbs and minerals can improve the absorption, potentiate the action, and reduce any unwanted side-effects of the primary ingredient. Ayurvedic basics The system of Ayurveda recognizes and modifies three primary substances, or doshas, that are present in the body: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. The quality, quantity, and balance of the doshas is dependent on diet, season, lifestyle, time of day and countless other factors.  Vata is associated with lightness, air, dryness and movement. Pain, inflammation and stress are the hallmarks of an imbalanced vata.  Pitta is the heat and energy of emotional and physiological metabolism. Vitiated pitta is characterized by impaired digestion and either fiery passions or emotional coldness.  Kapha is the element of water, embodied by softness, lubrication and the ability to carry nutrients. A balanced Kapha is integral to nourishment, both mental and physical. The goal of Ayurveda is to balance these three elements. Combining adaptogens to unlock their true potential Adaptogens are potent stress relievers for your body, mind, and spirit. They play protective roles against illness and imbalance; incorporating them into your daily life is a powerful application of Ayurveda to your health and well-being. Adaptogen combinations with turmeric Turmeric (Curcuma longa) - the consistent ingredient among the combinations explored below. The bright orange roots of the plant are comprised of 2-5% curcumin - the primary ingredient that is being actively researched for myriad treatment possibilities. However, the powder derived from the tuber itself demonstrates activities and applications that curcumin alone lacks. Not only does turmeric benefit from combination with other herbs, but the active ingredients within turmeric itself also potentiate its effects. These adaptogen combinations have been used for millennia to protect the body from biological and chemical assaults, and to protect the mind and spirit from imbalance and stress. Each is carefully combined to accentuate the natural shield of well-being that is provided from turmeric, along with providing their own potent protective actions. Ensure that you source only properly mixed combinations from samyoga experts, they take great care to gather and combine the ingredients for maximum effectiveness. Turmeric and Guduchi - This specific combination has seen extensive study for the treatment of diabetes, improving and protecting liver health, and for guarding against pathogenic invasions associated with disease. The mixture is consistently shown to be more effective than either of the ingredients alone. There are even topical applications for this particular blend, proving effective against psoriasis and dermatitis. Turmeric, Ashwagandha and Moringa - This combination including ashwagandha and moringa increases and improves Pitta, balances Kapha and pacifies Vata. The dry and rough nature of Vata - that makes you susceptible to infection and abrasion - is quelled; the energy of pitta strengthens both the mind and body forces; a balanced Kapha grounds the actions of both Pitta and Vata. Turmeric, Ashwagandha, Moringa, and Tulsi - The addition of Tulsi to the previous mixture potentiates the already powerful effects of the combination. It further increases pitta, while balancing and decreasing both Vata and Kapha. However, for some, this further bolstering of pitta may prove to be too much, with the potential to occlude otherwise balanced functioning of Vata and Kapha.
