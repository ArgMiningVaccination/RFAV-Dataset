That is the ultimate and idealistic goal of scientists in the U.S. Department of Agriculture and elsewhere who for years have been studying and developing scien tic methods and promoting practices to control agri cultural pests without pesticides (see page 16). Some have been known and used for years; others, such as ways to interrupt the life cycle of insect pests, are of relatively recent origin. We cannot yet see that time when we can, on a large scale, safely discard pesticides. But astounding successes have been achieved in some areas with nonpesticide control methods. Although for now we must continue to depend on careful use of pesticides for most pest con trol, it is reassuring to know that Government and in dustry are not merely marking time; that a future with out most pesticides is not foreclosed; and that to the extent researchers are successful in developing practical alternate means of control, to that extent can FDA safely relax its surveillance of pesticide residues and in crease its attention to other elements in man's environ ment that may dele his daily bread. FDA Papers / February 1969 /1nother evidence of the increased sophis- JL jL tication of our approach to compliance can be found in our present attitude toward Federal-State relations. There exists today a far greater and more effective exchange of informa tion between FDA and its State and local counter parts than has existed at any time in the past of w h i c h I a m a w a r e . \"Today, our District Directors sit down with their State counterparts to openly and frankly discuss problems within the particular State, to make considered decisions as to which agency can most effectively deal with which problems, and to reach agreement on the deployment of resources. This obviously results in a substantially higher level of consumer protection per tax dollar spent, since duplicated coverage, overlapping actions, re peated inspections, and similar wasteful practices can be largely eliminated.\" Alfred Barnard, Director, Bureau of Regulatory Com pliance, at the FDLI-FDA Twelfth Joint Educational Conference, Washington, D.C,, December 3, 1968. ^ I t is most important that there be adequate X planning for environmental control of con tamination. Input to this planning must come from members of the pharmaceutical quality assurance team, which should in addition to the usual pro fessional capabilities, have expertise in pharma ceutical engineering. \"In the quality control of drugs, planning for change must be initiated by industry, not by FDA or by unfortunate circumstances. The planning group should consider total environment in de signing the building, equipment, and flow proc esses to prevent contamination of drug products and to assure their quality and reliability in meet ing increasingly stringent standards. They need to constantly reevaluate and improve design con cepts based upon feedback from quality control, new drug contamination hazards, and the devel opment of advanced techniques in other indus tries. They must recognize the importance and yet the limitations of the human factor in achiev ing quality assurance goals in the production of drugs.\" Douglas C.

Pumpian The blanket of Federal regulationwith which the Food and Drug A d m i n i s t r a t i o n c o v e r s t h e 5 0 S t a t e s to assure the integrity of the food supply in interstate commerce has at times stretched distressingly thin. Production and processing of food has become a big, sophisticated, and scientic business, and the steady growth in population has imposed greater demands on the farmer, the processor, the warehouseman, the transporter, the distributor, and the retailer to provide more and better food by the most efcient and eco nomical means. These demands have put a corresponding strain on FDA and its State counterparts as resources are spread ever wider to assure that the food the consumer gets is safe and wholesome. FDA's formal movement to a so- called Federal-State partnership in food protection\u2014a well-thought-out program given ofcial sanction by the FDA a year ago in a \"position\" paper\u2014thus was essentially a recog nition of the obvious: if the whole- someness of the Nation's food is to be maintained, more help is needed \u2014from the industry, from other Federal agencies, from responsible citizens, and from legislatures and State and local consumer protection ofcials. Perhaps more important, FDA, by taking an ofcial position, concedes that food protection is not, nor has been, nor should be the ex clusive concern of a small group in Washington and in the FDA's 17 Districts across the country. The Agency's high standards and un compromising integrity since it was created by the Congress have helped to make legislatures. State and local ofcials, and responsible citizens everywhere acutely conscious of the benets to health that accrue from a wholesome food supply, and many o r m o s t o f t h e S t a t e s a n d m u n i c i palities long since have created con sumer protection machinery of their own, patterned largely on pertinentFederal statutes and their own needs and interests and reinforced by frequent exchanges of information with trained FDA people. Exchange of information, airing of common problems, joint or co ordinated action, and calculated ap proaches to areas of concern are by n o m e a n s n e w t o t h e F e d e r a l - S t a t e relationship in food protection. His torically, most States have patterned their food and drug laws after Fed eral statutes, but some have insti tuted protection programs that in given areas have exceeded the b r o a d e r F e d e r a l e f f o r t s . T h e f o r e r u n n e r o f t h e S t a t e S e r v i c e s U n i t of FDA's Ofce of Legislative a n d G o v e r n m e n t a l S e r v i c e s w a s formed in 1913 to establish an ef fective program of cooperation with State and local agencies. Today OLGS has a staff of 14 which keeps in close touch with State ofcials on the legal, administrative, technical, logistic, and nancial aspects of con sumer food protection. The relationship between State a n d F e d e r a l o f c i a l s o n t h e o n e hand and among State ofcials on the other has been given stability, continuing currency, and mutual protability through such organiza t i o n s a s t h e A s s o c i a t i o n o f F o o d and Drug Ofcials of the United States (AFDOUS), the Association of American Feed Control Ofcials, (AAFCO) the National Association of Sanitarians (NAS), the Associa tion of Ofcial Analytical Chemists (AOAC), and the Council of State Governments. Such groups have pro vided the spawning ground for some of the most progressive ideas and advances in food protection and have helped to supply uniformity and comprehensiveness for admin istrative and technical developments aimed at better consumer protec tion. Thus, the FDA late in 1967 reduced to paper a philosophy that had been adhered to informally in the past by those concerned, articulating what had been accepted by tradition and more informal ar rangements. Against this background of shared experiences and scientic knowl edge, the FDA in adopting its po sition paper not only formalized the Federal-State partnership, but out lined steps for making it a substan tive, formidable, and ongoing quan tity in the overall protection effort. The stated intent of the paper: to provide food protection based on improved use of \"the total resources currently directed to consumer pro tection activities, irrespective of the level of government concerned.\" In the paper, FDA held that any duplication of effort then existing in the surveillance of food-producing establishments \"must be corrected, as this is a luxury which neither the S t a t e s n o r t h e F e d e r a l G o v e r n m e n t c a n a f f o r d . \" B e c a u s e i n d i v i d u a l action by either the State or the Fed eral Government can hardly achieve the concentrated effort and unity of purpose needed, the paper said, it is up to FDA to provide leadership to eliminate duplication of resources, develop more effective State pro grams, and improve consumer pro tection programs. It set out general formulas or methods by which the partnership could be strengthened to optimum effect by allocation of inspectional and analytical tasks between FDA and State agencies, based on the willingness and capability of the States to work in general or specic areas. A State's extent or kind of participation thus was predicated on the strength and comprehensiveness of its statutes, the diligence and ex pertise of the people it assigned to the tasks, the State's interest in cer tain food areas peculiar to its econ omy or its geography, the resources (money, manpower, facilities, equip ment) available to it, and its own specic regulatory problems of con cern. 4 / February 1969 / FDA PapersUnder the flexible arrangements contemplated in the paper, FDA Districts were free to enter into agreements with each State to take advantage of its individual approach to regulatory problems. Thus, a State might agree to maintain in spection surveillance over all rms in a specic area, bakeries for in stance, or could inspect a specied number of them, while FDA in spected the rest. Where the State is able and willing to cover certain kinds of food establishments, the agreement could provide for inspec t i o n o f s o m e o r a l l o f s u c h e s t a b lishments, regardless of the inter- state-intrastate aspects of any rm's operation. The success of this kind of pro gram in terms of protection to the consumer depends, of course, on how well the job is done. Under the program contemplated in the po sition paper, each State would sup ply reports on its inspections and other activities to FDA, and FDA would reciprocate, thus permitting each agency to evaluate the protec tion afforded thereby and add to its own store of information. Since the State and FDA normally would not be concurrently inspecting the same establishments, duplication would be avoided, except for some overlap ping to allow comparison of FDA and State reports on the same rm. Each agency would have the task of checking the reports received and assuring itself that responsibilities under its own statutes are being ful lled. These combined State and F D A r e c o r d s w o u l d s e r v e a l s o a s a basis for future planning by both groups. The FDA and the State would agree on how to handle various com pliance actions (warnings, educa tion, legal action) based on the nature and health signicance of the individual offense, and could em ploy either State or Federal sanc tions, or combinations of both.Under the partnership, FDA would continue to help the States as needed and as requested in compli ance inspections, difcult analyses, special investigations, development of analytical methods, advice in legal and scientic matters, case participation, training of employees, and education of industry. Reduction by FDA of its own surveillance activities, made pos sible by increasing State activity, will enable the Agency to direct its re s o u r c e s t o w a r d s c i e n t i c a n d t e c h n i cal questions involving food manu facturing and to backup support to States that request it. FDA can ex pand its present activities in such areas as food additives and pesticide petitions, and in such work as Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, equipment criteria, and food stand ards. FDA inspections can be re- programmed, for example, to the drug area, where that Agency's ob ligations have been expanding. Other activities which may be brought into the scope of the Fed eral-State partnership include fair packaging and labeling, hazardous substances, and possibly cosmetics and devices, particularly devices used in medical quackery. The success of the new philoso phy would be enhanced by a com mon resource data base for use by both FDA and the States; agreed- upon common program objectives; priorities and planning concepts; complete exchange, where author ized by law, of inspectional, analyti cal, technical, legal, and administra tive information; cooperative plan ning conferences between FDA Dis tricts and the States on a regular basis; more FDA support to States in training, information, legal, scien tic, and administrative assistance; and exchange of personnel between S t a t e a n d F e d e r a l o f c e s u n d e r t h e provisions of the Comprehensive Health Planning Amendments of 1966, such as that described in anarticle about Illinois' new food and drug law in the March 1968 issue of FDA Papers. Examples of this sharing of data r e s o u r c e s i n c l u d e F D A ' s A b s t r a c t Index of Precedent Materials, a l ing system of cards with information under commodity or subject head ings, and the administrative guide line manual, made up of criteria fol lowed by FDA people in consider ing corrective actions under the Fed eral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The precedent cards make available to State ofcials such information as an advisory opinion, an excerpt from correspondence, or some other denitive nding concerning a spe cic commodity or problem area. The guidelines may be consulted by State people in administering laws a n d f u n c t i o n s r e l a t e d t o t h o s e a d ministered by FDA. The partnership will require co ordinated and comprehensive action by FDA and new functions and pri orities. The program is intended to follow through on the major recom mendations made in 1965 by a Pub lic Administration Service report based on a study of State and local food and drug programs. The report called for authoritative leadership by FDA, a balanced partnership of Federal and State governments in consumer protection programs, and better use of available resources for consumer protection in food areas. The partnership also follows a di rective by the President in a 1966 m e m o r a n d u m t o c e r t a i n F e d e r a l agencies which said in part: \"The basis of creative federalism is co operation. . . . These programs must be carried out jointly; therefore, they should be worked out and planned in a cooperative spirit with those chief ofcials of State, County, and local governments who are answer able to their citizens.\" The FDA position paper sug gested that joint planning and con solidation of information by the FDA Papers / February 1969 / 5partnership can provide a base for evaluation, for cost elfectiveness considerations, and for priority as signments, for State assistance grants, contract programs, and per sonnel interchanges. The partnership program is well under way. FDA's State Services Unit reported the signing, by the end of 1968, of formal memoran dums of agreement or understanding by 15 State government entities representing 14 States and the perti nent FDA Districts, covering a vari ety of protection activities in the food area. These agreements are in addition to more informal under standings reached with a number of States for inspection of medicated feed mills, some dating back to 1966\u2014well before adoption of the FDA position paper. The De cember 1968-January 1969 issue of F D A P a p e r s d e s c r i b e s o n e o f t h e s e programs in which an agency of the State of Texas has taken over, from FDA, all inspections of medicated feed mills in that State. Most of the agreements call for cooperation between the State agen cies and the FDA in the exchange of information concerning inspection reports and laboratory analyses. A number provide for training of State personnel through discussion and seminars and through joint inspec tions with FDA people. Some pre scribe formulas for enforcement ac tion involving both FDA and the States. Work plans (notices of pro posed inspections) are exchanged between the two parties in many instances to keep each informed and to prevent duplications. Many States arrange for joint inspections when they feel it is necessary for training of personnel or for other reasons. Some States which have signed agreements since FDA's Plant Eval uation System (PEV) reports were adopted in mid-1968 have agreed to provide FDA with PEV's based on their inspections. Most of the plans provide for fre- 6 / February 1969 / FDA Papersli \"-'.1 J ' ' > b An example of an agreement between an FDA District and a State is that between FDA's Baltimore District and the Food Regulatory Section of the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Commerce. Ofcials meet often to keep abreast of the progress of the shared inspection program and to exchange information. At top, A. Lee Turner(left), Superintendent of Food Inspection for the Virginia Department, chats with Chief Inspector Buel M. Walters of FDA's Baltimore District. At left, Baltimore District and Virginia ofcials confer. They are (clockwise, from left) Mr. Walters; Maurice B. Rowe, Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce, Virginia; Maurice D.

Pumpian, Director of the Ofce of Legislative and Governmental Services, joined FDA In February 1966 as Deputy Director of the Division of Case Assistance in the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control.quent consultation between FDA Districts and State personnel to keep all up-to-date on new developments. Practically all the agreements in clude an arrangement for both parties to reevaluate their commit m e n t s a t 6 - m o n t h i n t e r v a l s a n d t o include broader program coverage if indicated by ndings. Many of the States assuming responsibility in areas with potential bacteriological problems agreed to lean heavily on FDA laboratory work and expertise when they feel it's necessary, and some asked that Federal and State r e s o u r c e s b e c o m b i n e d w h e n u n usual problems arise. Here are summaries of the agree ments outlining the major responsi bilities assumed by the States for various categories of rms in the food eld: The Virginia Dcpartnient of Agri culture and Commerce assumed re sponsibility for inspection of bottling plants, wheat and corn mills, and canneries (except for sh and mush room canneries), and is expected to assume additional responsibility for inspections of candy plants, ware houses, and wholesale groceries at the start of 1969. The Oregon State Department of Agriculture agreed to primary re sponsibility for sampling food grains in that State. Oregon also agreed to assume primary responsibility for inspecting the 60 dairy plants, 36 beverage plants, all l3akeries, all warehouses, and the 3 egg pasteur izers in that State. Under an agreement with the En vironmental Services Program of the Kentucky Department of Health's Division of Environmental Health, t h e S t a t e s h a r e s w i t h F D A t h e r e sponsibility for inspection of food storage warehouses and bakeries, with emphasis on bacterial problems in bakery inspections. The Texas Department of Health's Division of Food and Drugs agreed to assure primary responsibility for inspection of frozen egg manufacturers, 80 percent of food ware houses, and all veterinary drug manufacturers. For frozen eggs, the State agreed to give primary atten tion to bacterial and decomposition problems. The Rhode Island Department of Health's Division of Food and Drug Control agreed to assume primary inspection responsibility for all bakeries except those whose prod ucts provide a potential for growth of pathogenic bacteria; for these FDA would retain primary responsi bility. The State accepted primary responsibility for food storage ware houses and bottling plants. The Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection assumed pri mary responsibility for inspecting S t a t e b a k e r i e s a n d w a r e h o u s e s , FDA conning its inspections only to those establishments where poten t i a l f o r b a c t e r i a l c o n t a m i n a t i o n i s inherent in the products. Similar agreements for inspection of bak e r i e s a n d f o o d w a r e h o u s e s w e r e reached between FDA and the Divi sion of Food and Drugs of the Bu r e a u o f C o n s u m e r P r o d u c t s P r o t e c tion, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and the Maine State D i v i s i o n o f C o n s u m e r P r o t e c t i o n . Maine also supplemented a 1966 agreement on medicated feed mill inspections, reafrmed that State's primary responsibility in the blue berry packing industry, and agreed to handling of sardine cannery in spections as a joint operation, FDA making inspections only twice a year. The program on sardines, also involving commitments by the sar dine industry, was described in the O c t o b e r 1 9 6 8 i s s u e o f F D A P a p e r s . An agreement with the New Jer sey Department of Agriculture pro vides for the State to assume major responsibility for collecting pesticide residue surveillance samples of raw agricultural commodities, and for FDA's New York District to analyze them. A similar agreement with the New Jersey Department of Health FDA Papers / February 1969 / 7involves drugs, and the Department assumes major responsibility under the same conditions for collecting drug samples and carrying out drug r e c a l l e ff e c t i v e n e s s c h e c k s . B o t h o f the New Jersey agreements provide f o r F D A r e i m b u r s e m e n t f o r t h e c o s t s of samples collected by the State. The Indiana State Board of Health's Food and Drugs Division agreed to cover the State's canneries and nonalcoholic beverage bottling plants, FDA giving backup scien tic, administrative, or legal sup port, and providing help in any area when requested. The agreement pro vides for reports to the State of FDA pesticide residue analysis. The Indiana agreement was made with both the Cincinnati and Detroit Dis tricts, each of which covers part of the State. The Oklahoma Department of Health's Food and Drug Division assumed primary responsibility for canneries, with major attention on bacteriological contamination haz ards. The State agreed to inspect 50 percent of food warehouses, FDA taking the rest. The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture agreed to inspect a majority of State dairy plants, while FDA agreed to investigate agricul tural pesticide use and collect samples of raw agricultural com modities, with certain exceptions to be agreed upon. The Washington Department of Agriculture's Dairy and Food Divi sion assumed responsibility for a specied number of the following rms engaged in interstate com merce: manufactured dairy product rms, bakeries, macaroni and maca roni product rms, confectionery rms, liquid and frozen egg pro ducers, food warehouses, and car bonated beverage plants. With FDA concurrence, the State also simpli ed an earlier procedure for com pliance or seizure action in cases of violation of Federal or State law involving food grains.How a typical State-Federal Inspections agreement works in practice is shown on these pages. At top, in a Virginia corn-grinding mill, a joint inspection is carried out by Inspector David E. Meekins (left) of the Food Regulatory Section of the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Commerce and Inspector Carey Davison (right) of FDA's Baltimore District. At the hopper that feeds grain to the millstones below , they look for live insect infestation or insect damage in the corn. At left, Mr. Meekins, inspecting alone, looks at corn from the sifting machine for such foreign materials as stones, insects, chaff, corncob fragments, and twigs. At right, Messrs. Meekins (left) and Davison are in a food warehouse using ultraviolet light on packages containing 5-pound bags of flour to detect any rodent urine that may be present. 8 / February 1969 / FDA PapersAt top, in a Virginia carbonated beverage bottling plant, Inspector John W. Davis, jr. (left) of FDA's Baltimore District and Inspector Dan Zipperer of the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Commerce's Food Regulatory Section are testing the strength of a sample of the caustic solution used in a bottle-washing machine with phenolphthalein, a substance that indicates acid content. At left, Mr. Zipperer, operating alone, uses the same chemical test to determine the concentration of the caustic substance in the water used in the bottle-washing machine. At right, Mr. Zipperer candles a bottle of the nished product, using a reflecting light, to look for visible foreign matter.The Michigan Department of Agriculture's Food Inspection Divi sion assumed primary responsibility for inspecting egg-breaking and non alcoholic beverage plants and frozen food lockers and warehouse and cold storage facilities, starting in 1969. The Division will share bak ery inspections, FDA directing its main attention to large volume manufacturers engaged in interstate commerce and those with potential microbiological hazards. The State assumed primary responsibility for rural grain elevators and FDA for \"terminals.\" Evidence that the State-Federal partnership program can pay off in measurable results is shown in a re port by the Ofce of Legislative and G o v e r n m e n t a l S e r v i c e s t h a t i n t h e well-established medicated feed mill inspection program. State agencies carried out 700 independent inspec tions of feed mills during the 1968 scal year. The implications here are plain in terms of the expertise a n d m a n - h o u r s t h a t F D A w i l l b e able to divert to other regulatory problems, once the Federal-State food protection partnership gets into full swing. Besides expanding regulatory at tention and surveillance in consumer food protection work, the program will have other dividends. As in any exchange or cooperative effort of this extent, it is giving Federal and State ofcials something more than just a glimpse into each other's methods, philosophies, capabilities, and problems. It has provided them a meeting ground where protection o f t h e c o n s u m e r i s t h e s o l e r e a s o n for existence, where they can de pend on more and more reliable sources of information, where they can arrive at mutual trust in each other's techniques and motives, and where they can work as one team to provide unduplicated and unex celled coverage that protects every consumer in every corner of the country. FDA Papers / February 1969 / 9Microbiological Control of Drugs by Kenneth R. LenningtonI t h a s l o n g b e e n r e c o g n i z e d i n t h eeld of medicine that drugs for injection into the body and solutions for intravenous administration must be sterile. Sterilization of ophthalmic solutions and dispensers is also re quired to prevent eye infections. But no such microbiological require ments have been in effect for articles such as baby powders, oils, and bath preparations commonly used on the newborn, and the hand and body lotions widely used in hos pitals in routine patient care and similar items commonly applied on the body. In the last 3 years or so, these latter categories of drugs and cosmetics have been of increasing concern to FDA and others from the standpoint of the types and numbers of bacteria present and their public health implications. Microbiological control of drugs has long been recognized as an im portant factor in quality. Many varieties of yeasts, molds, and bac teria can cause decomposition, fer mentation, off-odors, off-flavors, dis coloration, or other changes in the physical nature of .the product that detract from or destroy its con sumer acceptance, and in some in stances even affect its potency. The report of the Swedish investi gations of Dr. L. O. Kallings and coworkers in 1966 on the micro biological contamination of drugs and pharmaceutical preparations pointed up this critical problem and its public health signicance: 202 patients were infected with S. muenchen, S. bareilly, or both strains from taking contaminated thyroid tablets; eight workmen suf fered severe eye infection after treatment with a contaminated oint ment, with impairment of sight and loss of an eye in one case. These drugborne infections in Sweden led to study in that country of microbial flora in drugs pur chased on the market and to investigations of raw materials and in line production. In brief, the studies revealed high microbial counts in a variety of tableted preparations, as well as in ointments, wound pow ders, hand creams, baby creams, and baby powders. The investigations found frequent occurrences of gram-negative orga nisms, including E. coli, and coli- forms. Staphylococcus, and entero- cocci in these products. The Swedish study of manufacturing operations, especially of wet granulation and subsequent drying at elevated tem perature, indicated excellent condi tions for proliferation of the con taminant. Contamination of tablet ingredients such as thyroid powder and potato starch were found re sponsible for some contamination, but differences were obseryed in the microbiological quality between similar products from different man ufacturers. The study found a corre lation between the sanitation under which production was carried out and the bacterial load of the drugs. The Food and Drug Administra tion has periodically encountered contamination of liquid ophthalmic preparations with Pseudomonas aeruginosa over the past decade. The majority of those episodes came to our attention through reports of injuries or infections caused by the contaminated product. These occur r e n c e s l e d t o a n F D A S t a t e m e n t o f Policy on September 1, 1964, re quiring sterility of ophthalmic solu tions and dispensers. Hospital outbreaks of S. cubana infections in Massachusetts, Cali fornia, Oregon, Ohio, and England in 1966 were traced to the admin istration of capsules of carmine red color. These capsules, commonly used in hospitals for the investiga tion of gastrointestinal functions, were found to be contaminated with S. cubana.An outbreak of Klebsiella pneu moniae septicemia in early 1967 at a hospital in Worcester, Massachu setts, involved six of 13 patients in a medical intensive care unit, and resulted in one death. The hospital traced the pathogen to a dispensing bottle of contaminated lanolin hand lotion. The hospital's investigation revealed that the dispenser had been lled repeatedly with a variety of skin lotions, any one of which could have introduced the organism. Subsequent investigations stimu lated by that episode revealed that four of 26 brands of commercially a v a i l a b l e h a n d l o t i o n s f r o m u n opened bottles contained a variety of gram-negative organisms, includ ing Pseudomonas species. In December 1967, FDA found one manufacturer's nose drops and nasal sprays contaminated with Proteus morgani and Proteus rett- geri. Some of these preparations w e r e r e c o m m e n d e d f o r i n f a n t u s e . In the interest of public health, the manufacturer initiated a voluntary recall and promptly removed the contaminated preparations from the market. In the same month two different hand and body lotions, widely used in hospitals, were found contaminated with Psuedomonas and were recalled. L a t e i n S e p t e m b e r 1 9 6 8 , a l a r g e hospital reported 13 cases of Pseu domonas aeruginosa infection in newborn infants in its nursery in the 5-week period between July 30 and September 4, 1968. One case ended in a fatal septicemia. A hexa- chlorophene preparation, used on all newborn, was suspected. Labora tory examination disclosed Serratia a n d P s e u d o m o n a s i n a l m o s t a l l c o n tainers tested. Counts of 100,000 organisms per milliliter were found. It was not demonstrated, however, that the organism in the hexachloro- phene was the same serological FDA Papers / February 1969 / 11strain as that isolated from the in fected infants. The medical literature, especially in recent years, abounds with re ports of the increasing frequency of infections by gram-negative bacilli, some of which, under normal condi tions, might not be viewed as patho gens. But it has been demonstrated that when the host has limited re sistance, serious infection can result. At the Pharmaceutical Confer ence in Blackpool, England, in 1967, Dr. J. A. Savin reported a variety of cases of infection due to bacteriaUy contaminated prepara tions, many of which led to serious illness. Most of these cases involved secondary or \"opportunist\" patho gens which can and do invade when natural barriers are weakened. The U.S. drug industry has been studying the problem of drug con tamination. For at least 2 years, the Biological Section of the Pharma ceutical Manufacturers Association has been evaluating the problem of microbial contamination of all drug dosage forms, exclusive of paren teral preparations, and each member of a special committee formed to study this problem is examining his own rm's production methods. The U.S. Pharmacopeia Advisory Panel is active in current considera tions of microbial content of non- sterile drug products. The National Formulary Board also has interest in this area, including a possible requirement for sterility of ophthal mic ointments. The World Health Organization is pursuing the prob l e m o n a n i n t e r n a t i o n a l l e v e l . ost if not all of the progressive countries are giving attention to the problem of microbiological con tamination of drugs. The Swedish National Board of Health has de veloped recommended production hygiene and bacteriological control in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and has placed restrictions on the total microbial population that can be present in Uquid and tableted preparations. Great Britain requires all ophthalmic preparations to be sterile. Czechoslovakia has adopted statutory microbiological standards f o r t a b l e t s m a n u f a c t u r e d i n t h a t country. Belgium has drafted pro posals, including strict rules of hy giene and production sanitation, for ready-to-use pharmaceuticals. It is signicant that the infection outbreaks that come to attention are those affecting several persons in a common environment or ex posed to common risks. But what about the individual infection, the isolated case? As in foodbome infec tion, the single or isolated rarely attracts epidemiological notice; con sequently, the causative agent goes undetected and unidentied. There can be no reasonable doubt today about the hazards of micro biological contamination of drugs and cosmetics, especially when ad ministered or applied to the debili tated or newborn. The problem is identied, but its solution is more complex. How can we control or minimize the hazard of contamina tion? Although details and specic steps are not readily denable, let us consider the techniques applied to control contamination of foods and to some extent, the procedures devel oped by the pharmaceutical indus try in recent years to prevent cross- contamination of drugs with anti biotics and other potent ingredients. In general, and following the analogy of food contamination, the b r o a d s o u r c e s o f c o n t a m i n a t i o n o f pharmaceutical preparations can be broken down into raw materials, water supply, air supply, processing operations, equipment, employees, and environment and plant faciUties. Raw materials of animal or vege table origin must be considered aspotentially higher risk items than the chemically pure products result ing from rening, synthesizing, or other processes where high heat, acidity, or alkalinity results in de s t r u c t i o n o f m i c r o b i a l l i f e . F o r a determination of their general ac- ceptabiUty, raw materials should be checked for viable organisms and the ndings evaluated and inter preted in terms of the total count; the nature of the raw materials, in cluding origin and moisture content; the nature of the microbial flora; and, of course, specic pathogens such as Salmonella, Proper storage conditions and practices to protect against contamination or increase in residual microbiological populations is equally important. W a . s u p p l y , b o t h t a p a n d d i s tilled, should be checked frequently. Distilled water supplies have posed problems because of contamination with the Pseudomonas group. Such organisms, according to a report by Dr. G. Sykes to the American Soci ety of Microbiologists in May 1968, grow readily in puried or deionized water and even in distilled water, so that the number of viable cells developing at 22\u00b0 C. can rise to as many as 10^ per milliliter after a few days storage at ambient tem peratures. It is obvious then that c l o s e m i c r o b i a l c o n t r o l o v e r a l l water supplies must be a continuous program. The air supply of a processing plant can be a critical factor, as evi denced by recent experiences with bacterial contamination of processed foods, particularly those involving a spray-drying process where large volumes of air are used. Air intakes, lters, circulation patterns and sys tems, aerosols, and dust patterns must be considered and evaluated from the likelihood of contamina tion, cross-contamination, or recon- tamination. 12 / February 1969 / FDA PapersProcessing operations are another important link in the chain of micro bial control. Dr. Kallings reported that conditions suitable for prohfer- ation are presented by prolonged granulation and drying processes. Condensate can be a critical factor, especially in those preparations or in those stages of manufacture where the water activity level is nor mally sufciently low to preclude bacterial growth. If we have con d e n s a t i o n o n s u r f a c e l e v e l s o f o i n t m e n t s o r o n t h e i n n e r s u r f a c e s o f storage tanks, pockets may be set up which permit growth. Conden sate drip into in-process batcheswill not only provide the moisture necessary for proliferation, but may actuaUy set up a vector of contami nation. The reworking of batches, or salvage of any form of returns should be scrutinized carefully as a possible vector of contamination. Storage or holding conditions, re peated exposure to moisture, and cross-contamination are but a few of the variables that may con tribute to microbiological contami nation. Each plant should under take a critical study of its particular processes to detect and correct conditions that may provide poten tial infective or growth situations.with careful attention to obscure or hidden risks. Equipment and its maintenance, cleaning, and sanitation is another essential link in the control chain. All equipment should be so con structed as to permit thorough cleaning and sanitization immedi ately after use and immediately be fore the next use. This is especially important between changes in prod uct, and is essential so that any r e s e r v o i r s o f c o n t a m i n a t i o n a r e eliminated and do not serve to seed subsequent production. Special attention should be given to rubber and plastic hose, which. e FDA Papers / February 1969 / 13unless regularly steamed and sani tized, can be a prolic source of contamination. Employee hygiene and sanitation cannot be overemphasized in a pro gram to control microbiological con tamination. It would be logical and realistic to develop an employee training program in basic sanitation and hygiene. The employee must understand his or her personal role in preventing or contributing to con tamination. The signicance and the potential hazards of contamination with humanborne enteric organisms should be made clear. Against this background, the importance of per sonal cleanhness, complete cleaning, adequate sanitization, and in gen eral, good manufacturing practices, will be more meaningful and con sequently more likely to be followed by employees. A high level of plant hygiene can be maintained only through employee understanding, supplemented by continuing super vision. Specic rules and prohibi tions are not enough. Environment and plant facilities, which to some extent overlap into areas already discussed, have an im portant role in microbiological con tamination. In speaking of environ mental control, one must take into consideration all types of contami nation, but chiefly extraneous matter and microbial contamination. Wher ever you have one you have the other. There is a logical association b e t w e e n e x t r a n e o u s m a t t e r a n d microbial contamination in any given atmosphere. The plant in a crowded industrial area, with close neighbors whose operations gener ate dust and other contaminants, attract birds or vermin, or have other undesirable factors, runs a far greater risk than the plant in an un- crowded area in control of the im mediate surroundings. The specially constructed build- 14 / February 1969 / FDA Papersing, with the various operations separated and built for the purpose of pharmaceutical manufacture, has marked advantages over a remod eled structure that has been altered over the years to meet the needs of v a r i o u s t e n a n t s . I n t e r i o r c o n s t r u c tion, floor drainage, cleanabrlity, trafc patterns, adequacy of sanitary features, etc., are also important. We must bear in mind, however, that sanitation is an ongoing thing that is practiced and built into the process and into the product. The use of preservatives inevita bly arises in any discussion of microbial contamination. Preserva tives and bacteriostatic agents have a role, especially in preventing con tamination during the period of use and as a second line of defense dur ing manufacture, but they must not be used as a substitute for a high level of plant and production sani tation and hygiene. It should also be remembered that a number of organisms may not be affected by a particular preserva tive, hence some may flourish in its presence. In fact, contaminated b e n z a l k o n i u m c h l o r i d e a n d h e x a - chlorophene have been shown to cause some infections. A microbiological control pro gram, to attain any degree of effec tiveness, requires laboratory testing on a continuing basis. For the indi vidual plant, a minimum program must be designed which takes into consideration the nature of raw materials used, the physical nature of the product, the moisture and n u t r i e n t s e s s e n t i a l f o r m i c r o b i a l growth, the manner of processing, the amount of handling and expo sure, its intended use, and other signicant variables. Any sound test ing program would provide for bac teriological tests of all raw materials and a quarantine on \"high risk\" items until results are reported and evaluated.Kenneth R. Lennington, Bacteriological Contamination Coordinator, Ofce of the Associate Commissioner for Compliance, joined FDA in 1939.i In-line testing is necessary to determine what microbiological changes occur in processing, espe cially in those phases where mois ture and temperature conditions favor proliferation. Selective nished product testing should be conducted t o a s s u r e m i n i m a l c o u n t s a n d t o e s t a b l i s h a m i n i m a l c o u n t f o r t h e particular product. Once minimal counts are determined on prepara tions produced in a plant under good hygiene and good manufactur ing practices, any marked increase i n c o u n t s w o u l d b e a n a l e r t t o a weakness or breakdown in control, and a signal of potential trouble. Finished product tests should be made for total counts and for spe cic pathogens or indicator orga nisms such as Salmonella, Pseu- domonas, or coliforms. Frequency of tests should depend on the na ture, intended use, and plant history of the product. Sampling of air supply where pertinent, of sanitized equipment, and of packaging materials and components should also be carried on as a surveillance or monitoring operation. I would like to point out that aside from those drugs required to be sterile, and preparations con taminated with such obvious patho gens as Salmonella, the Food and Drug Administration has not devel oped a formal program or planned approach of enforcement. We have considered individually each case of contamination of tablets, hand lo tions, nasal preparations, or other products in the light of the contami nant, conditions and manner of use, and the potential danger to health presented by the facts in the case. We recognize the need for more data on the microbial quality of the ophthalmics, topicals, and prepara tions for internal use. Some of our D i s t r i c t s h a v e i n i t i a t e d m o d e s t e x ploratory programs, and in the nextyear we plan this area.increased activity in In any discussion of microbial con tamination of drugs, the pros and cons for standards or permitted populations arise. The FDA has reservations on the application of microbiological standards for drugs at this time. We don't feel we are in a position to propose population levels of organisms that should be permitted in various preparations or types of preparations. We have no tested and approved methods of analysis that we are condent can be applied across the board to deter mine, consistently and accurately, the actual counts. Comprehensive data on the microbiological quality of our drugs on the market today would be necessary to be sure that any standard we adopted would be attainable and meaningful. We do not have such data. Furthermore, any standard established would have to be qualied to exclude any patho gens. A precise, authentic denition of \"pathogen,\" agreed upon and adopted by all, would be needed. It seems to us that a more logical approach and goal at this time is the production of drugs under con trolled conditions to assure maxi mum sanitation\u2014under a quality control system which would assure that nished products contain no potentially infective agents. The whole subject area is one that calls for critical study by indus try, ofcial compendia panels or committees, and those charged with regulatory responsibilities. It would seem logical and of mutual benet if a system could be established for continuing exchange and sharing of v i e w s a n d s c i e n t i c d a t a . S u c h a n approach could then be the basis for an effective voluntary compli ance and improvement program in the interest of all concerned, includ ing the consumer. FDA Papers / February 1969 / 15Alternate Methods of Controlling Insect Pests by Edward F. Knipling, Ph.D. T h e p i n k b o l l w o r m , o n c e a s e r i o u s e c o n o m i c p e s t o f cotton in Texas, rarely causes losses today in that State even though chemical pesticides are not used to control this potential crop destroyer. In Florida, the screwworm no longer exists to kill o r m a i m m i l l i o n s o f d o l l a r s w o r t h o f l i v e s t o c k e a c h year. But no chemical was used to eradicate this insect pest. Citrus grown in California is not plagued by cot tony-cushion scale, a serious insect pest. Again, no chemicals are used to control the pest. The spotted alfalfa aphid once threatened the entire alfalfa industry, especially in the Western States. Al though chemical insecticides were found to effectively control this pest, they are rarely used today in dealing with this insect. These pests, and others like them, yielded to bioen- vironmental, biological, or other nonchemical methods of pest control. These control methods protect Ameri can agriculture and the consumer's food and ber sup ply at much less cost than pesticides. They also reduce the cost\u2014to farmers and Government\u2014of making sure that no harmful pesticides residues enter food channels. Someday, alternate methods of pest control may be used against most of the insects responsible for the most severe losses in the United States. Today, however, con ventional insecticides are needed to control 80 to 90 percent of insect problems affecting agriculture and public health. How soon the ratio between these pest control methods changes depends on research scientists in Federal, State, and industry laboratories. Toxic chemicals are needed to control pests until better methods are found. These conventional insecti cides have many advantages. They are positive and consistent in their effect in controlling destructive in sects. Because of their rapid action, damaging infesta tions can be brought under control in a matter of hours. Individual action can be taken by farmers or property owners, even though community cooperation is often desirable. A single insecticide, that may with minor modication control a hundred different kinds of harm ful insects, can be developed at a far lower cost than the research needed to develop biological or selective chemical methods of insect control. The research program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Entomology Research Division has changed drastically during the past decade. Until 1955, almost two-thirds of the research effort was on the de velopment of conventional chemical approaches to insect control. The change in direction developed in rec ognition of the many complex residue and environ mental pollution problems resulting from the use of broad-spectrum insecticides, and from a realization of the importance of insect resistance to insecticides. This redirection was well underway before the President's Science Advisory Committee in 1963 issued its report on the use of pesticides. Nonpoisonous pest control methods are not new. The story of the cottony-cushion scale illustrates this. The scale\u2014native to Australia\u2014^threatened to destroy Cali fornia's growing citrus industry in the 1880's. The threat was removed in the 1890's when a USDA en tomologist brought back from Australia other insects that are predators of the scale. This was the rst planned use of one insect to control another and be came a classic of modern science. Many of our most troublesome pests are those that slipped into the United States accidentally. They left behind their natural enemies and settled down. When we know where an insect pest came from and what its natural enemies are, we import the enemy to help us ght the pest. Insect diseases, parasites, and predators play a major role in reducing the numbers of destructive insects. Without these natural forces, we would be helpless to deal with pest insects, even with our current array of highly effective insecticides. Insects multiply with in credible speed. In one summer season\u2014^from April to August\u2014the descendants of one pair of houseflies, if all lived and reproduced normally, would total 191 quadrillion. Fortunately for us, most of those millions are destroyed by naturd means. Of the multitudes of insect species, some 10,000 are known to damage crops, forests, man, or livestock. Many of these are particularly destructive and would take more of the crop than the farmer would if left undisturbed. The competition of people against pests for food has been, historically, a life-and-death struggle. Many times the pests have won. T h e i n s e c t - v e r s u s - i n s e c t m e t h o d f r e q u e n t l y f a i l s b ecause the friendly insects lack the ability to live in the new environment. This has been true in our ght against the gypsy moth, a pest that escaped from a private research laboratory in Massachusetts a hundred years ago. We know of many insect parasites and preda tors that attack the gypsy moth and have imported large numbers of several species. Very few of them have be come established. We are continuing this approach to gypsy moth con- 16 / February 1969 / FDA PapersThe screwworm (top right), the larva form of the screwworm fly and hatched from eggs laid in open wounds in living animal flesh, is a major livestock pest in some areas. This pest is being combated by a peacetime use of atomic energy. Male flies are bred in captivity and are then .sexually sterilized by exposure to gamma rays (top left). The sterilized flies are then released weekly by the millions from airplanes over wide infested areas where they compete with the native male flies to mate with the native females. Female flies that mate with sterilized males lay eggs that do not hatch. A t bottom left are flies bred in captivity to be sterilized and released. trol by maintaining breeding colonies of friendly in sects that can be released in the spring to destroy low- level infestations of the pest. One of the most desirable means of controlling agri cultural pests is by the development of crop varieties that resist insect attack. The method involves little or n o e x p e n s e t o g r o w e r s a n d r e s u l t s i n n o a d v e r s e s i d e e f fects or residues to concern USDA pesticide monitors or FDA Inspectors. This method is not used more ex tensively because of the long, tedious research required to develop resistant plants. However , it has been pos sible to use this method in several instances. The spotted alfalfa aphid is an example.This aphid was accidentally introduced into the United States in 1954. To control the pest with insecti cides called for frequent and costly applications. Through a concerted effort, entomologists and alfalfa breeders succeeded within a rather short time in de veloping a number of varieties that are almost immune to attack by this insect. Growing such varieties is now the principal means of dealing with this pest. One of the best examples of success in the develop ment of resistant crop varieties involves wheat resistant to the Hessian fly. This introduced pest is capable of causing losses to wheat that could amount to severalhundred million dollars each year. But most varieties of wheat now grown in Hessian fly areas are virtually im mune to damage by the insect. Millions of acres of wheat now are planted with resistant varieties. In some areas, this has reduced the pest populations to levels that make the insect of relatively minor importance even on susceptible varieties. There have been other successes with this means of pest control, but most of our important crop insect problems cannot yet be resolved by this means. Major research efforts continue to be directed toward devel oping resistant varieties of crops for such pests as the boll weevil, corn rootworm, corn earworm, cereal leaf beetle, alfalfa weevil, and others. Some promising re sults are being obtained, but it will be some time before we can expect resistant varieties to replace chemical controls for these and most other crop pests. Cultural methods have long been important in inseet control. These methods involve such practices as de struction of crop plants as soon as possible after har vest to prevent further reproduction of insects; tillage of soil to destroy insects; rotation of crops to minimize insect reproduction; and early or delayed planting to avoid high emerging insect populations. Considerable success has been achieved in suppressing pink boll- FDA Papers / February 1969 / 17R esearchers are using ultraviolet radiant energy; invisible to humans but attracting insects, in blacklight traps to control some insects. Here a trap is used in a tobacco eld. ARS scientists found that use of three UV traps per square mile, plus destruction of tobacco stalks after harvest, sharply reduced tobacco hornworms in the area through trapping moth adults.worms in Texas and some other places by such means. The cultural practices that help control the pink boll- worm must be carried out by all growers if these meth ods are to be successful. In Texas, these practices in clude clean harvest, stalk shredding and plow-under, uniform planting and harvesting dates, and the removal of all overwintering cotton plants. While such cultural practices often play a signicant role in pest control, by themselves they seldom provide a dependable solution to insect problems. Nonetheless, more attention is being given to such measures in inte grated programs in which one control method is used to reduce insect populations and another method is used for the knockout punch. Special studies have been conducted\u2014and some are underway now\u2014on the control of certain insects by de stroying alternate host plants on an areawide basis. As an example, the beet leafhopper has been controlled ef fectively in one of the large farming areas of Idaho by replacing wild host plants near the farming area with useful livestock forage grasses on which the insect can not reproduce. The use of insects for their own destruction by sterility or other genetic means is a new approaeh to in sect control that holds great promise. The method in volves the mass production, sterilization, and release of large numbers of insects to compete with the natural fertile population in mating. This method was used to eradicate the screwworm, a major livestock pest, from Florida. This highly sophisticated pest control technique re quires a thorough understanding of the biology, ecology, and population dynamics of the insect to be controlled. The rearing of millions or even billions of insects to adequately overflood the natural population requires the devolpment of special insect rearing techniques and facilities. The feasibility and practicability of this method is governed by the number of insects in the natural popu lation and available means for rearing enough insects to achieve the required overflooding rates. The technique, therefore, will have its greatest value when used in con junction with other control methods. R e s e a r c h i s u n d e r w a y o n a w i d e v a r i e t y o f i n s e e t s t oexplore this method of control or eradication. Con siderable promise is seen in use of the sterility method against low-level populations of several species of tropical fruit flies, the codling moth, pink boUworm, boll weevil, cabbage looper, and some other pests. A major obstacle to success, in a number of instances, continued on page 23 18 / February 1969 / FDA Papersolor Scanning for Food ContaminationI n i t s t a s k o f d e t e c t i n g a n d i d e n t i f y i n g i n s e c t s , r o d e n thairs, or other extraneous matter in foods of plant ori gin, the FDA must also determine the amounts of such material in a given weight sample of food. The Bureau of Science's Microanalytical Branch, under William V. Eis- enberg, currently is working on the development of an automated electronic-optical scanning system that de termines the amount of unwanted material based on its color. At the present stage the color scanner is not sensi tive enough to measure foreign matter in food based on natural colors, but experiments are proving successful when articial means are used to make the food and the contaminating matter appear as different colors. These colors are obtained by several FDA methods of staining or dyeing which leave the food and the contaminant dif ferent colors. Ultraviolet light is used after staining in s o m e i n s t a n c e s t o i n c r e a s e t h e c o l o r c o n t r a s t b e t w e e n the plant tissue and the extraneous materials. After testing the principle of optical color scanning on actual food samples, FDA has been looking at a number of optical systems proposed by manufacturers for a proto type automated optical scanning system designed spe cically for its needs in measuring such lth in foods. Richard Stein has acted as consultant for the Branch, examining the various proposed systems and developing methods for machine recognition of extraneous material by color methods. The choice of lter determines the ma chine's ability to detect lth based on color. Light re flected off an orange insect fragment will pass through a red lter, hence will be counted, whereas the plant tis sue, colored green or blue, will not be counted. The scanning system, of course, does not identify in sects or other extraneous plant or animal material. This work must be done by the Branch's trained morpholo- gists. Thus, the scanner's usefulness is entirely depend ent on the reliability of the methods FDA uses in color differentiation. One of these methods was described in the February 1968 issue of FDA Papers. In the photo at the top are some of the dye solutions used row of photographs shows (at left) pecan nutmeats before dishes are an unstained sample of the nutmeats (left) and Although the curculio larvae are visible as whitish forms in distinctive color contrast in the stained sample at the right, in the center picture of a cast skin of the confused flour bottom right microscopic photo of cocoa shell (green) in is shown in the left bottom photo.for staining samples of plant-origin foods.

At the top right, Mr. Stein spreads a measured amount of stained plant-origin food material from a sample on a transparent lm or tape that ts the transparent scanning drum of the automatic scanner. When UV light is used to achieve color contrast, color photographs are made and placed on the drum. In the bottom left photo, he attaches the tape to the drum on the machine. At the bottom right is a closer view of the automatic scanner and drum. The knobs on the panel control the choice of optical lters to be used.SCANNING DRUM The drum (diagram, top left) spins on its axis while moving horizontally . A stationary beam of light rapidly scans the sample. The light reflecting from the sample electronically will pass through a series of predetermined optical lters in the machine. The color of the subject and choice of optical lters will determine the signal that will register on the oscilloscope (diagram, top center). The instrument can be adjusted so that orange lth will create an electroluminescent pattern in the upper portion of the oscilloscope tube, while the blue food material will register in the lower. When the lower section of the tube's screen is masked off and a photocell is placed facing the upper portion, the orange particles can be accounted for and the sum of the signals tallied by a counter. The top right drawing shows the scanning pattern of the machine on the tape. The photos at middle left and right show the oscilloscopic pattern left by a blue-stained particle (left) and the pattern left by an orange-stained particle (right). The machine's counter is shown in bottom photo. The photo on page 19 shows the principle of color ltering. Light from the orange-colored oversize insect model passes through the bottle of dye solution, but light from the complementary color (the green vegetable) is stopped and appears as gray to black.CONTROLLING INSECT PESTS continued from page 18 Changes in agricultural practices can help control insect pests in some cases. At left, an experimental machine is used to remove cotton stalks from a eld after harvesting. Immediate removal of the stalks after harvest stops reproduction of the pink bollworm and reduces the number of larvae that winter over in the eld. The photos at the center and right show normal and abnormal pupae of the yellow mealworm. A synthetic hormone was sprayed on the insect at the right, causing it to develop an adult head and thorax, but fail to develop an adult abdomen. In this abnormal stage the insect cannot reproduce. has been the inability to rear healthy insects capable of competing with the wild population. Another new trend in pest control is the use of at- tractants. Insects respond to various chemical sub stances in plants in their search for food and to chemi cals produced by the insect for mating. They also respond to light, sound, and possibly to radiations not yet identied. Scientists are trying to pinpoint these attractants and to nd ways of using them to detect and control insect pests. Large scale tests are underway on the value of black- light traps for the control of the tobacco hornworm, cabbage looper, and bollworm. When used at the rate of three traps per square mile in several hundred square miles of farming area, these traps reduced hornworm and looper populations to the point where only a limited amount of insecticide was needed to con trol the pests. A synthetic lure was used to eradicate the Oriental fruit fly on Rota, an island 37 miles north of Guam. In that effort, a chemical attractant was used to induce male fruit flies to eat an insecticide. Annihilation of thd males caused the entire population of fruit flies to die out. The lure used was attractive only to male Oriental fruit flies and posed no hazard to birds, wildlife, ordesirable insects. Chemicals still play their part in USDA's continuing s e a r c h f o r a d d i t i o n a l s a f e a n d e f f e c t i v e m e t h o d s o f controlling pests, but more selective insecticides are being developed. The insecticide being used against the imported re ant in the Southeast, for example, is so specic for this pest that it is nonlethal to many other species of ants, and completely harmless to warm blooded animals. Further, tests of new ways to apply this pesticide indicate that good control can be achieved with as little as one-fourteenth of an ounce per acre. Development of ultralow volume (ULV) spraying techniques is another way to increase the safety factor in pesticide application. Aerial spraying of pesticides in amounts as low as 1 ounce per acre is effective in controlling such insect enemies as the mosquito and grasshopper. Reducing the amount of pesticide applied to an area reduces potential hazard to people, animals, and the total environment. In this method, undiluted insecticide is sprayed as a very ne mist. Because only a small amount is needed for each acre, a single plane load can cover a far greater area than was previously possible, and so reduce the time and cost of pest control operations. Much basic and applied research is being conducted FDA Papers / February 1969 / 23on the development of new types of insecticides that disrupt insect development rather than cause death. Encouraging results are being obtained in the develop ment of insect hormones or hormone-like chemicals that interfere with the life cycle of certain pest insects but seem to have little or no effect on nontarget insects o r w a r m b l o o d e d a n i m a l s . Along the same hue, scientists are manipulating day- length to reset insects' biological clocks. These studies may lead to new ways to control insects by throwing them badly out of step with nature.

Certain chemicals also have the ability to trigger the proper regulating hormones in some kinds of insects so that they come out of diapause. If such efforts can be duplicated in the eld, insect pests could be tricked into entering hostile environments where they would die from cold weather or lack of food, or could not reproduce because of a lack of host plants. Crop damage might also eventually be reduced by forcing certain kinds of insects into their resting stage when they would normally be ravaging crops. In one experiment, a flash of hght as short as one-A s one weapon to control insect pests without pesticide chemicals, scientists enlist help from the pest's natural enemies, often brought from the same area of the world where the pest originated.

During their studies, scientists have found that the eye isn't the only light-sensitive organ. Other tissues in insects' bodies respond to the application of light. The study of these tissues may help us nd how bright a light should be, how long it must shine, and what color is most effective for upsetting a pest's life cycle. These basic research studies may suggest other ways to trigger or stop insect diapause\u2014including use of nontoxic, naturally occurring chemicals, combining various temperature and humidity conditions with con trolled lighting, or even making better use of existing control methods.Edward F.

Does he feel that egg bread contains enough eggs to give it a distinctive character istic? What attributes do potato bread and buttermilk bread have that make them different from other breads? Is a soft loaf of bread always a fresh loaf? These and other questions regarding bread have been a matter of concern to the Food and Drug Ad ministration for a long time. In 1941 proposals for identity standards for various kinds of bread were published by FDA in the Federal Register. In 1952, as a result of public hearings in 1941, 1943, and\u2014after interruptions by World War II\u20141948, involving more than 17,000 pages of testi- morfy, FDA promulgated standards for ve breads: white bread, whole wheat bread, enriched bread, milk bread, and raisin bread. But the Agency reached an impasse and did not establish standards for certain specialty breads because of differences of opinion over the minimum amounts of the so-called characterizing ingredients to be required. For example, FDA proposed at least ve parts egg solids per 100 parts by weight of flour in egg bread, whereas bakers proposed no higher than two parts. FDA wanted at least 12 parts milk fat from butter in butter bread (with this fat as the only shortening), while a baker's trade organization wanted the minimum to be only four parts. Since the time of the hearings in the 1940's, numer ous comments regarding the need for standards for specialty breads have been received from FDA Dis tricts; from State enforcement agencies; and from mem bers of the industry who expressed the opinion that they were faced with unfair competition. Almost all the complaints have been that overemphasis is placed on the modier in the name of the product, as \"egg,\" \"butter,\" etc. In its consideration of the problem, FDA has been conducting an intensive program of gathering data to be used in determining whether or not standards should be promulgated for egg bread, butter bread, potato bread, and buttermilk bread, and, if so, what the re quirements should be. One part of the program was a survey of consumers to determine just what the user expects when purchas ing bread under these specially modied names. The survey was conducted under contract with FDA by Harrington & Co. (now Day & Zimmerman Consulting Services) of New York. The survey is based on 1,944 face-to-face interviews representing a cross section of bread consumers of various groupings based on occu pations, age, family size, education, and representative' Looks at Bread O. Dunston income brackets in every State in the continental United States. Of those interviewed, more than half are users of at least one of the four breads in question. In the 6 months prior to the survey, as many as 14 percent had used egg bread; 17 percent had used butter bread; another 17 percent had used potato bread; and 28 percent had used buttermilk bread. Many of those interviewed said they did not use one or another of these four breads because they had never heard of it or h a d n e v e r s e e n i t o n t h e s h e l f i n t h e s t o r e . A s m a l l e r number said that they didn't like it or at least preferred other breads, or that they didn't want to pay the higher price charged for it. The survey revealed a surprisingly wide gap in ex pectations regarding taste characteristics of the four b r e a d s b e t w e e n t h e t o t a l h o u s e h o l d s i n t e r v i e w e d a n d the user households. More than 90 percent of the total household respondents expected egg to be the distin guishing taste of egg bread, butter to be that of butter bread, potatoes that of potato bread, and buttermilk t h a t o f b u t t e r m i l k b r e a d . I n t h e c a s e o f u s e r s o f t h e respective breads, an average of only 27 percent ex pected the ingredient specied in the name of the bread to provide the distinguishing taste. - / V n o t h e r i m p o r t a n t a s p e c t o f t h e s u r v e y i n v o l v e d t h e quantity of the special ingredient that the users expected to be present in the bread. Two eggs per 1-pound loaf of egg bread was the response of almost 20 percent of the users (see Fig. 1). Nearly 24 percent of the users expected only one egg per loaf, 14 percent expected three eggs, and the frequency continued to diminish with the increasing number of eggs. The amount of butter expected to be in butter bread showed a rather erratic pattern. Users were shown a full-scale diagram of a \"quarter\" (a 4-ounce stick) of butter divided into 16 slices (or pats). Over 10 percent of the users expected a pound loaf of the bread to con tain two slices (or Vi ounce), almost 15 percent ex pected four slices (or 1 ounce), and about 20 percent expected eight slices (2 ounces) (Fig. 2). Eight slices would be 20 percent of the flour weight, or 16 percent calculated on a butterfat basis. The amount of potato flour expected to be in potato bread varied from a frequency high of 4 and 5 ounces to frequency lows of 1 and 9 ounces (Fig. 3). Inter estingly, some of the users expected more than 10 ounces, which is equivalent to the total amount of any flour normally used per pound loaf of bread. The amount of buttermilk expected to be in a pound loaf of buttermilk bread varied from frequency highs of 4 and 8 fluid ounces to lows of 1 and 7 (Fig. 4).

Half of these said they believe it is desirable. The other half said either that it is undesirable or that they had no opinion on the matter. About half of the egg bread users thought that it is egg yolk that gives egg bread its color, while whole eggs were mentioned by an additional fth and articial coloring by less than a third. Less than a fth of the butter bread and potato bread users thought that the bread contains articial color. Slightly more than half of these felt that the articial color is desirable, while the balance either felt that it is undesir able or said that they didn't know whether it is or not. Only about 11 percent of the buttermilk bread users thought that the bread contains articial color, and about two-thirds of these believed that it is desirable, the balance saying that it is undesirable or that they didn't know. A fourth of the users who thought the specialty breads did not contain articial color or who had no opinion on the matter said they would be concerned if they found out that the bread actually did contain articial color. The chief reasons for concern were their beliefs that: (1) bread ingredients should be natural, (2) the articial coloring might be injurious to health, (3) articial coloring isn't needed, and (4) they don'tlike articial ingredients in general. The chief reason given by those who were not concerned was that they consider articial coloring to be harmless. I t w a s e s p e c i a l l y i n t e r e s t i n g t o l e a r n f r o m t h e r e s p o n s e s of the condence consumers place in their bakers. After the users were asked how much of the special ingredient they thought was contained in each of the specialty breads, they were then asked how much they thought really should be in a bread bearing a particular name. There was no great difference between the two answers, indicating that consumers are usually condent that bakers are providing them with a product which has the composition they feel it should have (Figs. 1-4). Another matter of long-time interest to FDA was included in the survey\u2014the degree of consumer interest in the softness of all bread. All households interviewed, whether users of any of the specialty breads or not, were asked \"Do you ever check a loaf for softness? If you do, what are you trying to determine? If not, how do you determine whether or not a loaf of bread is fresh?\" Of the respondents, 85 percent said that they do check the loaf to see if it is soft. Practically all of these said that they do so by touching the loaf in some manner and that to them the degree of softness is a measure of the bread's freshness.

This close correlation of softness with freshness is of interest in light of the faet that the standards for breads do not permit ingredients whose principal func tion is to contribute and maintain softness in bread, although this may be a subsidiary effect of some of the shortenings and dough eonditioners allowed. At the same time the consumer study was under way, FDA was busy conducting a different kind of survey. This was a national survey of actual production prac tices throughout the Nation for the purpose of deter mining what the consumer really is getting. In 1967 and 1968 all Districts were asked to gather, during the course of routine bakery inspections, information re garding the formulation of specialty breads. F o r e a s e o f e o m p a r i s o n t h e t e r m s r e p o r t e d i n t h e . FDA survey have been eonverted to those used in the consumer survey. For example, the quantity of whole egg solids per 100 parts by weight of flour is expressed as shell eggs per pound loaf of bread. This ealculation is based on the reasonable assumption that the average person being interviewed thinks in terms of an eggthat weighs about 50 grams. The average solids eontent of the egg is taken at 26 percent and the average amount of flour in a pound loaf of bread at 10 ounces. The milk fat in butter is calculated on a basis of 80 percent and the solids in buttermilk from sweet cream at 8 percent. It was found that the number of eggs\u2014or equivalent in dried eggs\u2014in 17 egg breads (bread with the word \"egg\" appearing in the name of the food) varied from a little more than one-fth of one egg to about IVa eggs with a frequency high of about one-third of an egg and an average of slightly more than half an egg (Fig. 1). It is interesting to note that all of these gures are considerably lower than the two eggs believed to be present by almost 20 percent of the users or, indeed, than the three or four eggs believed to be present by many other consumers. Only two of the 17 egg breads surveyed by FDA contained articial color. It was found that the equivalent in slices of butter in 18 butter breads varied from a low of none at all to a high of almost 2V2 (Fig. 2). The frequeney highs were one slice and 2V2 slices and the average was slightly more than \\V2 slices. These amounts are con siderably lower than those believed to be present by most users, especially the eight slices expected by about 20 percent of the users. Articial color as such did not 28 / February 1969 / FDA Papersappear in the formula for any of the butter breads; however, it is possible that some of the butter used may have contained added color. The amount of potato flour in 12 \"potato breads\" varied from a third of an ounce to almost 0.9 ounce with an average of slightly more than half an ounce and a frequency high in the range of slightly less than a half to three-quarters of an ounce (Fig. 3). Since the standard of identity for white bread permits up to three parts of potato flour\u2014almost a third of an ounce per loaf\u2014as an optional ingredient, some of the so-called potato breads with the lesser amounts of potato flour a r e n o t m u c h d i f f e r e n t f r o m s t a n d a r d i z e d w h i t e b r e a d . On the other hand, some of the consumers' concepts included a high of as much as 10 or more ounces of potato flour. It should be noted that too high a per centage of potato flour poses serious problems in bakery technology. The 29 breads with the word \" b u t t e r m i l k \" i n t h e n a m e \u2014 a n d m o s t o f t h e s e a r e labeled \"enriched bread made with buttermilk\"^\u2014 ranged from a low of slightly less than one-half fluid ounce to a high of 9 fluid ounces of buttermilk per pound loaf. The average was 5 fluid ounces and the frequency high was in the range of 2 to 6 fluid ounces (Fig. 4). This is one bread where the amount actually present approached the consumer concept with its fre quency high of as much as 8 fluid ounces. These differences between what people often expect a bread to contain and what it actually does contain show that many American consumers are unsure or unaware of just what they are buying, but rely on the baker to provide the product the label indicates. It is evident that consumers do not realize that the quantities of special ingredients that can be used in bread are sometimes self-limiting. To use as much as some con sumers expect could cause technological problems and even downgrade the bread's characteristics rather than enhance them. On the other hand, a comparison of the surveys of consumers and manufacturers reveals that some bakers' formulas are lower than may be con sidered reasonable as to the quantity actually present of the ingredient that is named on the label. It is FDA's responsibility to assure that the special ingredient from which the bread derives its name is used in a quantity that is reasonable, particularly in view of the survey's demonstration of consumer con fusion as to what is in the specialty breads studied. The minimum amount of the special ingredient specied by an identity standard would insure that the consumer, who relies on the baker to provide the product the label indicates, will get a standard product no matter who the baker is.James 0. Dunston joined FDA as a food technologist in 1966 after 15 years as a food technologist with the Army Quartermaster Corps, the last 3 years at the Army's Natick Labs in Massachusetts. FDA Papers / February 1969 / 29ATLANTA DISTRICT H. Traub's Sons, Inc., Savannah, Ga., and Frank F. Traub, Jr., its vice president, each pleaded nolo contendere in November to charges led by FDA, when inspection showed that the rm was storing food in a building accessible to rodents and in sects, resulting in the food products becoming con taminated with insects and rodent lth. The court ac cepted the nolo contendere pleas, and both defendants were placed on probation for 5 years. A 1,430,560-pound lot of pelletized shmeal, valued at $75,921, was detained by the District late in October when laboratory examination revealed that the product contained Salmonella micro-organisms. The shmeal, offered for entry at the port of Jacksonville, Fla., was being imported by H. J. Baker & Bros., Inc., New York, N.Y., and had been shipped by Gloucester Peruvian through Sindicato Nacional De Productores De Harina De Peacada, S.A., Lima, Peru. The lot reportedly occu pied all the cargo space on the vessel transporting it, which had been leased especially for the shipment. The importing rm plans to construct a new facility at Fernandina, Fla., to reprocess the contaminated sh meal. BALTIMORE DISTRICT A consignment of lettuce shipped by Mel Finerman Co., Inc., Toltec, Ariz., main ofce Oxnard, Calif., to Landover, Md., was seized by the District in Landover on November 27 because of excessive parathion and toxaphene residues. The amount seized consisted of 851 cartons, each containing 24 heads, valued at approximately $4,025. BOSTON DISTRICT An FDA Inspector recently got a street level perspective of the Agency's programs and their effects on consumers in a metropolitan low-income area. Boston District Inspector Milton Jon Klevens par ticipated, along with college students, educators, and other Federal, State, and local government employees, in a program called The Cornerstone Project, in which he and the other participants were required to live and work in the Roxbury Section of Boston for 2 weeks. The program was devised to allow government ofcials and interested students an oportunity to live in an urban ghetto and explore the causes of poverty, ignorance, and poor health existing in the area. Roxbury, settled in 1650 by English colonists, is the second oldest neighborhood in Boston. Today, 60 percent of its inhabitants are nonwhite and comprise the city's largest sector of the poor and unemployed. In an attempt to accurately simulate life and living condi tions in this section, the Project participants lived in a dilapidated wooden tenement house purchased from thecity of Boston, and which had been condemned and was scheduled for demolition. Dormitory rules were established, and they found themselves sharing various cooking and cleaning chores and sleeping on straw mattresses. The emphasis of The Cornerstone Project was on en couraging individual initiative in establishing contact with the ghetto community and its problems. Mr. Klev ens, having a knowledge of the Spanish language, used this opportunity to take a census of Latin Americans living in the area. Hoping to compile as accurate a census as possible, he utilized the listings of Latin American registrants at local churches and at com munity agencies, where he also met many residents of the area and discussed their problems and their needs. In visiting local community agencies, he familiarized himself with the programs and organizations intended to assist Latin Americans of the Roxbury area. Mr. Klevens also conducted an informal survey of retail stores to seek to determine if they were selling inferior meat at excessive prices or if railroad salvage merchandise was sold in these low-income areas. It was his opinion, based solely on personal experience, that the meat was of good quality and competitively priced. At no time during the 2-week period when he was a resident of Roxbury did he discover any railroad sal vage merchandise on sale. Boston District employees proted from Mr. Klevens' description of the problems besetting Afro-Americans and Latin Americans in the Roxbury Section, when he related his experiences later at a District employees con ference. CHICAGO DISTRICT FDA representatives met in conference with the staff of the Illinois Department of Public Health's Division of Milk Control on November 21-22 at Springeld to discuss the Division's plans to ex pand its inspectional activities in the eld of manu factured dairy products. District Director Sam M. Hart, Supervisory Inspector George E. McDonald, and Resi dent Inspectors Leon E. Harrast, Peoria, and David R. Foltz, Springeld, discussed Chicago District policies and activities in the various resident areas and offered full cooperation to the State Division in their expanding protection to the consumer. CINCINNATI DISTRICT Based on several consecutive inspections which revealed insanitary conditions, FDA took legal action on November 25 in Nashville against M. Cohen & Sons, Pulaski, Tenn., and Joe Cohen, its vice president, charging that popcorn and rolled oats were contaminated by insects while stored in an insani tary warehouse operated by the rm. The rm was ned 30 / February 1969 / FDA Papers$200, and the individual was ned $100 which was suspended. DALLAS DISTRICT The District sponsored a work shop for the breaded shrimp industry November 9 in Brownsville, Tex., attended by all shrimp processors in Texas. The workshop was described as unusual in that the morning session for line workers and their super visors was bilingual, in English and Spanish. The after noon session for management and technicians was in English. Some rms, who employ as many as 600 line workers, have asked the District to repeat certain por tions of the workshop in their individual plants. Span ish translations of some of the speeches made have been requested, as well as lms used together with the Spanish soundtracks made in the Dallas District. DENVER DISTRICT The District has initiated a pol icy of providing State ofcials with a data printout for planned inspectional activity on a monthly basis. This scheduling allows State ofcials to assign staffs for double coverage of some rms when they deem it de sirable, or to permit State Inspectors to accompany FDA personnel for joint training efforts. DETROIT DISTRICT The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act was the FDA segment presented by Lilyan M. Goossens, District Consumer Specialist, at a conference in Youngstown, Ohio, November 23, jointly spon sored by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Federal Model Cities Pro gram. The meeting was attended by 30 community leaders and professionals. KANSAS CITY DISTRICT District Consumer Special ist Lorena Meyers along with Dr. William J. Scar borough, Education Program Ofcer in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Higher Education Facilities Ofce, Kansas City, were cochairmen at a 2- day conference on \"Drug Use and Abuse\" held No vember 1-2 at the University of Missouri, Kansas City. The conference, held for youth and low-income group leaders, was attended by more than 400 instruc tors, school superintendents, welfare- workers, pastors, pharmacists, nurses, regional health and welfare agency representatives. Federal executive board representatives, parent-teacher group chairmen, and local organization leaders. Consumer Information Specialist Sue Boe of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association was the key note speaker. Dr. Ralph Weilerstein, Medical ofcer in the FDA San Francisco District, spoke on the safe and effective use of drugs. During the last session, a local panel discussed \"The Problem and the Means to the Solution.\" Followup resources were emphasized for a continuing educational program in the metropolitan Kansas City area, through the classroom, informal citizen discussion groups, public lectures, reading lists, and audiovisualresources to be disseminated widely in the community at large. LOS ANGELES DISTRICT The District and the Los Angeles County Health Department investigated a case of botulism poisoning reportedly caused by chicken liver paste. Type A botulinus was found in the jar of paste from which the patient had eaten. The manufacturer of the product. Coronet Foods Corp., Los Angeles, re called outstanding stocks; no interstate shipments had been made. Other samples of the product have been examined, but no other containers showed presence of botulinus. Only the one diagnosed case has been discovered. After living more than a month in a respirator, the victim died on December 4. In an action prior to this investigation, bacteriological contamination of frozen breaded onion rings was the basis of prosecution of the same rm and two of its of cers, Henry O. Eversole, Jr., and Harry B. Fisher. Evidence to support the criminal action was the insani tary factory conditions and the ndings of E. coli orga nisms in samples of the nished product. After the de fendants pleaded nolo contendere, the court on October 22 ned them a total of $3,500. Because there had been improvements in sanitation after legal action was begun, the court did not place the individuals on probation. Camillo De Rocco, trading as Florence Macaroni Man ufacturing Co., Los Angeles, and his son, Francis De Rocco, were each ned $500 in November on charges of shipping macaroni products manufactured under in sanitary conditions. FDA inspection had shown insects in equipment and in various parts of the plant. The plant was sold to another rm before the indict ment was led. However, since the De Rocco's had a long history of insanitary practices, with a prior con viction on the same charges, FDA went ahead with the second offense prosecution. MINNEAPOLIS DISTRICT Magica Rust Spot Re mover, a product of Denmark, has been recalled from 36 dealers because it was found to be corrosive and po tentially fatal if swallowed. The labels lacked the sig nicant warnings that are mandatory in the Federal H a z a r d o u s S u b s t a n c e s A c t . NEW ORLEANS DISTRICT After three reports of personal injury from consumption of a bottled soft drink. Diet Rite Cola, the District analyzed the re mainder of the article in the three suspect bottles. Re sults showed a high alkaline content, with caustic prop erties. Allegheny Beverage Corp., trading as Royal Crown Bottling Co., New Orleans, instituted a voluntary recall and issued a press release regarding the hazard. Ap proximately 6,300 cases were recovered, and the article was destroyed by emptying the bottles. No subsequent injuries have been reported. FDA Papers / February 1969 / 31FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION DISTRICTS NEW YORK DISTRICT An injunction was obtained October 18 in the Buffalo District against Aiello Dairy Farms, Inc., Heuvelton, N.Y., for shipping adulterated cheese (see Field Reports, FDA Papers, Dec. 1968- Jan. 1969). The injunction called for destruetion or re conditioning of all cheese manufaetured prior to Oeto- ber 16. The rm's Brooklyn, N.Y., warehouse, where all the cheese is shipped, had approximately 300,000 pounds of cheese in storage. Buffalo Eiistrict was un able to insure that this eheese would not be shipped prior to testing. New York District requested and ob tained a New York City embargo on all the cheese. As a result, all fresh cheese, 39,000 pounds valued at $17,- 000, was destroyed; the remaining 261,000 pounds, still under embargo, awaited results of analysis. PHILADELPHIA DISTRICT Possible tragedy was averted when the operator of a drive-in restaurant in Allentown, Pa., discovered in time that what was as sumed to be a food ingredient being used in the prepa ration of shortening was actually phenobarbital pow der, which had been delivered to the restaurant by mistake. The drum of phenobarbital powder had been shipped by Gaines Chemical Co., Carlstadt, N.J., and was intended for delivery to Vale Chemical Co., also in Allentown. The drum of powder was returned to the shipper, and an investigation is being made to determine the re sponsibility for the mistake in delivery. SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT Keystone Co., San Jose, Calif., and Henry J.

In addition to the District participants, speakers were from the above groups and from industry. The theme of the workshop was sanitation from a bacteriological viewpoint, covering seafood products from the boat to the consumer. FDA DISTRICT OFFICES ATLANTA 60 Eighth Street, N.E.

Samples col lected were positive for Salmonella. As a result, 40 30-pound tins of frozen whole eggs were denatured under the supervision of State In spectors, who will continue surveil l a n c e o v e r t h e r m .

McCubbin, Chief of the Bureau, stated that training in in- spectional techniques provided by FDA's Kansas City District in Oc tober was put to practical use dur ing this inspection.

The workshops, conducted in D e a r b o r n o n O c t o b e r 2 2 a n d K a l a mazoo on October 24, were attended by processors and users of liquid, frozen, and dried eggs, who partici pated in an extensive review of the f u n c t i o n a l c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s o f b a c teria and their relationship to egg products. Florida Reports Statistics The Florida Department of Agriculture, under Commissioner Doyle Conner, reports that in November 1968, over 30 million pounds of red meat and poultry products was produced un der State inspection, while 422,924 pounds of the same products was condemned. State laws providing such food consumer protection in clude the Florida Wholesome Meat Law and the Wholesome Poultry Law as well as the Florida Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law. Ralph L. Horst, Food Consultant of the Division of Chemistry, Flor ida Department of Agriculture, re ports the breakdown of meat and poultry statistics as follows: red meat products produced under State inspection, 16,451,126 pounds; red meat products condemned under State inspection, 100,230 pounds; poultry products produced under State inspection, 14,224,406 pounds; poultry products condemned ante- mortem, 47,819 pounds; poultry products condemned postmortem, 274,875 pounds. F o o d L a w B e c o m e s E f f e c t i v e Enactment of the Michigan Food Law of 1968, which became effec tive January 1, 1969, makes Mich igan the 37th State to have uniform food, drug, and cosmetic requirements. The new law is almost identi cal to the food portion of the Uni form Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as recommended by the Asso ciation of Food and Drug Ofcials of the United States. Michigan's previous law was obsolete in many ways, having been in effect since 1895 with few amendments. A corollary study course cover ing the Michigan Food Law of 1968 has been prepared by two admin istrators of the Food Inspection Di vision of the Michigan Department of Agriculture, Division Chief J. L. Littleeld and General Supervisor J. F. Hartzell. The two men par ticipated last spring in a 5-day semi nar conducted by FDA on the food sections of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and provisions of the Uniform Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. T h e 1 9 6 8 l a w c a l l s f o r a c o m pletely new concept in enforcement procedures. For that reason, staff meetings were scheduled last Oc tober for an intensive study of each section of the law as a guide to Division inspectors in uniform in terpretation of all provisions. Inspectors Assigned Under pro visions of Pennsylvania's mandatory meat and poultry inspection law, effective July 9, 1968, the rst group of 25 State meat inspectors were assigned to slaughtering and process ing plants in 16 Pennsylvania coun ties. The inspectors began their duties in November after training 2 weeks at a special school of Penn State University's College of Agri culture and 7 weeks training on-the- job at federally inspected meat plants. According to State Agricul ture Secretary Leland H. Bull, the State Agriculture Department ex pects to have 112 meat inspectors trained by next June. Previously, the only meat plants inspected were those doing interstate business (thus federally inspected) and those voluntarily asking for State inspection. Under the new State meat inspec tion law, all meat and meat plants in Pennsylvania must be inspected. 34 / February 1969 / FDA Papers: y i \" 1 ^ 2 2 1 T 1 f I T ' l l ' \" \" !
