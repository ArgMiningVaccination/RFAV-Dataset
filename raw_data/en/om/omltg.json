FAQ on COVID-19 VACCINATION and BLOOD DONATION 1. What kind of side effects should I look out for? As with other established vaccines, you may experience some effects such as pain, redness, swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle ache, fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea and joint pain after vaccination. They are common and expected as part of the body's natural response. These side effects usually resolve within a few days. If you feel unwell or are concerned about your health, you may wish to consult a doctor. 2. What information do I need to provide to the Bloodbank? Donors are required to provide information about their vaccination - date of vaccination and brand of vaccine, and any side effects, as part of the donation pre-screening process. 3. Why is there a longer waiting period for live-attenuated virus vaccine? The 4-week waiting period for live-attenuated vaccine is due to patient safety consideration. This is because blood from a recently vaccinated donor may contain an infective agent which although not harmful to the donor, may theoretically pose a risk to patients who are immune-suppressed or immunocompromised such as cancer patients.
