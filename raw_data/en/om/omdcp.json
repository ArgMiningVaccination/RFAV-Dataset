Credit Cover: Ed Reed/Mayoral Photography Office Credit Back: Michael Appleton/Mayoral Photography OfficeDear friends and fellow New Yorkers, Seven years ago, we came into office determined to transform city government and uplift New Yorkers from every corner of this city. There was an enormous amount of work to be done: The terrorist attacks of 9/11, the economic crash of 2008 and the devastation of Hurricane Sandy were still being felt by too many New Yorkers. But we did what New Yorkers always do in the face of adversity: use our creativity and courage to come back even stronger. New York is the Resilient City. Even after setbacks and tragedies, New Yorkers never falter. We strive to make something better for themselves, their families, and communities. The COVID-19 pandemic showed the entire world what New York City could do: Overcome incredible challenges while putting working families first. From the start of the pandemic, our city fought to make sure our people were provided for, cared for, and ultimately, vaccinated and protected. This year's Mayor's Management Report details exactly how that work was done, particularly with regards to our COVID-19 response and the largest vaccination effort in city history. This data gives the public across-the-board access to city data, providing an honest and open accounting of how we rose to the greatest challenge our city had faced in a hundred years. The pandemic changed our lives and our city, but it has also clarified what is needed to see us into the future. This Administration has led the way in showing cities around the globe that we can leverage the power of good government to put people first. People can't fight inequality and climate change alone. The recent deadly flooding brought on by Tropical Storm Ida shows how much we need each other to survive the coming storms. I've never been prouder to be the Mayor of this city than I am now. Not only have we weathered the worst of a global pandemic: we have done it while building America's fairest and safest big city. We're expanded economic opportunity and access to education. We've protected tenants, brought down homelessness, and built new housing for thousands. And our Recovery For All of Us aims to build on the legacy of equity and justice we have worked for all along. There are always a few who are ready to say the New York story is over, but every time, they are proven wrong. Our city has been through tough times, but when you're a New Yorker, you never have to go it alone. That spirit of solidarity is one I'm grateful for every day, and one that will see us through whatever the future brings. Sincerely, Bill de Blasio Mayor LETTER FROM THE MAYORMayor's Management Report Fiscal 2021 The City of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio Dean Fuleihan, First Deputy Mayor Jeff Thamkittikasem, Director Mayor's Office of Operations September 2021Page vi MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR This final Mayor's Management Report during the de Blasio administration proves that we have a lot to be proud of as a City. During the last seven and a half years, we have worked to deliver groundbreaking new services to New Yorkers, push for increased transparency and accountability, promoted a racial equity mission, and responded to an unprecedented global pandemic. The Mayor's Management Report (MMR) is an annual report produced by the Mayor's Office of Operations that ultimately helps City agencies, offices, advocates, and the public better understand how New York City is performing. The report was first produced by the Mayor's Office in 1977 as a part of the City's response to the fiscal crisis, to highlight the impacts on performance in a challenging budget environment. The MMR includes both quantitative metrics and qualitative explanations that show how each City agency and related projects are doing and allows for year-over-year comparisons, or in this particular publication eight- year trends, to show where progress has been made, where more attention is needed, and where there are opportunities for improvement. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted and disrupted the city's normal operations\u2014not to mention the daily lives of New Yorkers\u2014but, at the same time, it has also spurred innovative, immediate efforts to rapidly respond and address the pandemic. This year, the MMR highlights some of that response, as well as documenting the performance of the city, and its agencies, during these times. While the MMR is full of important data and metrics, it cannot fully capture the efforts of the heroic, resilient efforts of New Yorkers to adapt to, respond to, and reopen in the face of COVID-19. In accordance with the City Charter, this report covers Fiscal Year 2021, from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Since then, we've seen shifts in our COVID-19 case numbers, but also have enacted new measures to promote vaccinations and keep New Yorkers safe. This report will primarily focus on the state of the city during the reporting period, but will allow for additional context from July to September as is needed to provide accurate information. The de Blasio administration continues to prioritize fighting for racial equity citywide and across every agency. The \"Focus on Equity\" statements implemented in Fiscal 2014 at the beginning of each MMR chapter highlight agency's work in addressing racial and other social justice inequities over the years. Following important calls for racial justice, as well as the outcomes of the City's Racial Inclusion and Equity Task Force, these sections remain even more important now to show how each agency continues to do its part and will prioritize this work in years to come. This year, we have added a notation that directly links indicators in the MMR to indicators highlighted in the Social Indicators and Equity Report and on the Equity NYC website, published by the Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity. This will direct you to data where these critical indicators are disaggregated by race and provide additional context. Thank you to the staff at the Mayor's Office of Operations and across City agencies for making this important report possible during this challenging time.

The annual Mayor's Management Report (MMR) covers the 12-month fiscal year period, from July through June. The Preliminary Mayor's Management Report (PMMR) covers performance for the first four months of the fiscal year, from July through October. The Charter provisions governing the submission of the MMR/PMMR can be viewed on the Mayor's Office of Operations' website at www.nyc.gov/mmr . The MMR and PMMR cover the operations of City agencies that report directly to the Mayor. Three additional non-Mayoral agencies are included, for a total of 45 agencies and organizations. Activities that have direct impact on New Yorkers\u2014including the provision of support services to other agencies\u2014are the focus of the report. A set of services is listed at the beginning of each agency chapter. Within each service area, goals articulate the agency's aspirations. The services and goals were developed through collaboration between the Mayor's Office of Operations and the senior leadership of each agency. The \"Performance Indicators\" tables contain the following information for the measurements of each agency's goals: 1. In the MMR, the most recent five full fiscal years of data are presented. In the PMMR, results are shown for the first four months of the current and preceding fiscal years, in addition to three previous full fiscal years. 2. A star designation ( \u00ab) showing which indicators are deemed critical. 3. Numeric targets, if appropriate, allowing for the comparison of actual performance against these projected levels of service. Targets for the next year are set initially in the PMMR based on the City's preliminary budget and are later updated in the MMR, if necessary, based on the adopted budget or revised performance expectations. Because resources affect an agency's ability to perform, the MMR and PMMR also present, for each agency, an overview of resources used and resources projected for use including personnel, overtime, expenditures, revenues and capital commitments. Additionally, spending and budget information are provided by budgetary unit of appropriation, and, where possible, are shown in relationship to an agency's goals. Each agency chapter also contains information regarding how well the agency is serving its customers including timeliness in responding to e-mail, letters and service requests made through the City's 311 Customer Service Center. At the end of each chapter there is a \"Noteworthy Changes, Additions or Deletions\" section where important changes are noted, including updates and corrections to information presented in previous reports. \"Additional Resources\" provides the full Internet addresses of links to additional agency information and statistics, including the agency's website. A User's Guide identifies and describes each component of an agency's chapter.The MMR/PMMR is available in an interactive web version and in the form of a printable book. Both versions can be viewed at www.nyc.gov/mmr . Also available at www.nyc.gov/mmr : 1. Definitions for each agency performance indicator including the data source. 2. Additional tables showing information of interest across agencies including workforce absence rates and fleet vehicle usage. 3. An archive of previously released reports from Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 1997. MMR/PMMR data for performance indicators and resource indicators can also be found on NYC Open Data ( https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/ ). Community-level information for selected performance measures in the MMR, disaggregated by local service district (community district, police precinct or school district), is available through the \"Mapping\" tab of the Citywide Performance Reporting (CPR) website at: https://www1. nyc.gov/site/cpr/mapping/performance-mapping-report.page . Additionally in CPR, users can select data for any month from Fiscal 2003, where available, to the current fiscal year. CPR allows users to see long-term trends for the entire period selected. Further, CPR is updated every month on the first day of the month, making indicators available more frequently than the twice-yearly MMR/PMMR cycle.

THE DE BLASIO ADMINISTRATION: BY THE NUMBERS The Mayor's Management Report (MMR) provides detailed information to the public on more than 2,000 indicators each fiscal year. This section of the report offers a snapshot of over 60 trends occurring during the de Blasio Administration, Fiscal 2014 through Fiscal 2021, across the breadth of all 45 agencies represented in the MMR, telling important stories from every corner of City government. Fiscal 2013, covering July 2012-June 2013, is the last full year of the Bloomberg Administration, and is used whenever possible, as the starting point for comparison. The below indicators showcase the de Blasio administration's achievements over two terms in educational outcomes, public safety, criminal justice and police reform, sustainability, transportation, access to healthcare, affordable housing, economic security and more. EDUCATION UNIVERSAL PRE-K DOE Mayor de Blasio announced NYC's commitment to universal pre-kindergarten in January 2014. The Pre-K for All program reached full capacity by the 2016-17 school year. Today every four year-old in the city, regardless of family income, has access to free, full-day Pre-K. This initiative tripled the number of four year-olds in Pre-K programs, from approximately 19,000 students prior to Pre-K for All, to approximately 70,000 students after launch. The Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity), an Office that helps the City use evidence and innovation to reduce poverty and increase equity, partnered with the DOE to lead the evaluation of the initial rollout and implementation of Pre-K for All. The mixed-methods study, which worked with national early childhood experts and independent evaluators, provided valuable insights into the strengths and areas of improvement in instruction, family engagement, use of data in the program and provided a snapshot of student learning. The administration built on this progress in early childhood education, launching a 3-K for All program in 2017. 3-K for All is the nation's most ambitious effort to provide universal, free, full-day, high-quality early childhood education for every three-year-old child and builds on the success of Pre-K for All. High-quality 3-K helps to make sure children are prepared for kindergarten and have a strong start in school and life. 3-K for All has expanded year-over-year, with DOE announcing it will offer 3-K in every school district for the 2021-22 school year. By this fall, the City will support approximately 40,000 3-K seats across all 32 community school districts. 010,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,00080,00090,000 Student Enrollment as of October 31 in of October 31 in full day pre- kindergarten; DOEPage 4 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT GRADES 3 TO 8\u2014ENGLISH PROFICIENCY DOE The DOE's Equity and Excellence for All agenda extends beyond early childhood education and into elementary and middle school. The Universal Literacy initiative, launched in 2016, aims to get all NYC students reading on grade level by the end of second grade. Roughly 500 Universal Literacy Reading Coaches support DOE's K-2 teachers with instructional coaching and curriculum development to reach this goal. ELA State assessments were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19. GRADES 3 TO 8\u2014MATH PROFICIENCY DOE As a part of the DOE's Equity and Excellence for All agenda to prepare students for success in math, DOE launched Algebra for All in 2015, a commitment to offer access to algebra to all students by 8th grade. DOE has trained hundreds of teachers in algebra instruction to meet this goal.

The AP for All initiative has drastically increased access to Advanced Placement courses, raising the number of students with access from 160,000 to 226,000. DOE met its benchmark of offering 5+ AP courses to over 75 percent of NYC high school students by 2018 and is working to increase this to 100 percent of high school students. The percentage of students taking AP exams has also increased, from 23.9 percent in 2013 to 39 percent in 2019. Data for 2020 and 2021 has not yet been published. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE DOE Through a variety of initiatives, including the Equity and Excellence programs, providing supports, expanding training and support for teachers, and improving engagement with parents, the four-year high school graduation rate has improved from 66 percent in 2013 to 78.8 percent in 2020. Academic planning for juniors and seniors was top of mind during the transition of the nation's largest school system to remote learning in Spring 2020. School counselors and college and career planning staff supported the Class of 2020 remotely. Schools worked hard to keep students on track toward graduation, supporting them on mastering courses, offering rigorous instruction and individualized postsecondary planning to prepare them for their next steps after completing high school. Additionally, the College and Career Bridge for All program rapidly expanded to extend near-peer support to 51,796 students in the Class of 2020 from July through September as they made their postsecondary transition. In Spring 2021, Mayor de Blasio announced a historic investment to bring 100 percent \"Fair Student Funding\" (FSF) for all New York City public schools funded by FSF for the first time ever, starting in the 2021-22 school year. This built on years of investment totaling $1.6 billion to raise the Fair Student Funding floor from 81 percent in 2014 to its current level. This investment represents the administration's commitment to bring all schools to 100 percent FSF once the State met their Campaign for Fiscal Equity (CFE) funding mandate. FSF is driven by equity, and the data shows that it's been successful in advancing it. On average, schools with high concentrations of poverty receive over 20 percent more funding overall than schools with low concentrations of poverty. 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45% Percent of High School Cohort Taking At Least 1 AP Exam in 4 Years of High SchoolFY19 FY18 FY17 FY16 FY15 FY14 FY13High Schoolers Taking AP Exams Percent of high school cohort taking at least 1 AP exam in 4 years of high school; DOE 50%55%60%65%70%75%80%85% Students in Cohort Graduating from High School in 4 (%) (NYSED)FY20 FY19 FY18 FY17 FY16 FY15 FY14 FY13Four-Year High School Graduation Rate Students in cohort graduating from high school in 4 years (%) (NYSED); DOEPage 6 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT NEW SCHOOL SEATS CREATED SCA The School Construction Authority (SCA) is accountable for new school construction and major renovations to older schools. SCA continues to respond to build new schools in areas of need to reduce overcrowding, upgrade facilities, and improve access to technology. In addition to preparing for Universal Pre-K in Fiscal 2015, SCA continues to build new schools and add seat capacity with 50,000+ seats added during the de Blasio administration. FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE READINESS DOE CUNY To prepare students with the technical skills required in the 21st century economy, Mayor de Blasio announced a 10-year Computer Science for All initiative in 2015. To date, the initiative has trained over 2,000 teachers and expanded access to Computer Science to students in 825 schools, with 177,000 students taking Computer Science coursework in the 2019-20 school year. The number of students who took an AP Computer Science exam in 2019 was 5,573 compared to only 1,137 students in 2016. The College Access for All- High School initiative strives to give every student the resources to build an individual college and career plan. With increased funding and resources to support \"college-ready\" culture, DOE is seeing tangible gains in college readiness. The proportion of students taking the SAT at least once jumped from 65.9 percent for the class of 2017 to 80 percent for the Class of 2018. In addition, the CUNY college application fee was eliminated for low-income students. In the Class of 2019, 44,936 students redeemed fee waivers through CUNY, allowing them to apply for free. The percentage of a 9th-grade cohort who, by August after their 4th year in high school, have met CUNY's standards for college readiness in English and mathematics, increased from 31.4 percent in 2013 to 54.6 percent in 2019. More graduates are enrolling in college directly after high school graduation, increasing their likelihood of degree persistence and completion.

During the de Blasio administration the City committed to expanding the program to over 25,000 students, allocating more and more funds each year\u2014now more than $77M each fiscal year to meet this goal. ASAP , which was a partnership between CUNY and NYC Opportunity has proven to be one the most successful initiatives, with students in the program graduating at a rate more than double that of similar students. To date, across eleven cohorts, the ASAP three-year graduation rate is 52.0 percent, more than double the 24.6 percent for a historically matched statistical comparison group from the CUNY evaluation. As ASAP has expanded, a larger percentage of first-time full-time associate freshmen join each year. This has contributed to an overall increase in the CUNY three-year associate system graduation rate from 12 percent for the fall 2007 cohort to 25% for the fall 2017 cohort. By 2022, ASAP expansion is projected to help increase the CUNY three-year associate system graduation rate to 35 percent. CUNY and NYC Opportunity continue to partner on a four-year version of ASAP called ACE that is producing similarly impressive results.

The result has been a reduced enforcement footprint coupled with a sustained decrease in crime. The number of major felony crimes citywide has decreased significantly since Fiscal 2013, from over 110,000 to 95,369 in Fiscal 2021, making New York City the safest big city in America. Comparing Calendar Year 2020 to Calendar Year 2013, there were approximately: 182,000 fewer stop and frisk incidents, a 95 percent reduction 245,000 fewer arrests, a 64 percent reduction 34,000 fewer marijuana arrests, a 98 percent reduction 5,900 fewer people in jail on average per day, a 52 percent reduction In 2015, New York City launched Neighborhood Policing, which has since become the cornerstone of today's NYPD. Neighborhood Policing is a comprehensive public safety strategy built on improved communication and collaboration between local police officers and community residents. Neighborhood Policing greatly increases connectivity and engagement with the community while improving the NYPD's crime-fighting capabilities. Through the creation and implementation of Precision Policing, the NYPD has shifted its focus towards the drivers of crime and reduced overall index crime 13.4 percent below an already historically low crime rate. The Police Department has committed to improving upon its training protocols. Enhanced training includes instruction in implicit bias to mitigate bias that might affect the way police engage with the public and respond to situations, and extensive training in de-escalation tactics. Furthermore, in order to hold one another accountable and promote a culture of a duty to intervene, the NYPD has partnered with the Innovative Policing Program at Georgetown University to provide Active Bystandership in Law Enforcement (ABLE) training for officers on how to be active bystanders who intercede when they observe police misconduct. In addition, Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training was designed in collaboration with mental health professionals to teach officers how to better approach and gain voluntary compliance from individuals in crisis. Lastly, midway through 2021 the NYPD unveiled a deescalating training, titled Integrating Communications, Assessment, and Tactics (ICAT), which will enhance efforts to resolve situations without any use of force. Body-worn cameras were in use in all precincts by 2018, completing a roll out that began in 2014. Providing body-worn cameras to all patrol officers increases accountability, allowing the Department to review and improve interactions with the public. More recently, the NYPD also committed to the public release of body-worn camera footage within 30 days of critical incidents. In 2015, the NYPD Open Data Platform increased transparency by making department data publicly available for examination, review, and research. The NYPD has made significant improvements to its use of force policies and data collection. In 2016, extensive revisions were made that included a new multi-classification system, mandated in-depth investigations, and introduced the TRI (Threat, Resistance, Injury) Report. Additionally, in furtherance of the Police Department's commitment to transparency, NYPD use of force data was opened to public scrutiny and uploaded to NYC Open Data, which expands upon datasets with their Annual Use of Force Report and quarterly public dashboard.020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000 NYPDHOW IS NEW YORK CITY GOVERNMENT DOING? | Page 9 SCHOOL SAFETY NYPD DOE The Administration has clarified the role of the NYPD in schools, limiting the role of School Safety Agents (SSAs), and emphasizing that school officials should handle non-criminal misconduct, or incidents where students are not posing a danger to themselves or others. SSAs now undergo extensive training, including conflict resolution, de-escalation, restorative justice, and implicit bias. This administration also committed to transfer by June 30th, 2022, the management of SSAs from NYPD to DOE. In Spring 2021, cohorts of SSAs participated in training with the DOE in Conflict Resolution/Mediation, Restorative Justice, and Implicit Bias. The goal of transitioning SSAs back to the DOE is specifically focused on ensuring that SSAs are deeply integrated into the school community, are aligned with the school's social-emotional work, in partnership with educators, parents, and students in ensuring the wellness of the entire community. The transition builds off years of investments in school climate initiatives and we've seen progress. Comparing the first three quarters of 2016-17 to 2019- 20, overall NYPD interventions in DOE schools decreased 5 percent, with arrests declining 60 percent and summonses declining 80 percent, while suspensions are down 40 percent during the same time period. Due to this success, DOE will continue this work by expanding restorative justice pilot programs to 500 middle and high schools across the city, which is happening in parallel with training SSAs in being critical partners in the execution of restorative practices in schools. MAYOR'S ACTION PLAN FOR NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY AND COMMUNITY-BASED SOLUTIONS TO VIOLENCE NYPD The City created the Office for Neighborhood Safety, which houses the Mayor's Action Plan for Neighborhood Safety (MAP) and the Office to Prevent Gun Violence (OPGV), which includes the Crisis Management Systems, Cure Violence and other anti-violence programming. MAP provides wraparound anti-violence resources in the 15 NYCHA Developments with historically higher crime rates, with demonstrated progress over the last several years. Since its launch in 2014, MAP has contributed to substantial reductions in crime at the MAP developments. By the end of Fiscal 2020, shootings were down 18 percent, property crime was down four percent, index crime was down 12 percent and violent crime was down 15 percent from Fiscal 2014, before the initiative began. The City has taken extensive measures to fight gun violence, including the launch of the NYC Crisis Management System (CMS) to work with 22 communities citywide and more than 50 community-based organizations to interrupt violence, prevent retaliation and reduce gun violence. The Administration has been able to create an array of programs to fight gun violence, including a low-barrier employment program for people who are at-risk for gun violence, and a hospital responder program that deploys violence interrupters to hospitals to prevent future acts of violence. From YTD 2012-2021 neighborhoods with a CMS site saw a greater reduction in shootings than neighborhoods without CMS sites. During that time period neighborhoods with CMS sites saw a 19 percent decrease in shootings, compared to neighborhoods without CMS sites.0200400600800 Developments Total Index Crime; MAPPage 10 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT PEOPLE SERVED BY THE COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS CCHR Reaching diverse New Yorkers and educating them about their rights and fostering inter-group relations is a core mandate of the NYC Commission on Human Rights (CCHR). Since 2015 CCHR's Community Relations Bureau (CRB) has actively increased the number of New Yorkers served year over year. CRB staff respond to bias incidents, provide NYC Human Rights Law trainings, work with youth across the city, and foster relationships with community-based organizations, houses of worship, and small businesses in order to reach the city's most vulnerable populations. Despite the setbacks of the COVID-19 pandemic, CRB was able to maintain its robust outreach, serving close to 100,000 New Yorkers for three years in a row. STRENGTHENING OVERSIGHT OF POLICE CCRB Under the de Blasio Administration, in partnership with the City Council, the City has made historic investments in the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB). In 2020, the CCRB had a staff of more than 210 and a budget of $19M, up from around 160 staff and $12M budget in 2013, a 30 percent increase in staff and 60 percent increase in budget. As part of these investments, the City built out the Administrative Prosecution Unit and Outreach Unit in the CCRB. The result is a more efficient and effective CCRB with strides made across the CCRB including streamlined access to body worn camera footage, creation of a training academy for new investigations staff, an increase in CCRB's community outreach and public education, and the expansion of CCRB's jurisdiction. The effectiveness can also be seen in the continued progress in the number of closed allegations with findings on the merits, showing the successful closing of complaints as either substantiated, exonerated, or unfounded. The Board renders findings on the merits when sufficient evidence has been gathered, from complainants, the NYPD, and other sources, to allow a factual conclusion to be made.020,00040,00060,00080,000100,000120,000 People allegations with findings on the merits (%); CCRBHOW IS NEW YORK CITY GOVERNMENT DOING? | Page 11 DECREASING JAIL POPULATION DOC The average daily population in DOC custody decreased 58 percent from 11,827 in Fiscal 2013 to just 4,961 in Fiscal 2021. The reduction in the jail population has been driven by a variety of strategies including expanded funding for Alternative to Incarceration programs and bail alternatives such as Supervised Release (SR), the court-ordered community-based supervision and support program for individuals with pending cases that was launched citywide in 2016. Additionally, accelerated reductions in the jail population resulted from efforts undertaken during spring 2020 related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of people in city jails on September 9/9/2021 was 5,941. DOC continues to monitor and report on this information. The de Blasio administration has implemented historic reforms within the City's jails, including the elimination of punitive segregation for adolescents, young adults, and the seriously mentally ill. As a result, the number of people in punitive segregation on a given day in New York City has declined by approximately 86 percent since 2014. DOC also pioneered and expanded innovative housing models including Clinical Alternatives to Punitive Segregation and the Program for Accelerating Clinical Effectiveness, developed in partnership with Correction Health Service (CHS), which include on-unit mental health clinicians, as well as the Special Considerations Unit which provides safe and supportive housing and curated programming opportunities for transgender, intersex, and gender non-binary individuals in custody. Understanding the importance of maintaining family connections, DOC created a free visitor shuttle bus system for visitors to reach loved ones at Rikers, and established the nation's first community-based visit program for incarcerated mothers and their children. These efforts are key components of the Administration's Smaller, Safer, Fairer plan to close Rikers Island and replace it with four state of the art borough-based facilities. JUVENILE DETENTION ADMISSIONS ACS ACS detention admissions have decreased dramatically from 3,149 in Fiscal 2013 to 987 in Fiscal 2021\u2014a decrease of 71 percent. This continues a trend in the justice system. This dramatic decrease also has continued after the implementation of Raise the Age, a series of reforms in October 2018 that changed the age of criminal responsibility to 18, allowing 16- and 17- year olds to move into housing and programming that better meets their needs. ACS continues to provide additional support and programming, renovating the Horizon facility and investing in additional diversion programming such as supervised release, case expediting, and intensive mentorship. 02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,000 detention; ACSPage 12 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT BETTER OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE ON PROBATION DOP The Department of Probation (DOP) fosters personal change, increases opportunities to thrive and strengthens communities, helping to create a more equitable and safer city. To this end, the rate at which people successfully complete probation in New York City has increased significantly from 84 percent in Fiscal 2018 to 91 percent in Fiscal 2021 for juveniles, and from 76 percent in Fiscal 2018 to 89 percent in Fiscal 2021 for adults, of which one in five now earn an early completion. This was accomplished while maintaining focus on the appropriate use of probation violation filings in order to avoid unnecessary incarceration while promoting public safety. Through accountability measures and service practices grounded in evidence- based research, as well as partnerships with community-based organizations and other stakeholders, we have worked to ensure that those sentenced to probation supervision in New York City have access to opportunities and services not just to avoid jail or prison, but to thrive. For juveniles, individualized Alternative to Placement (ATP) programs for high-risk youth, operated in partnership with trusted community-based organizations, such as the Advocate-Intervene-Mentor (AIM) program, were created to keep placement- bound youth safe in their communities. An independent evaluation of AIM released in 2018 found that over two-thirds of participants completed the program without incarceration (placement) and over 90 percent avoided felony re-arrest within one year, significantly improving outcomes for the well-being of these young people, their family, their community, and, at the same time creating an on-going cost-avoidance of more than $29 million. DOP also brings resources into NYC neighborhoods which have been inordinately impacted by the justice system that large numbers of people on probation, disproportionately people of color, call home. Premised on authentic community engagement, the nationally recognized Neighborhood Opportunity Network (NeON) operates as an engine of equity in seven communities where half of those on probation are within walking distance of a NeON, and strives to minimize adverse collateral consequences of being involved in the criminal and juvenile justice systems. An independent evaluation of the ground-breaking Arches Transformative Mentoring program, which connects 16-24 year olds who live in NeON neighborhoods with credible messenger mentors, found a more than two-thirds reduction in felony reconvictions among participants. Moreover, residents of NeON neighborhoods are now successfully completing probation at the same rate as those who live in neighborhoods that do not have these structural challenges, ensuring that justice system outcomes are no longer defined by a person's zip code and thereby contributing to a more equitable and safer New York City, at a significantly reduced per capita cost as compared to incarceration.0%20%40%60%80%100% Successful Completion Rate for Juvenile Probationers (%) Successful Completion Rate for Adult Probationers (%)FY21 FY20 FY19 FY18Successful Completion Rates for People Adult Probationer Rearrest Rate (monthly average) (%); DOPHOW IS NEW YORK CITY GOVERNMENT DOING? | Page 13 TIME FOR MEDICAL EXAMINERS TO COMPLETE DNA CASES OEMOCME The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) provides additional forensic services, including DNA testing, to support criminal investigations.

Fire inspections are designed to reduce the loss of life and property from fires through two separate and distinct inspection programs, one carried out by FDNY fire protection inspectors, the other carried out by firefighters and fire officers. In Fiscal 2020, FDNY launched its Risk- Based Inspection System to balance mandatory routine inspections and risk- based ones that focus on buildings are higher risk of fire and fire-related damage. Through these fire prevention measures and more, FDNY is able to contribute to the reduction in serious fires when a structural fire breaks out. These serious fires are those with the highest alarms, from \"All Hands\" to a \"5th Alarm\" and above. FDNY continues to respond to fires and emergencies and advance fire prevention citywide. EMERGENCY INCIDENT RESPONSE NYCEM NYC Emergency Management (NYCEM) has an increased ability to respond quickly to a wider variety of incidents. As a result, the number of incidents NYCEM is actively involved in has increased since 2013. NYCEM monitors several incidents that necessitate interagency coordination. While there was an immediate increase in incidents due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the general increase incidents also includes weather-related events including heat events, blackouts, flooding, sewage conditions, and several other incident types. The increase in Fiscal 2019 also demonstrates the variety of incidents NYCEM can now respond to, including two flash floods, a steam main explosion, high winds, a Con Edison transformer explosion, a six-alarm fire in Brooklyn, a helicopter crash, and thirteen winter weather events.Serious Fires Per 1,000 Structural Fires 020406080100120 Serious YORK CITY GOVERNMENT DOING? | Page 15 TRAFFIC FATALITIES DOT NYPD In February 2014, Mayor de Blasio released the first Vision Zero Action Plan, launching a major, inter-agency initiative to reduce traffic-related deaths on NYC's streets. Through the original Action Plan, and yearly updates released by the standing Vision Zero Task Force, the City has launched 273 pedestrian, cyclist, and driver safety initiatives over the last seven years. These initiatives include sweeping borough-by-borough plans developed by DOT on intersection- and corridor-specific re-engineering projects, including adding speed humps, protected bike lanes, leading pedestrian intervals (LPIs), turn calming treatments, and accessible pedestrian signals. There has also been significant investment in the Vision Zero Great Streets, where immediate safety improvements and permanent capital construction was completed in major arteries. These arteries include Queens Boulevard, Grand Concourse, Atlantic Avenue, 4th Avenue in Brooklyn, and Northern Boulevard. When Mayor de Blasio launched Vision Zero at the beginning of his administration, DOT's Street Improvement Project (SIP) program welcomed the increased focus on improving safety at intersections and along corridors throughout NYC that had disproportionate numbers of pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries. At the same time, DOT continued to outreach, plan and implement SIPs that improved accessibility and mobility, while also calming traffic, expanding pedestrian space, and supporting sustainable modes of transportation. During Vision Zero, DOT increased the number of SIPs implemented from an average of less than 45 projects (2009-2013) to more than 100 projects each year (2014-2020). NYPD has also increased enforcement of Vision Zero driving offenses over the years with a focus on speeding, failure to yield, and other critical infractions. The Mayor signed legislation in 2014 to reduce the default speed limit from 30 to 25 miles per hour, and following the passage of State legislation, 750 school speed zones have received speed cameras. The City has also engaged its own City drivers and TLC-licensed drivers in extensive driver safety training and the installation of telematics systems. After reaching historic low annual fatality totals, there were 275 traffic fatalities in Fiscal 2021, 30 percent more than the prior year. The lockdown and less pedestrian activity in Fiscal 2020, coupled with less traffic and increased speeding in Fiscal 2021 led to a higher-than-usual annual change. In May 2021 the City announced that speed limits would be lowered on 45 miles of major streets with some the highest rates of crashes across Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx Pedestrians Total Fatalities; Vision Zero, NYPD, DOT Pedestrians; Vision Zero, NYPD, DOT Bicyclists; Vision Zero, NYPD, DOT Motorcyclists; Vision Zero, NYPD, DOT Motor Vehicle Operators; Vision Zero, NYPD, DOT Passengers; Vision Zero, NYPD, DOTPage 16 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT PRIVATE WASTE HAULER VIOLATIONS BIC The Business Integrity Commission (BIC) regulates and monitors the trade waste hauling industry.

EDC launched NYC Ferry in May 2017, a massive expansion of affordable ferry service in the city. New Yorkers now have access to ferry service, for the same costs as a subway ride, spanning 26 landings across New York City, serving Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and most recently, Staten Island and the West Side of Manhattan. NYC Ferry has provided over 20 million passenger trips since NYC Ferry's launch in 2017, and will soon continue expansion to Coney Island, Brooklyn and Throgs Neck, Bronx. BICYCLE LANE MILES INSTALLED DOT Under this administration, and in partnership with the Vision Zero Task Force, DOT has made massive investments in expanding the city's bike network. Cycling has become an increasingly popular mode of transit, prompted and supported by DOT's investments, installing over 500 new miles of bike lanes, including over 140 miles of protected bike lanes. DOT has added additional bike parking, with over 18,000 bike parking spaces installed through bicycle racks and other means of parking during the administration. As a note, protected bike lanes are included in the Fiscal 2013 - 2015 numbers.

Since 2013, Citi Bike completed Phase 2 by the end of 2017, with expansion into neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan up to 130th Street. In 2019, Citi Bike launched Phase 3 of its expansion and is nearly halfway complete. This expansion will grow the system to 70 square miles and over 40,000 bikes, across four boroughs by 2024. At the end of the Phase 3 expansion, over 50 percent of all New Yorkers will live within a five- minute walk of a Citi Bike station. In the summer of 2020, Mayor de Blasio and DOT celebrated Citi Bike's 100 millionth ride and 1,000th station installed since launching in 2013. BUS LANE MILES INSTALLED DOT The administration has partnered with MTA to identify ways to improve bus service by constructing new and better bus lanes, and executing roadway projects to reduce congestion and raise bus speeds. The City worked with the MTA to drastically increase the number of Select Bus Service corridors, more than doubling the number of SBS corridors in the first years of the administration, from six corridors in 2014 to 17 corridors in 2021. Through the SBS program and the Mayor's Better Buses initiative, the City has increased the number of bus lane miles from 38 miles in Fiscal 2013 to 145 miles in Fiscal 2021, an increase of 281 percent. The City launched a pilot busway on 14th Street in October 2019. In June 2020, Mayor de Blasio announced that the 14th Street busway would become permanent.

In addition, the Parks Without Borders initiative selected eight parks across NYC to make them more open and welcoming to New Yorkers, and the Anchor Parks initiative brought $150M worth of community-focused investments to one large park in each borough. Since Fiscal 2014, the Parks Department has completed over 900 capital projects. 0200400600800 Curbside and DPRPage 20 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT CUMULATIVE REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS DCAS The City leads by example in fighting climate change. Mayor de Blasio set an ambitious goal to reach an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. For public buildings, the City has completed several energy efficiency and retro-commissioning projects that have been funded, in whole or in part, by DCAS on behalf of the City. The chart shows the annual reduction in GHG emissions, by metric ton, (carbon dioxide equivalent or CO2e) estimated to be reduced as a result of these projects.

The City has made progress towards this goal, setting a goal of achieving 100 MW of solar power by 2025. NYC's solar capacity has increased seven-fold since 2014. DCAS also manages the Demand Response program, where agencies can curtail energy during peak energy events, such as increasingly common heat waves. Collectively, the City's Demand Response Program helps lower emissions; create energy cost savings, especially by lowering demand charges, in addition to generating revenue; increase the reliability of the grid; avoid blackouts and brownouts; and reduces the need to run the least efficient, most polluting backup power plants.. 050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000300,000 Cumulative Estimated Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions from All Energy Projects Greenhouse Gas Emissions Cumulative estimated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from all energy projects (metric tons); DCAS 0246810121416 capacity (megawatts); DCASHOW IS NEW YORK CITY GOVERNMENT DOING? | Page 21 HYBRID OR ALTERNATIVE FUEL CITY VEHICLES DCAS NYC has committed to adopting a cleaner, more energy-efficient transportation network.

DCAS has transitioned over 3,000 City vehicles to EVs and has rapidly expanded the network of electric chargers, which now stands at over 1,000 charging ports, including dozens of new fast-chargers. Part of this EV expansion has included increasing the number of publicly available EV chargers, which will encourage New Yorkers to adopt EVs. In April 2021, Mayor de Blasio announced a new program to transition NYC schools to electric school buses, with a target of a 100 percent electric school bus fleet by 2035. Currently 67 percent of all City fleet are hybrid or electric vehicles, up from 41 percent in Fiscal 2013.

These projects have fundamentally changed the City's landscape and how New Yorkers access government. In its first year of operation, Text-to-911 saw more than 20,000 text sessions between New Yorkers and 911 operators, with no outages. DoITT also spearheaded and completed Wi-Fi capabilities in more than 170 homeless shelters that serve families in the City, with work currently underway at 40 additional sites. During the COVID-19 response, DoITT built several new projects including the City's main COVID-19 portal, used by members of the public for scheduling, vaccination site staff, and vaccinators administering doses. In June 2020, DoITT created the City's COVID-19 contract tracing application to support the City's Test & Trace Corps. They have continued to maintain and enhance the application since its deployment. To enable New York City's children access to remote learning during the pandemic, DoITT worked with DOE on the procurement, configuration, and distribution of iPads.

In an evaluation of the program in 2016, more than half of the cardholders used the card as their primary form of identification (and nearly 25 percent total indicating it is their only form of U.S. photo identification) and over three-quarters of immigrants surveyed reported that the card increases their sense of belonging to the city. The IDNYC program, administered by HRA, has greatly improved access to public benefits and services, and access to financial institutions and cultural institutions, as well as helping people access services in their desired language or with their desired gender identity. Since the beginning of the program, a total 761,259 memberships have been issued by cultural institution partners and over 81,882 cardholders have added the functionality to use their card as a library card. Cardholders saved more than $,1,237,791 on prescription drug discounts and over $3.8 million dollars in grocery savings. VOTER PARTICIPATION AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT BOE In advance of the 2016 Presidential Election, the City saw an increase in voter registration, with more than 350,000 new registered voters, administered by the City Board of Elections. In the Mayor's 2018 State of the City Address, the Mayor launched the Democracy NYC initiative, focused on civic engagement and voter registration initiatives. Democracy NYC works to address and eliminate historic barriers to voting through public education, outreach, and policy reform efforts.

These websites have seen a significant increase in traffic with a 70 percent increase in unique visitors from Fiscal 2013 to Fiscal 2021. This is likely due to the increasing availability of digital services from every agency and the increased demand for virtual and digital services during the COVID-19 pandemic. NYC OPEN DATA DOITT NYC Open Data makes the information collected in the course of City agency operations available for anyone to examine and analyze. This program is jointly administered by the Mayor's Office of Data Analytics (MODA) and Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT), with datasets provided by a network of Open Data Coordinators from approximately 100 City agencies, offices, and commissions. The breadth of information covered by NYC Open Data has grown significantly over the past eight years, with thousands of datasets containing billions of rows of data about nearly every facet of life in New York City. Beyond just making this data available, the NYC Open Data program has focused on making it accessible\u2014under a guiding vision of \"Open Data for All.\" During the de Blasio administration, the Open Data program has made data documentation easier to understand with plain-language guidelines, started a gallery of projects that make use of NYC Open Data, held classes to educate the public about Open Data, improved the reliability of the available data with more automated feeds, and bolstered reporting requirements to ensure the publication of data posted on City agency websites and support agencies in engaging with the public around their data. During our annual Open Data Week festival, thousands of New Yorkers gather to learn about all the things you can do with Open Data from City staff, experts from around the country and world, and each other.

Over 194,000 affordable homes have been preserved or built across New York City since the plan was launched in 2014, with a priority on the New Yorkers who most need housing. This includes extremely low income, low income, and homeless New Yorkers. To date, the City has started 12,657 affordable homes for seniors and 15,757 formerly homeless households under the housing plan. NYCHA CAPITAL PROJECTS ON SCHEDULE NYCHA The City has invested in completing capital projects at NYCHA buildings to provide higher quality homes for its residents. To date, historic capital investments have enabled NYCHA to complete over 100k xrf inspections, protecting thousands of young children who live in NYHCA properties from lead exposure. With over a $1 Billion portfolio, these critical projects include energy and sustainability upgrades, long-term resiliency projects, and critical upgrades to services such as elevators and heating systems.

In 2017, Mayor de Blasio signed the Universal Access to Counsel law, making New York the first city in the nation to commit to make legal services available to all tenants facing eviction proceedings in housing court and public housing authority termination of tenancy proceedings. Nearly 450,000 New Yorkers facing eviction and other housing-related legal challenges have received City-funded free legal assistance since 2014. Despite the near-closure of New York City Housing Court and other courts and administrative proceedings in early calendar year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, HRA's legal services providers assisted over 92,000 New Yorkers in a wide variety of housing matters in Fiscal 2020, including approximately 63,000 tenants in eviction proceedings. Residential evictions by City marshals declined by over 40 percent, from approximately 29,000 in 2013 to approximately 17,000 in 2019. In addition, the Mayor created the Mayor's Office to Protect Tenants in 2019, which, among other initiatives, created the NYC Tenant Resource Portal to help tenants across the city find the resources they need and navigate public and private resources that can stabilize their housing situation.

The number of people enrolled in MetroPlus has grown from 427,830 in Fiscal 2013 to 620,041 in Fiscal 2021, an increase of 45 percent. These increases come from actively identifying Medicaid eligible people within NYC communities, marketing MetroPlus within these service areas, and then enrolling these Medicaid eligible individuals. This increased enrollment provides lower cost medical services to eligible and enrolled clients, providing for better health outcomes citywide, while also supporting the sustainability of the H+H hospital system.

Regarding education, DVS developed a consortium of Student Veteran community leaders across New York City's post-secondary schools, known as Veterans on Campus. For health, medical and rehabilitative services, DVS orchestrated outreach that enrolled uninsured Veteran community members into VA Healthcare and the New York State of Health. To account for federal, state, and local benefits, DVS erected a unit accredited by the state to assist Veteran families seeking access to government-conferred rights and privileges. The agency also pioneered one of the city's first social impact bonds; unemployed and underemployed Veterans were trained and employed per the bond. In addition, DVS' Veteran-specific housing support services transitioned more than 1,000 New York City Veterans from the shelter system into affordable housing. Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, DVS created Mission: VetCheck, an ongoing initiative to bridge the social isolation the pandemic generated.

Subject areas include commercial disputes; hazardous product claims; civil racketeering and fraud claims; nuisance and restitution claims; antitrust claims; intellectual property claims; and challenges to state and federal government decisions affecting funding for public benefit programs and education. These efforts have resulted in substantial monetary recoveries for the City over the years.

But New York City, primarily due to the resolve and ingenuity of everyday New Yorkers, showed the way forward in responding to and recovering from this enormous international health, economic, and humanitarian crisis. The city rapidly implemented a comprehensive mobilization of personnel and resources. This includes an unprecedented health response predicated on science and data; the overnight creation of new programs to combat hunger at scale; the procurement and distribution of over 100 million pieces of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to frontline workers; the adaptive use of technology to maintain critical services; the redeployment of thousands of City workers to tackle emergent issues such as social distancing compliance; and the creative use of streets and sidewalks for recreation, travel, and commerce. From the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, New York City made a decision to focus on the science and to have a data-driven response. The City deployed a wide array of public health measures, including education and critical outreach campaigns; distribution of vital supplies such as masks; placement of large numbers of testing and vaccination sites throughout the city; mobilization of contact tracers and take care ambassadors; and constant response and recovery programs. The City monitored the evolving science around COVID-19 to implement and continuously expand proven methods for preventing and combatting the disease. These methods, put in place throughout the City, included social distancing, testing, and contact tracing\u2014and eventually, vaccination. With this multiagency approach, the City administered over 12.5 million vaccine doses in the 9 months from the first vaccination dose in December 14, 2020 through September 14, 2021. As the City focused on a \"Just Recovery for All,\" the Taskforce on Racial Inclusion & Equity (TRIE) has continued to be on the forefront of the City's efforts to engage the communities hardest-hit by COVID-19. r. The taskforce has monitored response in affected neighborhoods and among vulnerable populations. It has also identified key disparities through analysis and dialogue with affected communities. Its goals have been both to meet the immediate needs of those neighborhoods and to shape long-term strategies so they come back stronger. The work of TRIE is highlighted throughout the chapter. This chapter provides a summary of the City's COVID-19 response through the MMR reporting period of July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021. It cannot fully capture the rapid and complex nature of the efforts, but it lays out key aspects of the City's response during this time. It is important to note that due to the public health implications of this health crisis, we have included some information outside of the traditional reporting period to provide for a more accurate and complete accounting. In addition, there are installments of this chapter in the Fiscal 2020 Mayor's Management Report and the Fiscal 2021 Preliminary Mayor's Management Report. These installments have additional information and context pertinent to their reporting periods.Page 48 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT FRONT LINE HEALTH RESPONSE From July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021, the City experienced 574,281 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 162,650 probable cases, for a total of 736,931 total cases. A confirmed case is a positive result from a molecular test (PCR/nucleic acid amplification test/diagnostic test). A probable case is defined as either a positive antigen test result; a person who has symptoms and was exposed to a confirmed case; or a person who has died whose cause of death on their death certificate is \"COVID-19\" or an equivalent, although a positive molecular test is not on record. To educate City residents about COVID-19, testing and vaccines the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) disseminated messages to New Yorkers through many forms of media to educate the public on the health impacts of the pandemic, as well as to mitigate risk, stigma, and fear. This effort involved developing and issuing more than 300 guidance documents, including fact sheets, FAQs, presentations, and guides for the general public, as well as sector-specific materials, which were translated into at least 13, and in some cases up to 26, languages and printed and distributed more than one million copies of these communications. The Department also invested more than $125 million in citywide, multilingual, multi-media campaigns on subways and buses, and through neighborhood businesses (including laundromats, bodegas, and supermarkets), billboards, murals, NYC Link kiosks, digital/online, newspapers, television, and radio. To meet New Yorkers where they are DOHMH partnered with 41 community-based organizations to provide education to over 2.5 million people in their communities and conducted outreach across 167 zip codes to enable wider neighborhood, cultural, language, and demographic reach. The City also provided coronavirus resources in multiple languages, including through a specially created COVID Call Line. This call center fielded 139,152 calls, 27,073 of which were related to vaccines. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) faced unprecedented demands on its operations in Spring 2020 due to excess mortality in the City from COVID-19, and since then it has maintained much of its expanded forensic operations. OCME was able to handle the sharply increased demands by establishing a full-scale disaster mortuary as well as a long-term decedent storage facility at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal (SBMT) near 39th Street. As part of its public health role, OCME has expanded postmortem COVID-19 testing beyond deaths falling strictly under the Medical Examiner's jurisdiction to include natural deaths that occurred at home of individuals with respiratory illness history. Data from this expanded testing directly informs both City and State public health officials in their work on COVID-19 deaths and viral respiratory disease epidemiology. In the reporting period, there were 9,884 confirmed deaths and 510 probable deaths, for a total of 10,394. During Fiscal 2021, the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) continued to strategically direct its resources to support the City's COVID-19 response and long-term recovery efforts. Among the highlights was the launch of the Pandemic Response Lab (PRL) in partnership with NYC Health + Hospitals (H + H) in September 2020 for the purpose of increasing the City's COVID-19 testing capacity. By the end of Fiscal 2021, the PRL had completed over 3.4 million COVID-19 tests and had capacity to process up to 45,000 tests per day. NYCEDC also continued its collaboration with local manufacturers to produce medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) during the first several months of Fiscal 2021, securing approximately 900,000 test kits, 550,000 medical gowns, 3.7 million face shields and 1,670 ventilators for the City while simultaneously supporting nearly 3,000 jobs locally. In March 2021, NYCEDC selected Columbia University as the first winner of its Rapid Testing Innovation Competition to support the development of reliable and inexpensive rapid COVID-19 tests to help New York City reopen safely. To support the City's long-term recovery, NYCEDC began laying the groundwork for the launch of the Pandemic Response Institute (PRI) later this year. PRI will help prepare the City for future pandemics and other health emergencies by promoting collaborative and innovative research, health data integration, and community workforce capacity building. PRI aims to address gaps in health infrastructure to combat structural inequities that have disproportionately caused harm to communities of color. NYCEDC's work on PRI is part of the broader LifeSci NYC initiative, which aims to invest $1 billion in life sciences to establish New York City as a global leader in the industry. In an effort to stay ahead of COVID-19 virus variants, the Health Department's Public Health Laboratory (PHL) increased sequencing capacity and is coordinating data with the PRL and relevant partners. As of June 30, 2021, PRL and PHL have successfully sequenced over 22,000 specimens. PHL was part of a group that identified the emergence of B.1.526 (Iota) in NYC. As of June 30, 2021, 6,881 variant genomes with B.1.526 lineage have been detected at PHL. The Delta COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: COVID-19 | Page 49 variant was first detected in NYC in April, and it now accounts for over 95% of variants detected in NYC. The increased transmissibility of the delta variant that has led to its rapid emergence and predominance is believed to be due to an increase in the amount of virus that infected persons produce. The Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) contributed over $1 billion worth of items to keep New Yorkers safe during the pandemic. In Fiscal 2021, the DCAS Central Storehouse distributed more than $259 million in COVID-19-specific items to medical facilities, City agencies, and other public entities. This included $83.6 million in disposable face coverings, $52.6 million in KN95 masks, and $11.6 million in hand sanitizer. To mitigate healthcare facility staffing shortages at the onset of COVID-19, in July 2020 NYC Emergency Management (NYCEM) established a Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) that allows healthcare facilities to develop surge staffing contracts. GPO uses predefined rates that will help to prevent inflation during a future surge and allows facilities to manage their own contracts through direct relationships with vendors. VACCINE FOR ALL In preparation for vaccine distribution, DOHMH developed an equity strategy to guide the agency's planning and implementation to reduce population differences in COVID-19 mortality and serious morbidity. The strategy aims to address mistrust, misinformation, and concerns about vaccine safety, and to promote transparency. In addition, DOHMH developed city health recommendations for prioritizing essential workers based on risk. DOHMH also coordinated vaccine planning discussions among healthcare partners including hospitals, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), home health providers, the New York City Fire Department (FDNY), and OCME to establish plans for vaccinating staff in advance of a Food and Drug Administration-authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Administration of vaccines was further supported by an aggressive community engagement effort that in the period from January to June 30, 2021, conducted 51 webinar presentations and news media outlet interviews, 20 community conversations in a variety of languages and together with 15 community partners, provided services to immigrant older adults. In addition, canvassers at the Vaccine Command Center (VCC) have had over 6 million conversations and knocked on nearly 1.5 million doors. It has been estimated that New York City's historic vaccination campaign has prevented about 250,000 COVID-19 cases, 44,000 hospitalizations and 8,300 deaths from COVID-19 infections since the start of the vaccination campaign through July 1, 2021. To bring the vaccines to New Yorkers, DOHMH planned the ordering of almost 10 million Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) doses under the initial weekly allocation caps of the Centers for Disease Control. Administration of doses was facilitated by significant enhancements made to the Citywide Immunization Registry (CIR), which is used to capture immunizations administered in New York City. CIR was expanded to include an online application used to enroll health care facilities into the NYC COVID-19 vaccination program. As of August 3, 2021, over 1,870 providers were registered, representing more than 2,860 NYC vaccination locations. To achieve this level of participation, over 40 webinars and 2 feedback surveys were conducted to help providers with enrollment, vaccine management and clinical operations. Helping New Yorkers find vaccines was facilitated using the interactive online NYC COVID-19 Vaccine Finder. Over 1000 sites were added to the NYC Vaccine Finder between January and June 2021 including those operated by the City and state governments, chain and independent pharmacies, community health centers, private providers and pop-up locations. In December 2020, the Mayor's Office created the NYC COVID-19 Vaccine Command Center (VCC), an interagency effort to facilitate, coordinate, and promote the equitable distribution of vaccine throughout the City. As of July 2021, VCC and DOHMH have have worked with providers to administer more than 10 million doses, including more than 20,000+ through a City-run in-home vaccination program. The VCC worked with NYCEM, DOHMH and H+H to create 60 fixed vaccination sites and more than 40 mobile teams that conduct pop-up vaccination events at over 100 locations per week. The City also conducted outreach about vaccines at over 5,500 outreach events and across 4.5 million outbound calls to NYC residents. Thanks to these efforts, nearly 80% of adults and 70% of eligible children have received at least one dose, outpacing the national rate.Page 50 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT DOHMH COVID-19 Points of Dispensing (PODs) or Vaccination Hubs were initiated on January 10, 2021 with three sites, expanding quickly to 15 sites within a week. By June 27, 2021, 819,000 vaccinations were administered at PODs to over 407,000 individuals, constituting over 9 percent of all vaccinations administered citywide. During the reporting period, over 10,000 staff from City agencies, the NYC Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) and clinical temp agencies worked more than 14,000 hours at PODs. DOHMH conducted extensive vaccine handling and supply operations to support its own PODS and other providers. As of June 30, 2021, DOHMH: Received and stored 1,032,350 doses of Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J vaccine Packed and shipped over 959,070 doses of vaccine in 1,910 deliveries to PODs and other providers without loss of a single vial due to temperature excursions or handling issues Filled over 1,100 supply requests The City also contracted with 16 vendors to provide immunization services through fixed site, pop-up and mobile clinics, and at-home vaccination services. To improve equitable access to vaccines, from January to July 2021, a high-capacity immunization vendor with 34 DOHMH-operated clinics administered over 368,000 vaccinations and set-up 26 pop- up clinics administering over 2,500 vaccinations. Two contracts with non-profit organizations supported the City's 28 FQHCs and 42 independent pharmacies to prepare them to offer COVID-19 vaccinations in their catchment areas. From the start of vaccine availability on December 14, 2020 through June 30, 2021, FQHCs administered 569,189 doses. As part of the City's in-home vaccination program, DOHMH nurses and non-clinical staff called over 35,000 highly vulnerable New Yorkers to provide information about the COVID-19 vaccine, address questions, and book vaccine appointments. Calls have resulted in over 800 in-home appointments and more than 12,000 conversations to build vaccine confidence. While the in-home vaccination program began with homebound New Yorkers, it has grown into a universal program for all over the age of twelve. When the CDC's Federal Pharmacy Partnership Program for Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) ended on February 21, 2021, DOHMH's Vaccine Operations Center (VOC) worked with long-term care pharmacies and community vaccinators to ensure a seamless transition of access to vaccine for LTCF residents and staff. From the conclusion of the federal program through July 28, 2021, resident vaccination in nursing homes increased from 66 percent to 82 percent while staff vaccination increased from 41 percent to 68 percent. In congregate settings, including group homes for people living with developmental disabilities, behavioral health supportive housing and congregate treatment centers for people living with substance use disorder, approximately 21,400 staff and residents were vaccinated as of July 19, 2021. Notably, 85 percent of residents living in group homes for people living with developmental disabilities have been vaccinated\u2014a significant accomplishment given the risk to these residents and the high rates of transmission observed in these settings. To assure New York City residents that vaccination remains safe, the VOC continually monitors reports from the FDA/ CDC Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). From December 18, 2020 through July 2, 2021, 7,775 VAERS reports were received about individuals living in the City. Investigations were conducted of 491 of these to verify the association of the adverse event with vaccination and to determine the associated medical circumstances. In June 2020, DOHMH created the Congregate Settings Investigations and Response Unit (CSIRU). This unit coordinates with federal, state, and local agencies to conduct COVID-19 outbreak detection and response in congregate settings in the City to reduce overall COVID-19 mortality and morbidity among vulnerable populations. Between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, CSIRU investigated 19,076 cases and identified 62,472 contacts and 1,956 clusters across 1,804 facilities. In addition, this unit facilitated 29,305 COVID tests at 1,032 facilities and vaccinated more than 1,000 residents and 1,200 staff in nursing homes. For non-nursing-home settings, the CSIRU initiated an onsite vaccination program in 93 facilities which administered 119 doses of J&J and 796 doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to residents and staff. To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, CSIRU provided Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) training to 77 DOHMH staff and 433 participants representing staff and residents of congregate residential facilities, and CBOs. It COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: COVID-19 | Page 51 also conducted 53 onsite IPC safety consultations. This unit also conducted 525 investigations of vaccine breakthrough cases, 355 re-infection cases, and 140 cases that were both re-infection and vaccine breakthrough. To support enthusiasm for the available COVID-19 vaccine, the City was able to offer incentives. The incentive program began with tickets to local New York City attractions to cultural attractions. It has grown to include $100 for every first dose that can be redeemed digitally, picked up in person, or received via mail. The City is also offering referral incentives to Community Based Organizations, faith organizations, and businesses to empower them to serve as a trusted voice. Vaccinations by Demographic Group This table shows data on the percent of NYC residents vaccinated by age, race/ethnicity and sex Data as of 9/8/2021. At least 1 dose At least 1 doseRace/EthnicityAt least 1 dose Age Sex FemaleAsian/Native Hawaiin or other Pacic Islander Black Residents Vaccinated Only residents 12 and older are eligble for vaccination The number of people who received at least one dose includes people who are fully vaccinated. The Hispanic/Latino category includes people of any race. Vaccination rates for people identified with unknown sex, unknown race/ethnicity, or other race/ethnicity are not available.Page 52 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT TEST AND TRACE On June 1, 2020, the Trace Program was launched as one of the major pillars of the New York City Test & Trace Corps, with the goal of slowing the spread of COVID-19 by interrupting the chains of transmission. Since then, the City has carried out one of the largest contact tracing efforts in modern history, using a force that is now comprised of over 4,000 contact tracers. Each day, contact tracers work to identify cases (people known or presumed to have COVID-19), trace their contacts (people they were in contact with who might have been exposed to COVID-19), recommend isolation or quarantine, and assist with the provision of resources. In addition, contact tracers provide education, monitor cases and contacts daily, support individuals in isolation or quarantine by evaluating their needs for supportive services, and let individuals in isolation or quarantine know when they can leave. The Trace Program constantly evolves as the pandemic evolves. Examples of its evolution include the City's special contact tracing efforts (e.g., accelerated contact tracing, community engagement, information gathering, home specimen collection, and the investigation of facility exposures) and new contact tracing tools (e.g., Validate My Tracer, which helps to verify the identity of a tracer to reduce the risk of scams, and the COVID Alert NY Proximity app). Since April 2021, tracers can now screen and connect patients to monoclonal antibody treatment (mAb) in order to reduce the risk of severe infection. Finally, they have made over 7 million outbound calls to connect former cases and contacts with vaccination information and appointments The contact tracers, who speak more than 40 languages, represent and build trust among the communities they serve. The Trace Program is voluntary, and many New Yorkers have chosen to participate as a result of their interactions with the contact tracers. As of June 30, 88 percent of 820,147 cases have been reached; 78 percent of all cases (638,922) and 62 percent of all contacts (660,692) have completed intakes; and 98 percent of cases and 96 percent of contacts report having not left their homes since the last time they spoke with a contact tracer. Additionally, tracers began identifying contacts of contacts in summer 2021. Through the Take Care initiative, NYC Test & Trace Corps ensures that anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and their close contacts have the resources needed to safely separate in a hotel, free of charge, or at home, to help prevent the spread of the virus. In Fiscal 2021, there have been 289,026 Resource Navigators referrals completed and 22,258 guests who have safely separated in take care hotels. In April, the NYC Test & Trace Corps announced the launch of the AfterCare program to support New Yorkers living with the long-term effects of COVID-19. The new initiative, which is housed in the Take Care program, leverages the City's wide-ranging resources to help Test & Trace clients cope with the far-reaching impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of life. An estimated 10 percent of people with COVID-19 experience \"Long COVID,\" a collection of symptoms that develop during or following a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19, that continue for weeks or months afterward. AfterCare connects Test & Trace clients with ongoing health and social needs to the full range of resources and referrals relating to Long COVID, including H + H COVID-19 Centers of Excellence. These centers provide assistance in the areas of physical health, mental health, community support, and financial support, such as paid sick leave. NYC Test and Trace Corps also operates 3 mass vaccination (24/7) sites in 3 boroughs, Bathgate, Brooklyn Army Terminal, and Citi Field. Citi Field is the most popular City-run site in New York City and recently surpassed 200,000 doses administered since its first day in operation to September 2021. This is an average of approximatively 1,200 doses per day. As of September 2021, NYC Test and Trace's mobile vaccination fleet has administered over 125,000 doses. EDUCATION After extensive efforts to ensure the health and safety of its staff and students, the City was able to reopen its school buildings in September 2020, the only major school district in the country to welcome back students at the start of the school year. The City supplied all schools with abundant personal protective equipment; ensured safe ventilation; instituted mandatory school-based COVID-19 testing; and created an interagency Situation Room that enables quick responses to positive cases in schools. In preparation for the 2020-2021 academic year, H+H, and DOHMH ensured nursing coverage in every public school building and all early childhood programs across the City. As a result, every student and staff member has a qualified medical professional available every day who can respond if they present with symptoms at school. These medical professionals work in close partnership with the NYC Test + Trace Corps team assigned to public schools.COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: COVID-19 | Page 53 The \"Bridge to School\" citywide initiative for the 2020-2021 school year, announced in August 2020 focused on the social and emotional wellbeing of students and adults to create a safe, supportive learning environment that confronts the trauma caused by the COVID-19 crisis. Through this initiative, which builds on past expansion of mental health supports in schools, schools across the City were equipped to integrate trauma-informed practices into school reopening. Beyond training and direct classroom support, the Department of Education (DOE) produced a Bridge to School Resource Guide. This guide made grade-appropriate tools available to educators, including activities and lesson plans for both remote and in-person learning, which helped students build coping skills; process grief; re-connect; and better orient themselves to blended-learning or online classrooms during first the few weeks of school. The Office of Community Mental Health (OCMH) partnered with DOE and DOHMH to offer onsite mental health support in 248 high-need schools and access to onsite mental health clinics in 129 of those schools. OCMH also supported training to help educators and caregivers better identify symptoms of trauma and emotional and psychological distress in order to meet the mental health needs of their school communities. In all schools, for all students, the City ramped up its capacity to provide high-quality remote learning. In addition to providing more than 500,000 LTE-enabled iPads to students, efforts expanded to improve internet service and technical help to families. The City has also provided educators with highly rated educational resources and professional development that facilitate effective learning from home. For families opting for in-person instruction, City agencies came together to ensure that schools had access to additional outdoor space during the school day. The City approved over 150 streets for various educational uses, such as classroom education, physical education, recess, lunch, and school arrival and dismissal activities. Schools are allowed to use approved streets Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. The City looks forward to welcoming all children and staff back for in person instruction for the 2021-2022 academic year. SAFEGUARDING OUR MOST VULNERABLE The City continues to maintain a robust surveillance and epidemiologic infrastructure to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC. Trends in case, hospitalization and death rates are assessed by area of the City, age group, race/ethnicity, and poverty level. Daily analyses are conducted to identify cases and clusters in high risk congregate residential settings (e.g., shelters, supportive housing, and assisted living facilities) as well as clusters associated with non-congregate settings, including workplaces, schools, and day care centers. New cases are transmitted to the NYC Test & Trace Corps daily for case monitoring and contact investigations. ESTABLISHING FOOD SECURITY COVID-19 has caused food insecurity in the City to rise significantly from pre-pandemic levels. At the height of the pandemic, over 1.6 million New Yorkers experienced food insecurity. This number is now estimated to have declined to approximately 1.4 million. Over the past 18 months, the City has taken bold and effective steps to make sure all New Yorkers have access to the food they need during the crisis. At the onset of the pandemic, the City launched the Feeding New York Plan and GetFood NYC. The GetFood Emergency Home Food Delivery (EFD) program has continued to be available for homebound New Yorkers who do not have anyone who can bring them food and who cannot afford private food delivery options. Vendors engaged by the program provide lunch and dinner for up to two persons in a household. All of the meals provided by these vendors adhere to the nutritional guidelines set forth by DOHMH. Since the start of the 2020-2021 school year, more than 1,100 DOE schools have continued distributing meals to children learning in person or remotely and there are over 260 DOE Grab & Go sites offering meals to adults. A defining feature of these programs is the vast range of food offered\u2014Halal and kosher meals are available at select Grab & Go sites and vegetarian meals are available at all locations. Certain schools are also offering hot meal service to students attending in-person.Page 54 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT Across both programs since March 2020, GetFood NYC has served over 225 million free meals, provided emergency home delivery to over 1.5 million New Yorkers, and Grab & Go pickup at over 500 DOE Community Meal Hub sites across the City. Among other services, Take Care provides individuals isolating at a hotel with daily free breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Those isolating at home have the option to enroll in GetFood and receive two meals daily for the duration of isolation. Take Care also assists clients with enrolling in food benefits like SNAP and WIC and with accessing food through local food pantries. Take Care Resource Navigators have reached out to more than 280,000 New Yorkers quarantining or isolating in their homes, to help connect them to resources. The Department of Social Services\u2014Human Resource Administration (HRA) managed historic increases in the need for SNAP and Cash Assistance (CA) by building on its pre-pandemic capacity to provide online and telephone access for SNAP clients and then creating such access for Cash Assistance clients. Both SNAP and CA offer a lifeline for New Yorkers who need it the most. Finally, at the start of the pandemic the City experienced various disruptions in its supply chain, from sharp increases in prices of staples food items, to concerns from truck drivers about entering NYC when it was the epidemic's epicenter. As part of the City's plan to ensure that no New Yorker went hungry as a result of the pandemic, $50M was designated for a food reserve. Fortunately, these disruptions quickly subsided and in August 2020, the Administration made the decision to transition this food reserve into a new program, the Pandemic Food Reserve Emergency Distribution Program, also known as P-FRED. This program provides direct food resources to hundreds of pantries and community organizations across the city that continue to experience high demand because of COVID-19. Since September, in partnership with HRA, the City has distributed over 11 million pounds of fresh produce and high-quality shelf-stable food through P-FRED. ENSURING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH Due to considerable COVID-19-related operational adjustments, there were substantial changes in how clients were served through many City services, including OCMH programs. Nearly all of OCMH programs have continued to offer critical support to New Yorkers during the COVID-19 pandemic as new engagement strategies were launched to eliminate barriers to care for particularly high-need populations. To reach veterans during the pandemic, OCMH and the Department of Veterans' Services (DVS) launched Mission: VetCheck, in which volunteers from the veterans community were trained to make supportive check-in calls to veterans. Volunteers have made nearly 31,000 calls to veterans since Mission: VetCheck began in April 2020, with nearly 18,000 calls made during Fiscal 2021. Mission: VetCheck has helped reduce social isolation for veterans and is addressing veterans' needs during the pandemic (callers made 836 referrals back to DVS for help with issues like food assistance, housing insecurity, unemployment, and COVID-19 testing information during Fiscal 2021). In October, the City announced two additional initiatives that added new mental health services to hundreds of schools in the neighborhoods most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first program, the School Mental Health Specialist Program, represents a re-engineering of the School Mental Health Consultant Program, an existing OCMH program implemented by DOHMH in partnership with DOE. Launched in 2016, the Consultant Program employed social workers and mental health counselors in public schools to survey existing mental health resources, create mental health plans tailored to individual schools, and, when needed, connect students to mental health support in their community. In the new program, these same mental health workers serve as Mental Health Specialists and provide direct service to students through trauma-informed group work at 350 schools in the neighborhoods hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Each Mental Health Specialist will serve up to five schools. In addition to their work with students, they will provide mental health education to caregivers and school staff to help them address students' mental health needs and strengthen community and family ties. The budget for the Consultant Program will now support the new Mental Health Specialist program, so the new model will not entail additional costs. The second program, Pathways to Care, creates a new partnership between H + H, OCMH, and DOE. This partnership will expedite referrals of students to outpatient mental health clinics, where they can receive ongoing therapy, psychiatric evaluation, medication management, and other clinical services. To reach New Yorkers in their places of work and worship, OCMH trained over 600 employers and employees in workplace mental health strategies and over 150 faith leaders representing diverse faith traditions in how to promote mental health during and following a disaster.COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: COVID-19 | Page 55 NYC Well, the City's comprehensive behavioral health helpline, responded to unusually high need levels. NYC Well exceeded its target for answered contacts in Fiscal 2021 by 23 percent. Mobile Crisis Teams continued to go to people's homes when needed, with protocols in place to screen for COVID-19 symptoms before teams entered a home and with access to personal protective equipment for team members. In June 2020, just before the start of the reporting period, the City replaced Mental Health First Aid trainings with COVID-19 Community Conversations (3C): a virtual model comprised of 1-hour presentations and 3-hour interactive training that provides COVID-19 resources and information to New Yorkers living in one of the 33 neighborhoods designated by TRIE as those hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions reached over 18,000 residents in these neighborhoods, and 21,000 overall in Fiscal 2021. Launched in April 2021, the Mental Health Amplifier (MHA) Program is part of the Mayoral Mental Health for All initiative and aims to have an emotional wellbeing check-in with clients at vaccination sites throughout New York City. The check-in also consists of sharing informational material on mental health services and low and no-cost health services for New Yorkers who do not qualify for or cannot afford health insurance. Between April 29 and September 11, 2021, MHAs have engaged 88,252 New Yorkers, had conversations with 65,290 New Yorkers, and distributed nearly 186,000 flyers for NYC Well , NY Project Hope , and NYC Care , combined. ENGAGING SENIORS Social isolation is a serious concern that affects a significant number of older adults and poses increased risk for dementia and other serious health and mental health conditions. Since the pandemic and through Fiscal 2021, the Department for the Aging (DFTA) internal staff, contracted providers and volunteers made over 4.8 million wellness and/or social engagement contacts to decrease social isolation among its clients. DFTA's ongoing efforts to decrease social isolation connected older adults to vital resources including food, mental health, and elder abuse intervention services. DFTA also launched media campaigns in the past year to highlight services for older adults, caregivers and identify often hidden victims of elder abuse. Highlighted programs and services included the Caregiver program, Elder Justice, Health Insurance Assistance (HIICAP), and the Friendly Visiting and Friendly VOICES programs. In Fiscal 2021, DFTA also worked with other City agencies, including DOHMH and VCC, to strengthen collaboration and promote COVID-19 initiatives, such as vaccine promotion, for older adults. In the summer, DFTA collaborated with VCC to implement a mobile vaccine initiative at senior centers. DFTA, and its network of providers, made tens of thousands of vaccination promotion calls per week to older adults that receive DFTA services. The calls provided appointment, eligibility information and scheduling assistance. If an older adult didn't have a ride to a vaccine appointment, callers helped them arrange transportation using the City's free transportation resources. PROTECTING TENANTS In public housing, the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) took proactive steps to ensure the safety and well- being of the approximately 400,000 New Yorkers residing in NYCHA properties. From the beginning of the crisis, NYCHA staff used approximately 2.4 million communications to residents and other stakeholders in the form of phone calls, robocalls, and emails advising about the risks of the virus and measures to prevent its spread. NYCHA launched a COVID-19 resource website and posted safety posters translated into Spanish, Chinese, and Russian at all NYCHA developments. Working with Tenant Associations, NYCHA staff helped mobilize federal Housing and Urban Development Tenant Participation funds to cover the distribution of free meals in coordination with New York City's GetFoodNYC program, and to provide transportation, face coverings and PPE, and other supplies for tenants. NYCHA deployed targeted outreach programs for its most vulnerable residents, including those with active social service cases, those with life-sustaining equipment, and seniors. NYCHA also took special precautions and preventative actions to ensure that the physical state of its facilities was in compliance with public health guidance to keep residents safe, including deploying two vendors to provide regular disinfection services at NYCHA properties citywide. From March 2020 through May 2021, NYCHA's Quality Assurance and Environmental Health & Safety department conducted 5181 inspections at 291 developments to ensure vendors were doing the disinfections properly. At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Mayor's Office to Protect Tenants (MOPT), the Mayor's Public Engagement Unit (PEU), and HRA's Office of Civil Justice (OCJ) created a Tenant Helpline. The City's Tenant Helpline assists residential tenants as they navigate difficult situations, including inability to pay rent and eviction prevention. PEU's Tenant Support Specialists staff the Helpline and provide coaching and case management. They also connect Page 56 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT tenants with OCJ-contracted legal services providers, including the Right to Counsel Program. The Helpline has had great success and is now a permanent resource for NYC's tenants. These services are available to all NYC residential tenants regardless of income, zip code, or immigration status. In August, the City launched its first-ever resource portal to help residential renters access free resources from the City to help prevent evictions and keep tenants stably housed. The portal, launched through Mayor's Office to Protect Tenants (MOPT), the Mayor's Public Engagement Unit (PEU), and the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT), features an eviction prevention tool to help renters navigate free public and private resources that can stabilize their housing situations. The portal is free and accessible to all residential tenants. Tenants respond to a series of questions about their unique circumstances and are directed to the most relevant resources, such as help navigating an illegal lockout or eviction. The portal also has up-to-date information on the general status of evictions in New York City Housing Court. Through this effort, MOPT, PEU, and DoITT have brought together resources from multiple City agencies, City-funded nonprofit legal service organizations, and community based organizations, improving and streamlining how tenants can learn about the options that may be available to them. In addition to online resources, the City mailed useful information to tenants about available resources, including: the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) to pay overdue rent and hardship declaration forms to prevent eviction during the pandemic. The City also produces fact sheets with real time information for tenants on tenant rights, eviction protections, and courthouse operations. These resources are available in all required languages. SERVING HOMELESS NEW YORKERS Since the outset of the pandemic, the Department of Social Services-Department of Homeless Services (DHS) has worked around the clock to convey the City's latest guidance to social service provider partners, program experts, staff, and directly to clients experiencing unsheltered homelessness, or in shelters, especially as that guidance has changed in response to changing circumstances throughout the pandemic. This includes protocols for screening and connecting any individuals who experience symptoms to isolation and/or care, which DHS rolled out to shelter providers as well as outreach providers and staff at all of our specialized facilities as part of this all-hands-on-deck collaborative effort to ensure that clients' health and safety is put front and center. To monitor health and safety and to continue to prevent the spread of COVID-19, DHS is continuing to offer free testing. This systematic testing occurs directly at shelter locations, providing clients arriving to shelter or already in shelter with an additional layer of protection. DOHMH's Public Health Laboratory (PHL) continued to provide testing for DHS and between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, 22,272 specimens were tested. To provide protections for DHS clients and staff and further reduce COVID-19 rates citywide, DHS continued to make it as easy as possible to get vaccinated by delivering COVID-19 vaccines directly to clients and by initially establishing a dedicated vaccination site for clients. Using the model established for COVID-19 testing, DHS implemented a proactive mobile vaccination program, making vaccines available to clients in shelters where they reside. SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES The phased reopening of nonessential businesses across the City began before the reporting period on June 8, 2020, once the region had met all metrics outlined by the Governor's Office as well as the additional metrics outlined by the Mayor's Office. Major phased reopening took place every 2 weeks between June 8 and July 20, with additional reopening for other industries throughout the summer and fall. Notably, outdoor dining began June 22; schools started in-person instruction September 21; and indoor dining was permitted to begin operating September 30. As of the timing of this report, most COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted as 70 percent of New Yorkers over 18 have received at least the first dose of the vaccine. On October 6, New York State put into effect a localized approach to restrictions, based on the severity of COVID-19 cases in hyperlocal geographies. In addition to enacting red, orange, and yellow zones, all of which had restrictions beyond those in non-zone areas, the State implemented additional enforcement of business practices and engagement with the public on mask-wearing and public gathering. At the initiative's peak, there were over 450 inspectors working and inspections surged to an average of over 1,900 completed per day in the last week of October. In total, 315,275 inspections were completed with 2,629 violations issued.COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: COVID-19 | Page 57 In advance of Phase 1, an interagency outreach and enforcement effort was launched to engage with businesses on the State's health and safety guidelines. Health and safety guidelines fall into five major sections: physical distancing, protective equipment, hygiene and cleaning, communication, and screening. Led by the Mayor's Office of Special Enforcement (OSE), this collaborative effort included an enforcement component, consisting mainly of inspections conducted by 13 City agencies, and an outreach component, including development and distribution of outreach materials, and communication of State and City guidelines to businesses. In addition to inspection, engagement, and enforcement conducted by inspectors, the commissioners and staff at Small Business Services (SBS), DOHMH, Mayor's Office of Nightlife (ONL), Office of the Mayor's Counsel, and OSE hosted several events for the business community, sharing information and fielding questions about State and City requirements, and resources available for businesses. Dozens of public- and business-facing materials, including reopening guidance, flyers, and resource guides were developed by DOHMH, SBS, ONL, the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Buildings (DOB), and the Mayor's Office of Operations. They were distributed by inspectors and via email, public websites and social media platforms, and at virtual and socially distanced outdoor events, such as business corridor walkthroughs. SBS's Business Restart Hotline took 28,784 calls from businesses seeking support, while the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) worker hotline received 11,582 calls. As the summer of 2020 continued, the City announced the Open Restaurants Program, allowing restaurants to use open space on sidewalks and curbsides, expanding outdoor seating options. The program supports the City's restaurants by streamlining the application process while promoting social distancing. As of June 30, 2021, more than 10,000 restaurants are participating in the Open Restaurants Program. Due to its success, the Open Restaurants program has become a permanent part of the City's landscape. On October 28, the City announced the Open Storefronts program. It permits storefront businesses to use a portion of the sidewalk to display merchandise, sell goods, complete transactions, and provide queuing areas. Building on the success of the Open Restaurants and Open Streets programs, Open Storefronts provides safer spaces for small businesses to rebound in challenging economic times. This program has been extended through September 30, 2021. Due to rising cases of COVID-19, on November 13, all bars, restaurants, and gyms or fitness centers, and all State Liquor Authority-licensed establishments, were required to close from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. daily. Under these revised guidelines, restaurants were still allowed to provide curbside, food-only pick-up or delivery after 10 p.m. so long as it was otherwise permitted. As of December 14, food establishments were not allowed to offer indoor dining. As vaccine distribution began, the City was able to reopen indoor dining on February 12. Additional COVID-19 rules and regulations were subsequently relaxed and businesses were allowed to resume normal services with face coverings and social distancing in place. While outside of the reporting period, it is important to note that additional COVID-19 precautions have been enacted by the City. As of August 17, people 12 and older are required to show proof they have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine authorized for emergency use by the Federal Drug Administration or World Health Organization for: Indoor dining Includes restaurants, catering halls, event spaces, hotel banquet rooms, bars, nightclubs, cafeterias, grocery stores with indoor dining, coffee shops and fast food or quick service with indoor dining Indoor fitness Includes gyms, fitness centers, fitness classes, pools, indoor studios and dance studios Indoor entertainment Includes movie theaters, music and concert venues, museums, aquariums and zoos, professional sports arenas, indoor stadiums, convention centers, exhibition halls, performing arts theaters, bowling alleys, arcades, pool and billiard halls, recreational game centers, adult entertainment and indoor play areas This new requirement\u2014called the Key to NYC\u2014also means staff at these locations must be vaccinated.Page 58 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT In addition to its work around safely reopening, NYCEDC has collaborated with several partners to launch the new Small Business Resource Network. This public-private partnership, funded by a $2.8 million grant, will establish a team of 22 dedicated Small Business Specialists to work with entrepreneurs in communities hardest hit by COVID-19, helping them gain access to a range of programs and services. The Network will focus on minority-, women- and immigrant- owned businesses that have limited access to the help they need to survive the pandemic. ACCESS TO OPEN SPACE In Fiscal 2020, the City announced its Open Streets initiative to allow New Yorkers to safely experience summer in New York City. Open Streets are streets that are closed to through traffic and only accessible for local access, allowing pedestrians and cyclists to use the roadbed for socially distant recreation. Open Streets locations were selected through community engagement and data analysis to include neighborhoods that lack open space and were hard hit by COVID-19. The program includes streets managed by local precincts or local partners such as Business Improvement Districts, block associations, and civic groups. As of the end of the reporting period, the City implemented 83 miles of Open Streets. At the start of the reporting period, the City announced a new initiative, Play Streets, to provide families with safe, structured activities on Open Streets during weekdays. At Play Street locations, children participated in independent crafting and art projects. Giant board games and various sports drills were also available. Reading corners, dance classes, cardio and yoga exercises were also provided. All programming was creatively designed to meet social distancing guidelines. In March 2021, the City launched the Open Culture program, which permitted outdoor cultural programming on City streets. This program allows ticketed, socially distanced outdoor performances, rehearsals, and classes at nearly 200 street locations throughout the five boroughs. The Open Culture program provides stages for artists and cultural groups, putting artists back to work and providing New Yorkers the opportunity to enjoy the arts safely in their neighborhoods.

ThriveNYC represented the first time a large American city dedicated its own funding to supporting the mental health of people who had long been underserved. Fueled by that vision, New York City today provides more mental health services, in more places and in more ways, than ever before. More than a dozen City agencies and hundreds of community-based organizations have made this possible. Because of their work through ThriveNYC and beyond, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers from all communities, boroughs, and levels of need are getting care and support they once could not count on. In May 2021, Mayor de Blasio signed an Executive Order establishing the Mayor's Office of Community Mental Health (OCMH). With that act, the City recognized the long-term value of ThriveNYC's work\u2014and the vision behind it. OCMH, as a permanent part of City Hall, will continue to implement this vision by addressing critical gaps in New York City's mental healthcare system and activating every part of City government to promote mental health. In Fiscal 2021, OCMH partnered with 13 City agencies and nearly 200 community-based organizations to implement 30 innovative mental health programs. This MMR chapter presents highlights from this work as well as key performance indicators. Beginning in the Fiscal 2022 Preliminary Mayor's Management Report, some of the indicators in this chapter will be reported in the chapter of the primary implementing agency. This will be the final ThriveNYC chapter. SEVEN YEARS OF PRIORITIZING MENTAL HEALTH For the past seven fiscal years, the ThriveNYC collaboration chapter in the Mayor's Management Report has tracked a coordinated effort across City government to promote mental health, which included and extended beyond the work of ThriveNYC. Through ThriveNYC, hundreds of new mental health service locations were added across the City, embedded into places where support was likely to reach New Yorkers who might otherwise go without care. These locations included onsite mental health services at 248 high-need schools, over 100 shelters for families with children; all runaway and homeless youth residences and drop-in centers; 46 older adult-centers; and every police precinct in the City to serve victims of crime, violence and abuse. Beyond ThriveNYC, many other parts of City government have found new ways to promote mental health, ranging from more supportive housing and reentry services for people leaving the City's jails to social emotional learning programs in public schools and NYC Care, a citywide guarantee of health care, including behavioral health services. Mental health support has also been added to EarlyLearn programs in and outside of Department of Education (DOE) public schools.Mayor's Office to End Domestic and Gender Based Violence Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity Mayor's Office of Labor RelationsFDNY DOE DFTA DHS DOHMH H + H HRA NYPDPage 60 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT These new programs and initiatives have contributed to a significant citywide commitment to promote mental health. They add to considerable work already underway, including programs for New Yorkers with serious mental illness at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH); street outreach teams and Safe Havens supported by the Department of Homeless Services (DHS); and extensive behavioral healthcare services provided by NYC Health + Hospitals (H+H). A MENTALLY HEALTHIER NEW YORK CITY With more mental health support, the mental health landscape in New York City is starting to improve. OCMH's measurement approach is informed by a Science Advisory Group comprised of national and international experts in epidemiology, mental healthcare and the social drivers of mental health. In March 2020, this Science Advisory Group published two population-level measures that can be directly associated with OCMH's contributions to the City's mental healthcare landscape. If the entire range of efforts to promote mental health across City government\u2014including OCMH's work to close gaps in care\u2014continues, the City can expect to see improvements in the following population- level measures within five years: 1. More New Yorkers with mental health needs are connected to treatment. Defined as 1) more New Yorkers with an identified mental health need receive treatment, and 2) greater equity in connection to treatment. 2. Fewer mental health needs become crises. Defined as 1) fewer mental health emergencies, as measured by 911 dispatches and emergency department visits, and 2) less disparity in mental health emergencies. In Fiscal 2021, New York City experienced population-level progress on both goals. First, there is some indication that more New Yorkers with mental health needs are connected to care. According to a recent evaluation of NYC Well, the City's behavioral health helpline, nearly one in five NYC Well users surveyed stated that they would not have contacted anyone in the absence of NYC Well, indicating that the helpline is increasing mental health support for people who would otherwise go without. According to data from DOHMH, in 2015, 45.9 percent of adults with suspected serious psychological distress reported that they had received counseling or prescription medication in the past 12 months. In 2019, 58.2 percent had, according to the most recent data published in Fiscal 2021. Second, mental health emergencies are declining. From 2008 to 2018, the number of mental health 911 calls in New York City nearly doubled, increasing every year and in every precinct. In 2019, the total number of calls dropped for the first time in a decade, by nearly 8,000. In 2020, the number of calls fell by another 6 percent, to 166,565 calls. In the first half of 2021, this trend held steady. And we know that new resources, such as NYC Well, are connecting people to care so emergency resources are less needed: according to a recent evaluation, more than 20 percent of NYC Well users surveyed reported that they would have considered calling 911 or going to an emergency room if not for NYC Well. OCMH'S APPROACH Through high-level policy coordination, programmatic oversight, and strategic partnerships, OCMH works with City agencies to build new strategies to close gaps in mental healthcare. OCMH incubates these new strategies\u2014helping agencies to launch or change how they deliver services, enhance existing services, and maximize the reach and impact of these new approaches. The programs included in OCMH's portfolio advance four goals: Promote mental health for the youngest New Yorkers Eliminate barriers to care Reach people with the highest need Strengthen crisis prevention and response The programs supported by OCMH bring mental health support to communities and locations where it did not exist. OCMH does this by reaching people with the highest need\u2014those with serious mental illness, those affected by trauma and those living in historically underserved neighborhoods\u2014and by breaking down barriers to care for all New Yorkers. OCMH's programs are motivated by six foundational principles: change the culture; act early; close treatment gaps; partner with communities; use data better; and strengthen government's ability to lead. Data on over 100 reach and impact metrics for OCMH's programs are regularly updated on OCMH's website.COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: Community Mental Health | Page 61 OCMH is committed to countering painful, long-standing and racist inequities in mental health. One way OCMH advances equity is by concentrating new mental health support where it is needed most: in Fiscal 2021, over 70 percent of service locations for OCMH programs were in federally designated mental health provider shortage areas\u2014 neighborhoods with low levels of mental health providers per capita. PROMOTING MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the mental health of New Yorkers. To ensure that services continued to reach people who need care, nearly all of OCMH's 30 programs have continued to deliver services during the pandemic. Many programs\u2014specifically those that reach New Yorkers with the highest need and those that strengthen crisis prevention and response\u2014have continued to provide in-person services. Mobile treatment teams continued to provide intensive, ongoing, community-based treatment to people with serious mental illness, many of whom are experiencing homelessness. And several programs introduced new tele-mental health services, including those for isolated older adults and students. During the COVID-19 pandemic, OCMH also launched new engagement strategies to eliminate barriers to care for particularly high-need populations. For example, to address veterans' needs during the pandemic, OCMH and the Department of Veterans' Services (DVS) launched Mission: VetCheck, in which volunteers from the veterans' community were trained to make supportive check-in calls to veterans. Volunteers have made nearly 31,000 calls to veterans since Mission: VetCheck began in April 2020, with nearly 18,000 calls made during Fiscal 2021. Mission: VetCheck has helped reduce social isolation for veterans and is addressing veterans' needs during the pandemic (callers made 836 referrals back to DVS for help with issues like food assistance, housing insecurity, unemployment, and COVID-19 testing information during Fiscal 2021). More information, including additional COVID-19 mental health resources and toolkits, is available on OCMH's website. PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH FOR THE YOUNGEST NEW YORKERS Half of all mental health disorders appear before the age of 14. OCMH supports innovative programs to promote healthy development and lifelong positive mental health practices of young New Yorkers, grounded in research showing that early identification and treatment of mental health disorders can build mental health in the long term. OCMH also partners with the DOE to enhance access to mental health support in New York City's public schools. In Fiscal 2021, OCMH partnered with DOE to offer onsite mental health support in 248 high-need schools and access to onsite mental health clinics in 129 of those schools. OCMH also supports training to help educators and caregivers better identify symptoms of trauma and emotional and psychological distress in order to meet the mental health needs of their school communities. In the beginning of the 2019/2020 school year, the City launched a new partnership between OCMH and DOE: School Response Clinicians, social workers who support students across the city. These social workers provide immediate support in times of emotional distress, onsite counseling, and help connecting students to long-term care if necessary. During the COVID-19 pandemic, students in high-need schools and students enrolled in school-based mental health clinics continued to receive counseling remotely and School Response Clinicians offered wellness check-in calls and individual mental health sessions remotely to students in emotional distress or crisis. Additionally, school-based mental health support was added to the newly created Regional Enrichment Centers, offering in-person social and emotional support to children of frontline workers. In October 2020, the City announced two new budget-neutral initiatives that will add new mental health services to hundreds of schools in the neighborhoods most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first program, the School Mental Health Specialist Program, represents a re-engineering of the School Mental Health Consultant Program, an existing OCMH program implemented by DOHMH in partnership with the Department of Education. Launched in 2016, the Consultant Program employed social workers and mental health counselors to survey existing mental health resources in public schools, create mental health plans and resources tailored to individual schools, and, when needed, connect students to mental health support in their community. In the new program, these same mental health workers will now serve as Mental Health Specialists. Mental Health Specialists provide direct service to students Page 62 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT through trauma-informed group work at 350 schools in the neighborhoods hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Each Mental Health Specialist is serving up to five schools. In addition to their work with students, they provide mental health education to caregivers and school staff to help them address students' mental health needs and strengthen community and family ties. To bring additional support to students in the neighborhoods most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, OCMH also worked closely with H+H and the DOE to structure a new partnership between the City's public hospitals and the City's public schools. In Fiscal 2021, this program was in over 25 public schools, and the program is expanding to reach all school districts. This partnership, called Pathways to Care, expedites referrals from schools to connect students to care at outpatient mental health clinics, where students can receive ongoing therapy, psychiatric evaluation, medication management, and other clinical services. ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO CARE One in five adults in New York City experiences a mental health disorder in any given year. Yet hundreds of thousands of individuals in need are not connected to care. Barriers to care vary, ranging from a lack of nearby care options, complicated healthcare systems, a lack of insurance coverage, a lack of insurance coverage, language barriers, and lack of cultural responsiveness by providers. OCMH addresses these barriers and increases access to care in many ways. Below are highlights from this work. NYC Well is the City's comprehensive behavioral health helpline. Available by call, text or online chat, NYC Well provides a safe, easy way for New Yorkers to connect to care no matter where they are, what emotional state they are in, or what signs and symptoms they express. Trained counselors and peer support specialists provide brief counseling, peer support, assistance navigating the behavioral healthcare system and help setting up appointments with mental healthcare and substance use providers. NYC Well is free, confidential and has the capacity to respond in over 200 languages. It has answered over 1,360,000 calls, texts, and chats from people seeking mental health support since launching in 2016. NYC Well also deploys Mobile Crisis Teams operated by hospitals and community-based organizations and staffed by mental health clinicians and peers to respond to urgent mental health needs. Teams can arrive within hours of a referral and services can include de-escalation, assessment, and connection to ongoing services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, NYC Well responded to unusually high need. It exceeded its target for answered contacts in Fiscal 2021 by 23 percent. Mobile Crisis Teams continued to go to people's homes when needed, with protocols in place to screen for COVID-19 symptoms before teams entered a home and with access to personal protective equipment for team members. The Connections to Care (C2C) program is an innovative partnership between 14 community-based organizations (CBOs), OCMH, the Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity, the Mayor's Fund and DOHMH. Through C2C, CBOs work with mental health providers who train and coach CBO staff to screen their clients for mental health needs, offer direct support when appropriate, and link to local health providers for further care if needed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, C2C providers continued to operate both onsite where necessary as well as remotely, conducting mental health screening and referrals by phone. Providers developed new ways to support clients during the pandemic, including creating virtual support groups on relevant topics such as anxiety, grief, and loss and delivering social work services outdoors, in parks. In Fiscal 2021, C2C trained 87 employees from participating CBOs (for a total of 1,950 since 2016) and reached 4,803 people from all five boroughs (for a total of 51,171 since launch in 2016). This includes 801 participants who were referred to clinical mental healthcare in Fiscal 2021 (for a total of over 5,935 since launch). Service levels during Fiscal 2021 were lower than during Fiscal 2020, as contracts ended as planned on February 28, 2021, eight months into the fiscal year. C2C providers also experienced shifts in service delivery practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they began to deliver services via phone and video. Some also experienced data collection challenges during remote service delivery. In March 2020, the City suspended Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) trainings due to COVID-19 safety precautions. In June 2020, the City replaced the in-person Mental Health First Aid trainings with COVID-19 Community Conversations (3C): a virtual model comprised of 1-hour presentations and 3-hour interactive training that provides COVID-19 resources COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: Community Mental Health | Page 63 and information to New Yorkers living in one of the 33 neighborhoods designated by the City's Task Force on Racial Inclusion and Equity (TRIE) as those hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions reached over 18,000 residents in these neighborhoods in Fiscal 2021. REACH PEOPLE WITH THE HIGHEST NEED Many people who are particularly vulnerable to mental illness\u2014often those who have been exposed to trauma\u2014are especially underserved. OCMH supports programs that bring new, dedicated support to these individuals, with a current focus on victims of crime, families living in shelters, aging New Yorkers, veterans, vulnerable young people, and people living in historically underserved neighborhoods. Below are some highlights from this work. PEOPLE HARMED BY CRIME, VIOLENCE OR ABUSE Before the launch of ThriveNYC, many crime victims navigated the complicated landscape of the criminal justice and social service systems alone. Only Housing Police Service Areas and three precincts had an onsite victim advocate to serve victims of domestic violence. Beginning in 2016, through ThriveNYC, victims of any kind of crime are now served by the Crime Victim Assistance Program, which operates in police precincts and Housing Police Service Areas citywide. The program provides supportive counseling, connections to individual or group therapy, safety planning, assistance with victim compensation and help navigating the legal and financial challenges that victims can face after a crime has occurred. From 2016 to June 30, 2021, the Crime Victim Assistance Program supported over 204,000 people. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Crime Victim Assistance Program advocates ceased in-person services to ensure safe operations and transitioned to phone outreach and support. This contributed significantly to the lower-than-average volume of services the program provided during Fiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020. FAMILIES LIVING IN SHELTERS In partnership with OCMH, DHS has placed over 340 licensed social workers in over 100 shelters for families with children across the city. These clinicians served over 23,000 families in shelter since the inception of the program in 2016. Through OCMH's partnership with DHS, families with children residing in shelter now have access to dedicated licensed social workers who conduct behavioral health assessments and engage families around their barriers to permanent housing. These assessments include behavioral health history and screening for current concerns, as well as developmental screening for children. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the City's shelters remained open and fully operational, providing essential services and support to families experiencing homelessness. Social work services were provided by licensed clinical social workers virtually and in-person in some instances in family shelters. AGING NEW YORKERS Older adults have high rates of mental health disorders, yet low rates of assessment and treatment. Before 2016, many older adults went without access to mental health support. Since 2016, OCMH and the Department for the Aging (DFTA) have partnered to embed licensed bilingual and bicultural mental health clinicians within 46 older adult centers operated by DFTA. In Fiscal 2021, these clinicians provided tele-mental health services to older adults above age 60. Over 38,035 clinical sessions (including both short-term and long-term clinical treatment) have been provided since services began over four years ago. Over 54 percent of clients have experienced a clinically significant reduction in depression symptoms. During the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians provided tele-mental health services to clients and conducted new client assessments by phone or virtually. VETERANS In Fiscal 2021, to enhance mental health for veterans, OCMH partnered with DVS to support outreach teams that worked directly with veterans and their families and caretakers, connecting them to a range of community-based services as they transition home. This program is designed to serve recent veterans and those who have been veterans for many years, both of whom may need connection to services and support. In Fiscal 2021, this program made 2,142 successful connections to care, placing the program on target to exceed its annual target of 608 connections to care in Fiscal 2021. This high volume of connections to care has been possible, in part, because of referrals from the Mission: VetCheck Page 64 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT initiative, which connected veterans to programs providing support during the pandemic such as GetFoodNYC and financial assistance programs. Connections to care through this DVS program remain high for the second year in a row. VULNERABLE YOUNG PEOPLE The Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD) funds Runaway and Homeless Youth (RHY) Drop-in Centers, Crisis Services and Transitional Independent Living Programs, which provide specialized services to vulnerable youth, including LGBTQ+ identifying youth. OCMH partners with DYCD's RHY programs to enhance mental health services offered to young people residing in more than 50 RHY residential programs and served in eight drop-in centers across all five boroughs. More than 16,000 young people have been served through this program since 2016. During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health support continued to be provided to youth both in-person and through new tele-mental health services at residential programs (which remained open and operational) and drop-in centers (which operated on a modified schedule). PEOPLE LIVING IN HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS In January 2020, H+H launched a redesigned Mental Health Service Corps, an innovative program that provides three years of high-quality training to early-career behavioral health clinicians and embeds them into over 46 H+H sites across the five boroughs. Seventy-six percent of service locations included in this program are located in federally designated mental health professional shortage areas. The number of individuals served by Mental Health Service Corps behavioral health clinicians within H+H increased from 2,749 in Fiscal 2020 to 5,874 in Fiscal 2021, exceeding the target of 4,950. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Corps Members continued to deliver in-person and tele-mental health services. STRENGTHEN CRISIS PREVENTION AND RESPONSE To prevent crises and help New Yorkers with serious mental health needs function well in their communities, OCMH works with several City agencies to ensure those with critical needs can access and stay connected to treatment. Below are highlights from this work. Co-Response Teams are a pre- and post-crisis intervention. Each team includes two police officers and one behavioral health professional from DOHMH. Teams are available 14 hours a day, seven days a week to assist people with mental illness and substance use disorders who may be at an elevated risk of harm to themselves or others. Co-Response Teams connect or re-connect people to care or another stabilizing support, including medical, mental health, legal, housing and other social and clinical services. Since 2016, these teams have had over 5,600 face-to-face encounters (defined as in-person engagement) with New Yorkers and have served more than 2,200 people across the city (defined as clinical assessment, supportive counseling, health promotion and awareness, service referral, connection to care or other stabilizing support, or transportation to a hospital, clinic, or doctor's appointment). In addition to creating greater stability for these New Yorkers, Co-Response Teams also reduce the subsequent number of enforcement interactions with NYPD. During Fiscal 2021, Co-Response Teams served 661 new people. In March 2020, Co-Response Teams suspended in-person deployments due to COVID-19 safety precautions, but Co-Response behavioral health professionals continued to offer community members support and connections to care remotely. In- person deployments resumed on August 29, 2020. Since the pandemic began, these teams have connected by phone with individuals and their support networks (such as family members, service providers, and friends) 11,044 times, often with multiple calls per person, as the teams work to connect people to stabilizing support. OCMH also partners with DOHMH to implement several new mobile treatment team models. As one example, OCMH provides additional substance use expertise to 40 of the City's Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Teams, which provide intensive, mobile, community-based mental health treatment and rehabilitation services to New Yorkers with serious mental illnesses. These OCMH-enhanced teams have the capacity to serve 2,720 individuals at a time. Beyond OCMH, there are eight additional New York State-contracted or operated ACT teams and one additional City-contracted team in New York City. In total, ACT teams have capacity to serve 3,312 individuals at a time.COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: Community Mental Health | Page 65 OCMH supports four Forensic ACT (FACT) Teams, which provide the same intensive mental health treatment and rehabilitation services as ACT teams, and include additional staff focused on serving clients with current or recent justice system involvement. Beyond OCMH, there is one additional FACT team that receives enhanced funding from the State, which is contracted and supported by DOHMH. In total, FACT teams have capacity to serve 340 clients at a time. OCMH also supports Intensive Mobile Treatment (IMT) teams managed by DOHMH. IMT teams provide a particularly flexible model of behavioral health treatment and intensive support to adults with mental illness and/or substance use disorders, homelessness and/or transience and escalating behaviors. IMT teams include mental health, substance use, and peer specialists who help individuals maintain a treatment plan and facilitate connection to housing and additional supportive services. IMT teams currently have the capacity to serve up to 297 individuals at a time, and this capacity will grow by 540 in Fiscal 2022. Collectively, in Fiscal 2021, mobile treatment teams in NYC had the capacity to serve over 3,949 clients at a time. Due to the unique needs of particular clients, the duration of service for each client served by a team can vary, but teams work to engage clients for several months. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ACT, FACT and IMT teams provided a combination of tele-mental health and in- person services and achieved a high level of client retention. The most recent data on client retention show that mobile treatment teams were able to keep clients engaged in care at nearly the same levels before and during the pandemic. Across mobile teams, the percentage of clients who continued to receive treatment from a team for three months or longer was 80 percent during the most recent month for which data are available (March 2021). NOTE ON THE EFFECT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC Due to considerable COVID-19-related operational adjustments, there were substantial changes in how clients were served through many City services, including OCMH programs. Nearly all OCMH programs have continued to offer critical support to New Yorkers during the COVID-19 pandemic, although operational adjustments resulted in reduced numbers of clients served for some programs. One short-term stabilization program (the Support and Connection Center in East Harlem) and two in-person training programs (Mental Health First Aid and Crisis Intervention Training) suspended operations during COVID-19 due to safety precautions. These programs remained suspended during Fiscal 2021.Page 66 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT SELECTED PERFORMANCE FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY21 FY22 Promote mental health for the youngest New Yorkers Schools with access to OCMH-supported on-site clinical mental health services (with DOHMH/DOE) 172 235 247 248 248 248 N/A Mental health workshops and trainings conducted for teachers, school staff, mental health professionals, families and students (with DOE and DOHMH) *Includes Community Schools, Prevention and Intervention Program, School Mental Health Specialists, Social Emotional Learning 3,920 6,512 9,151 7,781 10,925 4,000 N/A Eliminate Barriers to Care People who live or work in NYC trained in Mental Health First Aid (With DOHMH) 18,656 48,988 53,186 34,351 N/A N/A N/A who received mental health support through Connections to Care (with OEO) 7,532 12,080 14,901 11,534 4,803 4,000 N/A Reach people with the highest need Individuals who, after reporting a crime, received support to deal with the emotional, physical and financial aftermath of crime through the Crime Victim Assistance Program (with NYPD and MOCJ) 16,088 40,410 59,008 49,904 39,283 35,000 35,000 Veterans, family members and caregivers who were successfully connected to care, services or resources through VetsThrive (with DVS) 194 282 504 1,402 2,142 608 608 Young people who received mental health support in a city-funded residential program or drop-in center serving runaway and homeless youth (with DYCD) 2,408 2,802 2,569 2,648 2,794 2,600 2,600 Percentage of families living in shelter who received biopsychosocial screenings from mental health 79% 80% 80% 80% Individuals who received clinical services from Mental Health Service Corps behavioral health clinicians (with H+H) N/A N/A N/A 2,749 5,874 4,950 4,950 Strengthen crisis prevention and response Individuals who received services from long-term mobile community-based treatment providers (with DOHMH) *includes Co-Response Team (with DOHMH and NYPD) 182 243 605 498 661 400 500COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: Community Mental Health | Page 67 NOTEWORTHY CHANGES, ADDITIONS OR DELETIONS ! Beginning in Fiscal 2022, Mental Health Services in High-Need Schools (the program associated with the indicator 'Schools with access to OCMH-supported on-site clinical mental health services (with DOHMH/DOE)') will be fully integrated into the ongoing operations of the DOE and DOHMH and no longer overseen by the Mayor's Office of Community Mental Health. In Fiscal 2022, the DOE and DOHMH anticipate significantly expanding onsite mental health services in schools. For the indicator 'Mental health workshops and trainings conducted for teachers, school staff, mental health professionals, families and students (with DOE and DOHMH),' this does not include Youth Mental Health First Aid, which was suspended in June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the indicator, 'Individuals who received mental health support through Connections to Care (with OEO),' the reported number of individuals who received mental health support through Connections to Care was revised upward for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020 based on updated reporting from participating C2C providers. In Fiscal 2020, the definition of 'new individuals engaged by a Co-Response Team' was expanded from \"face-to-face contact with a community member and at least one service provided\" to also include phone contacts, which were added as a method of delivering services during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this report, the Fiscal 2020 total has been adjusted downward to reflect a more precise calculation of phone contacts with community members. Additionally, the Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020 totals have been adjusted downward to reflect a more accurate distinction between client records for Co-Response Teams and other programs that share DOHMH's clinical database, following significant maintenance to this database. It should be noted that both Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021 totals undercount the number of new community members served, as remote work conducted by the Co-Response Teams from March through September 2020 could not be reported due to data collection limitations. 'Supportive connections provided by NYC Well, a behavioral health helpline (with DOHMH);' 'Individuals who received services from long-term mobile community-based treatment providers (with DOHMH);' 'New individuals engaged by a Co-Response Team (with DOHMH and NYPD)' are now reported in the DOHMH agency chapter.

Through this plan, the City has pursued an ambitious neighborhood and housing development strategy with the goal to finance more than 300,000 affordable units through 2026 and build a fairer and more livable city for all New Yorkers. After a delay in funding for HNY due to the pandemic, capital was fully restored in October 2020, and the Agencies doubled down on the Administration's focus on serving the most vulnerable New Yorkers, including the lowest-income families, seniors, and those experiencing homelessness, bringing jobs and new infrastructure to neighborhoods that have been hit especially hard by the pandemic, and improving the quality of existing housing stock. New HPD and HDC programs are achieving deeper levels of affordability. More than 46 percent of all HNY homes financed since 2014 extremely low- and very low-income households, in addition to a record-breaking number of affordable homes for seniors and formerly homeless households, more than double the initial goal of 20 percent. Over the past fiscal year, the City secured the financing for a record 11,322 newly constructed affordable homes, 64 percent of which will serve these New Yorkers. More than 84 percent of HNY production served either low-income, very low-income or extremely low-income families and adults. In addition, the City has financed 12,657 homes for seniors and 15,757 formerly homeless households under the housing plan. Housing New York is a critical pillar of Your Home NYC, the Mayor's comprehensive approach to helping New Yorkers get, afford, and keep housing, especially in this moment of crisis. The City has helped keep vulnerable New Yorkers affected by COVID-19 in their homes by working with initiatives like Project Parachute, which provides anti-eviction services, including rental assistance counseling for all New York City tenants; the NYS Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP), which provides assistance with rent and utilities. The Tenant Helpline and Tenant Resource Portal, helps connect residents with free assistance with landlord/tenant issues and the Landlord Tenant Mediation Project helps mediate rent-related issues outside of Housing Court, focuses on the hardest hit communities. In the wake of COVID-19, the City ramped up efforts to house vulnerable families, including working with development partners to dedicate a larger share of apartments to homeless families, in addition to streamlining the homeless placement process to move families in as quickly and efficiently as possible. The City has also committed to supporting Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE) and non-profit firms through initiatives like a new equitable ownership requirement, which strengthens the role of M/WBE and non-profit developers on affordable housing projects developed on City-owned land; a competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) for M/ WBE developers to transform two City-owned sites in Prospect Heights: Pathways to Opportunity, which seeks to build the capacity of M/WBE and non-profit marketing agents; the Building Capacity Course, which is designed for M/WBE and nonprofit developers seeking opportunities and exposure to best practices in affordable housing development; The commitment by the New York City Acquisition Fund to now exclusively serve M/WBE and non-profit developers. Mayor's Office of Capital Project Development Mayor's Office of Workforce Development New York City Housing Development | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT The commitment by the New York City Acquisition Fund to now exclusively serve M/WBE and non-profit developers. Over the last fiscal year, HPD closed on 10 new construction projects with M/WBE developers out of 34 financed new construction projects. HNY's success depends on the collaboration and commitment of more than a dozen City agencies and offices, including HPD, HDC, the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), the Department of City Planning (DCP), the New York City Economic Development Corporation (EDC), the Department of Buildings (DOB), Human Resources Administration (HRA), the Department of Small Business Services (SBS), the Mayor's Office of Workforce Development and the Mayor's Office of Capital Project Development. HNY is segmented into the following broad strategies and priority initiatives. Unless otherwise stated, the accomplishments below occurred between July 2020 and June 2021. FOSTERING DIVERSE, LIVABLE NEIGHBORHOODS HNY recognizes that thriving neighborhoods require affordable housing as well as investments in other community assets such as open space, parks, schools, healthcare facilities, grocery stores, workforce development, and other resources and services that are identified by local residents through close consultation with communities. Together, DCP , HPD, HDC, SBS, NYCEDC and NYCHA work to provide housing and economic opportunities while enhancing the livability of neighborhoods. Accomplishments include: In October 2020, HPD and NYCHA in partnership with more the 30 City agencies released Where We Live NYC, the City's comprehensive fair housing plan-- a five-year roadmap to break down barriers to opportunity and build more integrated, equitable neighborhoods. The final version of the plan incorporates feedback from residents and community leaders to the Draft Plan, released in January 2020, as well as updates to reflect the disproportionate impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on low-income communities of color. The final plan includes enhanced metrics, strategies and policy proposals to address a legacy of housing segregation and build a more inclusive city. In November 2020, HPD introduced a new equitable ownership requirement to strengthen the role of M/WBE and non-profit developers on affordable housing projects developed on City-owned land. The new requirement mandates that an M/WBE or non-profit partner holds a minimum of 25 percent ownership stake in any affordable housing project awarded on public land through an RFP . The new requirement aligns with the vision of the Where We live NYC Plan, by reducing industry barriers for M/WBEs and non-profits, expanding and diversifying the city's construction industry, and allowing affordable housing spending to serve a greater diversity of New Yorkers. In November 2020, HPD released the Bedford-Stuyvesant Housing Plan to advance a health-centered vision for new affordable housing and protect local homeowners and tenants against displacement. The Plan builds on the pioneering neighborhood preservation success of local organizers in the 1960s, and helps to ensure City programs, public services, and community resources are coordinated and aligned with the neighborhood's unique challenges. As part of the plan, HPD issued the new Bedford-Stuyvesant Community Wealth and Wellness RFP for two projects that will create approximately 280 affordable homes and pair new affordable housing with community health and wellness facilities. The RFP was also the first to introduce the new equitable ownership requirement described above. In December 2020, HPD released an RFP seeking qualified development teams to submit plans to build 100 percent affordable housing in Stapleton on the North Shore of Staten Island. The City-owned site provides approximately 108,000 square feet of land for much-needed affordable housing, community amenities and services, and other improvements for the community through high-quality, mixed-use development. The RFP aims to further the goals of the Bay Street Corridor Neighborhood Plan and the Where We Live NYC Plan, and was informed by resident input gathered through a series of online Community Visioning Workshops held in September 2020. Two neighborhood plans, if approved, would significantly advance the City's goals around fair housing and equitable growth. The Gowanus Neighborhood Plan, a shared, long-term vision for a thriving, inclusive, resilient, and more sustainable neighborhood anchored by affordable housing entered the city's formal public review process on April 19, 2021. On May 17, 2021, the City Planning Commission certified the SoHo/NoHo Neighborhood Plan, which would replace outdated zoning regulations that preclude residences, including affordable housing, and severely restrict ground floor uses. COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: Housing New York | Page 71 In January 2021, along with Enterprise Community Partners, LISC, and a coalition of public, private, and philanthropic partners, the City announced that the New York City Acquisition Fund will exclusively serve M/WBE and non-profit developers in its mission to support affordable and supportive housing development. Established in 2006, the Fund offers flexible bridge loans to affordable housing developers to acquire vacant sites and occupied buildings and finance predevelopment work. In February 2021, HPD, Goldman Sachs, Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), and Enterprise announced new funding and training to build the capacity of marketing agents through the Pathways to Opportunity initiative, furthering the City's commitment to create fair and equitable access to affordable housing. The initiative seeks to offer training to 40 different M/WBE and non-profit firms to equip them to submit competitive applications to HPD's Qualified Marketing Agent RFQ, released in September 2020. In June 2021, HPD worked closely with both the City Council and the Public Advocate's office on final legislation that will advance the goals of the City's fair housing plan, Where We Live NYC, by providing a data tool that promises to improve transparency and promote equitable development for projects making their way through the land-use process. PRESERVING THE AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY OF THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK The City works to create new affordable homes while also preserving the affordability of existing housing so that tenants and homeowners can stay in their homes into the future. It has also launched a suite of initiatives focused on protecting tenants and keeping them in their homes. Accomplishments include: In July 2020, HPD announced the Landlord-Tenant Mediation Project, an initiative to help tenants and landlords address rent-related issues due to the COVID-19 pandemic in a mediation setting outside of housing court. The Project is managed by locally based Community Dispute Resolution Centers (CDRCs) in coordination HPD, the Mayor's Office to Protect Tenants (MOPT), and the Mayor's Public Engagement Unit (PEU), with support from the Human Resource Administration's Office of Civil Justice (OCJ). So far, more than 90% of the project's mediations have produced agreements. In August 2020, HPD and City agencies collaborated with MOPT to launch the NYC Tenant Resource Portal, an online resource to help residential renters access resources to help prevent evictions and keep tenants in stable housing. In December 2020, HPD and HDC released a Request for Expressions of Interest (RFEI) aimed at providing renters more choices for paying their security deposits. Traditional lump-sum security deposits can present a barrier for low- and middle-income households and prevent tenants from relocating to new housing when they need it. The Security Deposit Alternatives RFEI is the first step in identifying eligible companies that can offer alternatives to traditional, lump-sum deposits for affordable housing applicants of newly constructed homes. In March 2021, HPD, partners, and elected officials secured financing to convert four City-owned buildings in East and Central Harlem into affordable housing. Delivering on Mayor Bill de Blasio's commitment to explore new housing models, the East Harlem El Barrio CLT is the first to receive public land, capital financing, and startup support from the City in decades. Under the model, a board of tenants, community members and nonprofit leaders will oversee the building management and operate the development as an affordable rental mutual housing association project. The CLT will be committed to long-term affordable homes and community participation. In March 2021, HPD, EDC, and the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) issued a Shared Equity Request for Information (RFI), seeking models that enable low- to moderate-income households and households of color to build wealth through collective ownership of neighborhood assets, while keeping these assets affordable for their communities in the long-term.Page 72 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT In May 2021, HPD announced the expansion of the Homeowner Help Desk, a joint initiative with the Center for NYC Neighborhoods (the Center), the New York State Attorney General (OAG), Enterprise Community Partners (Enterprise), and community housing groups to support homeowners at risk of displacement. As part of the expanded initiative, new funding will allow seven community housing organizations to partner with HPD, the Center, and the OAG to provide struggling homeowners in key neighborhoods in Central Brooklyn, Southeast Queens, and the North Bronx affected by COVID-19 with critical one-on-one housing counseling, financial assistance and legal services and to proactively raise awareness about deed theft and scams. In May 2021, HPD and the Center announced the first rehab project completed through the HomeFix program, which provides affordable financing for essential home repairs in small family-owned properties across the city to promote safe, quality, and affordable housing. In partnership with the Center's extensive network of non-profit partners, the program also provides eligible homeowners with technical assistance, education, and financial counseling. BUILDING NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR ALL NEW YORKERS New York City's residents come from all corners of the globe and all walks of life. The City seeks to preserve the diversity of its neighborhoods through financing affordable housing for all income levels that will produce affordable housing on vacant and underdeveloped parcels of public land in all five boroughs. Accomplishments include: In July 2020, HPD completed the launch of the new and improved Housing Connect website. Significant upgrades to the new portal make it quicker and easier for New Yorkers to apply for new affordable housing projects. All affordable housing opportunities now appear on this site, providing New Yorkers with a streamlined option to search for opportunities that suit their household size, income, and needs. The website includes more types of housing than ever, such as re-rentals and homeownership. In August 2020, HPD and HDC announced the financing of three new affordable housing developments that will spur the construction of 400 deeply affordable homes in Brooklyn and the Bronx and create thousands of jobs. The developments include 1921 Atlantic Avenue and 461 Alabama Avenue, two projects selected through the first M/ WBE RFP , and Victory Commons. All three deals will be led by M/ WBE development teams and were made without deploying direct City capital, helping the City to continue delivering on its commitments to create more affordable housing despite budget limitations due to COVID-19. In October 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio restored capital funding within the City's affordable housing plan, a major step toward ensuring a fair recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. The City shifted $466 million to the current fiscal year's capital budget during the upcoming Preliminary Plan to address urgent affordable housing needs, bringing the capital investment this fiscal year to over $1.4 billion. The Housing New York goal of creating and preserving 300,000 affordable homes by 2026 remains on track. In October 2020, NYCHA and HPD announced the development of a 100 percent affordable homeownership housing development at NYCHA's Soundview campus. The closing marks the most recent phase of real estate projects the Authority has helped facilitate in Soundview, starting with a 120-unit multifamily development and 86-unit senior building in the area that were completed in 2016. In December 2020, HPD announced the financing for Rockaway Village 3, the third phase of a multi-phase mixed-use development located in Downtown Far Rockaway, Queens that is replacing a derelict shopping mall with affordable housing along with commercial space, public plazas, a new library and other infrastructure improvements. This third phase includes an additional 354 affordable homes, nearly half of which will serve very low-income families; the remaining units will serve low-income families. In March 2021, HPD released revised Design Guidelines for City affordable housing to ensure newly constructed buildings promote equity, health, and sustainability. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, HPD worked with the City's Taskforce on Racial Inclusion and Equity and the wider affordable housing community to issue stronger requirements and recommendations to improve standards of living for more New Yorkers, promote broader public health, and COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: Housing New York | Page 73 reduce the city's carbon footprint. Key additions include facilitating broadband access for tenants, improving cooling and ventilation, increasing energy efficiency, and building out a supplementary guide that serves as a framework for accessibility requirements. In April 2021, HPD released a competitive RFP for M/WBE developers to transform two City-owned sites in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn into affordable housing. The two completely affordable projects will create approximately 180 new affordable homes, mainly serving low-income families, and with one site dedicated to homes for seniors as part of the City's Seniors First initiative. The RFP is the second issued exclusively for M/WBE developers through HPD's Building Opportunity Initiative. In May 2021, Mayor Bill de Blasio joined HPD and numerous City agencies, elected officials, and hip hop luminaries to celebrate the groundbreaking for Bronx Point, a mixed-use project along the Harlem River waterfront in the South Bronx. Bronx Point's first phase will deliver 542 units of permanently affordable housing, along with approximately 2.8 acres of public open space. Additionally, the project will deliver an array of cultural and community-focused programming, including the permanent home of the Universal Hip Hop Museum, an early childhood space run by BronxWorks, and outdoor science programming run by the Billion Oyster Project. In June 2021, HPD joined elected officials and community partners to celebrate the near completion of buildings A and B of the five-building La Central development. In addition to nearly 500 units of new housing, the buildings feature a state-of-the-art YMCA, a production studio for BronxNet and a fully programmed rooftop farm operated by GrowNYC as well as dynamic retail tenants. Once complete, La Central will consist of more than 1,000 affordable homes, including a 160-unit supportive housing and low-income building completed in 2019. INCOME BAND DEFINITIONS Affordability AMI %Income Range 3-Person HouseholdMonthly Rent Required To Prevent Rent Burden Extremely Low <$32,220 <$806 Very $3,223 - $4,430 PROMOTING HOMELESS, SENIOR, SUPPORTIVE AND ACCESSIBLE HOUSING The City provides supportive, accessible housing to the homeless and other vulnerable New Yorkers with special needs. Accomplishments include: In August 2020, HPD awarded funding to nine community-based organizations as a part of an accessibility expansion of the Housing Ambassador Program. The awardees will be able to expand services accessible to people with disabilities and/or limited English proficiency who are applying for affordable housing, including technology upgrades, wheelchair accessible space, language interpretation, and assistive technology for those deaf or hard of hearing. The expansion is made possible with support from Citi. In October 2020, HPD and New York State officials joined Arker Companies to celebrate the completion of the initial phase of The Fountains in Brooklyn, a 6.7-acre mixed-use development complex that will ultimately offer 1,163 affordable homes. The City provided financing for 911 Erskine Street, which offers 267 affordable apartments for families and adults with intellectual and development disabilities. The Fountains is close to public transportation, green space, grocery stores, schools, and retail. The Block Institute will provide supportive services to help residents live independently. Page 74 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT In October 2020, HPD joined New York State officials, this time to celebrate the start of construction on 245 units of affordable and supportive housing in the South Bronx. 1159 River Avenue will offer 148 apartments specifically for individuals and families who have previously experienced homelessness and those recovering from mental illness. The 19-story building will include 20,500 square feet of commercial space on the ground floor, as well as art, exercise, laundry, and computer rooms. Community Access, Inc. will provide supportive services. In October 2020, HPD and HDC joined Breaking Ground in celebrating the start of the transformation of 90 Sands. Once a Jehovah's Witness Hotel, 90 Sands is now on its way to becoming 491 units of affordable and supportive housing in the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn. 305 units will be set aside for formerly homeless New Yorkers, who will have access to onsite supportive services provided by the Center for Urban Community Services. More than 28,000 square feet of the building will also be set aside for community-serving purposes such as community facilities and commercial space. In December 2020, HPD announced the award of $13.6 million in housing credits to seven developments for the creation and preservation of 583 affordable homes across the city. The awards benefiting six new construction and one preservation project will finance two supportive housing developments, two senior developments, and 189 homes for formerly homeless tenants. In January 2021, HPD announced the selection of the development team to transform a City-owned site in Astoria, Queens into 100% affordable senior housing. The mixed-use development at 31-07 31st Street will feature 135 affordable homes for seniors, a community center, and commercial space. HANAC and Mega Development LLC were selected as the winning proposal from the Broadway and 31st Street Astoria Seniors RFP that HPD issued in late 2019 as part of the Seniors First Initiative. In March 2021, HPD and HDC joined Monadnock Development, Signature Urban Properties, and Wells Fargo to celebrate the groundbreaking of Compass Six, the final phase of a large-scale affordable housing development serving West Farms, one of the neighborhoods in the Bronx hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The full Compass Residences Development will bring 1,400 affordable homes to the neighborhood, serving low- to moderate-income households and households experiencing homelessness. Nearly 300 homes are set aside for formerly homeless families. In May 2021, HPD and development partners celebrated the groundbreaking for the Broome Street developments at 64 Norfolk and 55 Suffolk. 64 Norfolk is a senior housing project that will provide 114 permanently affordable homes for seniors on the Lower East Side and develop a new congregation and cultural heritage space for the Beth Hamedrash Hagodol Synagogue (BHH). 55 Suffolk is private development that will provide 94 permanently affordable homes through the MIH program out of total of 378 total new homes. The building will also provide a new headquarters for the Chinese American Planning Council. In June 2021, HPD and the Department of Social Services (DSS) closed on the third deal to convert cluster apartments to permanent affordable housing. Through the conversion, the City created affordable housing for more than 550 families experiencing homelessness and preserved more than 200 additional units of affordable housing in the process. The prior two conversions created permanent affordable housing for almost 700 families and almost 300 additional units of affordable housing.

In partnership with the Mayor's Office, City agencies are implementing 273 initiatives to advance this mission. Progress on each of these initiatives is updated in the annual Vision Zero Report . The City's investment in Vision Zero, funded with a total of $4.5 billion through Fiscal 2025, has ensured resources will be available to continue an accelerated pace of redesign and reconstruction of City streets as well as for enforcement and education initiatives to deter unsafe driving and promote safe walking and biking. Progress happened with the full force of City government\u2014agencies collaborating since the inception of Vision Zero to chart a path towards safer streets for all, share best practices and implement proven strategies, as well as test new ones. The Vision Zero Task Force convenes regularly and includes representatives from the New York City Police Department (NYPD), the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS), the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), the Law Department, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the District Attorneys' offices, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the Business Integrity Commission (BIC) and the Sheriff's Office. This cross-agency collaboration has contributed to the successful implementation of key Vision Zero initiatives. The expansion of the speed camera program, the enactment of the 25 miles per hour default speed limit, targeted and data-driven enforcement of violations such as speeding and failure-to-yield to pedestrians, extensive public outreach and the legislative agenda to deter dangerous driving behaviors have all resulted from this close coordination. In Fiscal 2021 the City announced that speed limits would be lowered on 45 miles of major streets with some the highest rates of crashes across Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island. Additionally, the City created 83 miles of Open Streets in Calendar 2020 and legislation was signed in May 2021 to make the program permanent. In Fiscal 2021, overall citywide traffic fatalities rose 30.3 percent, from 211 to 275. Fatalities among all modes increased, with the largest jump among passengers (88.2 percent) and the smallest among bicyclists (13.6 percent). The lockdown and less pedestrian activity in Fiscal 2020, coupled with less traffic and increased speeding in Fiscal 2021 led to a higher-than- usual annual change.Mayor's OfficeDCAS DOHMH FY21 Total Fatalities 211 209 218 211 275 30.3% Pedestrians 132 107 120 107 123 15.0% Bicyclists 16 21 17 22 25 13.6% Motorcyclists 20 35 34 31 52 67.7% Motor vehicle operators/other motorized21 30 30 34 43 26.5% Passengers 22 16 17 17 32 88.2% Source: NYPDPage 80 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT STREET DESIGN DOT continued to make streets safer by implementing designs that simplify complex intersections, discourage speeding, slow down turns, provide bicycle lanes, make pedestrians and cyclists more visible and shorten pedestrian crossing distances at Vision Zero priority locations. In Fiscal 2021 DOT completed 69 street improvement projects at high crash locations, constructed 104 speed humps, activated 256 leading pedestrian intervals, installed accessible pedestrian signals at 211 intersections, installed 65.3 bike lane miles, which includes 29.2 miles of protected bike lanes and implemented safety signal retiming on two priority corridors. In Fiscal 2021 DOT advanced work on all Vision Zero Great Streets projects: Queens Boulevard: in June 2021, the City began construction on the Phase 4 operational project (Yellowstone Boulevard to Union Turnpike) after receiving the necessary final approvals from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). The Department of Design and Construction and its consultant restarted design work on Phases A and B of the capital project (Roosevelt Avenue to Eliot Avenue), with Phase B moving into the final design stage. In Calendar 2020, DOT completed the conceptual design and traffic study work on Phases C and D (Eliot Avenue to Union Turnpike). Grand Concourse: the City completed construction on Phase 3 of the capital project (East 171st to East 175th Streets) with a ribbon cutting on August 11, 2020. Construction continues on Phase 4 (East 175th Street to East Fordham Road) and design continues on Phase 5 (East Fordham Road to East 198th Street). The City recently funded the new Phase 6, which includes reconstruction from 138th to 161st Streets. DOT began its detailed scoping process for this most southerly phase of the corridor; the conditions of the Concourse within these limits differ from the earlier project phases. The design process will focus on accommodating these new conditions while aiming to achieve significant improvements beyond the earlier phases. Atlantic Avenue: construction of Phase 1 (Georgia Avenue to Logan Street) is substantially complete, with only one punch list item remaining. DDC transferred a portion of work to another contract, which began preliminary construction in Spring 2021. The City issued a Notice to Proceed on Phase 2 (Logan Street to Rockaway Boulevard) in June 2021. DOT presented the Percent for Art proposal to the Public Design Commission and received preliminary approval in May 2021. The Percent for Art law requires that eligible City-funded construction projects spend part of their budget on public art. 4th Avenue: the City completed its operational work between Flatbush Avenue and 64th Street in December 2020. The median improvement capital project (between 8th and 64th Streets), led by DOT and DDC, will begin construction in early Fiscal 2022. Further capital work (between Atlantic Avenue and 64th Street) is currently in the design procurement phase. Northern Boulevard: DOT's ongoing operational work continued on this corridor, which is now designated as an additional Vision Zero Great Street. DOT completed additional concrete pedestrian refuge islands during the Summer 2020 construction season, with interim geometric improvements planned for the 2021 season. DOT began scoping for the capital project and will continue in Fiscal 2022. ENFORCEMENT Data-driven law enforcement that deters dangerous driving behavior helps to reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries. Consequently, NYPD continued to focus on enforcement of especially hazardous driving violations, including speeding, failure to yield to pedestrians, signal violations, improper turns and use of hand-held devices while driving. Each week at Traffic Safety Forum, NYPD's Chief of Transportation meets with NYPD executives to outline, review and manage NYPD's traffic program. In Fiscal 2021, NYPD issued 105,352 speeding summonses and 26,766 failure to yield to pedestrian summonses, decreases of 27.6 percent and 63.2 percent, respectively, from Fiscal 2020. NYPD also issued 1,979 violations of NYC Administrative Code 19-190\u2014the \"right of way law\"\u2014to drivers who struck a pedestrian COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: Vision Zero | Page 81 or cyclist who had the legal right of way and made 13 arrests for these violations. NYPD has a total of 2,226 officers trained in LIDAR devices that measure speed and 661 LIDAR guns in service. In response to the pandemic, TLC Enforcement redeployed its officers to support the City's emergency work during the first four months of Fiscal 2021. The focus for TLC Enforcement was PPE distribution to drivers, coordination of food delivery services with NYCEM and work with the New York City Sheriff, including distribution of COVID-19 educational materials to the public. As TLC has now resumed standard enforcement, officers are once again issuing Vision Zero safety-related summonses to licensees. OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT The Vision Zero Street Teams integrate education and enforcement to discourage unsafe behavior on City streets. Teams of DOT and NYPD staff work together to identify corridors with significant crash history, along with the causes of those crashes. Staff then spend a week distributing fliers to pedestrians and drivers with safety tips about the most common causes of crashes in those corridors, followed by NYPD enforcement in the same area. In Fiscal 2021 Street Teams concentrated efforts on nine high-priority corridors. Vision Zero also delivers safe-driving messaging and training to specific populations of drivers, such as for-hire vehicle drivers, City employee drivers and MTA bus operators. At the City level, DCAS has reinforced the safety message to City employees with 6,671 City drivers trained in defensive driving during the reporting period, bringing the total number of employees who have completed the day-long safety training to over 70,000 since the beginning of Vision Zero. Almost 90 percent of all non-emergency service drivers of City vehicles have gone through defensive driving training at least once. NYPD and FDNY provide driver training to all uniformed staff as part of orientation. Defensive driving training was significantly impacted by COVID-19: training shut down in March 2020, but resumed in August 2020 via a new online class. In Fiscal 2021 DCAS continued to pilot virtual reality (VR) training to augment in-class sessions beginning with DPR. DCAS also worked with DOT, BIC, TLC and MTA to share best practices and coordinate training themes for fleet operators. Additionally, DCAS worked with the New York City Department of Education (DOE) to train DOE employees to teach defensive driving and develop the Vision Zero training curriculum for school bus operators. In October 2020, TLC approved the resumption of in-person driver training and testing via TLC-authorized education providers after pandemic-related closure by State order in March 2020. These nine schools and 12 test centers reopened in compliance with State, City and TLC COVID-19 safety guidelines, including setting 50 percent class capacity, spacing of seating, posting of public health signage, PPE provision and enhanced cleaning protocols. The pre-licensure driver training offered by these education providers includes a specialized Vision Zero curriculum developed for for-hire drivers that highlights important street safety information, such as road designs like bike lanes, high-risk driving behavior that can lead to crashes and the crucial role that professional drivers play in promoting a culture of safe driving. With the safe reopening of these training facilities, new applicants can pursue their TLC Driver License and receive crucial safe driving information. The \"Dusk and Darkness\" campaign returned for a fifth year in Fiscal 2021. Based on a 2016 DOT and NYPD analysis of crash trends, it was found that the earlier onset of darkness in the fall and winter is correlated with a 40 percent increase in severe injury and fatal crashes involving pedestrians in the early evening hours compared to crashes during those same hours outside the fall and winter. In addition, there were twice as many fatal and severe injury crashes involving driver turns during these hours. In response, the Vision Zero Task Force developed this multiagency seasonal enforcement and education approach. NYPD focused additional enforcement resources on the most hazardous violations, including speeding and failure to yield to pedestrians, with precincts increasing their on-street presence around sunset hours. FLEETS In Fiscal 2021 DCAS continued installations of 63,000 vehicle safety devices in City vehicles, including vehicle telematics, truck sideguards, backup cameras, automatic braking, pedestrian avoidance systems, driver alerts and automatic headlights that were acquired at the end of Fiscal 2020 through new vehicle purchases and retrofits. DCAS has installed Page 82 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT telematics in more than 12,000 City vehicles and over 10,000 school buses. These investments are designed to reduce collisions, improve training and driver awareness and lessen the impact of crashes that do happen. Through June 2021, the number of City vehicles with truck sideguards exceeded 3,750. New units with sideguards were delivered and retrofits were completed on a daily basis with over 880 trucks either retrofitted or replaced with sideguards in Calendar 2020. The City's rollout of sideguards is the biggest implementation in North America and DCAS continues to work with other public and private fleets to advocate for these lifesaving safety devices. Progress continued on the Connected Vehicle Pilot as hundreds of vehicles from DOT, TLC and other agencies were equipped with connected vehicle technology during the reporting period. This program is outlined in the Safe Fleet Transition Plan Update, prepared by DCAS in partnership with the U.S. Department of Transportation Volpe Center (Volpe). DCAS and road safety partner Together for Safer Roads (TSR) also collaborated on the development of the Global Safety Leadership Council and launched a pilot program for small and medium-sized private fleets in Fiscal 2021. DCAS and TSR also are collaborating on a \"Truck of the Future\" pilot with other private fleets to test various technologies to improve driver and road safety as well as partnering globally on training programs and panels. DCAS and Volpe will continue their collaboration by launching a series of projects and reports over the next five years. These will focus on safety in technology, vehicle design, private trucking fleets and school bus contractors. Volpe will also support the City's efforts to have the safest fleet in the nation by reviewing vehicle specifications and providing research and advice on the implementation of high vision truck cabs, pedestrian and bicyclist avoidance systems, automatic braking for larger vehicles and intelligent speed assistance. NYC Fleet is making progress towards its safest-in-the nation goal by requiring high-vision truck cabs, where available. One of the biggest safety risks on our roads is line-of-sight restrictions for truck operators. High-vision truck cabs help to solve this problem, but are not yet available on all models and vehicle types. However, truck surround cameras and back up sensors can be installed on any vehicle and during the reporting period over 870 such installations were completed. This represents 58 percent of the total phase one implementation, with installations continuing in Fiscal 2022. TLC actively engaged licensees on safe driving techniques, street changes and partnered with Vision Zero sister agencies to promote the Dusk and Darkness campaign to its licensees. In coordination with DOT, TLC also educated taxi and for-hire drivers on pandemic-related changes to the City's streets, including Open Streets and outdoor dining, to ensure the influx of pedestrians, cyclists and diners sharing the roadway remained safe. TLC also informed licensees about new busway pilot projects, including the Main Street Busway in Queens and the Jay Street Busway in Brooklyn, to ensure that they were aware of changes in traffic patterns and any restrictions for through-traffic. In Fall 2020, TLC relaunched an updated and improved distracted driving retraining course required for all drivers convicted of using an electronic device while driving for-hire. The course's new curriculum standards include an overview of the dangers of distracted driving, how to prevent this unsafe behavior and a review of safety enforcement and point- based penalty programs. Five education providers were approved to offer the course through an application, interview and teaching demonstration process established by TLC to ensure curriculum and teaching quality. DATA-DRIVEN SOLUTIONS While the burden of traffic injury and death in the City is well established, many questions still remain related to how and why crashes happen and the effects of prevention efforts. Vision Zero agencies continue working to improve what they know about the circumstances of roadway crashes and learning from the data they collect to inform decision making. In Fiscal 2021 the Vision Zero Data Working Group made progress on prioritizing research agenda questions and collaborating with academic partners such as University of Chicago and Columbia University. This work included advancing the Speed and Red-Light Camera & Driver Behavior Study, which aims to determine the impacts of speed and red-light cameras on driving behavior over time and to characterize repeat offenders across violations and involvement in traffic crashes. DOHMH, working with other City agencies, coordinated a fourth convening (and first virtual convening) of Research on the Road, a traffic safety research symposium. About 100 people attended the event, through which Vision Zero continues to promote action related to addressing Vision Zero research priorities. COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: Vision Zero | Page 83 In November 2020, DOHMH published a cycling data story on the Environment & Health Data Portal, which highlights cycling as a healthy and safe way to get around the city. Putting together injury data and bicycling infrastructure data, a \"safety in numbers\" story emerges: the more extensive the infrastructure and the more people riding bicycles, the safer streets are as an environment for physical activity.

MAP models an effort to build safety proactively by acknowledging the expertise of community residents in defining their own priorities of safety and well-being and positioning government to be responsive, just, and accountable to those priorities. Since 2014, the initiative has worked in partnership with neighborhood residents, city agencies and community based partners in 15 housing developments that have faced historic disinvestment and, as a result, persistent crime. Rather than rely on the traditional model of attempting to maintain safety solely by responding to crime, MAP addresses the factors underlying safety and well-being\u2014enhancing opportunities for work and play, health and well-being and youth development; promoting well-designed spaces that are active and well maintained; and improving trust between neighbors and with a responsive and just government. Through MAP's fundamental organizing process, NeighborhoodStat (NStat), partner agencies and residents come together for joint issue identification and the piloting of solutions that enable system-wide change. NeighborhoodStat is intentionally designed to span from hyper- local development-based convenings to citywide policy making discussions. The foundation of the NStat process is the Stakeholder Team in each of the 15 MAP developments, which consists of at least 15 residents of varying ages per site. This group of highly committed residents develop priority areas by engaging their broader community and auditing the physical and social infrastructure of their development. Stakeholder Teams meet weekly, with increased frequency at times such as the COVID-19 emergency, and have led the identification and deployment of a diverse array of social services, physical space interventions and infrastructure improvements. Resident stakeholder teams also meet at least monthly with MAP partner agencies who are dedicated to supporting MAP communities with a wide range of resources such as health services, public benefits support, physical space improvements, youth programming and employment, and much more. Importantly, the NStat process builds in mechanisms to engage whole communities of each MAP development, ensuring that all members of the 15 NYCHA MAP developments are included in proposal and pursuit of local solutions for safety and wellbeing with dedicated funding attached. Local NeighborhoodStat is MAP's annual convening, held in partnership with the Center for Court Innovation, to invite all residents to help determine priorities and physical and programmatic interventions that are responsive to the community context. From 2019-2020, NStat teams engaged 15 percent of their neighbors with over 9,200 votes cast for the selection of Local NStat community safety projects. Due to the severe and disproportionate impact of COVID-19 in MAP communities, NStat teams shifted their focus and energy to providing essential emergency relief in their communities. However, in 2021, teams resumed their work in implementing the projects that each MAP development selected through their Local NStat event. A new series of Local NStat events will take place from July through October of 2021. Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice Mayor's Office to End Domestic and Gender Based Violence Mayor's Office of Operations DFTA DOP DPR Page MANAGEMENT REPORTBecause of the need for system-level solutions and policy change to address the persistent safety concerns across MAP communities, NeighborhoodStat also includes a platform for central decision making and problem-solving. Central NeighborhoodStat identifies thematic issues across MAP communities, prioritized by residents, and brings them to the table shared by residents, community based organizations, and City agency leadership, all of whom are responsible for policy change. The Central NStat process facilitates dialogue between community members who have the deepest knowledge and expertise about local conditions and City policy-makers who are in a position to make system-wide change in response to the residents' priorities. Central NStat may lead to the expansion or redeployment of existing resources, new policies, programs and commitments, and increased accountability by relevant agencies. Additionally, although Central NStat focuses on the issues shared across MAP communities in particular, the solutions that arise from Central NStat serve as a model for neighborhoods across New York City. The pandemic's impact during last fiscal year has exacerbated existing racial disparities and created historic challenges for both the City and for MAP , in particular, as many of the NYC communities that were hardest hit by COVID-19 have also been disproportionately impacted by gun violence. Between July 2020 and June 2021, MAP experienced an eight percent increase in index crimes and a 79 percent increase in shooting incidents compared to the previous year. This is in line with similar rates reported NYCHA-wide, which had a 10 percent rise in index crimes and a 74 percent increase in shooting incidents over the same period. Citywide shooting incidents also rose by 84 percent year-over-year, despite index crime complaints remaining stable overall. Although gun violence remains a challenge that MAP is committed to addressing, it is also worth observing that overall index crimes are down 4 percent in the last fiscal year compared to Fiscal 2014 - with a particularly noteworthy 36% decline in felony robbery complaints during this period. Additionally, early indications of a decline in crime rates since the beginning of the upcoming fiscal year are promising. Shooting incidents within MAP developments during the first 12 weeks of Fiscal 2022 are 50 percent lower compared to the same period in Fiscal 2021, while index crime complaints are 18 percent lower. In response to the dual public health crises of COVID-19 and surging gun violence, MAP taps into the relationships it has been cultivating over the past seven years to respond to resident needs. On top of continuing to invest in networks of community leadership and adapting much of its programming to a virtual format, MAP has also been hosting community healing fairs in the wake of recent gun violence to connect residents to needed social services, Cure Violence organizations, and COVID-19 testing and vaccinations. Through MAP , MOCJ has also made significant investments to help create a safer environment through physical infrastructure improvements including exterior lighting and closed-circuit TV cameras at the 15 developments. The following section describes MAP's investment in community-centered design in greater detail. DESIGN Promoting activated, well-maintained spaces through design increases pride and a sense of safety by reducing exposure to hazards such as crime and violence, while creating places where the community can come together. TURNING RESIDENT IDEAS INTO ACTION PLANS Over the past three years, MAP stakeholder teams received training that builds capacity in community organizing, human-centered design, placemaking, city processes, and maintenance. The teams use these skills to design action plans, develop priority areas, execute community projects, and work with city agencies to leverage resources to address public safety challenges. In Fiscal 2021, MAP stakeholders continued to complete project ideas from previous years, including murals in Boulevard, Butler and Ingersoll Houses to revitalize underutilized areas, new wayfinding signage in Stapleton Houses, and youth- focused social programs at Bushwick and St. Nicholas Houses. Some of the other teams continue to move forward highly ambitious and transformative built environment projects that have required a lot of coordination with agencies and technical detail from our designers, ranging from new public plazas and play areas to novel lighting approaches and art installations. COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: Mayor's Action Plan For Neighborhood Safety | Page 87 In Fiscal 2021, all 15 NStat teams also designed their winning community safety projects from Local NeighborhoodStat 2019. Most of the social programs are taking place from the summer through fall of 2021, while the physical space improvements are using the busy summer months to engage more residents in design. Additionally, to expand knowledge and opportunity to more residents, MAP published three Mini-Guides based on our Safe Places, Active Spaces: A Community Playbook for Transforming Public Spaces in Your Neighborhood. The Mini-Guides are focused exclusively on the processes for NYCHA to help residents organize public events, create new gardens, and lead art projects. MAP continues to work with partners across a variety of agencies to raise the profile and improve policy around resident-driven design and planning, including through NYCHA's Connected Communities initiative, DOHMH's revised Active Design Guidelines, City Planning's revised Urban Design Guidelines, HPD's Where We Live Plan, and DOT's Open Streets program. TRUST Building trust between neighbors, elected officials and government agencies is vital to any effort to make change happen. NEIGHBORHOODSTAT SUMMIT, WORKING GROUPS, AND A COLLECTIVE ACTION AGENDA In January of 2021, more than 300 New Yorkers (residents, community based organization leadership, City representatives) joined MAP for its first-ever virtual Central NStat event, the 2021 NeighborhoodStat Summit: Reimagining Public Safety. During this Summit, resident leaders and policymakers came together to discuss how key community priorities in health and well-being, safety and justice, economic stability, physical space, and youth development can influence policy. These major priority areas were selected through years of input from MAP community residents. Then, from February through May 2021, smaller groups of residents and agency/organization representatives participated in a series of five virtual Working Group sessions organized by priority area in order to build a collective Action Agenda for now until 2022, plotting the path for making ideal solutions a reality. In total, almost 200 residents and partners met in working groups on health & wellbeing, safety & justice, economic stability, physical space, and youth development, which includes the Youth Leadership Council described below, to create a shared action agenda for public safety and well-being across MAP communities. Working Groups dedicated over 70 hours to collaboration and strategizing to ultimately identify the policy actions necessary for real change. Each Working Group focused on the most pressing and actionable issues impacting public safety. The resulting Action Agenda reflects residents' priorities and agency commitments to re-imagining public safety across all NYCHA communities. It is meant to be a living, working document that is continually re-visited, revised and updated by all stakeholders. Most importantly, it was informed by the brilliance and insights of many residents, community partners and government agencies, and evolved into its current shape with a great deal of hard work, time and patience. While the Action Agenda includes tangible recommendations, as well as short, medium, and long- term strategies focused on each priority area, it is framed by 16 clear goals, listed below, within the topics of physical space, economic stability, health and well-being, and safety and justice. The Youth Leadership Council, described in the following section, is currently crafting the youth development goals. Physical Space Goals: Reduce door breakage and improve the door repair process Develop rapid responses to unsafe conditions like construction and low lighting Clean common spaces led by active residents with better NYCHA infrastructure and service Create quality open and recreation facilities and programming for all residents Page 88 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORTEconomic Stability Goals: Increase residents' access, awareness and participation in education and employment opportunities, trainings and programs Connect education and job training to long-term/stable careers Connect residents launching their own businesses to resources to help them be successful Health and Well-being Goals: Take proactive measures to destigmatize mental health Increase access to and training around culturally competent \"mental wellness\" information and services Increase equitable access to supportive services, preparedness, testing and vaccination Increase access to fresh, nutritious, and affordable food for residents Support the creation, sustainability and access of local food distribution systems/networks to ensure day-to-day availability and during emergency relief Safety and Justice Goals: Reduce gun violence Increase awareness and accessibility about resources/ services available to re-entry for individuals and their families Increase the capacity of community based wraparound support services that respond to and address the specific needs of populations that may be vulnerable to the criminal justice system Courteous, professional and respectful interactions between law enforcement and community ANTI GUN VIOLENCE FAIRS / COMMUNITY HEALING DAYS In response to the violence that coincided with the COVID 19 Pandemic, and as a way to transform spaces for community healing, the Office of Neighborhood Safety (ONS) has activated historically unsafe or underused spaces in the most severely impacted neighborhoods. These events connect residents to vital resources and change the narrative from one of crime to one of community strength and connectivity. They are also critical for building relationships between neighbors and with the City and community based partners who can provide essential support, violence prevention resources, and more. OPPORTUNITY Enhancing opportunities for work, play, health, well-being, and youth development is essential to improving equity. ENHANCING YOUTH LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES: YOUTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL In Fiscal Year 2021, the Mayor's Action Plan for Neighborhood Safety and the Neighborhood Safety Initiative (a project of the Center for Court Innovation) launched the inaugural MAP-wide Youth Leadership Council (YLC). The YLC brings together 50 young NYCHA residents, between the ages of 16-21, to set and achieve social justice goals. Through a series of workshops over the course of nine months, these young leaders are supported as advocates for safety in their communities and throughout New York City. This initiative is dedicated to uplifting young voices to define community safety and well-being out of a deep respect and acknowledgement for the unique experience of youth and young adults in New York City. The YLC brings together young people from 17 different NYCHA developments to pursue creative ideas that address the root causes of violence in their communities.COLLABORATING TO DELIVER RESULTS: Mayor's Action Plan For Neighborhood Safety | Page 89 The 2021 Youth Leaders are working with artist and activist Sophia Dawson, to paint and capture stories of hope and inspiration along with photographer and videographer, Shaunese Crawford, who is guiding them through using digital media for their storytelling journey. Additionally, the Youth Leadership Council is working on their own Action Plan. To that end, the 2021 cohort is implementing a survey to hone in on the design of their project, and has decided to launch a mobile project that offers social programming based on the needs of each borough that will travel across all five boroughs. Finally, the YLC is designing their own Action Agenda to pair with the larger NStat Action Agenda of 2021 to ensure that the voice, experience, concerns, and creativity of youth and young adults is represented in the larger policy change agenda across MAP communities. BROWNSVILLE YOUTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL Since its inception, MAP has prioritized resident voice in decision making to improve community safety and well-being because of the immense value in their experience and expertise. In particular, young people from MAP communities are disproportionately impacted by crime, whether they are victimized by it directly or facing the consequences of stigma and trauma. After the Brownsville mass shooting in 2019, the Brownsville Youth Leadership Council was created to center young people in the community as leaders in creating safety and promoting healing of unaddressed trauma that has resulted from years of disinvestment, violence and other forms of oppression. Participants engage in community level service, peer-to-peer mentorship, mediation, and personal and community development. Through our trusted local partner, the Brownsville Community Justice Center, young people receive holistic support and intensive coaching. Brownsville YLC participants analyze their community and prioritize issues and places that challenge safety. Next, they craft and carry out solutions. In Spring 2021, The Brownsville Youth Leadership Council participated in 15 weeks of Creative Design and Healing Space workshops. Workshops included topics discussing the connection between individual and collective spaces for healing, identifying areas around Brownsville to address community healing, and also developing design tools and fabrication skills to co-create their own healing space. In conjunction with the Brownsville Keepers, the cohort connected with 10 different community pop-up events at each development in Brownsville. They also developed their own name for the cohort, \"Next Generation Gems,\" which is a representation of their group identity based on \"diamonds in the rough\" modeling unity, courage, and joy with branding material to market their work. Finally, the goal of their new healing space was to build on the original 2020 Healing Sanctuaries or headspaces, centered around the 3 senses of smell, sight, and sound. With the guidance of the Youth Design Center and A+A+A architecture firm, they conceptualized, constructed, and launched in June the \"Release & Restore\" room, a healing space for youth to release anger and restore collectively and individually. After assessing the community surveys collected from the all site activations, the Gems are developing a strategy for deploying their fleet of new mobile healing spaces while forming a healing guide for engaging community and easing tensions, particularly among youth, within the neighborhood. BUILDING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS In 2021, the Mayor's Action Plan for Neighborhood Safety engaged a Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprise, When Love Works Dynamically (WLWD), to provide technical assistance in relational health in six NYCHA developments in the South Bronx and Central Brooklyn. During the pilot program, the COVID-19 pandemic placed a significant strain on relationships of all kinds, and simultaneously made in-person engagement and capacity building difficult. MAP and When Love Works Dynamically partnered to build capacity in local communities to co-create safety and well-being through the identification and betterment of healthy and unhealthy relationships. When Love Works Dynamically provides support for intimate, familial, and professional relationships. In a few short months, the WLWD team connected with residents from the abovementioned MAP neighborhoods and staff from local organizations that serve these communities, and led them through a six-session virtual capacity building training designed to sharpen the skills to cultivate positive and strong relationships. Participants learn personal and community competencies to build and maintain healthy relationships, identify and address negative relationships, and acquire culturally relevant tools to support themselves and their communities. They also receive a referral guide to existing local domestic violence support services. Through the fierce advocacy of residents who recognize the training as a valuable community resource, WLWD expanded the Healthy Relationships Capacity Training to Polo Grounds Towers in March 2021. Page 90 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORTSUPPORTING ECONOMIC STABILITY The financial strain of COVID-19 is hard-hitting and long-lasting, particularly for the communities that have faced historic disinvestment. The Department of Social Services/Human Resources Administration (HRA) has partnered with MAP since its inception, and has adapted its engagement strategies in a number of creative and responsive ways to ensure that MAP households have continuous access to public benefits and emergency relief. HRA MAP outreach teams have held pop up, outdoor events in each MAP community to offer case management and application assistance for SNAP/Cash Assistance, rental assistance, restaurant allowances during gas outages, and much more. Additionally, when regular in person engagement is not possible, the HRA team hosts virtual office hours for all MAP communities, enabling real-time assistance without risking health during the COVID-19 Pandemic. It also conducts one-on-one follow up with individuals who make requests through the HRA MAP hotline and request forms. Finally, the HRA MAP team has taken its role of building capacity in the community to meet their own needs in managing public and emergency benefits very seriously\u2014in Fiscal 2021, it has held continuous training and webinars for resident leaders and community partners to utilize ACCESS HRA and other public tools. EVALUATION The John Jay College of Criminal Justice has finished conducting a comprehensive evaluation assessing MAP's effect on area crime rates and resident perceptions of community safety. The evaluation found that, relative to similar NYCHA comparison sites and controlling for other factors, the presence of MAP in NYCHA developments was associated with a statistically significant seven percent decline in overall misdemeanors with a particularly sharp 14 percent decline in misdemeanors against persons. Additionally, a survey of NYCHA residents administered by NORC at the University of Chicago found promising and statistically significant associations between declines in crime and positive perceptions in social cohesion, collective efficacy, awareness of social supports, and willingness to engage with government\u2014all constructs which the MAP model targets.

It performs a wide variety of public safety, law enforcement, traffic management, counterterror, and emergency response roles. Historically, the Department has achieved spectacular declines in both violent and property crime, ensuring that New York City has the lowest overall rate of major crimes in the 20 largest cities in the country. NYPD is divided into major bureaus for enforcement, investigations, and administration. It has 77 patrol precincts with patrol officers and detectives covering the entire city. The Department also has 12 transit districts to police the subway system and its nearly three-million daily riders, and nine police service areas (PSAs) to patrol the city's public housing developments, which are home to more than 400,000 residents. Additionally, uniformed civilians serve as traffic safety agents on the city's busy streets and highways, and as school safety agents, protecting public schools and the over-one-million students who attend them.FOCUS ON EQUITY In Fiscal 2021, the equitable, needs-based allocation of police personnel has been a major factor in continuing the historically low levels of crime in the City, while also reducing arrests and criminal summonses. Each of the city's 77 precincts, 12 Transit Bureau districts, and nine Housing Bureau PSAs has unique community and operational needs within their geographical boundaries, including high profile locations, transient working and visitor populations, and quality-of-life and community concerns. These factors, coupled with crime statistics and the number of 911 calls requiring police response, all contribute to the equitable deployment of police resources to address the problems and challenges our communities face. At a time when further police reforms are imminent and essential, Neighborhood Policing, initiated in May 2015, stands as a wide-ranging set of reforms that affirms the Department's commitment to reducing crime, promoting trust and respect, and solving problems collaboratively, both within the Department and with neighborhood residents. To further this effort, the Department recently established a youth coordination officer position in each precinct and housing PSA to engage with young people and to closely monitor and manage youth crime. The Department's enhanced training includes instruction in implicit bias, training in de-escalation tactics, and guidance for officers on how to be active bystanders who intercede when they observe police misconduct. NYPD is committed to cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace for all its employees. To increase transparency, NYPD has posted interactive dashboards on hate crimes and staffing demographics and published a customer survey to solicit feedback from members of the public. The NYPD discipline system has also been opened to public scrutiny. The discipline records of all uniformed members are now available online. Working with a wide array of police reform advocates, the Department has published an agreed-upon matrix of presumptive penalties. These penalties are assigned to various acts of police misconduct to clarify how and when penalties will be imposed. Also, with invaluable input from the community and external stakeholders, NYPD's use-of-force policies have been revised and continue to exceed national standards.

Goal 4a Improve police/community relations.NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT | Page 99 HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 SERVICE 1Manage public safety programs related to criminal activity. Goal 1a Reduce the incidence of crime. Crime reduction is achieved through collaboration between the public, patrol officers, neighborhood coordination officers (NCOs), investigators and regional criminal justice and law enforcement partners. The effectiveness of patrol officers as local crime fighters and local problem solvers has been enhanced by Neighborhood Policing. Sector officers and NCOs have been assigned to each sector within precincts and are working with local neighborhood forums on the most critical issues and crimes facing each community, helping prioritize and adapt police operations to respond to community concerns. Despite significant hardships and challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and extensive civil unrest, the NYPD remained operational at all levels in Fiscal 2021, responding to 911 and 311 calls for service, patrolling the entire city, investigating crimes, and taking police action when necessary. The Department continued to address criminal activity, counter threats of terrorism in New York City, manage traffic control, and ensure the safety of motorists, as well as providing a safe environment for New Yorkers using medical facilities and patronizing essential service establishments. During Fiscal 2021, overall major felony crime slightly increased by 0.6 percent compared to Fiscal 2020. Murder increased 38.9 percent and grand larceny of autos increased 47.2 percent. Forcible rape decreased by 13.7 percent compared to Fiscal 2020. Because of COVID precautions, NYC schools provided remote learning for most students, which resulted in limited face- to-face school participation in Fiscal 2021. Largely as a result, major felony incidents in schools decreased by 70.5 percent, and other criminal categories decreased by 82.7 percent when compared to Fiscal 2020. Juvenile arrests for major felonies also decreased 46 percent. By expanding its precision policing capabilities, NYPD has improved its capacity to more accurately identify incidents as gang-related, which has led to an increase in gang-motivated incidents by 82.8 percent in Fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year. Gun arrests have also increased by 39.5%. Narcotics arrests decreased 32.6 percent in Fiscal 2021, following several years of decline. This trend is in line with the NYPD's prioritization of felony-level narcotics arrests of higher level organized narcotics distributors, as opposed to minor drug arrests.Page 100 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT non-negligent manslaughter 300 303 278 352 489 \u00f2 \u00f2 Up Down \u00ab - Forcible rape 6,742 9,925 \u00f2 \u00f2 Up 5,373 \u00f2 \u00f2 2,399 2,590 2,378 1,452 \u00f2 \u00f2 Down Down Crime related to domestic violence - Murder 55 53 54 64 53 * * Neutral Down - Rape 504 466 726 645 591 * * Up Down - Felonious assault 8,082 7,912 8,288 8,182 8,324 * * Neutral Down \u00ab School safety - Major felony crime 504 466 444 288 85 \u00f2 \u00f2 Down Down - Murder 0 1 1 0 0 * * Down Down - Rape 4 16 8 2 5 * * Down Down - Robbery 60 37 49 31 0 * * Down Down - Felonious assault 140 134 122 60 5 * * Down Down - Burglary 37 46 27 40 35 * * Down Down - Grand larceny 263 228 235 155 37 * * Down Down - Grand larceny auto 0 4 2 0 3 * * Up Down School safety - Other criminal categories 2,007 2,026 1,537 976 169 * * Down Down - Other incidents 4,361 5,112 4,202 2,912 461 * * Down Down Gang motivated incidents 350 347 495 750 1,371 * * Up * Gun arrests 5,081 4,684 4,300 4,608 6,426 * * Up crime arrests 41,869 41,748 41,522 40,445 34,587 43,574 25,098 15,886 10,708 * * Down * for major felonies 2,198 2,200 2,754 4,252 2,297 * * Up * \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 1b Prevent terrorist attacks. The Department places a high priority on the prevention and detection of terrorist acts. Instead of drawing personnel from patrol precincts and depleting local patrol squads as previous counterterrorism deployments once did, NYPD's Critical Response Command\u2014a sub-unit of the Counterterrorism Bureau\u2014is staffed with dedicated personnel, trained and equipped to respond swiftly to active shooters and other attacks. There are continuous efforts to conduct in-depth training for all first responders, to maintain partnerships with other government agencies at the local, state, and federal levels, and to gather terrorism-related intelligence as effectively and expeditiously as possible. In Fiscal 2021, Counterterrorism training hours decreased 17.5 percent for uniformed members of the service and 93.7 percent for non-members. Although incoming recruit and promotional classes continued to receive training during Fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the cancellation of training sessions for school safety agents and non-members of the service.

The Department strives to respond to all calls for service as expeditiously as possible, while also ensuring that the public is provided with optimal levels of police service in every instance where the police assistance is required. Average response time rose slightly compared to Fiscal 2020 in all categories. Response time to all crimes in progress increased 6.6 percent but response time for critical crimes in progress increased only 3.1 percent. The Department continues to invest in the enhancement of new technology to provide patrol officers with vital and accessible information to enable a swifter and safer response to breaking crime and requests for service.

Goal 2a Reduce the incidence of traffic collisions, injuries and fatalities. The Department strives to improve and maintain the safety of pedestrians, motorists, and bicyclists alike. Yet Fiscal 2021 saw a 30 percent increase in total fatalities compared to Fiscal 2020. Passenger fatalities saw the greatest increase at 88 percent, and motorcyclist fatalities increased by 68 percent compared to Fiscal 2020. These increases are attributable to more vehicles on the road after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted and New Yorkers returned to normal driving patterns. Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) arrests decreased 33 percent, while DWI-related fatalities saw no change compared to Fiscal 2020. Moving violation summonses decreased by 38 percent. The Department will continue to intensify its efforts on traffic safety outreach to the public, in addition to enforcing vehicle and traffic law.

Goal 3a Reduce the incidence of quality-of-life violations. The Department, through rigorous analysis and other available resources, continues its efforts to identify and target conditions that affect the quality of life of residents and visitors. Through Neighborhood Policing, officers perform their law enforcement duties while also embedding themselves in the communities they serve as part of a team that works together to improve safety and quality of life for everyone. In Fiscal 2021, the total number of quality-of-life summonses decreased 39.8 percent and the number of unreasonable noise summonses decreased nine percent compared to Fiscal 2020. As neighborhood coordination officers learn more about the people who live in, work in, and visit their respective sectors, they develop a greater degree of detailed knowledge about quality-of-life issues affecting a particular community, and a greater capacity to remedy these problems without resorting to summonses.

Goal 4a Improve police/community relations. NYPD's efforts to win and maintain the trust of communities is the hallmark of Neighborhood Policing patrol. Patrol officers assigned to the same sector areas each day interact with members of the community on a daily basis, strengthening the police/community bond. Neighborhood meetings, convened by the neighborhood coordination officers in each sector within a precinct, provide a forum for cooperative and integrated problem solving. Additionally, the Department as a whole regularly partners with community members to strengthen police-community relations. The number of total Courtesy, Professionalism, and Respect tests conducted in Fiscal 2021 increased by 7.9 percent. The results of the tests were overwhelmingly positive, with 99.7 percent rated 'acceptable,' consistent with the positive results in Fiscal 2020.NEW YORK CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT | Page 103 Performance 7,698 5,028 3,583 3,867 * * Down * - Exceeds standard 9 2 3 1 0 * * Down Up - Meets standard 7,992 7,619 4,992 3,559 3,857 * * Down * - Below standard 166 77 33 23 10 * * Down Down Total civilian complaints against members of the service 4,215 4,392 5,236 4,597 3,326 * * Down Down Individuals who, after reporting a crime, received support to deal with the emotional, physical and financial aftermath of crime through the Crime Victim Assistance Program 16,088 40,410 59,008 49,904 39,283 35,000 35,000 Up * \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None AGENCY-WIDE Direction Cases state and federal court 2,115 2,065 2,084 1,763 $179,070 $154,432 * * Down Down Collisions involving City vehicles (per 100,000 miles) 4.6 4.3 4.4 4.0 3.6 * * Down Down Workplace injuries reported (uniform and civilian) 6,626 6,829 6,654 9,159 5,023 * * Neutral Down Violations admitted to or upheld at the Office of Administra - tive Trials and Hearings (%) 60% 55% 50% 57% 65% * * Neutral * \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None AGENCY CUSTOMER SERVICE Performance Indicators Actual Target Trend Customer Experience FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 275,981 287,866 267,680 * * Neutral * CORE facility rating 92 96 NA 94 84 * * NA Up Calls answered in 30 seconds (%) 99% 99% 99% 99% 99% * * Neutral Up \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Performance Indicators Actual Target Trend Response to 311 Service Requests (SRs) FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY21 FY22 5-YearDesired Direction Percent time to close - Residential Noise - Loud Music/ Party (0.3 days) 87 91 91 90 92 * * Neutral * Percent meeting time to close - Residential Noise - Banging/ Pounding (0.3 days) 84 89 88 88 99 * * Up * Percent meeting time to close - Noise - Street/Sidewalk (0.3 days) 87 90 90 92 99 * * Up * Percent meeting time to close - Commercial Noise (0.3 days) 92 94 94 91 99 * * Neutral * Percent meeting time to close - Blocked Driveway - No Access (0.3 days) 83 86 84 77 97 * * Neutral * \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * NonePage 104 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT amounts for the current fiscal year are not yet final.

Nigro, CommissionerFIRE DEPARTMENT | Page 107 WHAT WE DO The Fire Department (FDNY) responds to fires, public safety and medical emergencies, natural disasters and terrorist acts to protect the lives and property of City residents and visitors. The Department advances fire safety through its fire prevention, investigation and education programs, and contributes to the City's homeland security efforts. The Department responds to more than 300,000 fires and non-fire related emergencies and more than 1.5 million medical emergencies a year and maintains approximately 250 firehouses and ambulance stations.FOCUS ON EQUITY As first responders to more than 1.8 million fires, medical emergencies and myriad other incidents that impact and threaten public safety each year, FDNY equitably protects the lives and property of all New York City residents and visitors. The Department also advances public safety through its fire prevention, investigation and education programs, focusing on communities most vulnerable to fire and its devastating impact on life and property. The delivery of these emergency and public service initiatives enables FDNY to make significant contributions to the safety of all New Yorkers. Over the course of many years, operational efforts combined with public education have helped reduce the number of serious fires and fire-related deaths, which historically have had a disproportionate impact on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color. FDNY is also committed to cultivating and sustaining a diverse and inclusive workplace for all its employees, as outlined in its Diversity and Inclusion Vision, Mission and Goals Statement as well as its Inclusive Culture Strategy. These objectives are supported by its Equal Employment Opportunity, Sexual Harassment, Anti-Hazing/Anti-Bullying and similar policies. While continuing to enforce its members' compliance with the law and related policies, FDNY also provides diversity and inclusion education, restorative practices, mentoring and messaging to enhance authentic trust, supportive relationships, positive motivation, excellent education, community engagement and inclusive leadership development tools. Improving diversity, equity and inclusion is integral to every FDNY objective, especially the recruitment of firefighters. In addition, during Fiscal 2021, the Department participated in the Mayor's Taskforce on Racial Inclusion and Equity. The Department maintains a separate website for recruitment, JoinFDNY.com, which received 747,000 views in Fiscal 2021. Join FDNY social media content received 3.7 million views and interacts directly with prospective applicants.Page 108 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Protect lives and property from fire hazards and other emergency conditions. Goal 1a Reduce the risk associated with fire incidents. Goal 1b Promptly respond to fires and other emergencies. Goal 1c Minimize damage to persons and property. SERVICE 2 Respond to medical emergencies. Goal 2a Promptly respond to medical emergencies. Goal 2b Provide high quality emergency medical care.FIRE DEPARTMENT | Page 109 HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 SERVICE 1Protect lives and property from fire hazards and other emergency conditions. Goal 1a Reduce the risk associated with fire incidents. In Fiscal 2021 structural fires decreased 6 percent and non-structural fires increased 31 percent compared to Fiscal 2020. The rise in non-structural fires is attributed to a rise in manhole fires which more than doubled from 2,587 in Fiscal 2020 to 6,104 in Fiscal 2021. Fire company runs between Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021 increased 5 percent. FDNY reduces the risk associated with fires through its inspection, education and investigation programs. Fire inspections are designed to reduce the loss of life and property from fires through two separate and distinct inspection programs, one carried out by FDNY fire protection inspectors, the other carried out by firefighters and fire officers. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the Bureau of Fire Prevention continued to conduct inspections but conducted 15 percent fewer compared to the prior year because COVID-19 Emergency Orders restricted access to many locations and inspector and support staff faced high rates of COVID-19 related leave. The Bureau of Fire Prevention conducted additional inspections to ensure compliance with COVID-19 Emergency Orders and the phased reopening. Mandated inspection requirements are determined each year based in part on the number of permits issued by the City for new construction, demolition, alterations and abatements, as well as complaints received from the public. COVID restrictions throughout most of the fiscal year resulted in a decrease in total inspections completed. Firefighters conducted 26 percent fewer mandatory inspections as well as 62 percent fewer risk-based inspections. Regular building inspection operations resumed in April 2021. The primary mission of the Bureau of Fire Investigation is to conduct investigations that identify the cause of fires, including arson, as well as to analyze fire trends and risk factors. Those trends and factors are then targeted by FDNY's Fire Safety Education Program, the Bureau of Fire Prevention and Community Engagement and External Affairs personnel with the goal of preventing or limiting the occurrence of future incidents. In Fiscal 2021 fire investigations decreased 15 percent compared to Fiscal 2020. Additionally, there was a 25 percent decrease in incidents where arson was determined to be the cause of fire. The COVID-19 pandemic also had a significant impact on the Fire Safety Education Unit, leading to a 88 percent reduction in educational events. To limit public gatherings and protect FDNY employees, fire safety outreach transitioned to digital platforms. In April 2020, the FDNY launched the website which provided a variety of digital content on fire and life safety topics for youth and families. Since the launch, the website has received over 48,000 views.

Response time to incidents that are not reported through 911, such as those reported through private fire alarms, are not included in end-to-end response time metrics\u2014for example, in Fiscal 2021 43 percent of structural fire incidents did not go through 911. These incidents are included in FDNY dispatch plus travel time indicators.

Goal 2a Promptly respond to medical emergencies. The overall incidence of medical emergencies decreased between Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021\u2014total incidents declined 9 percent with a 9 percent reduction in life- threatening incidents. This may be best explained by an overall decrease in daytime population in New York City as well as a possible public reticence to visit hospitals during the pandemic. The decrease in workload and a rise in the peak number of ambulances in service per day (see Goal 2b) resulted in a Fiscal 2021 end-to-end combined average response time to life-threatening medical emergencies decreased by 47 seconds compared to Fiscal 2020. End-to-end average response time to life-threatening medical emergencies by ambulances decreased 45 seconds compared to Fiscal 2020. In Fiscal 2020 dispatch and travel time only to life-threatening medical emergencies for ambulances and fire companies combined decreased 50 seconds compared to Fiscal 2020.

In Fiscal 2021 FDNY responded to 29,843 reports of patient in cardiac arrest or choking (segment one incidents). This represents a nine percent decrease from Fiscal 2020 and is more closely representative of pre-pandemic volume. Overall, FDNY units responded to 9,497 confirmed non-traumatic cardiac arrest patients in Fiscal 2021. The percentage of confirmed arrest patients that were revived increased four percentage points compared to Fiscal 2020. A subset of these incidents are classified as bystander-witnessed cardiac arrest, which occurs when someone is with the patient who can recognize that the patient is in arrest, call for help and possibly perform CPR, often resulting in better outcomes.

The agency leads the coordination for multiagency responses to emergencies and other significant incidents in New York City, including planned events, severe weather and other natural and non-natural hazards. To accomplish this mission, NYCEM leads interagency and public-facing programs designed to improve overall community preparedness. This includes developing New York City emergency plans, liaising with over 400 local, state, federal, nonprofit and other entities, educating the public about emergency preparedness and hosting all-hazard training and exercises. NYCEM also works to advance long- term initiatives that reduce risk and increase the resilience of New York City through mitigation planning and FEMA mitigation grant coordination. When emergencies occur, NYCEM activates the City's Emergency Operations Center, a central location for officials from city, state and federal agencies, nonprofits, private sector, regional and utility partners to work during emergencies to coordinate response efforts, make decisions and gather and broadcast information. NYCEM also manages Watch Command - the City's 24/7 coordination center which monitors citywide radio frequencies, local, national and international media and weather and provides public information through Notify NYC, the City's emergency communications program. As the City's primary liaison with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for consequence management, NYCEM oversees the City's compliance with federal preparedness and emergency response requirements.FOCUS ON EQUITY NYCEM focuses on equity through programs and activities designed to address the needs of New York City's diverse communities. These include the agency's Disability, Access and Functional Needs (DAFN) program, Ready New York, Community Preparedness, Partners in Preparedness and the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program (volunteers trained in disaster preparedness and emergency response). Additionally, NYCEM partners with elected officials, community boards, civic groups, businesses, nonprofits and others. In Fiscal 2021, NYCEM established an Equity and Diversity Council to continue to prioritize an agency culture that welcomes, promotes and respects diverse communities within the agency and in our programs. In response to COVID-19, in Fiscal 2021 NYCEM established the Strengthening Communities through Recovery program to support community groups that offer important social services in areas most deeply affected by COVID-19. Through this program, local leaders were taught how to build emergency preparedness plans to support their communities before and after an emergency. In addition, NYCEM's hazard and preparedness guides offer tips and information on planning for a range of needs, including older adults, people with disabilities, children, people with limited English proficiency and people with pets. Most guides are available in 13 languages and audio format. Preparedness information is also available in Braille. In addition, contracted Certified Deaf Interpreters, American Sign Language (ASL) and multilingual interpreters are available for training, community events and during emergencies. NYCEM also hosts an annual DAFN Symposium to discuss emergency preparedness topics related to people with disabilities with community stakeholders. NYCEM's Advance Warning System sends emergency alerts to organizations that serve people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs. Notify NYC\u2014the City's free, official source for information about emergency events and important City services\u2014offers common notifications in 13 languages and audio format. The City's focus on equity grounds NYCEM's programming in the needs of New York City's diverse communities.Page 116 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Ensure that City government is ready for emergencies.

Goal 1a Efficiently coordinate emergency response, recovery and mitigation. NYCEM coordinates the City's emergency response and recovery, as defined in the Citywide Incident Management System (CIMS). In Fiscal 2021, NYCEM was actively involved with 4,630 incidents that necessitated interagency coordination. Though this is a 24 percent decrease from the 6,084 incidents in Fiscal 2020, NYCEM activated the City's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) for 365 days during Fiscal 2021\u2014the entire year\u2014a 96 percent increase over the 186 days activated in Fiscal 2020. While this was largely due to the ongoing COVID-19 response, the EOC was concurrently activated for Tropical Storms Fay and Isaias, the Bay Ridge Power Disruption, heat events, Election Day and winter weather. Notably, during Fiscal 2021, the City's EOC was conducted almost entirely virtually for the first time.

During Fiscal 2021, NYCEM continued to conduct citywide preparedness exercises that serve to test plans, reinforce response and management techniques, identify areas for improvement and promote better interagency coordination. The agency conducted 17 discussion-based exercises (i.e., seminars, workshops, tabletops), including Hurricane Zone Evacuation, Heat and Interim Flood Protection Measures Tabletop Exercises. NYCEM also held eight operations-based exercises (i.e., drills, functional, full-scale), including a Damage Assessment Data Drill. These were decreases of 39 percent and 47 percent from Fiscal 2020, due to resources shifted to COVID-19 response. Though the COVID-19 response challenged NYCEM's ability to offer and attend trainings, drills and exercises, NYCEM was able to meet nearly all of the Fiscal 2021 targets. In Fiscal 2021, while continuing to maintain COVID-19 response operations, NYCEM participated in 20 drills that were coordinated by other agencies. Due to the agency's transition to virtual trainings, NYCEM held 84 emergency management training sessions with 1,446 participants in Fiscal 2021, an increase from 1,357 participants during Fiscal 2020. exercises/drills 18 15 17 15 8 5 14 Down Up \u00ab Tabletop exercises 20 22 27 28 17 31 31 Neutral Up Participation in drills coordinated by other agencies or organiza - tions 41 49 45 19 20 * * Down Up \u00ab Participants at instructor-led emergency management training sessions 2,626 3,131 3,026 1,357 1,446 1,000 1,000 Down Up Online emergency management courses completed through Learning Management System NA NA NA 891 624 * * NA Up \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * NonePage 118 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT SERVICE 2Prepare New York City residents and private sector entities for emergencies. Goal 2aIncrease emergency preparedness and awareness among City residents, the private sector and nonprofit organizations. Through its Ready New York campaign, NYCEM educates City residents on preparedness. In Fiscal 2021, the agency held emergency management and preparedness education sessions for 6,833 participants, an 88 percent decrease compared to Fiscal 2020. This decrease is attributed to COVID-19, which limited the number of presentations and audience size. These sessions are typically held in workplaces, older adult centers and schools, all of which implemented closures or capacity restrictions. As NYCEM's community engagement strategies shifted to a virtual environment in response to COVID-19, in Fiscal 2021 the Ready New York program introduced the monthly \"Ready Up NYC\" webinar series which has helped 873 participants prepare for emergencies. Ready New York webpage views declined 55 percent in Fiscal 2021, as people continue to move toward social channels to gather information. Accordingly, NYCEM increasingly shared preparedness information through its social media where followers on Twitter, Facebook and other platforms increased by 8 percent in Fiscal 2021 from the previous year.

CERT members complete an intensive 10-week training program that raises awareness about emergencies and disasters and provides basic response skills needed for fire safety, light search and rescue, disaster medical operations and traffic control. After graduating from the 10-week program, CERT members support their communities by assisting with emergency education and response. In total, CERT members donated 11,037 hours of volunteer service in Fiscal 2021. Though this was a decrease from the 16,936 hours donated in Fiscal 2020, the number of CERT deployments increased by 127 percent from 22 in Fiscal 2020 to 50 in Fiscal 2021 due to the critical role CERT members played in COVID-19 response operations supporting, for example, the Test & Trace Program, pedestrian and traffic management at vaccination sites and mask and food distribution.

NYCEM's Watch Command tracks incidents affecting the City 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by monitoring radio frequencies used by the City's emergency responders, local and national news, weather conditions and 911 calls, among other information channels. Though the number of Notify NYC messages issued decreased from 3,910 in Fiscal 2020 to 2,926 in Fiscal 2021 (down 25 percent), the number of subscribers to NYCEM notification channels increased 4 percent. In Fiscal 2021 NYCEM bolstered its multilingual messaging to keep New Yorkers informed throughout the COVID-19 response and other emergency events. This includes NYCEM's continued use of the City's text notification system which was used to provide COVID-19 alerts to more than 800,000 New Yorkers in English and Spanish and provide New Yorkers living in Jackson Heights with important updates in response to the eight-alarm fire there.

Those in the Department's custody include individuals 18 years of age and older who are awaiting trial, who have been convicted and sentenced to less than one year of incarceration and persons held on state parole warrants. Pursuant to New York's Raise the Age law, 16- and 17-year-olds were removed from Rikers Island prior to October 1st, 2018. The Department operates 9 facilities housing people in custody, 8 of which are located on Rikers Island. The Department also operates court holding facilities in each of the five boroughs, and two hospital prison wards. In Fiscal 2021, the Department processed 16,179 admissions and managed a combined daily population (ADP) of approximately 5,000 individuals. Guided by its #NewDayDOC plan, as well as ongoing work with the Nunez Federal Monitor, the Department has implemented substantive reforms informed by, and contributing to, correctional best practice. With a focus on improving safety for staff and individuals in DOC custody, the Department is working to implement the use of a new Risk Management Accountability System that will eliminate the use of punitive segregation; develop of holistic approaches to behavior management; improve staffing ratios; enhance staff training in Mental Health First Aid, Safe Crisis Management and de-escalation; and expand programming for those in custody that is designed to reduce idleness and promote skills development towards post-release success. The goal is to make sure that anyone would feel safe knowing that their son, daughter, or loved one either works or is incarcerated in DOC facilities.FOCUS ON EQUITY The Department believes that the community at large benefits when we support those in our custody with the programs and services they need for successful reentry to their community. That is why we work to make sure each individual in our custody is equipped with resources that will provide them with the opportunity for a better life. To achieve that goal, we offer programming targeted to an individual's needs such as vocational training, access to education, mental health treatment, and substance abuse services among other assistance to keep people focused on their futures. We also partner with community organizations who can provide continuity of care services to people while in custody and upon community reintegration. The Department is focused on becoming an institution that changes people for the better to improve the overall safety of our community. DOC aims to transform the lives of individuals before they leave our custody so that they are equipped with the opportunities to better themselves upon returning to their communities. With that goal in mind, the Department is committed to improving the conditions of our facilities and quality of our care. Although many programs and services were paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in June of 2021, DOC resumed the provision of in-person visits and in-person services in a modified manner. Visits and services are handled safely with appropriate sanitization, PPE, and social distancing protocols in place. We are also focusing on population reduction plans that will lower the overall population on Rikers Island to assist in implementing the borough-based jail system. To that end, in July of 2021, we began transferring property to the Department of Citywide Administrative Services in accordance with the Renewable Rikers Act. However, while we are still on Rikers Island, we are doing everything in our power to repair outdated equipment and fixtures; improve conditions within our facilities for people in our custody; and provide programming that will engage and support incarcerated individuals.Page 122 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Provide a safe and secure environment for individuals in custody, staff and host communities.

Goal 3a Provide timely notifications to crime victims.DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION | Page 123 HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 SERVICE 1Provide a safe and secure environment for individuals in custody, staff and host communities. Goal 1a Ensure the security and safety of individuals in custody in DOC custody. DOC is committed to ensuring the safety and security of its facilities. The Department continues to embrace a hands-on, holistic approach in managing our jails, and driving down Uses of Force and violence while increasing a global understanding of effective techniques to accomplish those goals. However, managing a population of incarcerated violent offenders is always a challenge. A recent increase of those in custody being affiliated with security risk groups has enhanced this challenge. Roughly 70 percent of individuals admitted into custody throughout Fiscal 2021 were awaiting trial for a violent felony offense. Additionally, in January 2021, 23 percent of individuals in custody were known members of a security risk group, or gangs, as compared to 17 percent of the population in custody in January 2020 and an increase from 14.7 percent in Fiscal 2017. Further, the incarcerated population has also steadily risen despite an initial decrease at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The backlog in the court system has caused many individuals to linger in DOC custody for substantially longer than they otherwise would have. Data shows that the longer one remains in custody, the likelihood increases that they will be involved in a violent incident. Violent incidents among individuals in custody (monthly rate per 1,000 ADP) increased from 80.1 in Fiscal 2020, to 98.1 in Fiscal 2021, a 22.5 percent increase. With this in mind, the Department's #NewDayDOC plan is aimed at increasing safety within our jail facilities. For instance, DOC has accelerated the repair of cell doors in young adult housing, focusing on the facility that that houses a population that has historically been more prone to violence. Also focusing on young adults, the Department is implementing a plan that will safely and thoughtfully break up the housing of gang members. We have also realigned our Central Intelligence Bureau by adding staff and working closely with District Attorneys' Offices to ensure there are meaningful consequences for serious violent actions. Additionally, with the relaxation of many COVID-19- related restrictions, the Department has begun rolling out in- person visitation, programming, religious services, and barbering/ hairstyling. These efforts will productively occupy individuals in custody, lead to fewer violent incidents, fewer uses of force, and ultimately a safer Department.020406080100 FY 21 FY 20 FY 19 FY 18 FY 17Violent Incidents Among Individuals in (Monthly Rate per 1,000 ADP) 55.9 55.268.998.1 80.1 16000 19 FY 18 FY 17 of FY 20 FY 19 FY 18 FY 17Individual(s) of Stay 8,896 7,938 4,9219,500 6675 5,8419087 60 Page 124 population 9,500 8,896 7,938 5,841 4,961 * * Down Down Individuals in custody in Security Risk Group (% ADP) 14.7% 15.4% 16.4% 11,191 11,214 * * Jail-based arrests of individuals in custody 1,126 742 490 258 145 * * Down Down Searches 246,822 308,063 328,750 282,048 268,579 2,882 2,439 2,159 * * Down * \u00ab Violent incidents among individuals in custody (monthly rate per 1,000 ADP) 55.2 55.9 68.9 80.1 98.1 \u00f2 \u00f2 Up Down \u00ab Serious injury to individuals in custody as a result of violent incidents among individuals in custody (monthly rate per 1,000 ADP) 2.7 2.0 2.5 9.6 13.0 \u00f2 \u00f2 Up Down \u00ab Assault on staff by individual in custody (monthly rate per 1,000 ADP) 8.4 9.2 12.5 15.8 19.6 \u00f2 \u00f2 Up Down \u00ab Serious injury to staff as a result of assault on staff by individu - al in custody (monthly rate per 1,000 ADP) 0.24 0.42 0.49 0.65 0.52 \u00f2 \u00f2 Up Escapes 1 2 1 \u00f2 \u00f2 Up Down \u00ab Non-natural deaths of individuals in custody 1 1 2 0 2 \u00f2 \u00f2 Up Down Stabbings and Slashings 165 96 106 123 247 * * Up Down \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 1b Ensure that use of force is authorized and appropriate. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department observed a decrease in total use of force rates and a flattening of assault-on-staff rates. However, both rates began to climb once the courts reopened and the jail population began to steadily increase. Although the overall population in DOC facilities has decreased over the past year due to this crisis, the population that remains present a significant challenge to our staff. Notwithstanding an increase in the total incidents of use of force in the reporting period, the Department continues its efforts to reduce unnecessary use of force and the situations that may give rise to force.

During the reporting period, the number of health clinic visits decreased by 68 percent. However, as compared to the previous fiscal year, average clinic wait time decreased by 10 minutes. Although the Department aims to produce as many individuals to the clinic as possible, the current staffing shortages contribute to the increase in overall non-production numbers. Further, DOC is working to address any fears about attending clinics due to concerns regarding COVID-19 through weekly flyers distributed to all incarcerated individuals containing the latest information on the virus.

Goal 2a Prepare as many individuals in custody as possible for successful release through participation in skills- building programs including educational opportunities, jobs training, behavioral interventions and mental health services. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many program providers that offered group-based programming, discharge planning, and post-release assistance paused their in-person services. However, several program providers returned to in-person services in May of 2021. Many of our providers continue to support people in custody by providing self-guided materials that included reentry resources, engaging activities, and inspirational content; establishing discharge planning service hotlines that people in custody could use to contact providers to discuss their reentry needs; and supporting people after their release to the community. Additionally, the Programs Division offers a wide range of other educational and engaging programming, including self-guided activity packets, tablets, books, and more.

In addition to discharge planning, the Department understands the critical importance of job readiness in the reentry process. During the past fiscal year, the percentage of individuals in custody participating in skills-building activities/discharge planning dropped significantly because we paused in-person services in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. During that time, reentry providers continued to support people in custody by 1) providing self-guided materials that included reentry resources, engaging activities, and inspirational content, 2) establishing hotlines that people in custody could use to contact providers to discuss their reentry needs, and 3) supporting people after their release to the community. In addition, the Programs Division offered a variety of other educational and engaging resources, including self-guided activity packets, tablets, books, and more. In the summer of 2021, DOC resumed in-person programming, allowing the gradual return to offering a wide range of in-person skill-building and discharge planning services. The Department's #NewDayDOC plan specifically envisions keeping incarcerated individuals engaged to prevent idleness and promote wellness. We are expanding the tablet program, allowing all incarcerated people to use them. We are also concentrating on the young adult population where violence\u2014and hope for the future\u2014is highest, collaborating with the young adult task force to create the most supportive environment possible.

DOP also supplies information and recommendations to the courts to help inform sentencing and disposition decisions. In Family Court, DOP provides reports in family offense, custody, child support, visitation, adoption and guardianship cases. In total, DOP provides intake and interstate services, investigations and supervision in some 50,000 cases per year. DOP operates the Neighborhood Opportunity Network (NeON) in seven communities that a high concentration of people on probation call home, providing a range of opportunities to people on probation and other neighborhood residents. Through the NeONs, DOP reaches thousands of New Yorkers through arts programming, High School Equivalency classes, free groceries, access to health insurance enrollment services and more. FOCUS ON EQUITY As the largest and most robust alternative to incarceration in New York City, and one of the largest in the nation, DOP is committed to ensuring that the people under its supervision\u2014who are disproportionately people of color\u2014have access to the opportunities and services they need in order not just to avoid jail or prison, but to thrive. DOP brings resources into the NYC neighborhoods which have been disproportionately impacted by the justice system and that large numbers of people on probation call home. DOP's nationally-recognized Neighborhood Opportunity Network (NeON) operates as an engine of equity in seven such communities (Brownsville, Bedford-Stuyvesant, East New York, Harlem, Jamaica, North Staten Island and South Bronx) by partnering with neighborhood residents and community-based organizations to develop ground-up solutions, while also providing people on probation with reporting sites and resources within walking distance of their homes. Recognized with the Excellence in Crime Prevention Award from the American Probation and Parole Association, the NeON model is premised on the value of authentic community engagement. DOP is committed to minimizing the adverse collateral consequences of being involved in the criminal and juvenile justice systems which fall heavily on people and communities of color. This commitment is demonstrated through the diverse array of resources and programming (educational, employment and more) made available in these communities. Most NeON programs, including NeON Nutrition Kitchens, NeON Arts and NeON Sports, are open to all community residents fostering connectivity between neighbors and destigmatizing people on probation. An independent evaluation of the ground-breaking Arches Transformative Mentoring program, serving 16-24 year-olds on probation who live in NeON neighborhoods, found a more than two-thirds reduction in felony reconvictions among participants and the program was named a finalist in the Harvard Kennedy School's Innovations in American Government Awards. Through accountability measures and service practices grounded in research, as well as partnerships with community-based organizations and other stakeholders, DOP fosters personal change, increases opportunities to thrive and strengthens communities, thereby building a more equitable and safer city.Page 130 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Contribute to optimal court processing and decision-making in delinquency and criminal justice matters.

Based on Raise the Age legislation enacted in September 2017, sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds in New York State charged with lower-level crimes are also processed through family court intake. The Department processed 3,691 juvenile intakes during Fiscal 2021, a 39 percent decrease, based on reduced court operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the juvenile intake process, probation officers make individual assessments for statutory eligibility and suitability for adjustment, including outreach and communication with complainants, NYPD, and youths' families. The juvenile intake adjustment eligibility rate increased one percentage point to 34 percent. The Department continues to improve and monitor screening practices by conducting a standardized assessment instrument on all youths eligible and suitable for adjustment.

Goal 2a Assess risk to match individuals with supervision and monitoring levels; use rearrest and violation trends to make adjustments to supervision level components. During the reporting period probation officers completed 5,346 initial risk / need assessments for adults entering probation supervision, and 1,526 initial assessments for juveniles, decreases of 43 percent and 33 percent, respectively. A significant COVID-19 based reduction in new supervision cases added during the fiscal year, as well as continued overall year-to-year declines in NYPD arrests, reduced demand for new assessments. These screenings, based on validated actuarial instruments developed for community supervision, identify criminogenic risk factors and programming needs, and are used to develop Individual Action Plans (IAPs) for those on probation. The average monthly rearrest rate for adults on probation supervision decreased from 2.1 percent to 1.7 percent, while the juvenile rate decreased nine-tenths of a percentage point to 2.3 percent. When viewed as a percentage of all NYPD arrests, the adult rate decreased from 3.1 to 2.7 percent, while the juvenile rate dropped one-tenth of a percentage point to 0.2 percent. The Department continues to analyze and respond to Citywide arrest trends. The average monthly violation of probation (VOP) rate for adults on probation decreased from 1.0 to 0.7 percent. Probation violation proceedings ending in revocation for adults declined by 12 percentage points to 22 percent. The violation rate for juveniles decreased eight tenths of a percentage point to 0.9 percent, while the revocation rate decreased one percentage point to 29 percent. DOP continued to utilize a broad continuum of alternatives to a probation violation such as intensive supervision, programming, and behavioral health services to reduce violation filings.

The percentage of IAPs completed was unchanged at 100 percent for both adults and juveniles. IAPs serve as a roadmap for the period of probation supervision and provide a basis for benchmarking and measuring progress towards achieving short and longer-term goals, leading to better outcomes for individuals serving a community-based criminal or juvenile justice sentence. There were 57 new enrollments of juveniles in alternative-to-placement (ATP) programs, a 21 percent decrease. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these enrollments are reflective of DOP's overall supervision population trends and individual needs as determined by risk assessments and IAPs. There were 4,047 targeted behavioral health intervention contacts to individuals on probation Citywide. This represented a 17 percent decrease year-to-year in overall contacts, but when viewed as a percent of the total probation population supervised, clients serviced increased one percentage point to 23 percent. Early completions increased two percentage points to 18 percent of all adult supervision case closings, and the approval rate for early completion applications was 92 percent, a three-percentage point increase. The Department continues to prioritize identifying qualified candidates for early discharge based on compliance with the terms of probation and working towards goals set in individual action plans, and monitors these indicators at its quarterly performance management meetings. The rate for adults successfully completing their probation terms during the reporting period was 89 percent, a six percentage point increase. The juvenile rate increased one percentage point to 91 percent. Reductions in rearrests and violation (VOP) filings, as well as an increase in early completions for adults, contributed to the successful probation term completion rates.

The Board's investigative staff, composed entirely of civilian employees, conducts investigations in an impartial fashion. The Board forwards its findings to the Police Commissioner.FOCUS ON EQUITY CCRB focuses on equitable service delivery by resolving civilian complaints impartially and speedily, conducting outreach to the diverse communities of the City and examining the policies and systemic practices that lead to misconduct complaints. Toward that end, CCRB works to increase the percentage of complaints where findings on the merits are reached and, when officers are found to have committed misconduct, to recommend an effective level of discipline. CCRB continues to extend its outreach to underserved communities. CCRB has provided greater access for individuals who cannot travel to Manhattan to meet with investigators and CCRB's investigative team regularly conducts field interviews throughout the five boroughs, as well as on Rikers Island. The Board also conducts evening public meetings across the City. CCRB's website, which contains materials in eight languages, allows the public to file complaints, track the status of their complaints and view up-to-date maps with the number of misconduct complaints filed in each police precinct. CCRB is in the process of building a new Civilian Assistance Unit (CAU) to serve and support complainants, victims and witnesses with special needs, particularly victims of sexual misconduct. The CCRB Youth Advisory Council (YAC), a 19-member working committee made up of young leaders, ages 10-24, who are committed to criminal justice issues and improving police-community relations, launched in winter of 2018. The YAC meets quarterly and advises CCRB staff about its efforts to engage young New Yorkers to serve as ambassadors to their communities about the Agency and join team-building activities. CCRB also maintains a fellowship focused on equity: the James Blake Fellow aims to reduce the number of complaints closed without a full investigation by identifying complaints least likely to result in full investigations and recommending policy changes to address underserved groups.Page 138 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Investigate, prosecute and resolve claims of police misconduct.

Goal 1a Improve the quality and timeliness of investigations. Total civilian complaints against uniformed members of service decreased over the course of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent closures in Fiscal 2021, dropping 28 percent to 3,326 from 4,597 in Fiscal 2020. Monthly complaints hit their lowest level in August 2020, with 218 complaints, and reached a high in March 2021, with 376 complaints. The average time to complete a full investigation rose 30 percent, from 290 days to 378 days, largely as a continuing result of the city's COVID-19 precautions. The difficulty of shifting entirely to remote work caused by the lack of technological resources combined with the need to conduct investigations remotely caused the average time to complete investigations to rise. CCRB and NYPD agreed to conduct virtual interviews but negotiations to conduct these interviews continued through Fiscal 2021, and the delay in beginning remote interviews created a backlog of cases that is still being addressed. The average time to complete a substantiated investigation also increased, rising 33 percent from 326 days to 433 days. As cases opened during the pandemic are closed the length of time to close investigations will naturally increase until the backlog is cleared, at which point investigative times to close may normalize. Case completion times have also been strongly affected by the number of cases that include body-worn camera footage. A single case may include multiple hours of footage from several officers on the scene. In Fiscal 2021 the percent of allegations closed on the merits (allegations fully investigated and closed as substantiated, exonerated or unfounded) increased to 56.6 percent from 55.4 percent. The Board renders findings on the merits when sufficient evidence has been gathered to allow a factual conclusion to be made. No findings on the merits are made when allegations are unsubstantiated, the subject officer is no longer a member of NYPD or the subject officer could not be identified.

Pestana, Corporation CounselLAW DEPARTMENT | Page 143 WHAT WE DO The Law Department is responsible for all of the legal matters affecting the City. The Department represents the City, the Mayor, other elected officials and the City's agencies in all affirmative and defensive civil litigation. The Department represents the City in juvenile delinquency prosecutions brought in Family Court and Administrative Code enforcement proceedings brought in Criminal Court. Law Department attorneys draft and review local and state legislation, real estate leases, procurement contracts and financial instruments for the sale of municipal bonds. The Department also provides legal counsel to City officials on a wide range of issues such as civil rights, education, intellectual property, land use and environmental policy.FOCUS ON EQUITY The Law Department's lawyers and support professionals work collaboratively to pursue justice while providing the City with the highest quality legal representation. Department staff are expected to treat all whom they encounter in litigation with professionalism, respect and empathy, even as they vigorously pursue all appropriate legal defenses and claims in the best interests of the City. The Department acts to ensure that unrepresented claimants are treated fairly, explaining in plain language discovery orders and other documents. The Family Court Division conducts outreach to victims in delinquency cases to ensure that they are offered necessary services and personal protection, at the same time that it advocates for dispositional alternatives that rehabilitate young offenders in a manner consistent with public safety. The Department also brings affirmative litigation that advances vital interests of the City and works with other agencies to manage the risks involved in large- scale and widespread government operations. The Law Department advises agency clients on a wide range of issues affecting public safety and welfare, in such areas as education, health, environment, economic development and law enforcement operations. Department attorneys play an important role in drafting legislation that advances significant City policies, including the protection of the civil rights of its residents.Page 144 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Represent the City of New York in litigation and other legal matters involving the City's interests.

Goal 1a Limit the City's liability as a result of claims. In Fiscal 2021, the payout for judgments and claims brought against the City in state and federal court decreased nearly 8 percent compared to the same period of Fiscal 2020.

In Fiscal 2021, cases commenced in federal court increased 13 percent, while cases pending in state court increased by 16 percent. The increase in state court was due to the Governor's freeze on new case filings from March to May 2020. The backlogged cases from that period were filed mostly in July through September 2020. Fewer summary judgement motions were made due to the COVID-19 crisis. Since many agencies were mostly working from home during the reporting period, it was difficult to obtain the affidavits and perform the searches necessary to make the motions.

While these successful litigation outcomes have likely discouraged the filing of meritless claims, cases commenced in Federal Court rose nearly thirteen percentage points in Fiscal 2021 compared with the prior fiscal year.

It has oversight of more than 45 Mayoral agencies with over 300,000 employees, as well as dozens of City boards and commissions. DOI's strategy attacks corruption comprehensively through investigations that lead to high impact arrests, public reports, and recommended preventive internal controls and operational reforms. DOI's work aims to prevent criminal misconduct and waste, remove corrupt public officials, ensure wrongdoers are held accountable, and improve the way City government functions. DOI serves New Yorkers by acting as an independent and nonpartisan watchdog for City government.FOCUS ON EQUITY DOI focuses on equitable service delivery by rooting out municipal corruption through investigations and examining structural issues that undermine good government and New Yorkers' access to services. DOI's commitment to equity focuses on improving the integrity, effectiveness and credibility of City government by investigating cases involving corruption, waste, fraud, and inefficiency in City government, and issuing policy and procedure recommendations (PPRs) to mitigate vulnerabilities. To that end, DOI reviews City agencies' operations and practices, and recommends concrete ways to strengthen internal controls so public dollars are saved and agency processes improved. In addition to pursuing hundreds of investigations into specific allegations of misconduct or wrongdoing, DOI issued three significant public reports during the fiscal year. In December 2020, DOI issued a report on the New York City Police Department (NYPD) response to the George Floyd protests. DOI found six deficiencies in the NYPD's response that undermined public confidence and issued 20 recommendations to improve NYPD policies and practices relating to policing protests. DOI also reviewed the Environmental Control Board (ECB) summons issuance and debt collection process. The appraisal revealed that the City was losing out on much-needed revenue and the message of deterrence these ECB fines are supposed to deliver was undermined. The investigation resulted in six different recommendations for reform, a number of which were issued citywide, for a total of 203 PPRs\u2014including standardizing and expanding the use of a centralized database allowing all City agencies to efficiently share City information that is relevant to the issuance and enforcement of ECB summonses. DOI also issued a report finding that the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) had violated lead-based paint abatement regulations since at least 2013. DOI found that despite training and certification, several NYCHA managers failed to conduct abatement in accordance with regulations and intentionally misled executives by indicating the work done was in accordance with regulations while falsifying signatures on work orders. DOI issued 16 PPRs to NYCHA. The majority were accepted and either have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented. To ensure DOI provides equitable service, all DOI staff attended implicit bias training this fiscal year, highlighting DOI's dedication to conduct fair and impartial investigations on behalf of all New Yorkers. The Department's investigations in this period reflect that no one is above the law, whether they are the CEO of a non-profit operating soup kitchens, homeless shelters and affordable housing facilities in who schemed to enrich himself through bribes and kickbacks; a Corrections captain charged with criminally negligent homicide for ordering subordinates not to take potentially life- saving measures to assist an inmate in distress; or an unlicensed contractor and grocery store owner indicted for illegally installing a makeshift elevator that killed a vendor; or a New York City Council member who pled guilty to tax fraud. DOI's focus on equity means that DOI follows the facts and the law, regardless of politics, influence, or position. Through these investigations, DOI ensures that wrongdoers who steal taxpayer dollars, break the law or circumvent the rules for their own benefit are held accountable.Page 150 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Investigate possible corruption, fraud, waste and unethical conduct in City government.

Goal 1a Maintain the integrity of City agencies, employees, contract vendors and other recipients of City funds. During Fiscal 2021 DOI continued to promote the integrity and efficiency of City agencies, employees, vendors and recipients of City funds despite the ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to advance our mission, DOI employees quickly and successfully shifted into new and different work configurations as warranted by COVID-19\u2014from transitioning to working remotely early in 2020, to seamlessly moving to a mix of remote and on-site work schedules by the beginning of Fiscal 2021. COVID-19 has broadly affected DOI's operations, most notably in the difficulty of conducting witness interviews and field operations, delays in obtaining certain paper records from City agencies, and dramatic reductions in the operations of the criminal justice system due to partial court closures and limited availability of grand juries at both the state and federal level. In addition, the City's pandemic-induced fiscal crisis and hiring restrictions meant that DOI's investigative workforce was down by approximately 5-10 percent over the course of the fiscal year. All of these factors are reflected in DOI's statistics, including a dramatic decrease in our number of arrests, slight decreases in the number of cases we were able to open and close, and a drop in complaints received in Fiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020. DOI believes these are temporary decreases that will begin to change as the City continues to reopen and as DOI is able to replenish its workforce. Despite the serious obstacles presented by COVID-19, DOI continued to provide its vital services. Its commitment to investigate and remedy operational vulnerabilities and deficiencies, and prevent future waste in City agencies has led to a 56 percent increase in PPRs issued to agencies this fiscal year compared to Fiscal Year 2020. Of the 302 recommendations issued this fiscal year, 57 percent were accepted, which is DOI's evaluation of whether the agency has accepted the PPR, and 52 percent have been adopted or implemented by City agencies. 41 percent of PPRs are still pending, and therefore do not yet have an outcome. DOI believes that its ongoing outreach strategies, combined with what we hope will soon be a return to normal levels of City operations, will lead to an increase in awareness of the agency's mission among City employees and the general public, and as a result an increase in reports of corruption. In Fiscal 2021 the number of corruption-prevention and whistleblower lectures conducted by DOI decreased 79 percent due to COVID-19 health restrictions on in-person instruction. Where practical and technologically possible, DOI's Inspectors General did conduct video-based anti-corruption training lectures for certain agencies. DOI will resume and continue to build on the anti-corruption in-person lecture program as health and safety restrictions are lifted and more employees report to work in person. DOI works with the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) on its E-Learning Corruption Prevention Program, with DCAS providing technological and administrative support to deliver the program to employees. During Fiscal 2021, this program, which provides City workers with guidance about DOI and corruption prevention, remotely reached 25,028 City employees, a slight five percent decrease compared to the previous fiscal year. This small drop was due in part to technological hurdles that many agencies faced trying to make video and multimedia training available to employees working remotely. DOI identified a reduced need for integrity monitors during Fiscal 2021, resulting in a 17 percent decrease in the number of integrity monitoring agreements. The percentage of VENDEX checks of companies doing business with the City completed within 30 days increased by 12 percentage points compared to Fiscal 2020, exceeding targeted projections for the fiscal year.Page 152 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT Neutral * \u00ab Written policy and procedure recommendations (PPRs) issued to City agencies 514 2,071 573 193 307 300 300 Down * Written PPRs issued during previous fiscal years that have been accepted by City agencies (%) 94% 92% 85% 70% 61% 75% 75% Down Up - Written PPRs issued during previous fiscal years that have been implemented of those accepted by City agencies (%) 88% 90% 76% 56% 51% * * Down Up Written PPRs issued during previous fiscal years that are still pend - ing an outcome from City agencies (%) 21% 3% 11% 27% 37% * * Up * Written PPRs issued during previous fiscal years that have been rejected by City agencies (%) 5% 3% 4% 3% 2% * * Down * \u00ab Corruption prevention and whistleblower lectures conducted 477 389 449 318 67 400 400 Down Up Corruption prevention lecture e-learning attendees 18,561 25,068 33,539 26,298 25,028 * * Up * Integrity monitoring agreements 18 15 13 12 10 * * Down * Vendor name checks completed within 30 days (%) 98% 64% 80% 80% 92% Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 1b Improve the impact and effectiveness of investigations. DOI's strategy attacks corruption comprehensively by conducting thorough investigations that lead to arrests, recommendations that result in reforms, and preventive controls that improve the way the City operates and delivers services to all New Yorkers. This focus has led to positive results in several investigation-related indicators throughout the years. However, the ongoing restrictions and challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including limited in-person contact, the inability to conduct in-person witness interviews and obtain documents from City agencies, coupled with the dramatic effect of the pandemic on the criminal justice system, posed unique impediments to our investigations and led to reductions in several investigative categories. In Fiscal 2021, referrals for civil and administrative action decreased seven percent, while referrals for criminal prosecution decreased 36 percent and arrests decreased 49 percent. Despite these severe challenges, DOI adapted, and by focusing on what could be accomplished, DOI was able to maintain an average time to complete investigations at essentially the same level as the previous fiscal year. During the reporting period, financial recoveries to the City ordered/agreed increased six percent. Such orders are typically entered at the sentencing phase of a criminal case. Recoveries collected from previous orders as a result of DOI cases increased 26 percent.

Goal 2a Ensure that all background investigations and fingerprint checks are conducted in a timely manner. The background investigations unit has continued to meet and exceed all set targets. The average time to complete a background investigation increased slightly, primarily due to COVID-19 restrictions that affected the timing of fingerprinting and interviewing applicants and the ability to gather information from former employers and other relevant entities both in New York City and around the country. While the average time to complete a background investigation increased by 22 percent, the average time to close a background investigation was 107 days, still well below the 180 day target. Additionally, 1,879 backlogged background investigations were closed in Fiscal 2021, with only 2,720 backlogged background investigations remaining open from the original backlog of 6,500 investigations in the summer of 2019. In Fiscal 2021, DOI increased its capacity to process fingerprint checks for prospective childcare workers by modifying its workflow and upgrading tracking software. This allowed DOI to process over 14,100 childcare workers' fingerprints in Fiscal 2021, compared to 7,800 workers' fingerprints in Fiscal 2020. As DOI adjusted to these modifications, the overall average time measured across the entire fiscal year, to notify the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene of an arrest of currently employed childcare workers rose to four days compared to two days during the previous fiscal year. The average notification time was distorted by a handful of notifications that were substantially delayed as we shifted to these new procedures. The typical notification to DOHMH under these new procedures is made in under 48 hours. The fingerprint unit continues to adapt to the new processes and anticipates a continual reduction in the average notification time as well.

Malalis, Commissioner/ChairCITY COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS | Page 155 WHAT WE DO The New York City Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) enforces the New York City Human Rights Law (NYCHRL), educates the public about their rights and responsibilities under the NYCHRL and encourages positive community relations. The NYCHRL prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations and is one of the most comprehensive antidiscrimination laws in the country. CCHR meets this mission through its law enforcement, community outreach, media and policy efforts. CCHR's Law Enforcement Bureau (LEB) impartially investigates alleged violations of the law, negotiates and resolves matters, provides early intervention in cases of ongoing discrimination, retaliation, or the need for accommodations and, where appropriate, tries cases before an independent administrative law judge. Mediation services are offered through the independent Office of Mediation and Conflict Resolution. CCHR's Community Relations Bureau (CRB) educates the public on their rights by building deep community relationships through roundtable discussions, workshops, trainings and other gatherings. CRB also engages with the small business community, including chambers of commerce, merchant associations and business improvement districts to facilitate compliance with the NYCHRL. CCHR's Office of the Chair is the agency's policy, legislative, and adjudicatory hub. It convenes public hearings, publishes reports on key issues of the day, implements new legal protections, publishes legal guidance, issues final decisions and orders, and oversees media campaigns.FOCUS ON EQUITY In Fiscal 2021, the pandemic continued to disproportionately impact Indigenous Peoples, Black, Latinx and immigrant New Yorkers and exacerbate long-standing disparities, illustrating the vital importance of the protections of the City's Human Rights Law. During Fiscal 2021, the Commission continued to directly advance equity and focus on issues of particular importance to communities that have experienced interpersonal, institutional, and structural forms of discrimination and oppression. In November, CCHR announced Commission-initiated investigations into hospital policies and practices related to non-consensual drug testing of pregnant people and newborns to probe the existence of discriminatory racial bias. As part of its partnership with the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, CCHR launched a public awareness campaign in November by one of its two public artists-in-residence, Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya, titled \"I Still Believe in Our City,\" it focused on the vibrant resilience of Asian Pacific Islanders and Black New Yorkers in the face of racial injustice, and called for an end of xenophobia and COVID-19-related discrimination, harassment and bias. The second campaign, titled \"You Do It With Your Heart,\" is a multimedia series, amplified into an out- of-home and print advertising campaign by CCHR's other public artist-in-residence, Andre D. Wagner. It highlights the economic power of Black New Yorkers and the cultural significance of Black-owned businesses. The Commission also curated an art project for city youth aged 13-18, \"Amplify Youth Voices,\" inviting young people to submit artwork that explores social issues in their communities and links them to the broader context of justice and equity. CCHR further continued to advance its ground-breaking work on race discrimination on the basis of hair through rulemaking that codifies and clarifies protections related to hair textures and hairstyles, including the use of head coverings and hair lengths, which have often been associated with a particular race, ethnicity, culture or religion. CCHR also published proposed rules clarifying protections on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions, lactation accommodations and sexual and reproductive health decisions, and held a public hearing after notice and comment. CCHR was also part of the inaugural multi-agency cohort to participate in the City's Executive Order 45 Racial and Social Equity Program. In addition, CCHR staff took part in a series of workshops on equity analysis and planning organized by the EquityNYC team.Page 156 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Enforce the NYC Human Rights Law.

Goal 1aInvestigate, prosecute and resolve complaints of discrimination, discriminatory harassment, and bias- based profiling in a timely and efficient manner. In Fiscal 2021, CCHR's enforcement work focused on combating gender-based harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace, discrimination based on source of income, and disability discrimination, especially in the context of reasonable accommodations. This Fiscal Year, CCHR continued to efficiently resolve matters despite an increase in the number of complaints filed to 643 this Fiscal Year, which is 18% more than the 525 complaints filed last year. While facing ongoing challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic for the entire 12-month period of this fiscal year, agency staff closed 895 complaints, the third consecutive year that the agency closed more cases than were filed. The number of open complaints decreased for the second consecutive year\u2014dropping to 1,012 this year compared to 1,165 in Fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2021 marks the lowest number of open complaints since Fiscal 2015. In addition, CCHR reduced the average time cases remained open for the third consecutive year: the average time dropped to 427 days, an 18 percent decrease compared to Fiscal 2020, the lowest average open case time since Fiscal 2017. Through pre-complaint intervention work, CCHR was able resolve 217 matters without a complaint being filed, compared to 406 last year, likely due to the fact that this fiscal year represents the first fiscal year in which the entire year was affected by the pandemic. CCHR continued to dedicate resources to strategic enforcement of the NYCHRL through testing and other means. Testing is an investigative tool used to confirm whether potential employers, landlords, real estate brokers, restaurants, hospitals, stores, or other providers of public accommodations treat CCHR testers differently (or provide them with different information) because they belong to a protected class. CCHR conducted tests of 878 entities compared to last year's 1,424. As noted above, this decrease may be attributed to the fact that this fiscal year represents the first fiscal year in which the entire year was affected by the pandemic. The Office of Mediation and Conflict Resolution (OMCR) resolved 47 cases in Fiscal 2021 compared to 42 in Fiscal 2020, setting, for the fourth consecutive year, a record for the number of cases successfully closed, and accounting for an aggregate recovery (excluding non-monetary relief) of $2.1 million compared to $2.6 million in Fiscal 2020. The average time from the acceptance of a case by OMCR to its closure was 154 days, compared to 183 days in Fiscal 2020, a decrease of 29 days. CCHR obtained $9.7 million in compensatory damages and civil penalties, surpassing last Fiscal Year's total of $7.5 million, setting a new agency record. This marked the seventh consecutive year of increases, which was also a record. Finally, in June 2021, CCHR announced an historic conciliation agreement with a large multi-million dollar media corporation that imposed $1 million dollars in civil penalties (the largest penalty in CCHR's history), waived forced arbitration in agreements executed with the corporation's employees, talent, and contributors for any claims brought under the New York City Human Rights Law for a period of four years, created a hotline for sexual harassment complaints, and established monitoring by the Commission of sexual harassment training in the workplace.

Goal 2a Increase community awareness of the NYCHRL through know-your-rights presentations aimed at the general public; know-your-obligations presentations aimed at housing providers, employers and small businesses; and other initiatives. In Fiscal 2021, CCHR's outreach unit, the Community Relations Bureau, adapted longer-term strategies and innovative tools for community outreach to educate hard-to-reach communities using remote platforms, connecting with strategic partners, and focusing on virtual community-building tools as the pandemic continued to disrupt operations and disproportionately impact already vulnerable communities. Despite the challenges, CCHR interfaced with a record number of New Yorkers, reaching 102,121 people in Fiscal 2021, 2.2 percent more than in Fiscal 2020. This record was accomplished across 1,683 conferences, workshops, and trainings, an increase of 202 from 1,481 in Fiscal 2020. This increase can be linked to the declining requests for in-person conferences and the increased attendance for virtual events. CCHR partnered with elected officials, community-based organizations, and faith-based organizations to host \"Know Your Rights\" and \"Bystander Intervention\" trainings. The workshops, which were directly responsive to community requests, allowed CCHR to educate attendees on the differences between bias incidents and hate crimes, and the process that occurs when incidents are reported. The trainings reached 3,440 New Yorkers and were conducted in English, Mandarin, Korean, and Spanish. CCHR's Bias Response Team responded to 383 bias incidents, 84 fewer incidents than in Fiscal 2020. CCHR's Bias Response Unit also promoted community support and engagement, and organized a \"Day of Visibility,\" on April 2, 2021, in response to the brutal attack on Vilma Kari, a 65-year-old woman, in Hell's Kitchen. CCHR conducted a series of business outreach interactions using public artist-in-residence Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya's \"I Still Believe in the City\" posters to promote solidarity and awareness, while also highlighting the resiliency of New Yorkers. This effort involved staff interactions with 655 businesses.CITY COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS | Page 159 CCHR's commitment to dismantle anti-Black racism through dialogue, awareness, and bridge-building remained consistent during the pandemic. CCHR led specific events in an array of communities, including, \"Building Solidarity in NYC: Human Rights & the Shared Stories of Dominican & Haitian Communities\" to celebrate International Human Rights Day. CCHR hosted an event to honor and celebrate the second anniversary of the Commission's legal enforcement guidance on race discrimination on the basis of hair. \"To and 'Fro: The Journey to Honor Black Hair as an Act of Self Determination,\" featured discussions on the national movement to recognize hair discrimination as a form of race discrimination and the challenges and joys of wearing natural and protective hairstyles. In June 2021, in partnership with Weeksville Heritage Center, CCHR hosted \"Your Hair, Your Right,\" an event where public artist-in-residence Andre D. Wagner took portraits of attendees to celebrate hair as a form of self-expression and learn about the NYCHRL. CCHR also held a panel discussion entitled \"Stories from the Delivery Room: Health Equity, Pregnancy, and the Maternal Health Care of People of Color in Collaboration with Advancing Health Equity, Black Women's Blueprint, and Ancient Song Doula Services.\" In Fiscal 2021, Youth and School programming continued to expand. CCHR's Youth for Equity & Solidarity (YES) Council hosted our first youth symposium, entitled Youth for Equity and Solidarity Symposium: \"Our Rights, Our Future.\" Working with public artist-in-residence Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya, youth leaders launched a unique interactive art exhibit titled \"May We Know Our Own Strength,\" bringing attention to gender-based harassment and sexual assault.

OATH has two divisions responsible for adjudicating City matters: the OATH Trials Division and the OATH Hearings Division. The Trials Division adjudicates a wide range of issues that can be referred by any City agency, board or commission. Its caseload includes employee discipline and disability hearings for civil servants, Conflicts of Interest Board cases, proceedings related to the retention of seized vehicles by the police, City-issued license and regulatory enforcement, real estate, zoning and loft law violations, City contract disputes, paid sick day violations and/or fair workweek violations and human rights violations under the City Human Rights Law. Trials are conducted by Administrative Law Judges who are appointed to five- year terms. Hearings are conducted by Hearing Officers on summonses issued by 25 different City enforcement agencies for alleged violations of law or City rules. These summonses are issued by the Departments of Buildings, Sanitation, Environmental Protection, Consumer and Worker Protection, Health and Mental Hygiene and the Taxi and Limousine Commission, among others. OATH also has jurisdiction to hold hearings on summonses from certain non-City entities such as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. OATH also houses the Center for Creative Conflict Resolution, which provides mediation and restorative justice support to City government agencies, and the Administrative Judicial Institute, a resource center that provides training, continuing education, research and support services for the various administrative law judges and tribunals throughout New York City.FOCUS ON EQUITY During the COVID-19 pandemic, OATH remained fully operational, providing New Yorkers with access to justice by leveraging remote methods to appear for trials, hearings, settlement conferences, mediations, and Help Center sessions, in an effort to ensure that New Yorkers stayed safe and healthy while still being able to access their day in court. In Fiscal 2021, OATH launched a small business unit within its Help Center to assist small businesses that receive summonses to help ensure that they were also provided with information about and given the opportunity to take advantage of benefits offered by the City's Department of Small Business Services. Recognizing that respondents may be transient during the pandemic and may not be receiving mail promptly, OATH launched a text message system to allow respondents to get reminders of their upcoming hearings along with instructions on what they must do in order to have their remote hearing. Finally, in Fiscal 2021, OATH's Center for Creative Conflict Resolution launched its first public-facing program, Mediating Establishment and Neighborhood Disputes (MEND) NYC, a program meant to bring free mediation and conflict resolution services to New Yorkers facing quality of life issues from neighboring businesses in the hospitality industry such as restaurants and bars. OATH later expanded MEND NYC to provide mediation services to small businesses who were experiencing issues with their commercial landlords such as lease negotiations. Free mediation provides a way to address quality of life issues experienced by New Yorkers while simultaneously reducing the likelihood that a business gets inspected by enforcement agencies and issued a summons with the potential of burdening a neighborhood business with hefty fines.

Goal 1a Hear cases promptly and issue timely and fair decisions at the OATH Trials Division. Despite the pandemic, there were 104 more petitions filed at the OATH Trials Division in Fiscal 2021 as compared to the previous year. The OATH Trials Division successfully managed a shift to conducting settlement conferences and trials by video. While this contributed to an increase in the average time from the close of record to decision issuance, from 5.46 days in Fiscal 2020 to 8.85 days in Fiscal 2021, the Trials Division was nonetheless able to close more cases in FY21 than it did in the prior year. With the addition of newly appointed Administrative Law Judges (ALJ), the Trials Division was able to keep its case load per judge steady with each ALJ processing 185 cases on average in Fiscal 2021 compared with an average of 186 cases per ALJ the year before.

Goal 2a Hear cases promptly and issue timely and fair decisions at the OATH Hearings Division. In Fiscal 2021, the total number of summonses received from City enforcement agencies by the OATH Hearings Division decreased by 23 percent compared to the year before. OATH remained operational during the pandemic by adjudicating all cases remotely either by having a hearing with the parties by phone or, in eligible cases, with the respondent submitting their defense in writing either online or by mail. In Fiscal 2021, the number of OATH's hearings that were conducted by phone increased by 1,350 percent compared to Fiscal 2020. Despite the decrease in summonses received, the OATH Help Center conducted nearly the same amount of Help Sessions during Fiscal 2021 as they did in Fiscal Year 2020, with nearly all the 33,834 Help Sessions conducted remotely in Fiscal 2021.

On February 18, 2021, Mayor de Blasio signed Executive Order 63 of 2021, establishing the Center for Creative Conflict Resolution and directing the creation of an Advisory Board on Creative Conflict Resolution. The Center for Creative Conflict Resolution used videoconferencing technology to remain operational during the pandemic in Fiscal 2021. This allowed the small staff at the Center to double its conflict resolution trainings for City personnel and more than triple the number of restorative circles and group facilitations and City personnel consultations it provided in Fiscal 2021 as compared to the year before. In Fiscal 2021, for the first time ever, the Center expanded its services to include mediations for members of the public who are in conflict.

Genel, Commissioner/ChairBUSINESS INTEGRITY COMMISSION | Page 167 WHAT WE DO The Business Integrity Commission (BIC) regulates and monitors the trade waste hauling industry and the wholesalers and businesses operating in the City's public wholesale markets, and ensures the integrity of businesses in these industries. Through vigorous background investigations of license and registration applications, the establishment of standards for services and conduct of business, criminal, and regulatory investigations, BIC carries out its mandate to remove and prevent the infiltration of organized crime and other forms of corruption into these regulated businesses and industries. BIC protects New York City consumers by seeking to ensure that businesses in certain industries and markets act in an honest manner. By fostering an open marketplace, BIC protects the businesses in those industries and markets from unfair competition. BIC also regulates safety, and particularly traffic safety, in the trade waste industry. BIC also has the authority to regulate the shipboard gambling industry, although that industry currently does not operate in New York City.FOCUS ON EQUITY The core mission of the Business Integrity Commission includes eliminating organized crime and other forms of corruption from the commercial trade waste hauling industry and the public wholesale markets. By fostering an open marketplace, BIC seeks to ensure that the regulated businesses are able to compete fairly and that the industries are free from the criminal activity that once dominated them. By seeking to ensure businesses in the regulated industries operate with good character, honesty, and integrity, BIC helps to maintain a fair marketplace for all businesses that have contact and work with our regulated companies. In addition, BIC regulates traffic safety in the trade waste industry through development of relevant rules (one set of which went into effect in August 2021), vigorous enforcement of those rules, and outreach to the industry. BIC is also working closely with the Department of Sanitation (DSNY) on implementing the Commercial Waste Zones program, which will reduce trade waste truck traffic, thus improving public safety on New York City streets. Page 168 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Regulate the City's commercial waste hauling industry.

Goal 1a Ensure that businesses in the commercial waste hauling industry abide by the law. Throughout the pandemic, BIC continued overall enforcement efforts including a focus on safety resulting in a 17% increase of violations issued to illegally operating private waste haulers in Fiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020. In Fiscal 2021, the number of violations issued to legally operating private waste haulers decreased by 24% compared to Fiscal 2020. Part of this decrease was due to the fact that there were significantly fewer violations of the trade waste vehicle emissions law, which in turn is due to a high compliance rate (higher than 99% of vehicles covered by the law by the end of Fiscal 2021).

Several compounding issues impacted BIC's ability to meet certain goals in Fiscal 2021. The most significant issue pertains to new initiatives and expanding responsibilities (e.g., promulgation of rules governing traffic safety and micro-haulers which required the development of a new micro-hauler application, various forms, and the implementation of new internal processes) drawing upon existing BIC resources, without the addition of related staff, combined with a pre-COVID-19 staffing shortage which continues into Fiscal 2022. The disruption of the renewal applications' cycle due to COVID-19 emergency executive orders that suspended expiration of BIC licenses and registrations was another factor impacting license and registration application processing. These extensions resulted in out-of-cycle renewal application submissions during Fiscal 2021 (and into Fiscal 2022), which greatly impacted the processing of license and registration applications. Due to these existing and ongoing issues, the number of waste hauling applications pending increased from 639 in Fiscal 2020 to 1094 in Fiscal 2021. The average time to approve new and renewal waste hauling applications increased by 45%. While the number of renewal waste hauling applications approved decreased by 57%, the number of new waste hauling applications approved decreased by 24%. This was due to BIC's continued effort to prioritize new waste hauling applications. New applicants cannot operate unless their applications are approved, whereas renewal applicants may continue to operate while their applications are under review.

As previously noted, these increases are attributed to compounding issues of additional new and expanded responsibilities resulting in existing staffing resources being refocused and overburdened.

The Department operates 59 district garages and manages a fleet of more than 2,000 collection trucks, 450 mechanical brooms and 711 large and small salt-spreaders. The Department clears litter, snow and ice from approximately 6,000 miles of City streets, removes debris from vacant lots, and clears abandoned vehicles from City streets.FOCUS ON EQUITY DSNY is committed to providing high-quality, responsive waste management, street cleaning and snow removal services to all New Yorkers. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have continued our focus on communities that have disproportionately suffered from racial injustice and the effects of COVID-19, particularly in parts of the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn. The Department is also implementing policies to reduce the impacts of the commercial waste industry on historically overburdened neighborhoods in the South Bronx, North Brooklyn and Jamaica, Queens. In September 2020, DSNY completed the implementation of transfer station permit reductions under Local Law 152, eliminating more than 10,000 tons of permitted waste transfer capacity in four historically overburdened districts. In addition, DSNY is working to implement Commercial Waste Zones, which will foster a safe and efficient waste collection system that provides low-cost, high-quality service to New York City businesses, while simultaneously advancing the City's zero waste goals. Commercial waste zones will help to reduce truck traffic from waste hauling and the negative environmental impacts such traffic generates by more than 50 percent, improving public safety and enhancing quality of life in every neighborhood in NYC. DSNY will release the second part of a two-part RFP in 2021.Page 176 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Clean streets, sidewalks and vacant lots.

Streets rated acceptably clean decreased 2.7 percent and sidewalks rated acceptably clean increased 0.8 percent from Fiscal Year 2020 to Fiscal Year 2021. The decrease in street rated acceptably clean could be attributed to the reduction in litter basket and mechanical broom service related to the financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department increased litter basket truck allocations in September 2020 and March 2021, and litter basket truck allocations are now at or above historical averages. The increase in sidewalks rated acceptably clean is notable, despite a decrease in the number of violations issued for dirty sidewalks, which decreased from 56,844 in Fiscal Year 2020 to 42,694 in Fiscal Year 2021. The Department used enforcement discretion throughout much of the COVID-19 pandemic to focus only on the most egregious sanitation conditions. In addition, the Department has created the Precision Cleaning Initiative to address chronic litter conditions, illegal dumping and other problem areas. The Department's Bureau Community Affairs Office has also more than doubled the number of community cleanup events hosted in partnership with elected officials and community partners. The number of violations issued for illegal postings decreased substantially for Fiscal Year 2021 to 2,849 (down 38.0 percent) from last year, as the Department reallocated some enforcement resources for COVID-19 response.

The number of vacant lot cleaning requests increased slightly from 3,008 to 3,015 from Fiscal Year 2020 to Fiscal Year 2021, respectively. Lots cleaned during Fiscal Year 2021 were 1,231, a decrease of 60.2 percent from Fiscal Year 2020 and the amount of other non-lot locations cleaned is 688, an increase in 244 percent from last year. The decrease in lots cleaned can be attributed to the shift of uniform staff to backfill staff shortages in core operation such as refuse and recycling collection. Also, lot cleaning staff was redeployed last summer to assist in Tropical Storm Isaias cleanup and was utilized during this winter active storm season.

DPR's thousands of public programs include free Shape Up NYC fitness classes, Kids in Motion children's programing, swimming lessons and Urban Park Rangers' nature education. Through programs like Parks Without Borders, DPR is bringing innovative design to sites across the City. DPR's capital program strengthens the City's infrastructure by developing and improving parks, playgrounds, pools and recreational facilities.FOCUS ON EQUITY In the wake of the 2020 social movement sparked by George Floyd's death, the Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) has been working to further its commitment to equity and inclusion. To support the Agency's more than 6,000 staff, DPR launched a series of \"Reflections On\" listening sessions and is planning programming to help address staff trauma and other effects of systemic racism. The Agency is also devising a strategic plan that advances its commitment to ensuring a diverse workforce and fairness around recruitment and promotional opportunities within. Additionally, the Agency launched an internal committee to review park names. To date, DPR has re/named 28 park spaces for the Black experience in New York City, memorializing that which is locally, nationally, historically relevant. The newly named spaces represent educators, Civil Rights leaders, pioneers in the LGBTQ+ community, novelists, playwrights, abolitionists and more. On a parallel path, DPR is ensuring that the benefits of accessible, high-quality open space reach every community in New York City. DPR works toward this goal through its Framework for an Equitable Future, a comprehensive series of immediate steps and long-term initiatives to support equitable park development and sustainable service improvements. In August 2016, DPR announced a $150 million Mayoral investment at five large parks under the Anchor Parks initiative to upgrade infrastructure and improve amenities that are heavily used in these bigger parks, such as soccer fields, comfort stations, running tracks and hiking trails. Each park was selected based on three factors: historical underinvestment; a large surrounding population; and potential for park development. The framework also supports the ongoing $318 million Mayoral-funded Community Parks Initiative, which brings complete, community-informed reconstruction to 67 historically underserved neighborhood parks. As of July 2021, DPR has revitalized 60 Community Parks Initiative sites, completed seven Parks Without Borders showcase projects, and fully completed one Anchor Parks project with two more nearing completion. All of DPR's efforts build on the core principles of good park development: targeted capital investment; strong community and public-private partnerships; innovative programming; and efficient and effective maintenance. Interconnection among each of these areas is essential to the growth of a truly 21st century park system.Page 184 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Manage the City's parks and recreation facilities.

Goal 1a Ensure that all parks and playgrounds are clean and in good condition. During the beginning of Fiscal 2021, COVID-19 related budget considerations impacted maintenance operations and lead to approximately 1,700 fewer seasonal maintenance staff than the prior year. Despite these challenges, DPR worked tirelessly to ensure that parks remained clean and safe for all New Yorkers. This effort, coupled with the reinstatement of expected seasonal funding during the end of Fiscal 2021, resulted in the percent of parks rated acceptable for overall condition and cleanliness surpassing targets after falling short during the Preliminary Mayor's Management Report period. Play equipment and safety surfaces rated acceptable met or exceeded an aggressive 95 percent target for the second year in a row due to a sustained focus on treating these important park features with a high standard of care. For the fourth year in a row, in-service rates for drinking fountains and spray showers met or exceeded target. Decreased staffing contributed to comfort station in-service rates falling three percent, missing the target at 91 percent.

Total Summonses issued increased by 24 percent, returning to expected levels after a five-year low of 16,929 summonses in Fiscal 2020 when Parks Enforcement Patrol prioritized social distancing education and enforcement over issuing traditional summons during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Fiscal 2021, as the city began to reopen, the prevalence of Illegal parking in and around parks lead to a 50 percent increase in parking violation summonses. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is principally responsible for ensuring public safety throughout the City, including parks. DPR is committed to assisting NYPD in this effort to provide a positive and safe experience for all park visitors.

Goal 2a Maintain and preserve trees under DPR stewardship. DPR pruned 18,900 trees through its block pruning program, a 68 percent decrease from last year. Due to COVID-19 related budget considerations, block pruning contracts were suspended in July and August 2020 and resumed in a limited capacity for the remainder of Fiscal 2021. Funding has been restored for Fiscal 2022 with a target of 65,000 trees pruned. The total number of trees removed remains relatively unchanged. However, in August 2020 damage from Tropical Storm Isaias resulted in the removal of 3,774 trees, which was greater than all tree removals performed during the first four months of the previous fiscal year combined (3,385). Tree inspections decreased by 37 percent. The decrease was driven by over 65,000 fewer inspections related to block pruning work as contacts were suspended and later reduced. However, the mobilization of tree inspectors after Tropical Storm Isaias resulted in nearly 20,000 tree inspections in the month of August alone.

Examples of completed projects include improvements to the Fountain of the Fairs at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens and the track and field at Betsy Head Park in Brooklyn. At Flushing Meadows Corona Park, $6.8 million in Mayoral funding transformed the Reflecting Pool into an interactive mist garden. Specialized jets were installed to create a cooling cloud that refreshes visitors on summer days. Responsive to community input, the pool retains its 1964 imprint with the original design and dimensions. Additional site upgrades include new seating, a drinking fountain, updated plumbing and infrastructure, and new pavement designed to reflect the Art Deco style of 1930s New York. At Betsy Head Park, an $18.2 million Mayoral funded Anchor Parks project reconstructed the southern portion of the park. Completed three months ahead of schedule, improvements include a new synthetic turf field, rubberized track, sports courts, seating areas, and an adult fitness area with exercise equipment.

DPR opened a limited number of recreation centers in mid-June and plans to open all available centers and begin enrolling new members in early Fiscal 2022. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, non-recreation center programing was significantly reduced resulting in an attendance decrease of over 577,000. In addition to serving as social distancing ambassadors, Recreation, Media Education, Aquatics, and Urban Park Ranger staff conducted limited, safely distanced outdoor programing while introducing a suite of new digital programming through Parks@Home .

The Fiscal 2021 target for 'Capital projects completed' was misprinted in the Fiscal 2021 Preliminary Mayor's Management Report. The correct target, 132, appeared in the Fiscal 2020 Mayor's Management Report. The Fiscal 2022 target for 'Capital projects completed' was reduced to 115 from 132 in Fiscal 2021. Capital projects are planned far in advanced and vary significantly in size, cost, and expected time to completion. Targets for 'Capital projects completed' account for these factors and reflect anticipated project completions. 'Attendance at historic house museums' in Fiscal 2020 was adjusted up to 510,492 from 510,133 after a review of historical data. Attendance for programing normally conducted inside recreation centers that was moved outdoors due to closures was included in the 'Total attendance at non-recreation center programs' indicator. Youth and family programming of this type had attendance of 11,938 while adult programing attendance equaled 1,901, for a total of 13,839 in Fiscal 2021. During Fiscal 2021, Mitchell J. Silver was the Commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation. Margaret Nelson has served as Acting Commissioner since August 2021. Equity NYC indicators are identified with a burst ( ).

Through its Cultural Development Fund (CDF), the agency utilizes a democratic, peer panel review process to distribute grants to over 1,000 applicants that represent the extraordinary cultural breadth of New York City and share a commitment to public service and public participation. DCLA also administers several funding initiatives on behalf of the New York City Council that provide support for arts and cultural projects across the City, including Cultural After School Adventures (CASA), the Cultural Immigrant Initiative, Coalition of Theaters of Color, Anti-Gun Violence Initiative, and the SU-CASA creative aging program. DCLA also works with the 34 members of the Cultural Institutions Group to ensure funding resources to our partners at these much-heralded organizations that are both large and small. DCLA also continued to fund CUNY Cultural Corps, one of the agency's signature workforce development programs that creates opportunities for CUNY students to work in the City's cultural sector. The agency continued to administer its Language Access and Disability Forward Fund, two competitive grant opportunities designed to support more accessible cultural programming citywide. Fiscal 2020 was an historic year for moving the needle on cultural funding equity, with the establishment of the first new member of the CIG in more than twenty years: The Weeksville Heritage Center joined the CIG as its 34th member, and the first in the Group whose mission is to document, preserve and interpret the history of African Americans, in Weeksville, Brooklyn and beyond. Fiscal Year 2020 also marked the first full year of implementation of the Cultural Institutions Group (CIG)'s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) plans. These plans, among the first of their kind in the cultural sector, put forward strategies and policies for addressing the lack of diversity within individual institutions' staffs and boards and fostering more equitable and inclusive workplace environments. Areas incorporated into every plan included vision, process, hiring, recruitment, retention, promotion, diverse and equitable leadership, and inclusive organizational culture. After submission of the plans, DCLA conducted a rigorous review process and coordinated with each CIG member to finalize its plan. These plans are living documents, and CIG members are required to report on progress annually to DCLA. In addition, the agency began a long-term effort to audit its own internal grantmaking processes with the help of an MWBE consultancy firm. DCLA has initiated this audit with ultimate goal of making reforms that will improve access to City funds and ensure their more equitable distribution. WHAT WE DO The Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA) provides financial support and technical assistance to the City's cultural community, including 34 City-owned institutions that comprise the Cultural Institutions Group (CIG) and over 1,000 other cultural nonprofit organizations serving constituencies in all boroughs of the City. DCLA manages a significant portfolio of cultural capital projects; provides donated materials for arts programs to public schools, cultural and social service groups; and also commissions works of public art for City-funded construction projects.Page 194 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Provide financial support to the City's non-profit arts and cultural sector for operations, programs and activities.

Goal 1a Process grant payments promptly. In Fiscal 2021 DCLA issued initial grant payments through the Cultural Development Fund (CDF) in an average of 24.4 days compared to 11.9 days in Fiscal 2020. This increase is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which required staff to adapt all review and payment approval procedures to working remotely, while continuing a transition from a paper-based to a digital process. An increased volume of CDF grants and a high volume of non-CDF City Council initiative grants and payments required additional administration and processing, impacting the current capacity of the program services and finance units compared to the prior year. Further factors contributing to the lengthened grant payment schedule include City budgetary restrictions that resulted in a delay in notification of Fiscal 2021 CDF awards, and the need for pandemic- related updates to organizations' scope of services prior to issuing grant agreements. The time to issue final CDF payments is to be determined as those payments have not yet been processed. The CIG Unit's goal is to issue payments by the fifth day of the each month. In Fiscal 2021, staff vacancies in the CIG unit and additional reporting requirements implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact performance. Zero operating support payments to the City's Cultural Institutions Group (CIG) were made within the five-day performance standard in Fiscal 2021 compared to 27 percent of operating support payments made within the five-day performance standard during Fiscal 2020. While there were significant delays in making timely payments, DCLA awarded more than $174.2 million in financial support to the cultural community including: $102.3 million in operating support to CIG (including $32.1 million in energy subsidies) $45.4 million in program support to 1108 organizations $24.5 million to organizations designated through City Council initiatives including Cultural After School Adventures, the Coalition of Theaters of Color Initiative, the Cultural Immigrant Initiative, SU-CASA and an Anti- Gun Violence Initiative. The Department also awarded $2 million in other funding, including non-CIG energy grants.

Planned projects the Capital Unit initiated decreased to 81 percent in Fiscal 2021, still surpassing the target of 66 percent, but down from 86 percent in Fiscal 2020.

Due to the pandemic that forced the closure of MFTA on March 19, 2020 and severely limited staff time at the warehouse, transaction processing was deprioritized temporarily since staff could not weigh, value and enter items into the computer system. Since staff has returned to the warehouse on a limited but more consistent schedule since October 19th, 2020 transaction processing has resumed in earnest and numbers are reflecting the increased activity in the warehouse. Since October 2020, MFTA has pivoted from in person shopping to curbside pickup for schools, arts organizations and social service and social justice organizations. In July, MFTA's truck was filled with supplies and visited each of the five boroughs to reach communities that have a longer commute to our location in Long Island City, Queens.

Hatch, CommissionerDEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND WORKER PROTECTION | Page 199 WHAT WE DO The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) protects and enhances the daily economic lives of New Yorkers to help create thriving communities. DCWP licenses more than 59,000 businesses in more than 50 industries. The agency strives to create a culture of compliance in the marketplace by performing onsite inspections of businesses and enforcing license regulations, weights and measures regulations and the NYC Consumer Protection Law. DCWP also educates street vendors and responds to complaints about general vendors and mobile food vendors by conducting inspections. Through its Office of Labor Policy & Standards (OLPS), the Agency enforces various workplace laws, including Paid Safe and Sick Leave, Fair Workweek, and protections for contract workers under the Freelance Isn't Free law, by investigating complaints, conducting proactive investigations and recovering restitution for workers. DCWP's Office of Financial Empowerment (OFE) focuses on initiatives that educate, empower and protect residents and neighborhoods with low incomes so they can improve their financial health and build assets by providing free financial counseling and coaching at the NYC Financial Empowerment Centers, increasing access to safe and affordable financial products and services, and encouraging the use of NYC Free Tax Prep, which helps eligible New Yorkers file their taxes for free and claim valuable tax credits.FOCUS ON EQUITY DCWP's commitment to a fair and equitable marketplace begins with consumer advocacy, business education and transparency. As part of its consumer advocacy, DCWP continues to coordinate work across the agency and use a multi-pronged approach, including enforcement, legislation and education for maximum impact. To help prevent consumer harm and improve the financial health of New Yorkers with low incomes, DCWP's Office of Financial Empowerment provides financial counseling and coaching, helps with debt reduction, and offers free tax preparation. DCWP has also increased its outreach efforts to educate businesses about their obligations to workers in addition to consumers. Through DCWP's Office of Labor Policy & Standards, New York City employees and employers are informed about the workplace laws the Agency enforces, including Paid Safe and Sick Leave, Fair Workweek, and freelance contract worker protections to ensure workers get the protections to which they are entitled.Page 200 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Protect and advocate for consumers.

The number of docketed complaints decreased by roughly 0.5 percent, from 2,166 to 2,155 during Fiscal 2021, while the number of completed mediations also remained steady, decreasing by just six cases, from 2,098 to 2,092. The percent of complaints processed within 28 days dropped from 54 percent to 52 percent, a decrease of two percentage points from the previous year while more than 99 percent of all complaints were processed within 90 days. The median number of days to resolve complaints increased from 27 to 28 days, while the percent of complaints resolved to the mutual satisfaction of both parties dropped slightly, from 61 percent to 57 percent.

DCWP's enforcement division conducted 36,298 inspections during Fiscal 2021, a decrease of 5,407, or 13 percent, compared to Fiscal 2020. This is due to the fact that all of Fiscal 2021 occurred under COVID-19 pandemic conditions, which limited the number of inspections DCWP was able to conduct. There was also a dramatic shift in enforcement priorities, most notably a marked increase in Business Education inspections which are counted as part of DCWP's business outreach and not under enforcement and compliance. Another area of enforcement dramatically impacted by COVID-19 restrictions was the Tobacco Program, which conducted 4,542 inspections, 6,619 (59 percent) fewer than Fiscal 2020. This decrease was due to DCWP being unable to conduct under-age inspections due to the risks involved in conducting inspections with minors. Compliance with tobacco packaging and pricing regulations decreased from 96 percent to 93 percent, while compliance with regulations regarding flavored tobacco products decreased from 97 percent to 80 percent. The total number of summonses issued for all inspection types decreased in Fiscal 2021 due to redirected resources and enforcement policy changes resulting from COVID-19. Fewer inspections translate to fewer summonses.Page 202 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT Among the other key compliance indicators, compliance with the requirement for certain businesses to have a DCWP-issued license increased by seven percentage points, from 90 percent to 97 percent, which is largely attributable to the suspension of license renewal requirements during COVID-19 restrictions. Licensees' compliance with licensing law decreased slightly, from 86 percent to 82 percent while compliance with consumer protection law increased substantially, from 86 percent to 95 percent. The compliance rate for retail gasoline pumps remained steady at 99 percent, and the compliance rate for fuel trucks increased from 76 percent to 81 percent during Fiscal 2021.

Goal 2a Ensure that business licensing is efficient. DCWP averaged eight days to approve more than 20,000 basic license applications and renewals during Fiscal 2021, a five-day increase in processing time from the previous year. The change can be attributed to some small business friendly practices instituted by DCWP in response to the challenges presented by COVID-19, including the acceptance of incomplete applications and allowing applicants additional time to meet licensing requirements such as obtaining documents from other government agencies. Emergency Executive Order 131 of 2020, Section 2, suspended the requirement to renew licenses during the declared state of emergency which provided many applicants additional time to fulfil their license renewal requirements. To maintain a socially distanced work environment, applicants with pre-scheduled appointments had their paperwork processed in-person with reduced staffing levels. One major operational shift, however, was the near doubling of the percent of applications received online, from 23 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 45 percent in Fiscal 2021. The average wait time for consumers visiting walk-in services doubled in Fiscal 2021, from five to ten minutes, while still well within the target wait time of 15 minutes. This change is a direct result of no in-person services for several months during Fiscal 2021, the acceptance of incomplete license and renewal applications requiring additional explanations and service time for each applicant and the limited staffing for back-office operations due to social distancing requirements.

In Fiscal 2021, DCWP educated 16,925 businesses through violation-free business education inspections, special events and trainings, inspections that resulted in warnings but no violations, and Live Chat for Businesses , representing a one percent increase from the previous year. The Visiting Inspector Program conducted 420 (14 percent) more Business Education inspections than in Fiscal 2020, while direct live chats with businesses increased by 1,839, or 42 percent. This number does not include more than 14,500 business visits conducted by DCWP inspectors as part of City Hall's multi-agency business re-opening outreach and inspection initiative, intended to support and educate businesses about public health requirements and their obligations to adhere to New York State COVID-19 regulations and best practices.

Goal 3a Help residents with low incomes achieve financial stability. Through its Office of Financial Empowerment (OFE), DCWP continued to focus on initiatives that support New Yorkers and communities with low incomes in building assets and improving their financial health. The greatest challenge to fulfilling OFE's mission was the need to rapidly adapt from in-person to remote sessions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This presented some operational challenges including time to gather documents from clients and the need for new tools to support New Yorkers, but DCWP's financial counseling service providers rose to the challenge and continued its legacy of delivering unparalleled service. During Fiscal 2021 DCWP provided financial counseling to 6,901 clients, which was virtually unchanged from the previous year. Despite the protracted financial hardships experienced by many during Fiscal 2021, the percent of clients achieving measurable success remained consistent at 21 percent. The cumulative amount of debt reduced by OFE clients increased by seven percent, to $85.06 million, and the cumulative amount of increased savings rose by 27 percent, to $9.98 million. There were 73,701 returns filed by the NYC Free Tax Prep program during Fiscal 2021, a 10 percent increase from the previous year. Returns are still well below pre-pandemic levels, but DCWP expects levels to revert closer to normal if full- scale in-person services resume in Fiscal 2022. As New York City continues to recover from the impact of COVID-19 and businesses reopen, OFE is taking steps to ensure that its critical services are available to help New Yorkers navigate their finances and access city, state and federal resources. OFE expects to see the number of clients served, the number of New Yorkers achieving measurable improvements in their financial health and the number of returns filed increase over the coming years.

Goal 4a Investigate complaints in a timely manner to ensure employers' compliance with the Paid Safe and Sick Leave Law. The Paid Safe and Sick Leave Law is enforced by the Office of Labor Policy & Standards (OLPS), which was established at DCWP in May 2016. Because of DCWP's enforcement efforts, employees have become entitled to restitution totaling more than $10.3 million. In Fiscal 2021, the number of complaints received decreased by nearly a third, from 263 to 178. This could be due to any number of factors related to the impact COVID-19 has had on workers, including workers being laid-off or not working in person, or an increased focus on by workers on other job-related issues such as wage payment and unemployment DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND WORKER PROTECTION | Page 205 insurance. The number of cases closed decreased by 16 percent, from 220 to 184. The amount of employee restitution assessed decreased by 48 percent, from $1.76 million to $924 thousand. While there is no direct correlation between the number of complaints and the amount of restitution employees are owed, these decreases may be attributable to the substantial decline in the number of cases during Fiscal 2021. The average number of days required to complete investigations increased by 25 percent, from 241 days in Fiscal 2020 to 302 days in Fiscal 2021, an increase driven by an expanding enforcement mandate and more complicated cases.

The Freelance Isn't Free Law guarantees freelancers' rights to written contracts and prompt payment in full and strengthens their ability to file claims in civil court. OLPS assists freelancers in exercising these rights through its Navigation Program. This includes assistance with specific complaints as well as provision of general information about Freelancers' rights and the resources available to enforce them. In Fiscal 2021, the number of inquiries received decreased by 37 percent, from 370 to 233. The decrease in inquiries may be due in part to COVID-19 and its impact on businesses' ability to engage freelance services. The number of complaints received and addressed also decreased substantially, from 619 in Fiscal 2020 to 277 in Fiscal 2021, or 55 percent. Accordingly, there was a 40 percent decrease in the amount of money recovered by freelancers engaging in DCWP's court navigation support. It is important to note the amount recovered is collected through self-reporting by freelance workers during follow-up after their case has closed and is not necessarily complete.

Tisch, Commissioner311 CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER | Page 209 NYCWHAT WE DO The 311 Customer Service Center delivers fast and easy access to government services and information to all New Yorkers. NYC 311 can be reached via the call center, 311 Online, 311 Mobile App, 311 Facebook, 311 on Twitter, text messaging at 311-NYC (692) and 311 TTY at (212) 504-4115. Information and assistance are also accessible by Skyping \"NYC311\" or by using a video relay service at (212) NEW-YORK (212-639-9675). NYC 311's services are available in more than 180 languages, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. FOCUS ON EQUITY NYC 311 is committed to equitably serving the public interest of all New York City residents, business owners and visitors. With so many New Yorkers accessing government resources through 311, its work is inherently tied to fair and transparent service delivery, particularly for non-English speakers, who it aims to serve in their preferred language. Historically underserved communities rely on 311 for support and this has never been truer than during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 related inquiries to 311 (requesting meals, information on medical care, testing, remote learning devices, and small business loans, etc.) remained top drivers of its call volume during Fiscal 2021. To ensure that 311 provided prompt service to underserved communities in a time of crisis, 311 continued its expanded operations, which were done at the start of the pandemic: additional call centers; increased number of surge call takers; prioritized hiring of Spanish-speaking call takers; and express lanes at the call center to prioritize COVID-19 related requests.Page 210 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Provide public access to City government. Goal 1a Increase public access to government services and information.311 CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER | Page 211 HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 SERVICE 1Provide public access to City government. Goal 1a Increase public access to government services and information. In Fiscal 2021, 311 received more than 21.7 million calls, an 11 percent increase compared to Fiscal 2019 (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) and a one percent increase compared to Fiscal 2020. Given that Fiscal 2020 had been an increase of 10 percent compared to Fiscal 2019, this means that Fiscal 2021 was another busy year for 311. Spanish calls decreased by 28 percent and calls in languages other than English or Spanish increased by 38 percent. Text contacts decreased by 16 percent. For a second fiscal year, volume at 311 was driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, including requests for assistance with meals, access to healthcare (including vaccines), and information on return to work and reopening small businesses. 311 also fielded a large number of calls pertaining to the 2020 general election, Tropical Storm Isaias, and student transport. Efficiencies implemented last year to ease callers navigation of 311, such as \"express lanes\" for coronavirus- related calls and GetFood inquiries, remained in place due to demand. Despite receiving more calls than the previous fiscal year, 311 was able to reduce average wait times by 37 percent during peak hours and 64 percent outside of peak hours.

TLC licenses and regulates New York City's medallion (yellow) taxicabs, vehicles (app- based services, Boro Taxis, community- based liveries, and luxury limousines), commuter vans and paratransit vehicles. In response to the increasing food and health insecurities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the City created the GetFoodNYC and the In- Home COVID-19 Vaccine (Vaccine Program) programs. GetFoodNYC provides food to New Yorkers in need and used TLC-licensed drivers to deliver meals to individuals who could not safely leave their homes during the early days of the pandemic. The Vaccine Program assigned TLC- licensed drivers to transport medical personnel to administer vaccines to individuals who may be homebound, seniors over the age of 75, and/or people with disabilities. Drivers who were significantly impacted due to the pandemic were able to generate income through these programs. For GetFoodNYC, TLC partnered with DSNY, NYCEM, DoITT, and Parks to establish driver enrollment and payment systems, develop protocols for food distribution sites, and set up electronic shift reservations, route assignments, and turn-by-turn directions. The program ended in October 2020 with 9,591 TLC-licensed drivers who worked a total of 732,442 routes, earned $39,515,994 and delivered 65,977,119 meals across the city. For the Vaccine Program, TLC partnered with DSNY and FDNY to transport medical personnel, enroll and assign drivers to work shifts, assign routes, and disburse payments to the drivers. The program ended in April 2021 with a total of 67 TLC-licensed drivers who earned $286,230 and delivered 6,400 vaccines across the city.FOCUS ON EQUITY Increasing accessible and equitable service is a top priority for TLC. In January 2021, TLC launched new hands-on training for its Passenger Assistance and Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle Training courses. The course has been a requirement for Yellow Taxi Drivers since 2011 and For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) Drivers since 2015. In Calendar 2019, TLC created new curricula to reflect the needs of passengers with disabilities and, in Calendar 2020, TLC conducted an application process for all existing education providers to reapply for authorization to ensure compliance with the new standards. The new TLC Passenger Assistance and Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle Training course provides drivers with the tools they need to excel at their jobs and serve all New Yorkers. The course includes in-vehicle training where TLC-licensed Drivers can practice before they are expected to perform the process professionally. The course is divided into six different modules, covering in-depth information about the disability community, disability etiquette and the unique role drivers play in providing equitable transit for New York City residents and visitors. TLC also created new resources for Drivers, including an award-winning video and a how-to guide that illustrates the steps Drivers must follow during the wheelchair securement process. In 2018, TLC adopted rules to protect Driver earnings. As of February 2019, high- volume For-Hire Services (Uber, Lyft, and Via) are required to pay drivers a minimum amount for each trip. The minimum pay standard has significantly increased earnings for drivers working for the high-volume companies. In 2019, Drivers earned on average $970 weekly. While the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the licensed vehicle industry in New York City, high-volume weekly earnings increased by 10 percent from February through the end of Fiscal 2021. During the pandemic, all TLC-Licensed Drivers had an opportunity to supplement income by delivering meals to homebound New Yorkers. To further protect the industry, the Mayor signed Local Law 147 in August 2018, which paused the issuance of new FHV licenses for one year, with an exception for wheelchair accessible vehicles. When the pause went into effect in August 2019, over 120,000 FHVs held TLC licenses. Licensees expressed concerns about the number of vehicles on the road, as well as increased congestion and lower wages per driver due to the excessive supply. As the vehicle pause has remained in place, the number of licensed vehicles has decreased to roughly 96,000 as of the end of Fiscal 2021. As required by rule, TLC will continue to evaluate the pause on licenses and the impact on outer borough service, congestion and driver pay, among other metrics. However, it is apparent that the FHV license pause has resulted in a more balanced and appropriate number of vehicles on the road.Page 214 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Ensure the quality and safety of for-hire vehicle transportation services through effective regulation and administration of rules, standards and licensing requirements.

Goal 1a Increase access to for-hire transportation service. For-hire vehicle (FHV) bases, including app-based services Uber, Lyft, and Via, had a total of 2,247 wheelchair accessible vehicles in Fiscal 2021, which is roughly two times the figure reported the previous year. The number of wheelchair accessible yellow taxis increased 82 percent to 1,914 after experiencing a significant decrease in Fiscal 2020 due to the pandemic. The Boro taxi fleet is smaller and the number of accessible vehicles remained at 43 from the previous year. Citywide accessible dispatch service wait time remained relatively flat at 12 minutes and 22 seconds, and the percentage of accessible dispatch trips fulfilled also held steady at just under 90 percent.

TLC conducted a total of 94,632 safety and emissions inspections at its Woodside facility in Fiscal 2021, a 10 percent decrease from the prior year. The decrease is related to an overall drop in trips which led many vehicle owners to place their licenses and permits into temporary storage. The vehicles that did continue to operate were less likely to fail an inspection in Fiscal 2021 and all sectors experienced a decrease in the safety and emissions failure rate. This improvement is related to TLC's outreach and communication efforts to the industry about the inspection process to inform and prepare licensees prior to coming in for inspection. 015304560 Boro Taxi 18 FY 30.3% 31,756 27,000 16,226 * * Down * \u00ab Medallion safety and emissions failure rate - 28.1% 26.9% 33.6% 6.7% * * Neutral Down Medallion safety and emissions inspections completed on sched - ule (%) 94.0% 93.4% 54.7% 59.9% 27.2% * * Down Up For-hire vehicle (FHV) safety and emissions inspections conducted at TLC facility 69,390 84,145 69,640 72,717 * * Neutral * \u00ab FHV safety and emissions failure rate - 30.3% 26.6% 28.7% 8.6% * * Neutral Down FHV safety and emissions inspections completed on schedule (%) 96.9% 99.9% 96.8% 98.6% 97.7% * * Neutral Up emissions inspections conducted 17,002 12,414 10,374 8,009 5,689 * * Down * \u00ab Boro Taxi safety and emissions failure rate - (%) 45.9% 41.2% 41.3% 10.6% * * Neutral \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 1c Ensure all vehicles operating for-hire follow TLC rules and regulations. To maintain public safety, TLC Enforcement aims to concentrate field operations on illegal street hails and unlicensed operations in Fiscal 2021. However due to COVID-19 emergency deployments, there was an 86 percent and a 74 percent decrease in summonses issued for these types of violations, respectively. Overall, TLC enforcement officers issued 18,575 patrol summonses in Fiscal 2021 compared to 50,795 the prior year, a decrease of 63 percent. This decline was because for much of the reporting period, TLC enforcement officers were deployed to check on business compliance of COVID-19 restrictions and officers played a central role in coordinating TLC-licensed driver meal delivery program. From October 2020 to May 2021, TLC Enforcement conducted 45,000 COVID-19 business inspections. In addition to business inspections, TLC Enforcement Officers supported the Meal Delivery Program from June 2020 through October 5th, 2020, when the program ended, dedicating 7,765 tours of duty to this initiative. The number of administrative summonses was 40 percent lower than in Fiscal 2020, but comparable to the totals issued in Fiscal 2019 before the pandemic. Part of the reduction in the number of summonses issued is related to a significant increase in licensee compliance with administrative directives, and acceptance of administrative settlement offers, which results in fewer violations resulting in a summons.

During the COVID-19 pandemic TLC was open for in-person business at a reduced level to ensure there was adequate social distancing in our waiting room and between staff and TLC's customers. Some transactions were moved online to allow customers to conduct business without visiting the Agency's customer service center in Long Island City. During the second part of the fiscal year, more customers started returning to work. The number of in-person visits to the customer service center increased and wait times increased to 46 minutes, exceeding the Agency's target of 25 minutes. This was partially due to the ongoing need to maintain social distancing within our waiting area and is expected to normalize with the expiration of New York State COVID-19 guidelines. The pandemic similarly impacted driver licensing operations. Specifically, the total wait time for a driver license rose to 85 days, an increase of 71 percent from Fiscal 2020. This increase is largely due to the driver education schools remaining closed for part of the year and operating at a reduced capacity upon reopening. Internal processing time increased 23 percent in Fiscal 2021 primarily due to operational challenges adjusting to remote and hybrid work models. The average time to conduct safety and emissions inspections, which includes both wait time and actual inspection time, decreased across all vehicle categories. The downward trend in wait times started in the middle of Fiscal 2019 as TLC incorporated and improved its use of new technologies and scheduling strategies. In Fiscal 2021, a major reason for the decrease in wait times was the fact that fewer vehicles overall were active during the pandemic.

Chokshi, CommissionerDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE | Page 223 WHAT WE DO The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) protects and promotes the health and well-being of New Yorkers. DOHMH engages with communities to develop and implement robust public health programming and policy recommendations, enforces health regulations, responds to public health emergencies and provides limited direct health services. Through its core values of science, equity and compassion, DOHMH works toward a city where all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, where they are from or where they live. DOHMH is integral to the city's COVID-19 public health emergency response. DOHMH's top COVID-19 priorities in 2020-2021 are to rapidly address a resurgence in COVID-19 infections; vaccinate New Yorkers for influenza and COVID-19, partnering with New York City communities to inform effective local strategies; and address \"parallel pandemics\" related to COVID-19, including other infections (such as tuberculosis) or chronic diseases (such as heart disease), mental health, overdose, racism and social and economic instability. Beyond COVID-19, DOHMH's core public health work continues. It contracts with community- based organizations to deliver mental health, developmental disability and alcohol and substance use disorder treatment services. It works with health care providers to improve health care delivery and to increase the use of preventive services, such as immunizations and cancer screenings. Direct services are provided at four tuberculosis clinics, eight sexual health clinics, one immunization clinic and more than 1,200 public schools. DOHMH issues birth and death certificates, inspects restaurants and childcare centers and protects public safety through immediate response to emergent public health threats. The Early Intervention Program serves infants and toddlers with developmental delays.FOCUS ON EQUITY To improve health outcomes faster, the City must be deliberate in naming and addressing health inequities rooted in historical and contemporary injustices and discrimination, including structural racism and discriminatory practices. As one of its core values, DOHMH aims to integrate equity into all its work. At the cornerstone of these efforts is the Department's focus on promoting healthy childhoods, creating healthier neighborhoods, implementing anti-racist public health practice, improving public health surveillance systems and bridging public health and healthcare delivery. DOHMH envisions a city where every New Yorker lives in a thriving neighborhood with equitable access to resources that will support their health and their community's health, including the infusion of mental health into our public health initiatives. DOHMH promotes equity by using data and storytelling to highlight injustices, inform policy, systematic and environmental change and by implementing neighborhood-based programs and strategies to foster health. The Department invests in three neighborhood-based bureaus that serve catchment areas that have historically experienced the highest burden of premature mortality due to structural inequities and disinvestment. These bureaus also oversee Neighborhood Health Action Centers in East Harlem, Tremont and Brownsville that offer coordinated health and social services, as well as community programs, under one roof. The Action Centers provide a central location for people to connect and plan for improving the health of their neighborhoods.Page 224 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Detect and control infectious diseases.

Goal 1a Reduce new cases of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. The number of new HIV diagnoses continued to decline in New York City due to DOHMH's wide-ranging Ending the Epidemic efforts, including HIV testing, prevention, care, and treatment services and programming. Calendar 2020 represents nine months of data, as reported to DOHMH by September 30, 2020. Calendar 2020 data are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on case surveillance activities and citywide service delivery, including HIV testing. DOHMH continues to work to expand access to HIV testing, including through home delivery of free self-test kits. In Fiscal 2021, there were 2,175 reported primary and secondary syphilis cases in New York City, compared to 2,054 in Fiscal 2020. This 5.9 percent increase in cases occurred among people reported as female, transgender, Black or African American, and Hispanic/Latino; increases in cases occurred in all boroughs, with the exception of Manhattan. Fiscal 2021 data are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution due to standard delays in reporting and classifying syphilis cases. DOHMH continues to provide syphilis testing and treatment in the City's Sexual Health Clinics, monitor reports of syphilis, and work to prevent ongoing syphilis transmission by notifying, testing, and treating the partners of individuals diagnosed with syphilis. During the reporting period, distribution of safer sex products\u2014including male condoms\u2014by DOHMH's NYC Condom Availability Program (NYCAP) was down significantly by 42.2 percent. While local businesses began to re-open in June 2020, most distribution sites did not open or opened with limited hours, capacity restrictions, and safety requirements. Restaurants and bars constitute a large portion of NYCAP sites, and most did not fully reopen until spring 2021. NYCAP has been in consistent contact with sites to ensure up-to-date reopening and service status; this has allowed the Department to maintain a current the list of safer sex product distribution sites on the NYC Health Map. The Department also continues to operate Door 2 Door, through which New Yorkers can order safer sex products for home delivery.

The number of tuberculosis (TB) cases decreased by 20.0 percent in Calendar 2020 from 556 cases to 445. This finding aligns with national trends in TB cases in 2020. DOHMH believes the decline was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and a combination of several factors such as underdiagnosis and patients not seeking health care. Since the re-opening of the City's TB Clinics, the Department is continuing to provide essential TB care services. There was a decrease of almost four percentage points in the percentage of children age 19-35 months with up-to-date immunizations during the current reporting period. Vaccination rates have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Likely causes for this decline include New York State PAUSE, fewer routine pediatric visits during the pandemic, families leaving NYC, and remote learning as New York State waived school immunization requirements for students learning remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. The immunization status of remote-only students was provisional, rather than excludable for the 2020-2021 academic year. HPV vaccination rates were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to a lesser extent compared to other routine vaccines required for school and daycare. There was a 1.5 percentage point decrease in the HPV vaccine series completion rate in Fiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020.

Goal 2a Reduce tobacco use and promote physical activity and healthy eating. The percentage of adults who smoke decreased to 10.9 percent during Calendar 2020, which is below the 12 percent target. This decline follows the implementation of new laws in 2018 and 2019, which put New York City at the forefront of tobacco control in the nation with the highest minimum cigarette pack price, new protections from secondhand smoke and limits on the number of tobacco and e-cigarette retailers for all neighborhoods. DOHMH continues to partner with the New York State Smokers' Quitline to ensure access to free coaching support and nicotine medications for New Yorkers. New York State also expanded the Medicaid benefit for smoking cessation in 2020 to remove the limit on the number of counseling sessions covered, which augmented the already strong coverage of smoking cessation medications for New Yorkers with Medicaid.

In Calendar 2020, the number of children under the age of 18 with blood lead levels of 5 micrograms per deciliter or greater was 3,015, a 19.4 percent decrease from the prior year. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in health care utilization\u2014including a drop in blood lead testing among children,\u2014which may have contributed to this decrease. This decrease may also be due to other factors, including continued reduction of lead-based paint hazards in homes and lead poisoning prevention education efforts aimed at health care providers, community-based organizations and families. The number of children under the age of 6 with blood lead levels of 5 micrograms per deciliter or greater was 2,603, a 14.7 percent decrease from the prior year. In Fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic diverted substantial inspection resources to support citywide COVID-19 risk re - duction efforts and business compliance. Routine child care inspections were modified to address the most critical public health requirements to keep children in child care safe, and therefore do not equate with the inspections conducted in prior years.

The rate of initial inspections with active rat signs was 26.9 percent in Fiscal 2021, an increase of 12.2 percentage points from the 14.7 percent rate in the prior fiscal year. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as substantial inspection resources were diverted to support citywide COVID-19 risk reduction efforts, inspection resources were focused on properties with more severe rodent cases. In June of Fiscal 2021, there were 93,240 dogs licensed in New York, an 11.8 percent increase from the prior year, when the COVID-19 pandemic impacted DOHMH's ability to issue new and renewal licenses in a timely manner.

Goal 4a Reduce the adverse health consequences of substance misuse. The number of buprenorphine patients decreased by 2.6 percent from 16,383 in Calendar 2019 to 15,949 in Calendar 2020. This slight decrease may be due to difficulties accessing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergency measures to provide treatment via telemedicine likely mitigated these challenges. Despite this slight decline, there was an increase in the number of patients who received four or more months of buprenorphine prescriptions.

Delays in building construction and certification of Temporary Certificates of Occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic were the cause of a majority of buildings scheduled to open in Fiscal 2021 to move the anticipated opening to Fiscal 2022. New children receiving services from the Early Intervention Program increased 3.2 percent from 12,400 in Fiscal 2020 to 12,800 in Fiscal 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the number of referrals to the Early Intervention Program, which in turn impacted the number of children initiating services.

The Fiscal 2021 average response time of 5.1 days for birth certificates remained the same as in Fiscal 2020 and was slightly lower than in Fiscal 2019 but was above the target of three days. The increased average time is related to a significant increase in requests related to the federal Real ID policy, which requires the submission of a birth certificate as part of updating a driver's license. The increase in customer orders is consistent with vital records jurisdictions across the nation and represents a long-term trend in increasing order volume for birth certificates. In addition, this office is processing an additional 9,612 birth certification orders for a new order type (pre-adoption birth certificates), which is not included in these totals but does impact response times. The Fiscal 2021 average response time for death certificates was 3.7 days, which is slightly above the three-day target. The 48 percent increase from Fiscal 2020 is related to high volume from both routine orders and new orders associated with recently implemented legislation, as well as operational challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

OCME's independent investigations of deaths and analysis of evidence provide answers to families and communities during times of profound need. OCME is responsible for investigating deaths resulting from criminal violence, accident or suicide; that occur suddenly and when in apparent good health; when unattended by a physician; in a correctional facility or in custody of any criminal justice entity; or occurring in any suspicious or unusual manner or threat to public health. These types of cases are referred to as being under \"Medical Examiner jurisdiction.\" The Office also reviews all applications for permits to cremate the body of a person who dies in New York City. The Office provides additional forensic services, including DNA testing, to support investigations. OCME also manages all functions of the City mortuary, including the retrieval and processing of unclaimed deceased bodies, and facilitates final disposition. Finally, OCME maintains a specialized mass fatality management team ready to support the City in responding to mass fatalities and other disasters.FOCUS ON EQUITY To best serve all New Yorkers\u2014regardless of economic ability\u2014OCME operates Family Services Centers in all five boroughs so that all communities have equal service access. At these centers, staff interact with family members, medical practitioners, and other advisors to receive and verify information that will assist in determining the identity of deceased persons and aid in final disposition. For families who may need or choose interment of their loved ones in the City Cemetery, OCME provides an opportunity for a final viewing before burial. In addition, OCME also serves as the independent pathologist for families by performing its own impartial death investigations and autopsies, free from undue influence by legal or medical communities or law enforcement. OCME develops and maintains a workplace culture in which employment and advancement decisions are made fairly and employees are treated equitably, regardless of race/ethnicity, age, gender, religion/creed, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation. This is accomplished through agency wide training and continual engagement with managers to ensure familiarity with the city's EEO, diversity and inclusion policies, and through incorporating these policies into recruitment, selection, promotion, and workplace activities so that all employees feel welcome and inspired to succeed.Page 234 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Perform the processes necessary to certify deaths falling within the agency's jurisdiction.

Goal 1a Respond promptly to scenes of reportable fatalities and conduct related investigations. In Fiscal 2021, OCME took jurisdiction in 7,735 cases. OCME death scene investigators, called medicolegal investigators (MLIs), respond to the scene of reported deaths that fall within Medical Examiner jurisdiction. The median time for scene arrivals by MLIs remained approximately the same from the preceding fiscal year at 1.6 hours. The number of deaths reported to OCME decreased from the previous year, which was elevated corresponding to the surge in NYC deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic.

OCME forensic pathologists examined 7,735 decedents in Fiscal 2021, up from 7,568 in Fiscal 2020. OCME performed 6,225 autopsies in Fiscal 2021, up from the 4,854 autopsies in Fiscal 2020. The median time to complete OCME autopsy reports in Fiscal 2021 was 144 days, a 77-day increase from the previous year. The increase is a result of the laboratory backlog caused by the pandemic, during which time OCME laboratories were suspended but for some high priority cases. The majority of laboratory staff were temporarily reassigned to assist in the mortuary to keep up with the surge in deaths. This created a backlog that lab staff were still working to resolve during the reporting period, and it contributed to a delay in toxicology reports that are relied upon by medical examiners to help complete autopsy reports. Beyond these issues, OCME medical examiners were deployed during the pandemic to cover forensic investigations as team leaders, 24/7; during this period, all routine medical examiner work was suspended for the individuals who were detailed to this auxiliary work (roughly half of the entire medical staff). In addition, the remaining half of the medical examiners were detailed to support forensic investigations on workdays during which they were not actively performing autopsies; these were workdays that they would have otherwise used to complete autopsy reports. These multiple factors directly related to the COVID-19 emergency response had a negative impact on autopsy report turnaround time as backlogs developed during the crisis. Laboratories have now resumed operations under COVID-19 risk mitigation protocols (social distancing, staggered work shifts, etc.) and medical examiners have returned to full time medical examiner work, allowing significantly more time to focus on the completion of autopsy reports. Based on this, autopsy report turnaround times are expected to improve in Fiscal 2022.

OCME reviews all applications for a permit to cremate the body of any person who dies in the City. When OCME's review of the cremation application reveals a cause or manner of death that falls within the Medical Examiner jurisdiction, the application will be rejected and OCME will investigate accordingly. However, once the investigation is complete, family members will have the opportunity to have the remains of their loved ones cremated if they wish. In Fiscal 2021, OCME responded to 20,636 cremation requests, down from 27,863 last year but elevated in comparison to pre-pandemic years. OCME rejected 115 cremation requests after investigation and converted them over to the Medical Examiner jurisdiction.

Goal 2a Recover and transport decedents to City mortuary facilities in a timely manner. In addition to those cases falling under Medical Examiner jurisdiction, OCME provides mortuary services for the City, including the retrieval and processing of unclaimed deceased bodies. In Fiscal 2021, the median time from OCME receipt of decedents' remains to \"Ready to Release\" was 6.54 hours. This number is up from the previous year. The reason is that during the months of March through June in Fiscal 2020, because of the pandemic, the vast majority of the deceased that arrived at OCME constituted non-forensic cases. Because these decedents arrive at OCME having already been identified, generally having come from healthcare facilities, they were typically ready to release almost as soon as they arrived. Therefore the large number of these cases resulted in a median time under one hour. For Fiscal Year 2021, the median time to clear and release to funeral directors per case was 39 minutes.

Under the City Incident Management System, the OCME's core competency is to manage mass fatality incidents. As defined in the NYC All hazards Mass fatality Response Plan, a mass fatality incident includes: any event having the potential to yield 10 or more fatalities; any situation in which there are remains contaminated by chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive agents or materials; any incident or other special circumstance requiring a multi-agency response to support mass fatality operations; or any incident involving a protracted or complex remains recovery operation.

Goal 4a Provide timely and accurate laboratory services for criminal justice purposes. The Forensic Biology Department's median time for completion of cases increased across all case types during Fiscal 2021 compared to the same reporting period in Fiscal 2020. As a result of the pandemic, the Forensic Biology lab suspended operations from March 13, 2020 to June 9, 2020 with only a small team processing priority cases, resulting in turnaround times that rose towards the end of Fiscal 2020 and backlog that continued to impact the Lab's turnaround time into the beginning of Fiscal 2021. Page 238 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT Median turnaround times for the Forensic Toxicology Department increased during the reporting period as the pandemic also resulted in the temporary suspension of the Forensic Toxicology laboratories for over three months. Due to this suspension, the Toxicology Department began Fiscal 2021 with more than 1,373 postmortem cases pending tests with 75 percent over 90 days turnaround time. Furthermore, there were over 1,300 new postmortem cases collected during the laboratory closure and placed in storage by OCME's Evidence Unit awaiting the reopening of the Forensic Toxicology Laboratory. Processing of the cases that had been held in storage took two months to complete before testing could begin, resulting in over 3,000 cases pending tests in August 2020, a three-fold increase compared with August 2019. The Department has made great progress on reducing this backlog by having staff in the department work tirelessly to process cases seven days per week. This ensured compliance with social distancing requirements of having only 50 percent of staff working in the laboratory and 50 percent working remotely for 10 months of Fiscal 2021. Over 7,400 postmortem toxicology cases have been closed in Fiscal 2021 resulting in month by month decreases in turnaround times. The reduction in turnaround times was achieved even though there was an increase of over 17 percent in postmortem cases submitted to the Laboratory for testing and linked to the reported national increase in drug-related deaths and the ongoing opioid pandemic. Median turnaround times for toxicology DUI and toxicology sexual assault cases at the start of Fiscal 2021 were three to eight-fold higher than those achieved prior to the introduction of the new discovery law and the laboratory suspension due to COVID-19. Since testing recommenced in July 2020, the Department has successfully cleared the backlog for both case types. In June 2021, the median turnaround time for toxicology DUI cases was 34 days, with a median time of 46 days for the fiscal year. The median turnaround time for toxicology sexual assault cases was reduced by over 50 percent from 243 days (as reported in the Fiscal 2021 PMMR) to 80 days at the end of Fiscal 2021, with a median turnaround time of 50 days for the month of June 2021.

The System provides comprehensive health care services including preventive and primary care, behavioral health, substance abuse, trauma, high-risk neonatal and obstetric care, and burn care. The System's acute care hospitals serve as major teaching hospitals. In addition, the System includes a managed care plan called MetroPlus; an Accountable Care Organization that provides Medicare beneficiaries with coordinated care and chronic disease management, avoiding unnecessary duplication of services and preventing medical errors; a Certified Home Health Agency; a Health Home; and Correctional Health Services. NYC Health + Hospitals is New York's single largest provider of care to Medicaid patients, mental health patients, and the uninsured, serving more than one million New Yorkers within the five boroughs. NYC Health + Hospitals continues to have an important role in caring for the most vulnerable New Yorkers during the COVID-19 pandemic.FOCUS ON EQUITY NYC Health + Hospitals' mission is to deliver high quality health care services to all New Yorkers with compassion, dignity, and respect, regardless of income, gender identity, or immigration status. By the very nature of the System's mission, NYC Health + Hospitals provides high quality care to the most vulnerable New Yorkers within the diverse communities it serves, many of whom are uninsured or underinsured. People in these communities who would typically lack access to health care services are the most impacted, by being able to obtain the quality care that they need and deserve through NYC Health + Hospitals. For instance, the NYC Care Program ensures that New Yorkers in need of health care services are being connected with affordable, high quality primary, preventive, and specialty care. This access has become even more important, considering the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on New Yorkers who are not eligible for or cannot afford health insurance. NYC Health + Hospitals also continues to expand MetroPlus membership, offering low to no-cost health insurance options to eligible people living within the five boroughs of New York City who otherwise would not be able to obtain insurance. The System's Correctional Health Services, in particular, is among the City's strongest advocates for social and racial justice, and is a key partner in the broader efforts to reform the criminal justice system. Finally, to further address equity, an advisory group called the Equity and Access Council, supports the Human Resources Office of Diversity and Inclusion and develops initiatives that promote equity among both staff and patients. This Council optimizes the delivery of care and health outcomes for diverse patient populations, with its primary focus to advance racial and social justice to eliminate barriers, promote institutional and structural equities, identify and reduce health disparities, and continuously improve the health of vulnerable communities.Page 242 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Provide medical, mental health and substance abuse services to New York City residents regardless of their ability to pay. Goal 1a Expand access to care. Goal 1b Enhance the sustainability of the Health + Hospitals system. Goal 1c Maximize quality of care and patient satisfaction.NYC HEALTH + HOSPITALS | Page 243 HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 SERVICE 1Provide medical, mental health and substance abuse services to New York City residents regardless of their ability to pay. Goal 1a Expand access to care. The NYC Care Program enrollment nearly tripled in one year, from 28,151 in Fiscal 2020 to 69,309 in Fiscal 2021. This essential program connects New Yorkers, who otherwise wouldn't be eligible for or cannot afford health insurance, with access to affordable, high quality primary and preventive health care services. At the same time, the number of uninsured patients served decreased from 378,104 in Fiscal 2020 to 304,174 in Fiscal 2021. This decline is a direct result of the increase in NYC Care enrollment; as uninsured patients became connected to care through this program, they were no longer in the category of patients considered uninsured. The number of calendar days to third next available new appointment, a measure of access, improved for both adults and pediatrics: for adults, from 13.0 days in Fiscal 2020 to 10.3 days in Fiscal 2021, and for pediatrics from 9.0 days in Fiscal 2020 to 6.5 days in Fiscal 2021. NYC Health + Hospitals' ambulatory care division has focused on improving access to appointments through implementing specific practices, such as carving out dedicated time slots available only for new patients, in addition to improving access to revisit appointments by template improvements, better coordination with the Contact Center, and increasing efficiency through the use of telemedicine. This has ultimately helped to maintain and surpass the access targets for both adult and pediatric patients. The number of eConsults (electronic specialty referrals) completed increased substantially for the fourth consecutive quarter, from 171,569 in Fiscal 2020 to 322,229 in Fiscal 2021. This is an indicator of NYC Health + Hospitals' ongoing commitment to expand access to specialty services. Through eConsults, primary care providers and specialists can co-manage and communicate about patients' health conditions, eliminating the need for in-person specialty care visits in approximately 15 percent of the time. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth visits, both telephone and video, rapidly increased and they were an important way to maintain continuity of care to patients when in-person visits were disrupted. In the month prior to the pandemic, there were 500 billable virtual visits, while between March and June 2020, there was a total 289,238 telehealth visits. In Fiscal 2021, 1,008,900 telehealth visits were conducted, reflecting NYC Health + Hospitals' commitment to its patients maintaining access to care during the pandemic. Alongside in-person visits, the System's long-term goal is to continue telehealth services as a viable source of quality care. Feedback from our patients about telehealth visits has been overwhelmingly positive. Unique patients decreased slightly from 1,153,089 in Fiscal 2020 to 1,148,019 in Fiscal 2021. At the same time, the number of primary care visits decreased from 445,672 in Fiscal 2020 to 389,505 in Fiscal 2021. This decrease is primarily because the definition for this measure was modified in Fiscal 2021 to account for the most accurate departments, visits, and encounter types. It includes visits occurring at primary care clinics, including family medicine, adult medicine, geriatrics, HIV, and pediatrics. In the past, certain departments, visits, and encounter types were counted, including COVID-19 testing data, which inflated the calculation for this metric; these encounters are no longer included in this indicator. The percentage of women enrolled in care in the first trimester of their pregnancy decreased slightly from 62.5 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 61.21 percent in Fiscal 2021. This decrease is a result of patients limiting in-person visits because of their discomfort with coming to health care settings during the pandemic. Care during the first trimester of pregnancy remains an important measure of women's health, with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommending that women with uncomplicated pregnancies be examined at least once in their first trimester for prenatal care. Eligible women receiving mammogram screening increased from 63.5 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 70.5 percent in Fiscal 2021, coming closer to pre-pandemic rates. Screening rates had decreased primarily due to patients avoiding health care institutions for routine appointments and screenings during the pandemic. The goal moving forward is to maintain access, as more women come back to in-person visits for their mammogram screenings. Adult medicine Pediatric medicineCalendar days to third next available new appointment 10.313.0 2021 FY 2020 FY 2019Page 244 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT The percentage of HIV patients retained in care increased from 81.6 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 85.0 percent in Fiscal 2021, now achieving the target and above pre-pandemic levels. This increase is a result of a combination of both in-person and telehealth visits being accessible for HIV patients. This rate was anticipated to improve from the prior year as, again, telehealth visits were leveraged to maintain continuity of care for this cohort of patients during the pandemic. Follow-up appointments kept within 30 days after behavioral health treatment decreased from 56.68 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 44.59 percent in Fiscal 2021. Most of this decrease is attributable to a modification in the way the data for this metric was collected in Fiscal 2021, now captured through the electronic health record system rather than through a separate database. This change created an opportunity to update the number of patient categories included in the denominator. Additionally, because of the pandemic, patients opted out of attending appointments at a higher rate than usual. Even though there was connection using tele-mental health services, not all patients were reached due to lack of access to devices or inability of some patients to use the technology. NYC Health + Hospitals' behavioral health services is working with the City to provide cell phones and data to this specific patient population to improve access. The total number of correctional health clinical encounters per 100 average daily population decreased slightly from 15,675 in Fiscal 2020 to 14,999 in Fiscal 2021. Correctional health patients with substance use diagnosis that received jail-based contact decreased from 94 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 91 percent in Fiscal 2021, though remains above the target of 90 percent. Correctional Health Services continues to offer a broad range of services to people with substance use disorders, including the nation's largest opioid treatment program, counseling, and reentry planning. The number of individuals served by Mental Health Services Corps behavioral health clinicians within NYC Health + Hospitals was 5,884 in Fiscal 2021, exceeding the target of 4,950. In January 2020, NYC Health + Hospitals launched a redesigned Mental Health Service Corps, providing three years of high-quality training in evidence-based practice to early career behavioral health clinicians, embedded in 46 NYC Health + Hospitals' sites across five boroughs. A total of 76 percent of service locations included in this program are located in federally designated mental health professional shortage areas. During the pandemic, Corps members continued to deliver these important services, including both in-person and telehealth mental health services, for patients. \u00f1 Neutral Up Unique primary care patients (seen in the last 12 months) 425,000 417,000 NA 445,672 389,505 * * NA NA 289,238 1,008,900 * * NA * \u00ab Eligible women 83.5% 84.9% 84.0% 81.6% 85.0% 85.0% 85.0% Neutral Up Calendar days to third next available new appointment - adult medicine 18.6 13.1 12.0 13.0 10.3 14.0 10.0 Down Down Calendar days to third next available new appointment - pediatric medicine 5.1 4.7 6.0 9.0 6.5 5.0 5.0 Up Down \u00ab NYC Care enrollment NA NA NA 28,151 69,309 \u00f1 \u00f1 NA Up \u00ab Patients enrolled in care in the 1st trimester of pregnancy 59.7% within 30 days after behav \u00f1 \u00f1 Down Up Correctional health patients with a substance use diagnosis that received jail-based contact (%) 97% 96% 95% 94% 91% 90% 90% Neutral Up Total correctional health clinical encounters per 100 average daily population 8,290 8,294 8,027 15,675 14,999 * * Up * Individuals who received clinical services from Mental Health Service Corps behavioral health clinicians NA NA NA 2,749 5,874 4,950 * NA * \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * NoneNYC HEALTH + HOSPITALS | Page 245 Goal 1b Enhance the sustainability of the Health + Hospitals system. Financial sustainability and ability to provide care to all New Yorkers, regardless of ability to pay, improved over Fiscal 2021. Specifically, net days of revenue for accounts receivable decreased from 71.3 days in Fiscal 2020 to 59.9 days in Fiscal 2021 (lower is better for this measure). Though still below the target of 42 days, this is a positive trend, with the days in accounts receivable significantly below last year at the same time. It is also important to note that the net days of revenue for accounts receivable calculation has changed, comprising both inpatient and outpatient accounts receivable. The ratio of patient care revenues to expenses improved from 61.6 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 74 percent in Fiscal 2021, representing a 12.4 percent improvement. This is mostly attributable to an increase in patient service revenue related to the pandemic as well as other revenue-generating initiatives, including continuing to improve registration and follow-up by revenue cycle staff members, coding more accurately, and focusing on managed care contracting improvements. MetroPlus membership continued to increase, from 560,212 members in Fiscal 2020 to 620,041 in Fiscal 2021. This increase is a result of the ongoing commitment to identify and connect Medicaid eligible people to MetroPlus and encouraging them to obtain this necessary coverage. At the same time, MetroPlus Health Plan medical spend remained neutral from 39.9 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 39.3 percent in Fiscal 2021. The percentage of patients who left the emergency departments without being seen had an observed, continued decline, from 6.9 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 3.5 percent in Fiscal 2021, at this point surpassing the target of 4 percent. The major driver of this decrease was the decline in overall emergency department volume over the course of the pandemic. NYC Health + Hospitals' acute care facilities put various improvement efforts in place, including operational changes to augment patient flow, and decreased boarding for patients who are admitted for inpatient services, which contributed to improved performance in this measure. The number of insurance applications submitted per month averaged 7,895 in Fiscal 2021. In Fiscal 2020 this number was at 16,402. The decline compared to the same period last year is linked to a change in reporting. Before July 2020, the number of insurance applications submitted reflected a manual count, but from July 2020 forward, the number includes data pulled from the electronic health record system. Data no longer includes applications submitted by Health Plan facilitated enrollers on site at NYC Health + Hospitals facilities. As a result, comparisons between periods are not consistent.

The System continued to place great emphasis on care experience in Fiscal 2021. MyChart is an important part of this effort. Each facility across NYC Health + Hospitals has encouraged patients to sign up or \"activate\" their MyChart accounts. MyChart is an electronic patient portal which allows patients to access important information about lab results, appointments, after visit summaries, review of medical history, medications, immunizations, and other personal health data. The portal allows patients to communicate seamlessly with their care teams to ask clinical questions and also request medication refills. MyChart activations increased from 20 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 69 percent in Fiscal 2021. During the pandemic in particular, MyChart has been critically important for patients to connect to and communicate with their care teams, as well as to obtain refills and important real-time test results (including COVID-19 testing results). MyChart has directly improved the patient experience with their care team, allowing quick and efficient access to health information in a convenient and secure way. Page 246 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT There was an observed increase in patient satisfaction across both inpatient and outpatient services. Inpatient satisfaction rate rose from 63.0 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 65.7 percent in Fiscal 2021 and outpatient satisfaction rate rose from 83.6 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 84.5 percent in Fiscal. Despite the pandemic, patient satisfaction remained positive as health care workers continued to focus on providing patients with the best care experience possible. Additionally, improvements in wait times for outpatient services, access to telehealth visits and overall communication among the care teams in both inpatient and outpatient settings contributed to the improvements. The actual score post-acute care satisfaction rate of 81.9 percent is below the set target of 86.3 percent for Fiscal 2021. Due to the adverse impact of the pandemic on residents and staff working in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), the System anticipated that patient satisfaction would decrease Fiscal 2021. However, the NYC Health + Hospitals' post-acute service satisfaction rate remains above the national score (80.7) and the New York State score (77.1). Despite limitations visitation, communal dining, and group activities, residents generally remained satisfied due to alternative methods of engagement. In fact, all post-acute care sites ranked the highest, at 5 Stars, in the CMS Quality Ratings, a federal ratings system for healthcare facilities focused on quality-of-care metrics. The percentage of patients diagnosed with diabetes who have controlled blood sugar decreased from 64.6 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 63.7 percent in Fiscal 2021. During the pandemic, many patients avoided health care facilities and did not obtain the services needed to stabilize their chronic conditions. Chronic disease coordinators are contacting patients to resume in-person visits for chronic disease management. Clinicians are working with diabetic patients in primary care clinics to improve diabetes management skills, and trainings for multiple clinical disciplines were developed to enhance patient education specific to managing diabetes and nutritional interventions. Finally, some of the decline in control rates is simply due to missing laboratory testing as patients avoided coming to health care facilities during the pandemic; if testing was not documented, the patient was considered \"not in-control.\" This will resolve as more patients return.

Data for 'Patients receiving a defined set of medical services to treat sepsis within three hours of presentation (%)' is no longer reported by the New York State Department of Health. This indicator will be updated when new reporting guidelines become available. NYC Health + Hospitals adjusted Fiscal 2022 targets for 'Calendar days to third next available new appointment\u2014adult medicine' because previously published targets were exceeded. NYC Health + Hospitals adjusted Fiscal 2022 targets for 'Net days of revenue for accounts receivable' to align with the median net accounts receivable days benchmark cited by the 2015 Revenue Cycle Benchmarking Survey conducted by The Advisory Board Company. NYC Health + Hospitals adjusted Fiscal 2022 targets for 'MyChart Activations (%)' because previously published targets were exceeded.

HRA also promotes opportunity through employment programs and provides essential resources to vulnerable New Yorkers, including persons with disabilities, immigrants, survivors of domestic violence, New Yorkers living with HIV/AIDS, and seniors. In this role connecting millions of families and individuals with vital lifelines, HRA is at the forefront of addressing poverty citywide, statewide, and nationwide.FOCUS ON EQUITY The Human Resources Administration (HRA), integrated with the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) in 2017 under the management structure of the Department of Social Services (DSS), serves over three million New Yorkers annually through programs that address poverty and income inequality, including cash assistance, food assistance, and Medicaid public health insurance. HRA also prevents homelessness by providing rental assistance, rehousing programs, and legal services programs to families and individuals. In conjunction with the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs (MOIA), HRA administers the City's municipal identification program (IDNYC) and legal services programs for immigrants. In New York City, as in the rest of the United States, persistent racial inequities have manifested themselves in higher poverty rates; greater housing insecurity; and diminished access to health care for Black and Latinx residents. HRA provides an array of anti-poverty programs and initiatives that serve low-income New Yorkers, a disproportionate number of whom are people of color. HRA has implemented client-centered reforms to reduce barriers to benefits and services that address poverty and inequity. HRA developed technology to modernize and simplify access to benefits; increased anti-eviction and immigration-related legal services; and expanded rental assistance and other affordable housing and social services programs. HRA continues to expand opportunity for New Yorkers, addressing income inequality through economic empowerment services to achieve financial security and conducting outreach to underserved groups who may be eligible for Agency services.Page 250 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Improve access to assistance that provides economic stability to support the basic needs of all eligible children and adults.

Goal 1a Provide access to cash assistance benefits for all eligible children and adults. The Cash Assistance (CA) 12-month unduplicated number of persons\u2014the true measure of the total number of clients served in a year\u2014was lower in Fiscal 2021 than any period since Fiscal 2013, when HRA began reporting this indicator. The reduction was due to fewer emergency assistance recipients during this period as a result of federal and NY State moratoria on evictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The unduplicated number of persons receiving recurring assistance has fluctuated between approximately 467,000 and 492,000 since Fiscal 2017, and at 482,000 for Fiscal 2021, remains lower than in years prior to 2015. Of those clients receiving cash assistance in the month of June 2021, the number of individuals receiving recurring assistance decreased by 1.4 percent when compared to June 2020, but remains higher than it was prior to the pandemic and the resultant economic dislocation. The number of persons receiving one-time emergency assistance in June 2021 decreased by 42.5 percent compared to the previous June. This decrease, which includes grants for rent and utility arrears, is primarily due to the March 2020 NYS moratoria on evictions and utility shutoffs. Starting June 1, 2021, the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA) required all clients applying for help paying for rental and utility arrears to apply to the federally funded NYS Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) first before applying to HRA for such assistance. Clients accepted by ERAP are not included in HRA's count of clients receiving one-time emergency assistance. The cash assistance application acceptance rate decreased 18.4 percentage points in Fiscal 2021. This is due, in part, to an increase in applicants during the pandemic who did not meet the income requirements for the program. The percent of cases in the sanction process and in sanction status declined to nearly zero due to the suspension of all employment-related requirements to combat the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of clients and staff during the pandemic.

As of June 2021, the overall number of individuals and households receiving SNAP benefits increased by 5.6 and 6.2 percent, respectively, compared to June 2020, continuing the reversal of downward trends seen prior to 2020. This shift is due primarily to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Benefits access reform since 2015 has resulted in steady increases in the submission of online applications and telephone interviews for SNAP benefits. These reforms enabled SNAP clients to conduct business with HRA from the safety of their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, driving a 1.4 percent increase in applications filed electronically compared to Fiscal 2020. During Fiscal 2021, SNAP application timeliness improved by 17.4 percentage points, from 74.5 percent to 91.9 percent, returning to pre-pandemic levels. The SNAP payment error rate decreased from 8.4 percent in Federal Fiscal 2018 to 6.5 percent in Federal Fiscal 2019, but increased to 9.81 percent for Federal Fiscal 2020, although data collection was suspended in spring 2020 due to the pandemic.

This included 1.591 million enrolled in Medicaid administered by HRA, pursuant to State rules, and another 2.390 million enrolled in Medicaid through the New York State Health Care Exchange. To protect the health and safety of clients during the COVID-19 pandemic, NYS ordered Medicaid cases to be automatically extended, without the need for clients to recertify. As a result of this order, the number of Medicaid-only enrollees administered by HRA was 11.1 percent higher than in the previous year. Overall enrollment in the portion of the Medicaid program administered HRA, which includes persons enrolled through Cash Assistance and SSI, increased by 3.2 percent. Application timeliness increased by 6.9 percentage points, returning to pre-COVID-19 levels, as staff adjusted to working remotely.

Goal 2a Increase the proportion of cash assistance recipients who obtain and retain paid employment. HRA Employment Services helps CA applicants, recipients and non-custodial parent child support clients obtain and retain employment. HRA provides services through contracts, training and education referrals and placement in transitional subsidized jobs in the public and private sectors. HRA programs focus on the individual needs of clients, providing assessments and specialized services, including programs for youth and sector-specific training. In April 2020, HRA suspended in- person employment programs in compliance with New York State's stay-at-home order which, coupled with reduced job opportunities, significantly impacted HRA's ability to connect clients with employment. In addition, NY State waived engagement requirements and made all education, training and employment requirements voluntary for CA clients. As a result, HRA helped 4,724 clients obtain jobs in Fiscal 2021, 85.3 percent fewer than during Fiscal 2020. During the last three months of Fiscal 2020, as businesses closed due to COVID-19, more clients who had previously obtained employment began to return to HRA for assistance. In Fiscal 2021, 70.2 percent of clients who obtained a job either retained it or did not return to CA after 180 days, roughly the same as in Fiscal 2020, and 60.4 percent of employed clients either retained their jobs or did not return to CA after 12 months, 1.2 percentage points lower than in Fiscal 2020. HRA's Employment Services vendors continue to assist clients to help them return to the labor force if they lose their job within a year of employment. HRA's redesigned approach to employment services emphasizes access to training and education, literacy programs, community service, and other training consistent with the Mayor's Jobs for New Yorkers Task Force recommendations. This approach is intended to help clients secure better jobs. Periodically, each client's participation in the program is reassessed to determine the best services to meet their career goals. HRA was correcting a technical issue with the reassessment process for a portion of clients in training and education activities to enable complete data reporting when in-person training and education activities were paused due to COVID-19 safety requirements. As a result, complete data on training and education was not available for Fiscal 2020 and is not available in Fiscal 2021.

HRA's Wellness, Comprehensive Assessment, Rehabilitation and Employment program (WeCARE) supports CA clients with barriers to employment to achieve self-sufficiency in the workforce and helps those who have disabilities apply for federal disability assistance. As of June 2021, there were 32,937 recipients participating in the WeCARE program, 22.7 percent fewer than in June 2020. The decrease is the result of a pause of in-person appointments due to COVID-19, which reduced the number of referrals to WeCARE. During Fiscal 2021, there were 1,519 federal disability awards granted to clients assisted by WeCARE, 41.8 percent fewer than in Fiscal 2020. This is due in part to fewer applications being filed as referrals to WeCARE went down, and additional delays in federal processing of applications that can regularly take 12 months or longer.

Goal 3a Provide homelessness prevention benefits and services to eligible children and adults. HRA provides homelessness prevention assistance to families and individuals with housing emergencies and to those seeking shelter. HRA offers access to emergency rental arrears payments and ongoing rental assistance at job centers, Housing Courts, and DHS shelter intake and HomeBase locations. The percentage of client successfully diverted at PATH, the DHS shelter intake location for families with children, decreased by 3.7 percentage points. The number of families entering shelter declined significantly in Fiscal 2021 during the pandemic and many who did seek shelter did so only when they had no alternatives, resulting in a smaller percentage being diverted. HRA exceeded its 85 percent target for shelter avoidance for all clients who received homelessness prevention services through its HomeBase contracts. The number of single adults who avoided entering shelter within the 12 months following receipt of services remained largely stable; however, this metric still exceeded the target by more than 5.5 percentage points. The rates for adult families and families with children remained stable, exceeding the target by more than 10 percentage points.HUMAN RESOURCES ADMINISTRATION | Page 255 There was a significant drop in emergency assistance requests after New York State suspended evictions due to COVID-19 in March 2020, when average weekly requests fell by 8.3 percent. This trend continued as the number of requests submitted to HRA's Rent Arrears Unit (RAU) for one-time, emergency rental assistance to prevent evictions decreased 8.3 percent during Fiscal 2021, and the percentage of emergency assistance requests approved decreased by 9.3 percentage points. The decrease in approvals can be attributed to fewer applicants being income eligible due to the availability of pandemic- related income supports, as well as the introduction of federally funded ERAP later in the fiscal year. HRA's Office of Civil Justice continues to oversee implementation of the City's Universal Access to Counsel Law, the nation's first law to ensure access to legal services for every tenant facing eviction in court. Full implementation is expected Fiscal 2022. In Fiscal 2021, HRA assisted households with legal services for City tenants in need, connecting 15,331 households with legal assistance. This decline of 36.4 percent compared to the prior year is due to significantly reduced operations at NYC Housing Court throughout Fiscal 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

HRA assists individuals and families who are domestic violence (DV) survivors and require DV services within the community or placement in an emergency DV shelter. In Fiscal 2021, the percent of DV-eligible families at DHS Prevention Assistance and Temporary Housing intake center (PATH) entering an HRA DV shelter was 56.9 percent, 12.0 percentage points higher than the previous period due to increased focus on timely vacancy control, a process by which staff closely monitor shelter exits and quickly fill vacant units. This enabled HRA to provide shelter to more families as the need arose. Families who cannot enter an emergency DV shelter are referred to a Department of Homeless Services shelter, where they also receive targeted services for domestic violence. The average number of families served per day in domestic violence emergency shelter decreased by 5.8 percent in 2021 due to the reduced number of overall referrals as a consequence of COVID-19. The closure of one facility (74 beds) during the last quarter of Fiscal '21 accounts for the overall reduction in DV emergency beds. However, clients were not adversely affected due to the lower referral rate, and additional DV capacity is coming online. For Fiscal 2021, there was an increase of 1.9 percent in the number of clients receiving non-residential domestic violence services from the prior period. Non-residential programs saw an increase in participation primarily due to the availability of user-friendly technology allowing the public to use mobile phones and computers in lieu of in-person visits to engage program services. This has provided another safe option for survivors to access services.

Goal 4a Ensure that all eligible vulnerable and/or frail children and adults and children and adults with disabilities receive services to resolve immediate risk and provide ongoing assistance to enhance their safety and independence. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Adult Protective Services (APS) continued to take referrals directly and provide services, visiting individuals within three days of referral at essentially the same rate as prior to the pandemic, and continuing to make determinations within the State-mandated 60 day time frame 98 percent of the time. There was a decrease of 24.8 percent in the number of referrals leading to a 27.1 percent decrease in number of cases assessed for Adult Protective Services (APS) during Fiscal 2021, compared to Fiscal 2020, mostly due to fewer eviction related referrals following the moratorium on evictions and the limited operations of Housing Courts. The number of APS cases eligible for services decreased by 7.5 percent compared to the prior period primarily because of case closures among clients no longer requiring APS services and the decline in referrals. The total number of cases receiving home care services increased 3.2 percent, driven overwhelmingly by an increase in enrollment of 6,299 Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC) clients between June 2020 and June 2021. The enrollment of MLTC clients is managed exclusively by New York State Managed Care contractors. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, NYS suspended case closings to protect the health and safety of clients. Cases were only closed for death or clients moving permanently out of state. In Fiscal 2021, the average number of days to initiate home attendant and housekeeper services for HRA clients, which excludes the State-administered MLTC caseload, was 23.5 days. This indicator remained stable even though, fearing the pandemic, clients often did not want HRA assessment staff to come into their homes, thereby increasing processing time as HRA pivoted to processing initial cases telephonically, rather than in person. HRA Personal Care billable hours increased by 5.1 percent because more clients applied through HRA for Medicaid rather than through the New York State broker for Managed Care Home Care Services. Once cases are opened, their billable hours are attributed to HRA until they are transitioned to MLTC within 60 to 90 days. Serious personal care complaints resolved within 24 hours increased by 13.0 percentage points during the period, above resolutions levels seen in 2018 and 2019, pre-pandemic. During Fiscal 2021, the number of individuals who received HIV/AIDS Services Administration (HASA) services remained largely unchanged and the number of new applicants decreased by 19.2 percent. There was a State-approved waiver in place at the end of the Fiscal 2020 suspending the need for clients to recertify during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a reduction in re-applications. While the percentage of HASA clients receiving enhanced housing benefits decreased by 1.5 percentage points, the time taken to conduct the application review for ongoing enhanced housing benefits decreased 8.8 percent and the time to issue enhanced benefits to eligible clients improved to 14.9 days, 12.9 percent more quickly than in Fiscal 2020. These quicker processing times were due to decreases in the number of requests for enhanced housing benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic.HUMAN RESOURCES ADMINISTRATION | Page 257 4,863 5,241 4,485 3,271 * * Down * \u00ab Individuals referred to an APS field office visited within three working days (%) 95.0% 95.3% 96.2% 97.4% 96.9% 85.0% 85.0% Neutral Up cases accepted or denied for undercare within State-mandated 60 days (%) 95.3% 96.1% 96.5% 98.0% 98.1% * * Neutral for services 7,346 7,407 6,942 6,630 6,131 * * Down for APS 27,860 30,252 30,974 24,843 18,672 * * Down * \u00ab Personal care services - average weekly billable hours 46.1 50.5 52.8 55.2 58.0 * * Up * \u00ab Serious personal care complaints resolved in 24 hours (%) 94.0% 93.0% 84.0% 97.0% 100.0% 100.0% Neutral Up \u00ab Average days to initiate home attendant and housekeeper services for all cases 20.0 23.0 20.0 23.5 23.5 30.0 30.0 Up Down home care services 155,504 176,681 200,927 222,182 229,280 * * Up * Administration (HASA) services 6,862 6,102 5,730 34,476 34,063 34,383 34,290 * * assistance (%) 80.6% 81.8% 83.6% 83.1% 81.6% * * Neutral * \u00ab Average number of days from submission of a completed application to approval or denial of enhanced housing benefits to keep HASA clients in stable housing 6.9 7.6 7.6 6.8 6.2 8.0 8.0 Down Down \u00ab Average number of days from submission of a completed application to issuance of enhanced housing benefits to HASA clients 16.8 17.7 19.7 17.1 14.9 15.5 15.5 Neutral Down \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None AGENCY-WIDE MANAGEMENT Recoveries and Cost Avoidance In March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, nearly all of these operations were deferred or suspended, significantly reducing the Medicaid, Cash Assistance and SNAP recoveries and cost avoidance results since that time and thus the total result for Fiscal 2021. In Fiscal 2021, HRA continued to focus on maintaining the integrity of the benefit programs it oversees and ensuring that funds are collected appropriately through its Investigation, Revenue and Enforcement Administration (IREA). Efforts include investigation of provider fraud, recovery of monies owed from collection activities (such as Supplemental Needs Trusts and property and negligence liens) and securing repayments from settlements or in cases of concealed income. HRA continues to pursue Medicaid investigations under agreement with New York State even with the State takeover of most Medicaid administration and the enrollment of most new Medicaid clients through the State Exchange. Fair Hearings HRA is committed to making it simpler for clients to obtain and keep benefits for which they are entitled by eliminating unnecessary punitive administrative actions that negatively affect clients. State administrative fair hearings are held when HRA clients dispute findings on their cases, usually related to eligibility or benefits. With the suspension of employment requirements due to the pandemic, and fewer case closings, the number of fair hearings requested decreased by 24.4 percent between Fiscal 2020 and 2021. There has been an overall decline in requests of 62.2 percent since the beginning of the Administration. Of the hearings that were held with determinations made in Fiscal 2021, 18.4 percent resulted in HRA's decisions being upheld, 1.6 percentage points lower than the prior fiscal year. IDNYC HRA administers the largest municipal identification card program in the nation. IDNYC cards serve as an official identification card and help New Yorkers gain access to City services and buildings. The program also offers free membership in the City's leading museums, zoos, concert halls and botanical gardens. In Fiscal 2021, there were 167,070 cards issued, adding to the more than 1.56 million cards issued since the program's inception. In December 2019, IDNYC began accepting renewal applications for expiring cards. In this second year of both new and renewal activities, there was a 0.6 percent increase in the total number of IDNYC applications processed and the 7.5 percent increase in IDNYC cards issued. All IDNYC enrollment centers closed in mid-March 2020, with only a small number reopening in 2021, reducing the number of new applications.Page 258 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT Fair Fares NYC Launched in January 2019, Fair Fares NYC is a City program to help low-income New Yorkers manage transportation costs. With the Fair Fares NYC discount, eligible New York City residents receive a 50 percent discount on subway and eligible bus fares or Access-A-Ride fares. During the first phase of the program, HRA provided discounted MetroCards to working New Yorkers at or below the federal poverty level who were receiving Cash Assistance or SNAP benefits from HRA. As of June 2019, 58,946 people were enrolled in the program; and as of June 2021, a year after the program expanded to open enrollment for all eligible New Yorkers, 235,583 people were enrolled in the program. Motor Vehicle Collisions As of June 2021, HRA had 198 vehicles in its fleet and 484 authorized drivers. During Fiscal 2021, there were 15 fewer motor vehicle incident reports filed by HRA drivers compared to Fiscal 2020 and 38 fewer than Fiscal 2019, prior to the pandemic. In March 2020, most staff began working remotely from home, reducing the utilization of the HRA fleet and contributing to the decrease in incident reports. Employee Injuries During Fiscal 2021, 55 Workers' Compensation Reports were filed due to workplace injuries, 52.6 percent fewer than filed in Fiscal 2020. These results show a sharp decrease during the pandemic, as most HRA locations were closed during the pandemic. HRA conducts annual workshops on workplace safety with a strong emphasis placed on how to reduce workplace violence.

In child welfare, ACS contracts with nonprofit organizations to support and stabilize families at risk of a crisis through prevention services and with foster care agencies for children not able to remain safely at home. Each year, the agency's Division of Child Protection conducts over 40,000 investigations of suspected child abuse or neglect. In youth and family justice, ACS manages and funds services including detention and Close to Home placement, intensive community-based alternatives for youth and support services for families. In the Division of Child and Family Well-Being, created in September 2017, ACS issues child care vouchers for more than 50,000 children eligible for subsidized child care and promotes a two-generation approach to child and family wellbeing, family stability and equity through public education campaigns and a place- based approach including Family Enrichment Centers and the Community Partnership Program.FOCUS ON EQUITY ACS seeks to establish an equitable child welfare and juvenile justice system in which a child or family's race, gender, sexual orientation or other identities does not predict how they fare. In New York City, Black and Latinx families are overrepresented at key points along child welfare and juvenile justice pathways. To address racial disproportionality ACS has implemented programs such as Collaborative Assessment, Response, Engagement & Support (CARES) which diverts families from a traditional child welfare investigation and instead connects them directly with resources that will help them thrive. ACS also restructured its prevention and family support system through new contracts that improve the availability of and access to the most appropriate services; reduce reliance wherever possible on court-ordered interventions and prevent the need for foster care placements whenever children can remain safely at home. Thanks to this and other efforts, ACS has reduced the foster care census to a historic low. ACS is building the capacity of Children's Services staff at all levels to respond effectively to structural racism and individual bias and promote culturally competent policy and practice. To meet the needs of LGBTQ+ youth in foster care, ACS has implemented policy, guidance and best practices for ACS and provider agency staff and a mandatory LGBTQ+ training that focuses on engagement techniques and cultural competency.

Goal 1a Respond quickly to every allegation of abuse and neglect and perform thorough assessments of safety and risk. The number of investigations conducted in response to reports of suspected child abuse and/or neglect continued the downward trend that began in Fiscal 2018. During Fiscal Year 2021 this decline was especially sharp because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with substantial reductions in reports from school staff and other mandated reporters. The number of investigations in Fiscal 2021 declined 8 percent compared to Fiscal 2020 from 46,403 to 42,783. Continued quality assurance and oversight, coaching to support strength-based investigations and best case practice and service provision to families contributed to the 2.3 percentage point decline in the percentage of children in investigations that found some credible evidence of abuse or neglect with repeat investigations that also found some credible evidence within a year, from 17.2 to 14.9 percent. ACS's increased use of evidence-based prevention services also supported behavioral change for families that helped to decrease incidents of repeat maltreatment of children.

Additionally, there was a 21 percent decline in the number of families entering specialized teen child welfare prevention services from 838 to 663. These declines were driven by two major factors: the COVID-19 pandemic led to a reduction in child abuse and neglect investigations throughout Fiscal 2021, which led to fewer prevention referrals. The pandemic also made families more hesitant to have prevention service providers in their homes. Secondly, new contracts and programs that started on July 1, 2020 restructured the citywide prevention service system. This system transition also impacted prevention service utilization as new programs ramped up. The number of families entering child welfare prevention services rose eight percent from 7,699 in Fiscal 2020 to 8,316 in Fiscal 2021 indicating that the system's performance is improving and returning to pre-COVID-19 levels. ACS will continue to work closely with prevention service providers to expand access to their services during this time, including establishing new connections with schools, healthcare clinics, foster care agencies, and other community-based organizations.Page 264 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT 9,240 9,608 9,965 7,699 8,316 10,000 9,000 Down Up Families entering child welfare specialized teen prevention services 1,136 1,175 1,099 838 663 * * Down Up Children receiving child welfare prevention services (daily aver - age) 23,870 24,481 25,296 22,860 18,330 * * Down Up Children who received child welfare prevention services during the year (annual total) 43,157 43,874 45,468 41,176 32,945 * * Down Up \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 1c Provide safe and stable foster care placements for children who cannot remain safely at home. The number of children entering foster care continued to decline in Fiscal 2021. Foster care placements fell by 17 percent from 3,105 in Fiscal 2020 to 2,592 in Fiscal 2021. This decrease parallels the reduction of child abuse and neglect reports and investigations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The average number of children in foster care declined two percent from 7,827 to 7,639. In addition, the number of days all children spent in foster care declined four percent. ACS continued its focus on ensuring safe and stable foster care placements, with a priority on placing children with kin. The proportion of all children in foster care who are living in kinship homes increased from 40 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 42 percent in Fiscal 2021, an increase of 11 percentage points since Fiscal 2017. Children placed in their borough of origin increased from 52.3 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 54.1 percent in Fiscal 2021; however, as the total number of children in non- relative homes continued to decline, the percentage of them placed in-community decreased from 29.9 percent to 24.2 percent, which may be a reflection of the impact of COVID-19 on the available foster parent pool. The percentage of children who re-entered foster care within a year of discharge to family declined from 8.0 in Fiscal 2020 to 7.5 in Fiscal 2021. Placement stability performance continued to be strong and improving; the number of children moved from one foster care placement to another per 1,000 care days declined 14 percent from 1.4 in Fiscal 2020 to 1.2 in Fiscal 2021. Children's safety is ACS' top priority. The number of children for whom a child protective investigation found some credible evidence that maltreatment by foster parents may have occurred decreased from 7.3 incidents per 100,000 care days in Fiscal 2020 to 7.2 in Fiscal 2021 040008000120001600020000 FY 21 FY 20 FOR CHILDREN'S SERVICES | Page 4,196 3,798 3,105 2,592 * * Down * \u00ab Children placed in foster care in their community 28.7% 29.9% 24.2% 36.0% 8,341 7,827 7,639 \u00f2 \u00f2 Down homes (average) 2,761 2,883 3,177 3,115 3,225 * * Up * - Children in nonrelative foster boarding homes (average) 5,337 5,027 4,400 4,001 3,755 * * Down Down - Children in residential care (average) 823 821 764 711 659 * * Down Down \u00ab Children who re-enter foster care within a year of discharge to family (%)(preliminary) 6.2% 9.1% 9.8% 8.0% 7.4% 6.0% 6.0% Neutral Down in Foster Care (%) 82.2% 81.4% 81.9% 82.4% 78.7% * * Neutral Up Total days all children spent in foster care 4,062,642 3,923,854 3,686,234 3,538,806 3,406,169 * * Down Down \u00ab Number of moves in foster care per 1,000 care days 1.6 1.7 1.7 1.4 1.2 1.4 1.2 Down Down \u00ab Children maltreated during family foster care place - ment per 100,000 care days 6.7 7.5 9.7 7.3 7.2 5.0 5.0 Neutral Down \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 1d Encourage and support family-based foster care.

Given concerns about the limited operations of the Family Court during the pandemic, ACS has taken steps to move permanency forward for children and families that could be pursued with the agreement of all parties. 1,679 children were reunified in Fiscal 2021, in part due to ACS conducting proactive case reviews for thousands of children with the goal of reunification in order to identify cases that could safely progress to increased family time, trial discharge or final family reunification, with court approval when necessary. Due to limited court access, the percent of children who reunified within a year of entering foster care declined from 29.6 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 26.5 percent in Fiscal 2021 and the number of reunifications dropped by 8 percent from 1,834 in Fiscal 2020 to 1,679 in Fiscal 2021.

Child care voucher enrollment declined 22 percent from 64,324 in Fiscal 2020 to 50,266 in Fiscal 2021. This decrease was driven by a decline in the HRA cash assistance population with vouchers and by COVID-related reasons (program closures and parents' decisions not to send children to child care). Voucher enrollment for center-based care fell 18 percent to 25,496; vouchers for family-based child care went down 15 percent to 22,108 and vouchers for informal (home-based) child care decreased 63 percent to 2,663. Mandated voucher enrollment declined 33 percent to 26,251. Vouchers for other eligible children fell five percent to 24,015. The number of reports of suspected abuse and/or neglect for children in child care programs declined 49 percent from 442 in Fiscal 2020 to 224 in Fiscal 2020. Child Care investigations include alleged abuse or maltreatment of children perpetrated by someone who cares for children in a setting that is not the child's familial home and that requires state or local government approval and is subject to state laws, regulations and oversight. This includes, but is not limited to, NYC Early Care and Education programs. During this period, the percent of investigations for children in child care that found some credible evidence of abuse and/or neglect rose 1 percentage point to 20.5 percent.ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN'S SERVICES | Page 267 65,607 64,324 50,266 * * Down voucher enrollment 53,723 50,937 45,569 39,039 26,251 * * Down * children voucher enrollment 13,245 15,745 20,038 25,286 24,015 * * Up voucher enrollment 27,864 28,932 29,576 31,045 25,496 * * Neutral * care voucher enrollment 24,786 25,916 26,607 26,065 22,108 * * Neutral * care voucher enrollment 14,318 11,834 9,424 7,215 2,663 * * Down * Fiscal year spending per child - Center-based child care vouchers $9,149 $8,646 $8,726 $8,997 $9,869 * * Neutral * Fiscal year spending per child - Family child care vouchers $8,322 $7,740 $7,823 $7,860 $8,513 * * Neutral * Fiscal year spending per child - Legally exempt (informal child care) vouchers $4,234 $4,327 $4,379 $4,362 $5,495 * * Up * Abuse and/or neglect reports for children in child care 621 726 709 442 224 * * Down * Investigations for children in care that found credible evidence of abuse or neglect (%) 16.4% 14.1% 16.4% 19.5% 20.5% * * Up Down \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None SERVICE 3Provide custody and care of youth in secure and safe detention and placement facilities while providing casework services. Goal 3a Assure that detention facilities are safe and secure. During Fiscal 2021, admissions decreased from 1,442 in Fiscal 2020 to 987. This decline was largely the result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Driven by the decrease in admissions, the average daily population in detention fell eight percent to 118.9 from 128.7 during this period. The average length of stay rose 31 percent from 29 to 38 days. This increase can largely be attributed to delays in court adjudication due to the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with a decrease in the proportion of juvenile delinquents who tend to have shorter stays in care and increase in adolescent offenders who typically have longer stays. Assaults and altercations with injury and abuse/neglect declined during Fiscal 2021. The youth-on-youth assault and altercation with injury rate per 100 average daily population decreased from 0.35 in Fiscal 2020 to 0.34 in Fiscal 2021.The youth-on-staff assault with injury rate per 100 average daily population declined from 0.30 to 0.27. The rate of cases in detention where credible evidence of abuse and/or neglect was found fell from 0.13 to 0.08. ACS continues to refine its behavior management system (STRIVE+), enhance training through embedded coaching techniques focusing on effective methods of deescalating and engaging youth, work with community providers such as violence interrupters and work with oversight agencies to explore additional improvement strategies in the new context of a substantially older youth population. The weapon recovery rate per 100 daily population in detention increased from 0.22 in Fiscal 2020 to 0.25 in Fiscal 2021 and the illegal substance/prescription or over-the-counter medication recovery rate rose from 0.07 to 0.14. ACS continues to work closely with its state oversight agencies on the development and deployment of practices to better identify and remove contraband for secure detention facilities. ACS is also working closely with the Department of Investigation to conduct canine searches in detention and continues to work towards building its own internal capacity in this area. Additionally, search teams and protocols have been developed which has led to an increase in contraband recovery. The number of young people entering Close to Home placement declined 35 percent from 110 in Fiscal 2020 to 71 in Fiscal 2021. The average number of youth in Close to Home placement fell 25 percent from 87 to 65. These decreases were largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and a dramatic slowdown in court processing within Family Court. The average number of young people in aftercare declined 49 percent from 40.5 to 20.6. Similarly releases to Close to Home aftercare declined from 80 to 48 and discharges from Close to Home with complete disposition orders fell from 83 to 77 as a result of having fewer youth in the continuum. Close to Home youth-on-youth assaults and altercations with injury per 100 care days declined from 0.11 to 0.07 and youth-on-staff assaults with injury declined from 0.09 to 0.07. These critical incidents reached historic lows largely due to improved execution of the safe utilization of physical interventions and by ensuring that effective programming and youth Page 268 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT engagement is occurring within the programs. The absent without consent (AWOC) rate fell from 0.27 in Fiscal 2020 to 0.22 in Fiscal 2021. The continued decrease in AWOCs is due to the mitigating measures taken by the providers to ensure the safety and security of youth. The continued collaboration between ACS and the Close to Home provider agencies remains our highest priority with an emphasis on ensuring the safety and security of youth and staff.

DHS collaborates with not-for- profit partners to provide temporary shelter and services that New Yorkers experiencing homelessness need to achieve and maintain housing permanency. In February 2017, Mayor de Blasio released a comprehensive plan to turn the tide on homelessness, neighborhood by neighborhood; followed by \"The Journey Home\" in December 2019, an action plan to end long-term street homelessness.FOCUS ON EQUITY In New York City and throughout the United States, homelessness is driven by income and racial inequities, lack of affordable and supportive housing and stagnant wages combined with social factors, including domestic violence, de-institutionalization of persons who have mental illness without sufficient community-based services and discharges from a range of institutions. DHS addresses homelessness by connecting New Yorkers to preventive services that help them remain in their homes and, when prevention is not an option, by providing safe and appropriate transitional shelter, services to unsheltered New Yorkers, and placement into permanent subsidized and supportive housing. In partnership with the Human Resources Administration (HRA) and other agencies, DHS provides access to targeted rental assistance to help eligible families and individuals avoid or exit shelter. In Fiscal 2016 Mayor de Blasio announced a comprehensive plan to reform the delivery of homeless services in New York City. \"Turning the Tide,\" a report issued in February 2017, laid out a blueprint for moving forward with the reforms, providing borough-based services and shrinking the footprint of the shelter system by closing 360 facilities, including eliminating the 21-year old \"cluster\" apartment program. In December 2019, DHS announced \"The Journey Home,\" an action plan to end long-term street homelessness with enhanced efforts around new permanent housing, and safe havens, outreach, and cross-agency collaborative interventions to bring these solutions to those New Yorkers who have been the hardest to reach. People of color, particularly African-Americans, are over-represented among those who are experiencing homelessness, both in New York City and throughout the country. Poverty is a strong predictor of homelessness; and Black families and individuals are more likely to experience poverty, especially deep poverty, than their White counterparts. Higher incarceration rates, especially for Black men, are also linked to increased risk of homelessness. Mayor de Blasio's investment in services that strengthen communities; services in shelter that provide people with tools to move out of poverty; and the development of stable permanent housing and rental assistance programs provide a foundation to counteract these historic inequities.Page 272 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Provide temporary emergency housing to homeless individuals and families.

Goal 1a Ensure that individuals and families have access to emergency shelter and are immediately connected to appropriate mainstream resources. In Fiscal 2021, the average number of adult families and families with children in shelter per day declined by 19.2 percent and 16.2 percent respectively compared to the prior year, driven primarily by fewer entrants to shelter and continuing exits to permanent housing despite the pandemic. Adult families and families with children entering DHS shelter decreased by 52.8 percent and 39.5 percent, respectively. DHS has made progress reducing the number of families experiencing homelessness and residing in shelter on any given night, with the peak number of individuals in those families declining by over 10,000 between 2014 and 2021. The decline of families in shelter began prior to the pandemic and can be attributed, in part, to several factors: the increase in legal services funding over the last few years; an increase in payments for rent arrears and a resultant decline in evictions; and increases in subsidized housing placements since the inception of the City's rental assistance and rehousing programs in 2014. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was correlated with a further decline in family shelter entries, as evictions were suspended, some families may have sheltered in place, and exits to subsidized housing continued. The average number of single adults in shelter per day increased by 6.8 percent over the previous period. While the number of new single adult entrants declined, the average length of stay continued to increase, contributing to the census growth. Compounding the lack of affordable and supportive housing, COVID-19 public health measures made it especially challenging to place single adults into permanent housing. DHS continues to focus on addressing the housing and services needs of those longest in shelter, including through targeted interventions for elderly clients and clients with disabilities. In Fiscal 2021, 57.6 percent of families with children entering shelter received an initial placement according to the youngest school-aged child's school address, a 2.3 percentage point increase compared to Fiscal 2020. In Fiscal 2021, 75.4 percent of families with children in shelter resided in an ongoing shelter placement in the borough of their youngest child's school. All families with children in shelter have access to dedicated licensed social workers who conduct behavioral health assessments, developmental screenings for children, and provide services to help address barriers to permanent housing. These clinicians served 80 percent of families in shelter in Fiscal 2021, essentially the same as in Fiscal 2020.

The rate of serious incidents increased in all three systems, driven almost entirely by health-related categories. COVID-related incidents, including quarantining of both staff and clients for contagious diseases, accounted for more than a quarter of the overall increase in serious incidents. Additionally, the Agency's Serious Incident Unit (SIU), a centralized unit for all incident reporting that operates 24 hours a day, year-round, continued its new quality assurance review process and staff were retrained during the fiscal year, resulting in more accurate reporting and tracking. There were increases in the average daily cost of shelter for single adult and adult family shelter. Despite a decline in the nightly cost of commercial hotel rooms used for shelter, the increase of 5.4 percent in the cost of adult shelter was primarily due to the use of several thousand additional commercial hotel rooms, beginning in April 2020, in order to de- densify congregate shelters and prevent the spread of COVID-19. For both single adults and adult families the continuing replacement of older, low quality facilities with new, borough-based programs also contributed to the increase. Family with Children shelter rates declined by four percent due to a combination of the lower nightly cost of commercial hotels and fewer numbers of families in these facilities as more families were placed in the new borough-based shelters.

Goal 2a Facilitate exits and minimize clients' length of stay in shelters. Homeless clients continue to be placed into permanent, stable housing through a variety of City and federally funded rental assistance programs and prior to the pandemic, exits to permanent housing were increasing for all populations. However, efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19, which encouraged New Yorkers, including landlords and brokers, to remain inside as much as possible, resulted in a sharp decline in apartment showings before DHS shifted to virtual showings. Placements to permanent housing for single adults and families with children declined in Fiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020 as a result. Single adult exits to permanent housing decreased by 17.2 percent and families with children exits to permanent housing decreased by 10.1 percent compared to Fiscal 2020. Adult family exits to permanent housing increased by 6.7 percent compared to Fiscal 2020. DHS staff continued to assist clients in finding and moving into permanent housing during the pandemic to the extent possible and, in accordance with City safety guidance, have added remote alternatives to the normally in-person housing search process. Average length of stay increased for all populations. While there were fewer entrants to shelter compared to the prior period, this led to fewer families and individuals with short-term stays and resulted in an increased proportion of the population with long-term stays in shelter.

Goal 3a Reduce the number of unsheltered homeless individuals. The annual Homeless Outreach Population Estimate (HOPE) street homeless survey was conducted from January 26 to January 29, 2021. The Fiscal 2021 HOPE survey was conducted amid a global pandemic requiring changes to the methodology, including expanding the survey to take place over four nights, to maintain health and safety. The survey found 2,376 unsheltered individuals, a decrease of 38.4 percent compared to Fiscal 2020, and 45.9 percent fewer than the 4,395 in the first survey in Fiscal 2005. The survey also found that the number of unsheltered individuals in the subways declined by 23.4 percent. In addition, to respond to the COVID-19 crisis and the related MTA overnight shutdown, the City increased efforts to engage individuals in shelter services, particularly at End of Line subway stations and opened more than 1,300 specialized beds to serve unsheltered individuals.Page 276 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT Through an unprecedented investment to enhance the work of street outreach programs, significant progress has been made in placing individuals experiencing unsheltered homelessness into housing. In Fiscal 2021, HOME-STAT outreach workers referred 5,454 clients to placements in permanent housing, transitional programs, and other stable settings, nearly doubling the number of clients referred prior to Fiscal 2020. Before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, 24/7 outreach efforts have continued\u2014with outreach teams extending a helping hand to New Yorkers experiencing unsheltered homelessness on the streets and in the subways around the clock. The End of Line (EOL) initiative during the MTA overnight shutdown contributed to the large increase in referrals compared to 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. The EOL initiative was created to help unsheltered individuals who would otherwise have been displaced due to nightly subway system-wide closures between 1:00 and 5:00 A.M. in order for the subway system to be cleaned to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This is due in part to the implementation of a telework policy instituted in March 2020 for many staff, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure continuity of services. Permitting employees in non-direct service sites to work from home has resulted in fewer employees having to report to an agency work site, which contributed to the decrease in workplace injuries as well as collisions involving City vehicles.

DHS and DSS continued the processes implemented in Fiscal 2020, which included a dedicated team to follow up on and send reminder alerts to responsible programs if they have not responded within the required timeframe. Additionally, the DSS correspondence system, Intranet Quorum (IQ), auto generates daily reports with all letters that still have outstanding responses; the reports are monitored daily by DSS managers. This contributed greatly to the increase in the response rate. Completed requests for interpretation increased by 40.0 percent from 18,660 in Fiscal 2020, to 26,123 in Fiscal 2021. This increase is largely due to DHS giving shelter providers access to Agency interpretation services in Fiscal 2020. The agency also increased training for staff on language access and, due to the pandemic, increased the use of telephonic interpretation services.DEPARTMENT OF HOMELESS SERVICES | Page 277 Performance Indicators Actual Target Trend Customer Experience FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 15,957 18,660 26,123 * * Up * Letters responded to in 14 days (%) NA 82% 88% 98% 100% * * NA Up E-mails responded to in 14 days (%) NA 65% 99% 99% 99% * * NA Up Average wait time to speak with a customer service agent (minutes) 6 5 4 50 55 * * Up Down CORE facility rating 92 100 NA 94 100 * * NA Up \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None AGENCY amounts for the current fiscal year are not yet final.

Average school attendance rate for children in the DHS shelter services system for the 2020-21 school year will be reported in the Fiscal 2022 Preliminary Mayor's Management Report. A change was made to the methodology of counting serious incidents to address situations in which a resident is in possession of a knife, but the knife is not involved in the incident. Beginning in January 2021, any incident where there was a knife present was automatically characterized in the most serious category regardless of whether the knife was used during the incident. DHS updated the methodology for capturing the \"Average customer in-person wait time (minutes)\" and adjusted previously reported figures from Fiscal 2019 through Fiscal 2021. Previously, this indicator measured only the time that it took for a client's case to get transferred to the proper service queue after arriving at PATH. However, once the client's case is transferred to that service queue there is an additional wait time before the client speaks to a customer service agent. This additional time was not captured in the previous methodology. The methodology for fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021, the years for which data is available, has been updated to reflect total client wait time from when they arrive at PATH to when they speak to a customer service agent.

The COVID 19 pandemic has impacted various services, including the temporary closing (recently reopened) of Older Adult Center physical sites and the implementation of the NYC GetFood Program in Fiscal 2020. In Fiscal 2021, DFTA's in-house and contracted providers, as well as volunteers, made contact with over 218,000 older New Yorkers. The Department continues to support a broad range of services, both directly and through over 400 direct service contracts, which include discretionary funds with community- based organizations. Additionally, DFTA's call center (Aging Connect) directly receives hundreds of calls each day from older adults, their caregivers, and other members of the public seeking aging services and support.FOCUS ON EQUITY The NYC Department for the Aging (DFTA) promotes, administers and coordinates the development and provision of vital community services that can help older New Yorkers aged 60+ within the 5 boroughs of New York City stay healthy and independent. DFTA and its providers are committed to ensuring that all older New Yorkers, especially the historically under-served, obtain the services they need. The historically underserved among older New Yorkers include people of color (especially Black/African Americans and Native Americans/Alaskan Natives), immigrants and other individuals with limited English proficiency, and those who are low income (particularly minorities). Always seeking to increase equity, DFTA aims to connect with the full range of older people in the City based on demographics, immigrant status and other factors, in order to link interested seniors from all backgrounds and with varied demographic characteristics with services and activities that promote their health and well-being. Procurements are an important vehicle that DFTA uses to promote equity; through solicitations, DFTA emphasizes the need for provider candidates to demonstrate how they will achieve cultural competence among staff related to the population groups in their catchment areas, how they will conduct outreach and marketing efforts to attract the full range of groups to their programs, and the types of programming that they will offer to meet the needs of these groups. This year, DFTA released an Older Adult Center (OAC; aka senior centers) and Naturally Occurring Retirement Community (NORC) Supportive Service Programs Request for Proposals (RFP). A centerpiece of the vision for this RFP is the planned investment in establishing new centers and/or NORCs in up to 25 community districts, many of which are among those neighborhoods identified by the City as needing an infusion of resources to promote greater equity for low income, ethnically diverse, immigrant and other groups with particularly great needs. This year, $5.5 million has been dedicated to the Fiscal 2022 purchase of devices, connectivity, training and technical assistance to be made available to 10,000 low income, older New Yorkers and to put in place a service finder to ease access among older people throughout New York City from all backgrounds to virtual programming.Page 280 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Provide health and nutrition opportunities to older New Yorkers. Goal 1a Increase utilization of senior centers. SERVICE 2 Provide supportive services for seniors. Goal 2a Increase supportive services to the homebound. Goal 2b Increase supportive services to caregivers.DEPARTMENT FOR THE AGING | Page 281 HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 SERVICE 1Provide health and nutrition opportunities to older New Yorkers. Goal 1a Increase utilization of senior centers. The Department for the Aging's Older Adult Centers provide opportunities for older New Yorkers to access nutrition and health services, recreation, socialization, volunteerism, and education. During Fiscal 2021 these services were provided virtually, with over 149,000 individual older New Yorkers served by DFTA's 249 DFTA-funded centers and 66 affiliated sites, an increase of approximately 20 percent. In addition to the virtual programming provided during the pandemic, Older Adult Centers continued to make social engagement and wellness calls to clients, as well as calls to connect clients to vaccination sites. Many of these services were provided virtually with DFTA funded sites citywide providing over 6,000 virtual programs and events. During Fiscal 2021, due to the ongoing pandemic closures, no congregate meals were served. Older adults have high rates of late-onset mental health disorders, yet low rates of assessment and treatment. DFTA partners with the Mayor's Office of Mental Health (formerly ThriveNYC) to provide mental health support to older New Yorkers through DFTA's Geriatric Mental Health Initiative (DGMH). DGMH places mental health clinicians in centers; they lead educational games and have open conversations with older adults about anxiety and depression. Clinicians also screen participants for depression, provide on-site counseling, and give referrals. Older New Yorkers 60 and older do not have to be a member of an Older Adult Center to see a mental health professional. Before this initiative, many seniors went without ready access to mental health support. In Fiscal 2021, clinicians worked with 48 senior centers: over 2,500 seniors participated in presentations on mental health, over 678 participated in structured engagement activities, and over 800 experiencing mental health issues were treated through this initiative. Clinicians continue to provide tele-mental health services to existing clients and conduct new client assessments by telephone during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Goal 2a Increase supportive services to the homebound. DFTA continues to support homebound older New Yorkers through its case management, home care, and home delivered meal programs. During Fiscal 2021, hours of case management remained stable with 562,899 hours provided; 35,153 older New Yorkers were served by case management providers, a decrease of 8 percent in comparison to last year. DFTA funded home care services to help functionally impaired older New Yorkers live safely at home. Home care services include assistance with personal care, housekeeping and chores. The number of home care recipients decreased by 10 percent and hours decreased by 9 percent in comparison to last fiscal year, with 3,386 homebound older New Yorkers receiving 1,146,986 hours of home care services. These decreases continue to be due to client and homecare worker fear of contracting and spreading coronavirus by entering the homes of older New Yorkers. Eligible homebound older New Yorkers have a choice of daily delivery of hot meals, or twice-weekly delivery of frozen meals. This year DFTA's Home Delivered Meal providers served to 26,398 homebound older New Yorkers 4.25 million home delivered meals, a decrease of 9 percent compared to the same period in Fiscal 2020. This decrease is due to DFTA's return to serving traditional home delivered meals after the pandemic enrollment of older New Yorkers who normally would not qualify for this meal type. To qualify for a DFTA funded home delivered meal one be must be a New York City resident who has been determined to meet the following criteria: is 60 years of age or older; is unable to attend a congregate meals site due to accident, illness or frailty; lacks formal or informal supports (family, friends or neighbors) who can regularly provide Page 282 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT meals; and is able to live safely at home if home delivered meals services are provided. Potential clients must also be unable to prepare meals due to at least one of the following: lack of adequate cooking facility, such as refrigerator or stove; lack of knowledge or skills to prepare meals; is unable to safely prepare meals; or is unable to shop or cook. Please note that when it is in the best interest of the older person receiving a DFTA-funded home delivered meal, meals may also be provided to the client's spouse or domestic partner regardless of age or physical condition, and disabled individuals under 60 years of age living in the same household as the client.

DOE prepares students to meet grade level standards in reading, writing and math, and prepares high school students to graduate ready for college and careers. The School Construction Authority (SCA), reported separately, coordinates the development of DOE's Five-Year Capital Plan, selects and acquires sites for new schools, leases buildings for schools and supervises conversion of administrative space for classroom use.FOCUS ON EQUITY DOE is committed to putting every student on a path to college and a meaningful career. Equity and Excellence for All is an ambitious agenda and set of goals for New York City schools: by 2026, 86 percent of students will graduate high school on time, and three-fourths of graduates will be college ready. To reach these goals, DOE is focusing on: ensuring a strong foundation for students through its EarlyLearn, 3-K for All, Pre-K for All, and Universal Literacy programs; increasing student access to the courses they need to succeed, including Computer Science for All and AP for All; engaging students and families; and giving students and families additional support through College Access for All, Single Shepherd, and investment in Community Schools. Efforts to create more diverse and inclusive classrooms are also central to this work. Together, the Equity and Excellence for All initiatives are creating a pathway for every student to receive a world-class education and have the opportunity to reach their full potential.Page 288 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Educate New York City's children.

Goal 1a Improve academic achievement. For 2019-20 school year, the New York City four-year high school graduation rate was at a record high of 78.8 percent and the dropout rate was 5.8 percent. The graduation rate improved across all boroughs, supporting the goals of equity, equality and opportunity for all New York City residents. The COVID-19 pandemic posed enormous challenges throughout the 2020-21 school year. In September 2020, New York City was the only major school system in the United States to provide in-person instruction for students who elected that option. Though case surges in November led to a return to fully remote learning, 3k-5 schools reopened in December, with middle and high schools reopening in the spring. NYC public schools ended the school year with nearly 365,000 students attending school in person. The daily attendance rate declined to 89.5 percent in Fiscal 2021 from 91.8 percent in Fiscal 2020; during the 2020 reporting period DOE reported school attendance from September 2019-February 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the school year and pandemic, schools closely tracked student attendance and conducted exhaustive outreach to ensure the wellbeing of every student across the school system. The Fiscal 2021 class size data reflects unaudited enrollment information. In a typical year, students in K-8 are assigned to one official class. However, due to remote and blended learning in Fiscal 2021, new guidance was given to schools to assign students to different official classes depending on their blended or remote cohorts. How schools implemented and documented this change varied across the City, therefore this data may not reflect true class size.

Parent coordinators (PCs) connect families to their school communities and create opportunities for family empowerment. The 2020-21 school year continued to be a challenge due to COVID with face-to-face meetings and events suspended. Yet parent engagement indicators continued to show high levels of parent engagement. A year-to-year comparison shows some differences in numbers because of the circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in the technology that schools and parent coordinators used to connect with families. Phone calls responded to by parent coordinators or parent engagement designees increased by 44 percent, and the number of school-based workshops for parents increased by 65 percent, from 35,000 to 57,709, which can be attributed to the fact that most interaction between schools and parents happened by phone or online during the pandemic. However, the number of in-person consultations between parents and parent coordinators declined by 57 percent, from 1,204,000 to 522,665. Parent coordinators have mobilized during this crisis to make frequent outreach to families. Other indicators\u2014such as in- person consultation and parent workshops\u2014showed declines because most families were not entering the school's premises. Instead, there was an increased use of other parental engagement options that are not captured by standard activity reports. Mobile engagement apps and online meeting platforms provided ongoing news and support and allowed parents to participate in workshops virtually and in multiple languages. Parent Coordinators have been professionally developed to use technology and to coach and support families in remote learning, and the Department continues to promote parent engagement through and during the pandemic. Additionally, DOE has held several virtual Family and Student Information Sessions to provide up to date information about back to school, remote and blended learning, testing and tracing, safety and cleaning protocols and mental health supports. Schools and districts continue to host back-to-school orientations, curriculum nights and offer ongoing support and training so that families can become actively engaged, involved and empowered to effectively support and advocate for the educational success of their children.

Goal 2a Improve the ability of English Language Learners to learn English and improve academic progress. The number of English Language Learners (ELLs) increased from 142,000 to 147,000 partially due to the cancellation of Spring New York State Assessments such as the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) and NYSITELL Waivers for newly enrolled students attending school fully-remotely during the 2020-21 school year. Those students identified as needing ELL services by their school were considered as provisionally identified ELLs and included in the number of ELLs. The percentage of ELLs testing out for 2020-21 school year will be reported in the Fiscal 2022 Preliminary Mayor's Management Report. as English Language Learners (000) 160 159 154 142 147 * * Down * English Language Learners testing out of ELL Programs (%) 15.6% 18.1% 20.7% NA NA 19.1% 19.1% NA Up \u00ab English Language Learners testing out of ELL status who did so within 3 years (%) 55.5% 50.9% 48.9% NA NA 51.9% 51.9% NA Up \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 2b Improve the ability of students with disabilities to progress academically and socially. For the 2020-21 school year, there was a decrease in overall special education enrollment, as well as the number of students initially recommended for special education and the number of students no longer in need of special education. These decreases are attributable to the effects of the pandemic. The fact that the decrease in preschool special education enrollment (-18 percent) was more pronounced than the decrease in school-age special education enrollment (-3.2 percent), is attributable to the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on preschool enrollment and the fact that preschool is not compulsory, resulting in a decrease in the number of students initially recommended for special education. DOE is focused on ensuring that students of all ages who may be in need of special education are promptly referred and evaluated, and that evaluations in progress are completed as quickly as possible, to prevent any delays in the delivery of appropriate programs and services.

The Department is committed to ensuring that all students graduate ready for future success in college and careers. Post- secondary school enrollment reached a record high of 62.8 percent for the cohort that graduated in the 2018-19 school year. To meet New York City's College Readiness Index, students must achieve target scores in mathematics and English on the Regents, SAT, ACT or CUNY assessments. During the 2019-20 school year, the percentage of students meeting the standard rose to 57.7 percent, a gain of 2.8 percentage points over the previous year. The increase was partially driven by changes to CUNY math remediation requirements and New York State math Regents exams.

DOE's work with the School Safety Division includes establishing safety protocols and procedures in schools, developing school safety and emergency preparedness plans and maintaining a safe environment for students and staff. In addition, the Department's Office of Safety and Youth Development works closely with schools to provide a safe, supportive and inclusive environment by investing in and expanding successful school climate programs\u2014including restorative trainings, mental health programs and social-emotional supports. The NYPD reported fewer felony school safety incidents as felony incidents declined from 288 to 85. At the same time, incidents in other criminal categories fell by 83 percent, from 976 to 169. Non-criminal incidents declined by 84 percent, from 2,912 to 461. New York City is forming a task force to transition school safety agents from the NYPD to DOE over the course of two years. Beginning with Fiscal 2019 data, New York State mandated a new report to standardize reporting of expenses by school across all districts in the state. Under the new guidance, debt service, transportation, school food, and nonpublic school costs, among other costs, are no longer reported in statewide per pupil expenditures. Additionally, under this methodology, funds not included in school budgets are divided evenly across all schools, resulting in changes to per pupil expenses across different school types. DOE will be reporting expenditures in this manner from Fiscal 2019 forward.

SCA has set its priorities, including reducing overcrowding, upgrading schools, and improving access to technology to reflect this commitment. The Fiscal 2020-2024 Capital Plan creates tens of thousands of new seats in areas projected for enrollment growth, directly addressing current and projected overcrowding, and the goal of creating additional high-quality, full-day pre-kindergarten and 3-K seats for neighborhoods throughout the City. Furthermore, the Capital Plan calls for much-needed improvements for aging infrastructure as well as enhancements to ensure more equitable access by all children throughout the five boroughs.Page 300 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Design and construct new schools, additions and capital improvement projects authorized by the Department of Education's Five-Year Capital Plan.

DYCD's diverse range of programs includes services to help low- income individuals and families become more self-sufficient, literacy programs that help adults and adolescents further their education and advance their careers and programs that assist immigrants. DYCD's afterschool programs, known as COMPASS NYC (Comprehensive After-School System of NYC), offer school-age youth a mix of recreational activities, arts and cultural experiences, academic support and physical fitness programs when school is out. As part of the City's broader commitment to providing free afterschool programs to all middle school students, SONYC (School's Out NYC), a component of COMPASS, provides opportunities for more than 70,000 young people in grades six to eight, including justice involved youth and young people living in Department of Homeless Services' family shelters. DYCD also oversees the City's portfolio of services for runaway and homeless youth and the City's youth workforce development system, known as Workforce Connect, providing summer employment and year-round services to introduce youth and young adults to the job market and help them develop the skills to succeed. The Department supports 190 community centers, including Beacon community centers in public schools and Cornerstone community centers in New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) developments which serve youth, adults and families.FOCUS ON EQUITY DYCD prioritizes investments in programs that aim to eliminate disparities in economic opportunity and well-being among New Yorkers and improve quality of life for all residents. During the current administration, DYCD achievements include a significant expansion in programs for young people, NYCHA residents, and runaway and homeless youth, including those who identify as transgender or non- binary. In order to continue to broaden access and heighten awareness of services, DYCD is improving protocols and systems used to assess community needs, enroll participants and track results, as well as supporting the expansion of provider networks and partnerships with City agencies to offer individuals and families pathways to holistic services. Most recently, DYCD incorporated an intersectional focus on equity into all its work, joining in the City's efforts to identify and remove barriers to opportunity based upon race, gender and sexual orientation. To continue to elevate this work, DYCD is committed to being a proactive anti- racist city agency. Supported by the Executive Team, this commitment has led to the adoption of goals that include an increase in professional development for internal staff, increased support for consultants of color, strengthening of the DYCD Equity Statement by increasing its accessibility and applicability, and assessments of how agency investments can greater serve historically marginalized New York City neighborhoods.Page 304 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Support youth development throughout New York City through the implementation, funding and management of contracts with nonprofit service providers. Goal 1a Maximize resources to support the involvement of young people in DYCD-funded programs and direct them toward positive outcomes. Goal 1b Runaway and homeless youth will reunite with their families or live independently. SERVICE 2 Increase youth capacity for economic independence through programs that provide work- related education, skills training and employment opportunities. Goal 2a Young people will complete DYCD-funded training and employment programs at high levels. Goal 2b Young people engaged in DYCD-funded training and employment programs will achieve success targeted by these programs. SERVICE 3 Support programs that provide participants with the services needed to increase and tap their capacity to strengthen and revitalize the communities of New York City. Goal 3a Maximize participation in and effectiveness of community antipoverty initiatives for youth, adults and seniors in lower income neighborhoods, including Neighborhood Development Area (NDA) and Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity) programs. Goal 3b Maximize participation and success in programs improving English literacy skills among adults, adolescents, children and recent immigrants. Goal 3c Maximize the number of New York City immigrants receiving services that improve language and employment skills that help families successfully integrate into their new communities.DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT | Page 305 HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 SERVICE 1Support youth development throughout New York City through the implementation, funding and management of contracts with nonprofit service providers. Goal 1aMaximize resources to support the involvement of young people in DYCD-funded programs and direct them toward positive outcomes. In Fiscal 2021, DYCD-funded programs provided a variety of educational, social, cultural, recreational, and employment- related opportunities to 209,955 New York City youth. The majority of youth were served through one of four program areas in the DYCD portfolio: COMPASS NYC, Summer Youth Employment Program, Beacon, and Cornerstone. Summer services in these programs were initially suspended due to City-wide budget shortfalls and uncertainty about safety and capacity. These summer programs were later partially reinstated. From this difficulty and continued challenges in enrollment and participation related to social distancing, along with temporary COVID-19 related site closures, DYCD experienced lower enrollment in many areas in Fiscal 2021. In addition, many COMPASS, Beacon, and Cornerstone providers also offered Learning Lab services to their communities to provide a safe space, along with technology support, for students to engage in their Department of Education remote learning. COMPASS NYC, which offers after-school programming to students enrolled in grades K through 12, served 90,148 youth in Fiscal 2021, down from 122,575 in Fiscal 2020. Total enrollment represents 96 percent of funded slots. Due to COVID-19, COMPASS providers utilized both in-person and remote programming in order to implement safe and engaging services for youth. The well-being of participants was a priority during this difficult time, and providers offered increased activities to support emotional health such as yoga, journaling, and wellness check-in calls. Beacon programs, operated in 91 school-based community centers, served 32,261 young people and 31,848 adults in Fiscal 2021, representing 92 percent of the minimum target enrollment. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple school closures, these school-based programs were limited to serving the host school population, reducing participation particularly among adults. However, Beacon programs were able to offer pivotal enrichment and support activities to youth and adults, including participation in remote services such as wellness calls, healthy living exercise classes, cooking classes, and college prep support services to maintain community engagement during COVID-19. Cornerstone programs, operated in 99 community centers located in New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) developments including five new centers opened this year, served 13,488 young people and 5,304 adults in Fiscal 2021, representing 96 percent of the minimum target enrollment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple closures and overall community concerns about in-person services led to a reduction in the participation level of older youth and adults. However, Cornerstone Community Centers were an essential resource to the community. They became a lifeline for the community residents by providing meals, serving as vaccination sites, PPE distributors and general support services.Page 306 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT 324,667 337,199 337,599 339,963 209,955 * * Down Up Comprehensive After School System of NYC (COMPASS NYC) enrollment 124,258 126,203 122,390 122,575 90,148 110,000 110,000 Down * \u00ab COMPASS NYC programs meeting target enrollment (school year) (%) 96% 96% 93% 66% 85% 85% Down NYC programs meeting target enrollment - SONYC/ middle school (school year) (%) 85% 85% Down Up \u00ab COMPASS NYC programs meeting target enrollment - elementary (school year) (%) 99% 99% 98% 92% 64% 90% 90% Down Up (%) 81% 73% 75% 83% 18% 80% 80% Down Up Beacon programs enrollment as a percentage of the annual target (%) 100% 100% 100% 100% 92% 100% 100% Neutral Up Beacon programs active 80 91 91 91 91 * * Up * Youth served in Beacon programs 75,107 76,872 74,142 92,692 32,261 * * Down Beacon programs 72,995 63,273 46,708 85,927 31,848 * * Down * Cornerstone programs enrollment as a percentage of the annual target (%) 100% 100% 100% 100% 96% 100% 100% Neutral Up Cornerstone programs active 94 94 94 94 99 * * Neutral Up Youth served in Cornerstone programs 27,012 20,856 25,831 19,976 13,488 * * Down Cornerstone programs 8,128 5,253 4,426 5,594 5,304 * * Down Up Calls to Community Connect 40,586 46,496 52,309 NA NA 50,000 50,000 NA Up \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 1b Runaway and homeless youth will reunite with their families or live independently. In Fiscal 2021 DYCD continued its commitment to residential service offerings for runaway and homeless youth (RHY) ages 16 to 20, and for homeless young adults (HYA) ages 21 to 24, with an addition of 35 beds for a total of 813. These essential programs remained operational in person throughout Fiscal 2021. COVID-19 impacted demand in congregate settings, leading to slight decreases in youth and young adults served in both Crisis Services (3 percent) and TIL Support Programs (5 percent).The utilization rate for these beds decreased in Crisis Services (15 percentage points) and TIL Support Programs (8 percentage points) because programs saw decreased demand for congregate housing during the pandemic. The percent of youth reunited with family or placed in a suitable environment decreased by 3 percentage points in Crisis Services due to youth leaving crisis centers without reporting their next residence. Youth placements held even for TIL Support Programs at 88 percent, above the target of 85 percent. A total of 2,794 youth received mental health support through RHY programming, an increase of 6 percent over Fiscal 2020.DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT | Page 307 Performance Direction Youth and young adults reunited with family or placed in a suit - able environment from Crisis Services Programs (%) 77% 73% 75% 65% 62% 75% 75% Down Up Youth and young adults reunited with family or placed in a suitable environment from Transitional Independent Living (TIL) Support Programs (%) 87% 84% 83% 88% 88% 85% 85% Neutral Up Residential beds for runaway or homeless youth and homeless young adults 465 557 674 778 813 * * Up * Runaway and homeless youth and homeless young adults served - Crisis Services Programs 2,340 2,267 2,084 2,191 2,124 2,400 2,400 Neutral * Runaway and homeless youth and homeless young adults served - Transitional Independent Living (TIL) Support Programs 659 837 986 1,247 1,183 800 800 Up * Utilization rate for Crisis Programs (%) 92% 90% 92% 84% 69% 90% 90% Down Up Utilization rate for Transitional Independent Living (TIL) Support Programs (%) 93% 89% 91% 84% 77% 90% 90% Down Up Young people who received mental health support in a city- funded residential program or drop-in center serving runaway and homeless youth NA NA 2,569 2,648 2,794 * * NA * \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None SERVICE 2Increase youth capacity for economic independence through programs that provide work- related education, skills training and employment opportunities. Goal 2a Young people will complete DYCD-funded training and employment programs at high levels. The Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) provides young people with career exploration opportunities. Because of social distancing concerns and City-wide budget shortfalls, SYEP was initially suspended and later partially reinstated as Summer Bridge with an online curriculum through Hats and Ladders along with Project-Based Learning opportunities. A total of 35,198 youth participated in this modified SYEP experience. There were a total of 1,309 projects that provided youth the opportunity to work in groups on project themes such as Community Advocacy/Participation, STEAM, Media Literacy, Economic Equity, Environmental Justice, DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), and Census. DYCD's federally funded Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Train & Earn programs served 1,270 participants in Fiscal 2021, a 6 percent increase over Fiscal 2020 and just below the target of 1,276. The WIOA Learn & Earn programs served 1,460 participants in Fiscal 2021, well above the target of 1,056.

During the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, New York City's libraries offered these programs, services, and resources virtually as the systems quickly shifted to an expanded online presence. Since full-service restoration in July 2021, the libraries have resumed providing many of these services in person while maintaining their digital and remote services. FOCUS ON EQUITY Whether amid system-wide closure during the pandemic, or the City's current recovery stage, the Brooklyn Public Library, New York Public Library, and Queens Public Library prioritize equitable service delivery to patrons. During the COVID-19 pandemic the Libraries expanded their online presence to ensure access to information, resources, and programs for all New Yorkers through webinars, classes, book clubs, live tutoring and career/financial counseling that supported schools, jobseekers and students, among others. But Brooklyn Public Library, New York Public Library, and Queens Public Library know that many of our patrons on the wrong side of the digital divide can only access our services in person. This is why we supplemented these offerings with our limited in-person services, maintenance of our Wi-Fi networks, and the distribution of thousands of reading materials as part of our 2020 summer reading programs. The high volume of patrons who exclusively engage with their libraries in person is the primary reason we prioritized full-service restoration as soon as it was safely possible. The City's library systems reopened at full capacity July 2021 (following a phased reopening that began in July 2020), which included the full complement of services such as general space use, programs, and classes incrementally reinstituted as quickly as circumstances allowed. Maintaining our commitment to equity during this critical stage of recovery and beyond means adjusting to a \"new normal.\" We are now applying what we learned during the pandemic to new initiatives like outdoor programming and the continued offering of our digital and remote services. We are balancing these lessons learned with our priority to reconnect with those New Yorkers we lost touch with during closure. Many of these patrons were adversely impacted by COVID-19. The Brooklyn, New York, and Queens Public Library systems are committed to restoring these citizens to a place of security with the space to learn and find opportunities. The Libraries are working with local Community Based Organizations, housing and tenant associations, and elected officials to reconnect with communities through activities such as tabling and the distribution of materials. The Libraries also aim to increase the number of adult New Yorkers that are empowered to use technology with a focus on immigrant and workforce readiness populations and workplace-valued or marketable technology skills. Achieving these goals within a \"new normal\" means implementing a strategy for a hybrid model of course delivery in addition to our current service models of in-person and online programming.

The Libraries temporarily closed all branch and research center locations beginning on Saturday, March 14, 2020 to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. On July 13, 2020, the library systems began a limited reopening, starting with 22 branches across all systems providing Grab-and-Go in-person service; in the following months, this number grew to 120. The Libraries future reopening plans and ability to establish targets for its service were significantly compromised by the unpredictable nature of the COVID-19 crisis; for example, on November 16, 2020, the Libraries rolled back Phase 2 of the reopening plan (which was set to expand in-person services) due to rising infection rates; other branches on Staten Island were closed entirely due to their area's designation as an Orange Zone. For 10 indicators in each library system, there are no targets for Fiscal 2021. The Libraries did not offer any in-person programs during closure, but instead transitioned to offering virtual programs for their patrons. The indicators 'Program sessions' and 'Program attendance' include live online program attendance during closure. As the libraries moved their programming to the virtual environment, they were careful about which platforms to use, keeping in mind a variety of issues including patron privacy, which has affected Fiscal 2021 program attendance figures. Brooklyn Public Library additionally includes the total views of recorded sessions for the first two days after the live program session occurred. New York Public Library additionally includes the total views of recorded programs for all programs that were created and posted during the reporting period. Queens Public Library additionally includes the total views of recorded content one month after the live program session occurred. New York Public Library - Research, because it could not offer in-person service, maintained and expanded digital services such as research database access. Since closure and through June 2021 New York Public Library - Research has recorded 849,000 database sessions by its patrons. New York Public Library and Queens Public Library adjusted Fiscal 2022 targets for 'Circulation (000)' because previously published targets were exceeded. New York Public Library and Queens Public Library adjusted Fiscal 2022 targets for 'Electronic visits to website (000)' because previously published targets were exceeded. PUBLIC LIBRARIES | Page 317 New York Public Library adjusted Fiscal 2022 targets for 'Library card holders (000)'. To improve the performance of circulation processes the libraries periodically purge long inactive patron records from the database of cardholders. Such a purge is planned in Fiscal 2022. For Brooklyn Public Library, previously published Fiscal 2020 data for the indicator 'Program attendance' was revised to reflect corrected data.

Matos Rodriguez, Chancellor CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK | Page 319 WHAT WE DO The City University of New York (CUNY) provides higher education to more than 261,000 degree and non- degree seeking students and offers adult and continuing education with over 185,000 course registrations. CUNY consists of 25 institutions: 11 senior colleges, seven community colleges, and seven graduate, honors and professional schools offering close to 60 doctoral programs. CUNY enrolls students in 1,900 academic programs and has approximately 7,000 full-time faculty and 11,300 part-time faculty. In the academic year 2019-2020, CUNY granted 9,400 graduate and professional degrees, 27,200 baccalaureate degrees, 18,500 associate degrees, 300 certificates and 1,100 advanced certificates.FOCUS ON EQUITY The City University of New York is of vital importance for the upward mobility of the people of New York City. Six of CUNY's senior colleges and six community colleges are among the top 10 nationwide in promoting social mobility, moving lower-income students into the middle class and beyond with excellent jobs. CUNY offers all levels of training, from certificate programs to doctoral degrees, and an unprecedented number of students currently take advantage of this opportunity to obtain an excellent and affordable education. CUNY serves the diverse people of New York City; 35 percent of CUNY students were born outside the US mainland, over 50 percent report an annual household income of less than $30,000 and two in three undergraduate students attend tuition-free. Last spring, over 56,500 new CUNY graduates entered the workforce or began work on more advanced degrees. In the key areas of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), the Mayor's critical multi-year investment in CUNY's community colleges continues to enable thousands of students to earn STEM degrees and enter New York City's vibrant high-tech sector. With funding from the City, CUNY has expanded its highly successful Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) initiative from 4,000 students in 2014-15, to 25,000 students each academic year. ASAP has more than doubled associate degree completion rates for participating students, aiming to graduate at least 50 percent of students in three years. ASAP is now considered a national model, having received the distinguished 2020 Innovations in American Government Award from the Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. In the academic year 2020-21, CUNY ASAP enrolled 23,118 (9,664 new) students and has served over 70,000 students since inception in 2007. Consistent with the Mayor's investment in STEM success, ASAP expansion has an explicit focus on serving more STEM majors and a campus-wide expansion at Bronx Community College that guides all eligible incoming first-time, full-time freshmen into ASAP . ASAP students are diverse and representative of the larger population of CUNY associate degree seeking students with 44 percent Hispanic, 33 percent Black, 13 percent Asian/Pacific Islander and 10 percent White. Over 85 percent of ASAP students receive federal Pell and/or New York State Tuition Assistance Program grants. ASAP students in all of these groups have three-year graduation rates of close to or above 50 percent. In addition, ASAP serves as an important entry point to CUNY's senior colleges with close to 60 percent of students transferring to a baccalaureate program within six years of entering ASAP .050001000015000200002500030000 FY 21 FY 20 FY 19 FY 17 FY 17Total Students Served in CUNY Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) 21,51425,507 23,118 15,47325,345Page 320 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 Performance Indicators Actual 8.5% 10.7% taught by full-time fac - Senior Colleges 40.8% 39.2% 39.0% 38.2% 36.5% * * Neutral Up equivalents (FTEs) taught by full-time fac - Community Colleges 52.8% 52.8% 51.8% 50.8% 50.1% 29:1 29:1 27:1 27:1 * Colleges 32:1 32:1 32:1 31:1 28:1 * * Colleges 27:1 28:1 28:1 26:1 27:1 * * Neutral Down Number by CUNY community colleges 2,182 2,284 2,309 2,143 2,071 * * Neutral Up Number awarded at community colleges 14,108 14,675 15,390 15,927 15,835 * * Up Up Students earning Grade C or better in Freshman Composition Courses (%) 84.1% 83.8% 83.6% 82.6% 77.7% * * Neutral Up Students earning Grade C or better in Math Gateway Courses (%) 67.4% 69.3% 69.0% 66.3% 78.5% * retention rate of full-time first-time fresh - men enrolled in CUNY of full-time first-time fresh - men enrolled in CUNY rate (%) - CUNY Acceler - ated Study in Associate 47.0% 50.0% 50.0% Down Up Six-year systemwide graduation rate (%) - community college students in STEM disciplines 30.7% Students passing the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurse (%) 86.3% 86.5% 90.1% 90.2% 89.5% * * Neutral Up \u00ab CUNY associate degree recipients who transfer to a CUNY bac - calaureate program within 54.8% 53.6% 56.0% 56.0% Neutral Up CUNY community college certificate and associate graduates from career and technical education programs who are employed six months after graduation (%) 77.1% 78.8% 80.3% 74.6% 63.2% * * Down Up CUNY community college certificate and associate graduates from career and technical education programs who are employed or continuing their education six months after graduation (%) 94.2% 92.3% 93.8% 94.4% 90.6% * * Neutral Up High school students participating in college preparation program (College Now) 32,072 32,900 33,181 33,904 30,852 * 272,957 274,099 274,906 271,242 261,134 * 204,337 205,860 206,950 204,395 198,483 * * Neutral * at CUNY community colleges 96,865 95,951 95,073 91,715 82,515 * * Down * \u00ab Enrollment in STEM disciplines at CUNY community colleges 15,053 15,186 14,811 14,216 13,008 15,000 15,000 Down Up Total students served in CUNY Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) 15,473 21,514 25,507 25,345 23,118 * * Up Up Enrollment in CUNY community colleges 18,506 18,098 18,512 18,615 15,788 * * Down * Enrollment in CUNY senior colleges 18,397 20,064 21,148 21,907 21,214 * * Up * Enrollment of first-time freshmen in CUNY community colleges who are recent graduates of NYC public high schools 13,589 13,344 12,916 13,350 12,038 * * Neutral * Annual tuition at CUNY community colleges (full-time NYS resident) $4,800 $4,800 $4,800 $4,800 $4,800 * * Neutral * Annual tuition at CUNY senior colleges (full-time NYS resident) $6,530 $6,730 $6,930 $6,930 $6,930 * * Neutral * Expenditures per student (full-time equivalent) at CUNY com - munity colleges $13,611 $14,950 $15,620 $16,664 $18,703 * * Up * Percentage of CUNY community college students receiving fed - eral financial aid (Pell) (%) 60.8% 63.4% 61.4% 61.7% 54.7% * * Neutral * Percentage of community college students receiving Tuition As - sistance Program (TAP) grants (%) 35.9% 36.6% 34.8% 33.5% 27.1% * * Down * \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * NoneCITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK | Page 321 AGENCY RESOURCES amounts for the current fiscal year are not yet final.

SBS runs the City's NYC Business Solutions Centers, Industrial Business Solutions Providers and Workforce1 Career Centers; provides grants and services to support the growth of local community and economic development organizations throughout the City, oversees the largest network of Business Improvements Districts (BIDs) in the country; and administers the Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE) Program.FOCUS ON EQUITY Equity and opportunity are at the core of SBS's work, and the key values of collaboration, innovation, and adaptability are woven into all it does - collaborating with community members to design programs and services that directly address their needs, recommending bold and innovative solutions, and adapting to a changing world. These values together lay the foundation for the department's three pillars\u2014good jobs, stronger businesses and thriving neighborhoods. SBS is committed to ensuring economic security for all New Yorkers by providing a wide range of services that help businesses, jobseekers and communities throughout the five boroughs. Through business programs such as Women Entrepreneurs NYC (WENYC), the agency has committed to providing customized services to 5,000 women entrepreneurs in underserved communities. As part of the City's Black entrepreneurship initiative (BE NYC), the agency established new public-private partnerships and launched new programming to address the racial wealth gap through business ownership and entrepreneurship in the Black community. In addition, SBS is addressing the racial wealth gap by overseeing certification and capacity building services for Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprises (M/WBE). To date, SBS has certified over 10,500 M/WBEs through Fiscal 2021, more than doubling the certified pool of M/WBEs, achieving a goal set by Mayor de Blasio in 2016.

Goal 4a Increase the number of Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprises (M/WBEs) that obtain City contracts.DEPARTMENT OF SMALL BUSINESS SERVICES | Page 325 HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 SERVICE 1Help businesses start, operate and expand in New York City. Goal 1a Ensure that businesses and entrepreneurs have easy access to a variety of high quality support services. In Fiscal 2021, SBS served 18,901 unique customers and businesses across the five boroughs and connected businesses to more than $25.4 million through federal programs including the Paycheck Protection Program, Economic Injury Disaster Loan, Shuttered Venue Operators Grant, Restaurant Revitalization Fund, and more. The Fair Share NYC initiative provided communication, webinars, and one-on-one assistance to ensure that NYC small businesses got the funds they needed to keep their doors open. SBS helped small businesses obtain 1,624 financing awards totaling $83.3 million, far exceeding both its annual goal and the volume of businesses helped in years prior to the pandemic. The number of awards and the award value decreased compared to the prior fiscal year because temporary federally funded COVID-relief programs, which in Fiscal 2020 served over 3,800 businesses, were no longer available in Fiscal 2021. This also caused a decrease in unique businesses served compared to Fiscal 2020, although the number of unique businesses served does not include the Business Restart Hotline created in June 2020 and the 28,784 calls received and responded to in Fiscal 2021 to help businesses impacted by COVID-19. There was a slight increase in the number of unique businesses served by SBS programs that help navigate government. The number of businesses opened with assistance from SBS decreased by 50% to 179, and the number of hires at those businesses also decreased by 50% to 1,702.

The Energy Cost Saving program (ECSP) and its companion program, the Lower Manhattan Energy Program (LMEP), help retain and attract eligible businesses by reducing energy cost associated with relocation or capital improvements. Lower energy costs are a significant incentive to promote business retention for firms and facilities seeking to move, modernize and/or expand. The programs save businesses up to 45 percent on eligible utility costs. Although the Energy Cost Savings Program (ECSP) was scheduled to expire at the end of Fiscal 2020, it has been extended until June 2023. During Fiscal 2021, ECSP approved 47 businesses for benefits representing 2,118 jobs. This is a lower number than last year because participants during Fiscal 2021 were generally smaller businesses, with fewer employees, which is the priority for the agency. These businesses used less energy, so their savings were proportionally lower. Also, due to the pandemic, some Page 326 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT anticipated projects were delayed or put on hold which included multi-tenant commercial and industrial renovation projects that could confer benefits to the smaller businesses renting space within the facilities. The Lower Manhattan Energy Program (LMEP) was also scheduled to expire but was extended until June 2023. The LMEP , measured on a cumulative basis, saved 296 commercial tenants over $4.57 million in energy costs during Fiscal 2021. This reflects a slight increase in tenancy from the prior year, but the aggregate annual savings was slightly less than last year because of a reduction in energy consumption due to COVID-19 and quarantine.

Goal 2a Ensure that businesses have timely access to qualified job applicants. The Workforce1 Career Center system served a total of 79,438 jobseekers in Fiscal 2021. These jobseekers were served exclusively online or over the phone as the Workforce1 Career Center system paused in-person services in mid-March 2020 due to COVID-19. New Yorkers successfully connected to 18,889 jobs with the support of Workforce1 in Fiscal 2021. The average hourly wage for the reporting period was $18.15, a 9% increase over Fiscal 2020. The reduction in number of job seekers served, walk-in traffic to centers, and hires as compared to last year is due to the impact of COVID-19. Fewer New Yorkers sought jobs due to the risk of exposure to the virus, and as employers struggled to remain open there were fewer opportunities to connect jobseekers to open positions SBS offers training designed with employer input to ensure the New Yorkers we train acquire in-demand skills and connect to quality jobs with real advancement opportunities in tech, healthcare, manufacturing, construction, transportation, food, media and entertainment. In Fiscal 2021, SBS enrolled 8,764 New Yorkers into trainings which were made available primarily online due to COVID-19. The significant increase in training enrollments compared to prior years was due to two unique initiatives in Fiscal 2021. The first was SBS's support in training New Yorkers to participate in the Vaccine For All Corps to deliver vaccines against COVID-19. The second was the delivery of Construction Site Safety training as part of Local Law 196. The full implementation deadline requiring 40 hours of training was March 1, 2021 and SBS enrolled a high volume of New Yorkers leading up to this deadline. This high volume of training enrollments in Fiscal 2021 will not occur in future years given the nature of these two initiatives.

Goal 3aStrengthen and expand New York City's Business Improvement District (BID) program and other local economic development organizations. SBS administers Commercial Revitalization Grants which help nonprofit Community-Based Development Organizations (CBDOs) serving low-to moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods assess their community needs and carry out merchant organizing, district marketing, beautification, and small business support. The Avenue NYC Program, funded via Federal Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), provided more than $1.24 million in grant awards to CBDOs to boost underserved neighborhoods through community development projects. In addition, SBS has awarded 20 CBDOs nearly $14 million over three and a half years to revitalize commercial corridors in 12 neighborhoods across the five boroughs as part of the Neighborhood 360\u00b0 initiative. As part of the response to the pandemic, in Fiscal 2021 SBS launched a Commercial District Recovery Grant for CBDOs to implement local COVID-19 recovery support to small storefront businesses and strengthen our commercial corridors. Over $1 million was awarded to 40 organizations in 51 neighborhoods through this grant initiative. SBS continued to build and support the City's Business Improvement District (BID) program by assisting local organizations and merchants' associations interested in creating a BID with the planning, outreach and legislative phases of BID formation. This included oversight of the legislative approval of one new boundary expansion of an existing BID, Flatiron in Manhattan. BIDs keep their districts clean, safe, beautiful, and vibrant, as demonstrated by consistently high sidewalk cleanliness ratings. SBS also continued to offer technical assistance, capacity building, governance support and oversight to the City's 76 existing BIDs, the largest network of its kind in the country. To build a network of strong community organizations and pipeline of civic leaders prepared with commercial revitalization expertise and place management experience, SBS awarded $285,000 to non-profit partners to provide a broad array of capacity building and organizational development programs for CBDOs across the City. This past year, SBS offered CBDOs non-profit legal assistance, workshops on governance and financial management, 1-on-1 coaching to executive directors, media/video training, and a nine-month-long Neighborhood Leadership Program with the Coro New York Leadership Center to 20 individual CBDO professionals. services through BIDs 4,044 4,065 4,108 4,325 4,325 3,800 3,800 Neutral Up ratings (%) 97.8% 98.4% 98.2% 95.5% 97.0% 97.0% NA ($000,000) $1.30 $1.45 $1.71 $1.30 $1.24 * * Neutral Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None SERVICE 4Help minority and women-owned businesses identify and compete for City contracts. Goal 4aIncrease the number of Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprises (M/WBEs) that obtain City contracts. After achieving Mayor de Blasio's ambitious goal of certifying 9,000 M/WBEs during Fiscal 2019 and reaching over 10,000 M/WBEs during Fiscal 2020, the Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprises Program certified and recertified a total of 2,239 M/WBEs during Fiscal 2021, increasing the number of certified M/WBEs in the program to 10,665. This represents a 6 percent increase over the 10,034 firms certified one year earlier. The M/WBE recertification rate was over 66 percent in Fiscal 2021, exceeding the annual target of 60 percent. During Fiscal 2020, the Governor signed legislation that increased the City's small purchase authority to $500,000 for all procurement categories, including construction. Subsequently, mayoral Executive Order 59 instructed City agencies to use the M/WBE Noncompetitive Method for contracts $500,000 and below, barring a justification and approval to do otherwise. SBS continues working to ensure that certified firms can compete for and perform on contracts issued using the revised M/WBE noncompetitive method and other procurement Page 328 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT methods. In particular, SBS has worked to improve the quality of data in the online directory of certified firms and connected MWBEs to contract financing and bonding assistance. The number of M/WBEs that were awarded City contracts was 1,416. Additionally, the number of M/WBEs that were awarded City contracts after receiving direct assistance from SBS decreased slightly by 3 percent to 1,025, compared to the previous year.

Col.), CommissionerDEPARTMENT OF VETERANS' SERVICES | Page 331 WHAT WE DO The Department of Veterans' Services (DVS) connects, mobilizes, and empowers New York City's Veteran community in order to foster purpose-driven lives for U.S. Military Service Members\u2014 past and present\u2014in addition to their caregivers, survivors, and families. DVS works with City, state and federal agencies, as well as regional private and not- for-profit partners, to improve the lives of all New York City Veterans and those close to them. The Department ensures that homeless Veterans have permanent housing and access to the support services needed to find and maintain their homes; expands education and career opportunities for Veterans; and provides the human and technological infrastructure for Veterans and their families to gain citywide access to benefits, resources and care through the nation's leading coordinated service network. FOCUS ON EQUITY DVS strives to connect with New York City Veterans regardless of discharge status and branch of service in the U.S. Armed Forces, including the Reserves and/ or National Guard. DVS serves as a critical hub for Veterans' advancement by informing our Veteran community of resources that exist, serving as a bridge to those resources when needed, and occupying roles that the local government can uniquely fill when gaps in Veterans' services appear in the private, not-for-profit, federal and state realms. DVS recognizes and honors Veterans of all protected classes in the City of New York, as the diversity of our City informs and reflects the diversity of our Veteran community. Further, the Department serves family members, caregivers and survivors, recognizing their essential role in Veteran health and well-being. Page 332 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Provide supportive services to Veterans and their families. Goal 1a Mitigate and prevent homelessness for Veterans. SERVICE 2 Assist Veterans and their families with accessing eligible resources. Goal 2a Ensure Veterans have information about and are connected with appropriate resources.DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS' SERVICES | Page 333 HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 SERVICE 1Provide supportive services to Veterans and their families. Goal 1a Mitigate and prevent homelessness for Veterans. In Fiscal Year 2021, DVS secured placements for 117 housing-insecure Veterans through the Veteran Peer Coordinator (VPC) program; our peer-to-peer service model focused on Veterans helping Veterans experiencing homelessness navigate the challenging process of finding housing in New York City. Despite working remotely for most of Fiscal 2021, our VPCs continued to engage Veterans, community partners, and other agencies working to end Veteran homelessness. In the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, as mentioned in the PMMR, housing viewings and interviews were able to go back to a combination of in-person and virtual appointments for our Veterans to limit close, in-person interactions. There was a 36 percent decrease in the total number of placements compared to previous fiscal years due to the precautions surrounding the COVID-19 epidemic as offices and community partners adjusted to remote and limited in-person engagements. DVS believes that these factors played a significant role in the decrease of homeless Veterans processed and housed. Despite the decrease in placements, DVS remained committed to help Veterans obtain and stay in safe, affordable housing by providing appropriate connections to resources. Of the 117 placements, 22 percent (or 24 Veterans) were placed into a supportive setting with on-site services, and 63 Veterans who were not already connected to services were referred to community- based services for additional case management. These Veterans were not just housed but are provided additional supports to reduce homelessness recidivism. In Fiscal Year 2021, DVS conducted 617 Critical Time Intervention calls, an approximate increase of 37 percent from Fiscal Year 2020. Former housing-insecure Veterans received needs assessments, mental health screenings, and subsequent referrals for any additional resources or supports during these intervention calls. Further, DVS ensured that our former housing-insecure Veterans receive the additional care necessary to continue their forward progress in housing and personal security through these actions.

Goal 2a Ensure Veterans have information about and are connected with appropriate resources. In Fiscal Year 2021, DVS had to effectively halt all in-person outreach, including the availability to meet in-person with Veterans at our Veteran Resource Centers and community-based outreach events. This decline in the volume of activities attributed to a decrease of 28 percent in our engagement metrics compared to the same period during Fiscal Year 2020, resulting in 5,066 Veterans and Veteran family members engaged. With the continuation of the Mission: VetCheck initiative, DVS continued calling Veterans and Veteran households that otherwise would not be aware of or able to access services or resources. Through this initiative, almost 18,000 phone calls were placed during Fiscal Year 2021, yielding a program total of nearly 31,000 calls. The team successfully engaged and interacted with over 2,300 Veterans and Veteran family members and processed 836 referrals for DVS assistance as a result of the Mission: VetCheck initiative. In Fiscal Year 2021, DVS restructured its staff assignments to form a Care Coordination Unit that provides complete oversight of all Assistance Requests, Referrals and delivering case management as needed via the VetConnectNYC platform. This was the first year that all client-facing interactions were tracked and recorded on VetConnecyNYC platform and the UniteNYC network. There were almost twice as many assistance requests processed in Fiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020. This significant increase can be attributed to the Mission: VetCheck initiative and GetFoodNYC. The agency obtained about 75,000 Veteran household contacts through data-sharing agreements with other agencies, which definitively sustained the Mission VetCheck wellness calls throughout Fiscal 2021. DVS also established a Claims Unit that acts as a conduit to Veterans gaining access to their U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs benefits. During this fiscal year there were 96 Page 334 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT completed claims submitted. Those benefits include, but are not limited to, service-connected compensation, non-service- connected pension, survivors' pension, and education benefits. Throughout the pandemic, there was a significant increase in food insecurity amongst the Veteran community. DVS responded by obtaining staff certification to enroll and set up meal deliveries to more than 576 Veterans and Veteran household members who could not leave their homes. DVS collaborated with NYC Department of Corrections to facilitate phone interviews with justice-involved Veterans at Rikers Island; those Veterans were allowed the same opportunity to submit assistance requests and seek help obtaining access to the benefits and resources to which they are entitled.

The Department manages the City's water supply, which provides more than one billion gallons of high quality drinking water daily to more than half the population of New York State. It builds and maintains the City's water distribution network, fire hydrants, storm and sanitary sewage collection systems and Bluebelt and green infrastructure systems, and manages 14 in-City water resource recovery facilities as well as seven water resource recovery facilities in the upstate watershed. DEP also implements federal Clean Water Act rules and regulations, handles hazardous materials emergencies and toxic site remediation, oversees asbestos monitoring and removal, enforces the City's air and noise codes, bills and collects on approximately 836,000 water and sewer accounts and manages citywide water conservation programs.FOCUS ON EQUITY The Department of Environmental Protection has the critical mission to enrich the environment and protect public health for all New Yorkers by providing high quality drinking water, managing wastewater and stormwater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous materials pollution. In July 2015, DEP announced a new series of programs to provide additional assistance to its most vulnerable customers. The City froze the minimum charge, preventing any increase in water and sewer charges for many single-family homeowners and undertook a major expansion of the Home Water Assistance Program (HWAP), a billing program that provides a credit to low income homeowners who qualify for the federal Home Energy Assistance Program. In 2016, the Department undertook a further expansion of the HWAP credit to include additional low-income senior and disabled homeowners who receive a New York City Department of Finance property tax exemption. Then, in Fiscal 2018, DEP implemented the Multifamily Water Assistance Program (MWAP), which provides a bill credit to multifamily buildings that conserve water and enter into an agreement to keep rents affordable. In Fiscal Year 2021, DEP continued both the freeze of the minimum charge and the income-tested HWAP credit. In addition, the system has for many years offered a bill amnesty program, in which high water charges that are attributable to leaks that are fixed receive a partial reduction in charges. The Department's two major bill credit programs together provide assistance to almost 90,000 households each year, covering approximately 237,000 New Yorkers, including both renters and owner-occupants.Page 338 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Ensure the sufficiency, quality and security of the City's drinking water supply.

Goal 1a Comply with all federal and State drinking water quality standards. By regularly collecting water samples at nearly 1,000 water quality sampling stations throughout the City and conducting analyses for a broad spectrum of microbiological, chemical and physical measures of quality, the Department ensures that all federal and State standards for drinking water, including those for coliform bacteria, are consistently met. In Fiscal 2021, DEP collected over 33,100 samples from the City's distribution system, performed approximately 392,700 analyses and recorded 298,000 discrete online measurements, meeting all State and federal monitoring requirements. Additionally, approximately 193,000 analyses were performed on 13,600 samples, and 3 million robotic monitoring measurements were recorded from the upstate water supply watershed.

The additional focus on the management of hydrant repairs resulted in the Department reducing the backlog of broken and inoperative hydrants from 0.38 percent to 0.28 percent of hydrants. The Department's continued coordination with the Department of Transportation to proactively investigate and discover infrastructure defects sooner allowed repairs to be made before a street failure or collapse occurred, resulting in an 8 percent reduction in the number of street cave-in complaints received during the reporting period. The aforementioned coordination with DOT and further coordination with the Department of Health and Mental Health on service line issues also helped the Department to respond to these complaints and render the condition safe almost 42 percent faster. 0200400600 FY 21 FY 20 459445 371Page 340 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT The Department surveyed/inspected fewer catch basins during the reporting period due to a change in the mandate for these inspections after Fiscal Year 2019. Historically, the Department inspected catch basins once every three years. Local Law 48 of 2015 mandated the annual inspection of all DEP catch basins for three years beginning with Fiscal 2017. This law sunsetted at the end of Fiscal 2019 and the Department has returned to its previous inspection frequency of once every three years and is monitoring to ensure that all gains made during the annual inspection cycle period can be sustained. The Department made water main break repairs with minimal disruption to consumers, as evidenced by a 16 percent decrease in time to restore water, from 4.9 hours to 4.1 hours. While fluctuations in the number of water main breaks are expected year to year due to weather and other factors, the Department makes efforts to reduce the potential for water main breaks through pressure management, programmatic pressure regulator maintenance, utilization of predictive modeling, as well as prioritizing replacement of mains with the highest history of breakage.

The average time it took the department to close air, noise and asbestos complaints remained consistent during the reporting period despite the many challenges presented by the COVID 19 pandemic. At the same time, the Department continued to meet its targets for responding to these complaints. The number of complaints received declined for air/noise during the period largely due to the prolonged closure of construction activities and the many commercial businesses due to the pandemic. Asbestos complaints were up eight percent due to the fact that the asbestos industry went back to work sooner and with citizens being home they made additional ongoing work observations which resulted in additional complaint calls being made.

DOT operates over 13,250 signalized intersections and over 315,000 street lights, and maintains over 350 million linear feet of markings on City streets and highways. Safety for everyone using the City's roads, bridges and ferries is the agency's top concern. To increase mobility, DOT manages the City's Bus Rapid Transit program, Select Bus Service, in partnership with the MTA; oversees the City's bike share system; and maintains over 1,316 miles of the cycling network, including over 140 miles of on-street protected bicycle lanes. DOT's infrastructure programs include bridge capital investment and life-cycle maintenance, roadway resurfacing and pothole repair, ferry boat and terminal upgrades and maintenance and street and sidewalk reconstruction. DOT focuses on delivering quality projects on time and under budget by developing and monitoring project plans and schedules. DOT also manages the Joint Traffic Management Center, pedestrian ramp and sidewalk repair and oversees the on-street parking meters system. DOT's alternative fuel program promotes cleaner vehicles using biodiesel, ethanol and electricity in both the public and private sectors.FOCUS ON EQUITY DOT focuses on equitable service delivery through its maintenance of critical transportation infrastructure and commitments to safety and mobility for New Yorkers. This focus ensures DOT provides its services in an equitable manner, including roadway, bridge, and sidewalk maintenance, traffic planning and management, and ferry operations. DOT developed Vision Zero Borough Pedestrian Safety Action Plans by combining statistical data collected from traffic crashes with community feedback gathered at safety workshops held across the five boroughs and comments received through the interactive Vision Zero input map. There are 145 miles of Select Bus Service routes, bringing fast and reliable service to residents living in transit-dependent neighborhoods, such as Tremont, the Bronx; Bedford- Stuyvesant, Brooklyn; Jamaica, Queens; and East Harlem, Manhattan. As part of its Better Buses Action Plan, DOT is implementing the same SBS priority measures on local bus segments identified as slow and unreliable. These measures include dedicated bus lanes, transit signal priority intersections, and accessible bus stops. Criteria for selecting segments include the prevalence of low-income and no- vehicle households. Over the years, DOT strengthened its community engagement through the Street Ambassador Program, engaging New Yorkers where they live, work, and socialize. Street Ambassadors attended over 700 engagements with the community, including mobile workshops, pre-project implementation outreach, and merchant surveys. DOT's Mobility Management Program improves transportation opportunities for traditionally underserved communities by advancing equity and accessibility. The program offers various resources, such as staff training to ensure meaningful community engagement; contact information for community organizations and service providers; and neighborhood surveys, focusing on travel behavior. DOT launched its Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) initiative to encourage employees to organize in order to celebrate cultural connections, advocate for professional development, and enhance morale in the workplace. ERGs are instrumental in helping DOT achieve its key objectives of workforce diversity, workplace inclusion, and community understanding. There are six active ERGs, including groups created around African American/Black, Women, Latinx, and LGBTQ issues. DOT is committed to fostering an equitable and competitive business environment while ensuring procurements reflect the diversity of the City, including Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprises (M/WBE). Efforts include restructuring contracts, expanding its pre-qualification program for professional services, and partnering with other City agencies and professional groups to host meet-and-greet sessions for M/WBE vendors.Page 346 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Maintain the City's transportation infrastructure.

Goal 1a Manage the City's bridge inventory to achieve a high state of good repair. In April 2016, New York State began to inspect and rate bridges using the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) protocol. DOT has been phasing in this ratings system for major bridges but continued to rate pedestrian bridges on the old scale. There is currently no accepted translation from the previous ratings system. City inspection crews are scheduled to begin rating bridges using the new AASHTO scale in late 2021. DOT expects to publish bridge ratings in the Fiscal 2022 Mayor's Management Report.

In Fiscal 2021 DOT repaired a total of 176,939 potholes (local streets and arterials), a slight increase from Fiscal 2020. The average to time to close a pothole work order increased to 4.1 days, the highest total in five years, along with a 14 percent drop in pothole work orders. Due to the lack of contract milling, resurfacing operations began using in-house crews for milling work, leaving fewer crews available to perform pothole repairs, in addition to the already limited staff because of the pandemic. The number of lane miles resurfaced in-house dropped to 918, a result of fewer crews working during the PAUSE order plus a lower internal resurfacing goal of 910 lane miles due to budget limitations. Streets maintained with a pavement rating of good improved to 73.6 percent, the highest total on record. DOT anticipates ratings will continue to improve in the coming years as funding is now available to resurface 1,100 lane miles until Fiscal 2030.

Goal 2a Improve safety for pedestrians, motorists and bus and bike riders. There were 275 traffic fatalities in Fiscal 2021, 30 percent more than the prior year. The lockdown and less pedestrian activity in Fiscal 2020, coupled with less traffic and increased speeding in Fiscal 2021 led to a higher-than-usual annual change. Fatalities increased by 15 percent for bicyclists and pedestrians and 55 percent for motorists and passengers, including \"other motorized\" transport devices like scooters and hover boards. Injury crashes dropped slightly by four percent to its lowest total in five years. In Fiscal 2021, as part of its commitment to advance the Vision Zero Action Plan, DOT completed 69 street improvement projects, installed 256 Leading Pedestrian Intervals and 104 speed humps and installed 53.0 million linear feet of pavement safety markings. The Department also installed Accessible Pedestrian Signals (APS) at 211 intersections. APS are wired to a signal pole and send audible and vibrotactile indications when pedestrians push a button installed at the crosswalk.

Goal 3a Increase mobility and accessibility throughout the City. Staten Island Ferry ridership dropped to 7.6 million, a 52 percent decrease from last year, a direct result of COVID-19 and the PAUSE order. The average cost per passenger per trip was $17.75, almost double last year's cost, mainly due to the considerable drop in ridership. The ferry provides free, around-the-clock service between the South Ferry Terminal in Manhattan and St. George Terminal in Staten Island. Generally, the ferry runs every fifteen minutes during rush hour, and every half hour or hour during nights and weekends. On-time ferry service improved to 97.7 percent, its highest rate on record. Page 350 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT Private ferry ridership decreased 54 percent to 5.8 million riders due to the reduction in service for the PAUSE period, including suspended ferry routes on NY Waterway, SeaStreak, NYC Ferry, and Liberty Landing Ferry. The ferry routes help reduce overcrowding on subways and buses, offer reliable transportation to underserved communities and expand the use of our waterways as an essential component of the City's transportation network. During Fiscal 2021 users of the Bike Share Program activated over 172,000 annual memberships, including renewals. Trips taken by all users, annual and short-term, rose to nearly 23.1 million. Citi Bike continued its Phase 3 expansion and installed nearly 370 new stations in the following neighborhoods: Astoria in Queens; Morris Heights, Mount Hope, Kingsbridge Heights and Bedford Park in the Bronx; Windsor Terrace, Kensington and Sunset Park in Brooklyn; and Inwood in Manhattan, covering the entire borough of Manhattan with bike share service. DOT is working with community boards and other local stakeholders to add station capacity at the highest demand parts of the system as part of its infill project plan. DOT added over 65 lane miles to the City's bicycle network, including a record 29.2 miles of protected bike paths. While the total lane miles added fell by 21 percent from Fiscal 2020, the mileage of protected lanes added grew by 39 percent. Completed bicycle projects include protected bike lanes on Crescent Street in Queens, connecting the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge in Long Island City to the Robert F Kennedy Bridge in Astoria; as well as protected bike lanes along Southern Boulevard in the Bronx, from East Fordham Road to Mosholu Parkway.

Goal 4a Enhance quality of life through streetscape improvements. The Department installed 448,691 square feet of pedestrian space during Fiscal 2021, 64 percent more than last year and above pre-pandemic levels. Pedestrian space includes, but is not limited to, plazas, curb extensions, sidewalks, safety islands, and triangles. Notable street improvement projects completed include Rockaway Beach Boulevard from Beach 59th to 116th Streets in Queens; Riverside Drive from 155th to 161st Streets in Manhattan; Bronx Park East at White Plains Road and Bronxdale Avenue in the Bronx, plus additional projects associated with the Bike program including protected bike lanes and neighborhood bike network expansion to enhance safety and accessibility throughout the five boroughs.

La Rocca, CommissionerDEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS | Page 355 WHAT WE DO The Department of Buildings (DOB) regulates the safe and lawful use of more than 1,000,000 buildings and over 40,000 active construction sites under its jurisdiction by enforcing laws, including the City's Construction Codes, Zoning Resolution and Energy Code, as well as the New York State Multiple Dwelling Law. The Department enforces compliance with these regulations and promotes public safety through its review and approval of building plans, permitting and licensing functions, and inspections. FOCUS ON EQUITY The Department of Buildings (DOB) is committed to efficient, impartial and effective service delivery and protection for all New Yorkers - tenants and owners alike - especially as DOB migrates more of its public-facing interactions online. Guided by the Building One City plan, the Department continues its rollout of DOB NOW, the Department's transformative initiative to replace a three-decades-old mainframe system and increase transparency of agency operations, ease business interactions with the agency, promote the highest standards of integrity internally and within the industry, and develop a data-driven approach to disciplining bad actors. Additionally, DOB is fully committed to protecting the public's long-term safety in the face of climate change. With the passage of the 2020 NYC Energy Conservation Code, and our continued implementation of significant parts of Mayor de Blasio's NYC Green New Deal and OneNYC 2050 plan, including Local Law 97 of 2019, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, the Department is focused on assisting owners in making their buildings more sustainable. The key to success is DOB's effort to recruit a diverse and inclusive workforce reflective of the City's population, grounded in providing services in a fair and equitable manner to all members of the public. DOB's commitment to Diversity and Inclusion is celebrated and acknowledged by the various members of the workforce. In Fiscal 2021, DOB reaffirmed its commitment to diversity and awareness initiatives within the workforce and the community. The Department will continue to train its managerial and supervisory staff on best practices as it relates to anti-racism and how it ties into the agency's commitment to equity and inclusion. These diversity and equity initiatives will be ongoing into the upcoming fiscal years and beyond as we continue to promote the importance of diversity, respect, and equity throughout DOB's workforce.

Goal 2c Prevent construction-related fatalities and injuries.DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS | Page 357 HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 SERVICE 1Facilitate safe and compliant development. Goal 1a Improve processing efficiency. The Department is in the process of replacing the Building Information System (BIS) with its public-facing application portal DOB NOW. When fully implemented, it will allow industry professionals, licensees, owners, and the general public to conduct business with DOB fully online. Since implementation began, DOB NOW has successfully moved the processing of a significant percentage of job and permit work-types, inspection sign-offs, safety compliance filings, and licensing transactions to DOB NOW. In Fiscal 2021, the Department added more work-types and functionality to DOB NOW including General Construction, the most commonly issued permit type, and Certificates of Occupancy. DOB NOW volumes are reported separately from their BIS counterparts. Although reported by job type, the agency can classify DOB NOW filings by work type (such as plumbing, sprinkler, antenna, and supported scaffold). Separating filings this way in DOB NOW will allow construction applications to be reviewed and approved more quickly, eventually creating a much better service experience for customers. In Fiscal 2021, total job filings increased by 16.0 percent from the prior period. There were 31,865 BIS filings and 88,472 DOB NOW filings. The total number of completed plan reviews for BIS and DOB NOW filings increased by 13.7 percent from 98,881 to 112,393, including 25,334 BIS completed plan reviews and 87,059 DOB NOW completed plan reviews. Filings and plan reviews are expected to continue to increase in DOB NOW as volume shifts to that system from BIS.

In furtherance of its mandate to protect the safety of the public, DOB is focused on its role as steward of the zoning resolution and building code. For those who choose to violate those rules, the Department addresses bad actors in several ways, one of which is the issuance of summonses or violations. The Department completed 162,135 construction inspections compared to 168,507 in the same Fiscal 2020 period, and issued 72,966 OATH/Environmental Control Board violations (nine percent fewer than a year ago). Of the violations heard, 78 percent were upheld, compared to 80 percent last year. DOB's violations not only require a penalty payment but also that unsafe conditions must be fixed. Licenses and registrations is another area where the Department carefully watches for repeat offenders who ignore their compliance obligation. Licenses and registrations are issued only after applicants pass rigorous background investigations, and in many cases applicants must take an examination. Investigations are also conducted upon renewal. In Fiscal 2021, DOB violations issued decreased to 65,411 from 96,969 in the prior Fiscal 2020 period. With respect to the decrease in the issuance of DOB violations, this can be attributed to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the construction industry, including a citywide pause on non-essential construction in calendar year 2020 and prolonged site closures.

The Department continues to enforce Local Law 196 of 2017, which requires workers on the City's larger building construction sites to have site safety training. Through Fiscal 2021, efforts to raise safety awareness included direct outreach at job sites, distribution of outreach material in multiple languages, mailing permit holders and site safety professionals about training requirements, issuing public service notices, training professionals during Local Law 196 information sessions, and social media engagement. Additionally, the Department performed Zero Tolerance and scaffolding inspection sweeps at approximately 7,500 building construction work sites across the City to ensure that conditions at sites are safe for both workers and the public, leading to issuance of over 3,600 violations and nearly 1,500 stop work orders.0100200300400500600700 Construction-Related InjuriesConstruction-Related FatalitiesFY 21 FY 20 FY 19 FY 18 FY 17 Average Active Employees - Building Construction (NYS Dept. of Labor)FY 21 FY 20 FY 19 FY 18 FY 17Construction-Related Injuries and Fatalities and Construction Employment 13 16 11540 62247,208 646 974444,00045,750 853443,51742,350DEPARTMENT OF * Down Down - Construction-related accidents 611 729 625 509 533 * * Down Down \u00ab Construction-related injuries 622 744 646 534 540 \u00f2 \u00f2 Down Down \u00ab - Construction-related fatalities 9 16 11 8 13 \u00f2 \u00f2 Neutral Down Incident inspections resulting in violations (%) 64.3% 72.7% 81.7% 87.4% 87.0% * * Up * \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None AGENCY-WIDE City vehicles 98 81 110 NA NA * * NA Down Workplace injuries reported 21 20 10 16 17 * * Down Down \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None AGENCY CUSTOMER SERVICE Performance Indicators Actual Target Trend Customer Experience FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY21 FY22 63% 50% 53% 51% 82% 57% 57% Up Up 60% 47% 58% 86% 47% 57% 57% Neutral seconds (%) NA 70% 68% 62% 64% * * NA Up Completed customer requests for interpretation 63 100 122 77 85 * * Neutral * CORE customer experience rating (0-100) 90 90 NA 99 98 85 85 NA Up \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Performance Indicators Actual Target Trend Response to 311 Service Requests (SRs) FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY21 FY22 5-YearDesired Direction time to first action - Elevator - Defective/Not Working (60 days) 92% 100% NA NA 100% 50% 50% NA * Percent meeting time to first action - General Construction/ Plumbing - Contrary/Beyond 72% Up * Percent meeting time to first action - General Construction/ Plumbing - Failure to Maintain (60 days) 80% 63% 63% 89% 97% 77% 77% Up * Percent meeting time to first action - Illegal Conversion of Resi - Up * Percent meeting time to first action - No Permit - Construction, Plumbing, Cranes & Derricks, Building/Use, Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * NonePage 362 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT amounts for the current fiscal year are not yet final.

DDC supplies a full range of design and construction management services for public buildings projects such as new and upgraded libraries, firehouses and police precincts, and infrastructure projects including water mains, sewers, roads and public plazas. In Fiscal 2021 many of the agency's projects, at all stages of development and implementation, were impacted by the effects of and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in DDC's Public Buildings Division. DDC's total portfolio in Fiscal 2021 consisted of 599 active projects (not including Borough-Based Jail facilities or projects in the planning or closeout phases) valued at approximately $15.6 billion.FOCUS ON EQUITY DDC has an extensive and diverse portfolio of projects that support neighborhoods, promote economic growth and advance the Mayor's commitment to enhancing the wellbeing of New Yorkers in every part of the City. In Fiscal 2021, this focus expanded to include the rapid construction of field hospitals, community clinics, testing sites and vaccination centers the City needed to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work also included the completion of the new Marcy Community Center in Brooklyn, now home to a Department of Youth & Community Development Cornerstone program run by Grand St. Settlement, an example of the beneficial projects designed and constructed by the agency for every New York City resident. DDC, a leading agency in contract awards and payments to M/WBE firms, fosters an equitable and competitive business environment while ensuring its procurement processes are fair and contractors reflect the diversity of New York City. DDC's Office of Diversity and Industry Relations implements policies and programs focused on creating accessibility to work, building business capacity, and ensuring accountability. Since 2015, the agency has engaged over 7,500 Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprises (M/WBEs) through internal and external workshops and seminars that enhanced technical and business capacity and connected a number of these businesses to contract opportunities. DDC has also structured procurements and utilized legislative tools to create additional opportunities for M/WBEs. The agency continues to develop a mentoring program in which emerging firms will be paired with experienced construction management firms in the field, and aims to broaden its reach in order to support economic development across the City. DDC's commitment to equity is also exemplified through its work to help the City meet its long-term resiliency and sustainability goals. In Fiscal 2021, the agency began construction of its largest infrastructure project to-date, East Side Coastal Resiliency. This project will protect more than 110,000 Lower East Side residents, including many in public housing, from the effects of future storms and sea level rise while also upgrading valuable open space and public parks in the area. Also in Fiscal 2021, DDC began construction on the Borough-Based Jails program, which will help create a more fair and equitable justice system by building four new jails in Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens that will replace the jails on Rikers Island. To help neighborhoods manage the impacts of construction, DDC's Office of Community Outreach and Notification reaches out to local businesses and individuals in every community to share information and respond to concerns. Most infrastructure projects have full-time Community Construction Liaisons assigned to them, many of whom are multilingual, working daily at job sites to proactively address community issues. DDC also educates students about careers in science, technology, engineering, architecture/art and mathematics through its Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) program, providing workforce development, mentorship, and internship programs for students from middle school through college and graduate school. Through STEAM, DDC has provided 4,556 students in NYC high schools and in Title 1 middle schools with the guidance and skills to carve out careers in the design and construction industries. Over the summer of 2020, due to COVID-19 public health concerns, DDC's STEAM launched a virtual \"Lunch and Learn\" program as a substitute for DDC's in-house high school summer internship program.Page 364 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Design and build quality public buildings and infrastructure. Goal 1a Complete projects on time and within budget. Goal 1b Meet quality assurance and site safety standards for all active projects. Goal 1c Improve customer satisfaction ratings.DEPARTMENT OF DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION | Page 365 HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 SERVICE 1Design and build quality public buildings and infrastructure. Goal 1a Complete projects on time and within budget. DDC's operations were directly impacted by the pandemic and COVID- related pause that began in mid-March 2020. Design and construction of almost all planned projects by DDC's Public Buildings Division were suspended, with much of the Division's staff and resources re-assigned to the building of facilities the City required to manage the pandemic. Operating under less restrictive contracting and procurement rules allowed under the State of New York's emergency health declaration, in effect from March 2020 through June 2021, the Division designed and constructed two field hospitals with 1,100 beds total, 28 stationary testing sites, nine mobile testing trucks, 18 vaccination centers and three permanent COVID-19 Centers of Excellence clinics for NYC Health + Hospitals. DDC also expanded four NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene laboratories and equipped them with negative air pressure handling systems to accommodate COVID-19 testing. These emergency projects are reflected in the data below. The agency also supported the \"GetCool\" program, overseeing the installation of more than 70,000 air conditioning units in low-income and senior residences. The pandemic's more flexible procurement rules allowed the agency to deliver crucial COVID-related projects in a fraction of the time that would normally be required, such as a 470-bed field hospital in 11 days and three large COVID-19 Centers of Excellence for the City's public hospital system in less than seven months, while meeting outstanding M/WBE performance standards. The Centers of Excellence represent $117 million of construction that would typically have taken upward of six years to complete. Other projects, including COVID testing sites (seven days average construction time) and laboratory upgrades (35 days) were also greatly accelerated under the emergency health declaration. While the work of DDC's Infrastructure Division was deemed essential and continued through the State's emergency declaration. Infrastructure project delivery times generally benefitted from reductions in vehicle and pedestrian traffic that allowed for construction to proceed more quickly than it had pre-COVID. Overall, the Division exceeded its goal for construction projects completed (41) in Fiscal 2021, completing 45 projects total. The Department completed 81 design projects during Fiscal 2021, exceeding a lower-than-normal goal of 28 projects driven by the pandemic pause. There were also 108 construction projects completed, exceeding the target of 79. For construction projects that were completed, 91 percent of infrastructure projects and 83 percent of public buildings projects were early or on time, exceeding each division's target of 82 percent. In addition to its COVID-related work, completed public buildings projects included the new Roosevelt Island Library, which opened in January 2021 and is more than twice the size of the previous branch while meeting LEED Silver standards for energy efficiency. Infrastructure projects completed included Phase 1 of the massive $139 million rebuild of Downtown Far Rockaway, where a project that would normally have taken seven years to complete is on track to be completed in just three. DDC also completed work to upgrade the City's sewer and water main infrastructure and to alleviate chronic flooding, adding a total of 27.8 miles of new and rebuilt sewers, 38.7 miles of new and replacement water mains and reconstructing 60.6 lane miles of roadway. This work includes the $1.9 billion Southeast Queens Initiative, where 16 projects have been completed out of a total of 44, with five more currently in construction.$0$500$1000$1500$2000 Dollar Value in MillionsFY 21 Completed % Projects Completed Early and On Time FY 21 FY 20 FY 19 FY 18 FY 17Page 366 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT The impacts of COVID were noticeable in the agency's on-time performance for active design projects, which fell to 63 percent, 25 percentage points under the Fiscal 2021 target of 88 percent. This is largely because designs being performed by outside consultants were completely paused for several months when the pandemic struck and while the City reevaluated its financial situation. Overall on-time performance for active construction projects was 72 percent, ten percentage points below the Fiscal 2021 target of 82 percent. This performance was also a direct result of the pause imposed during COVID. In DDC's Infrastructure Division, where construction work was allowed to proceed through the pandemic, 89 percent of active construction projects were early or on time, while in the Public Buildings Division, where work stopped on all active projects during the height of the pandemic, 63 percent of construction projects were early or on time. As of June 2021, work had restarted on all projects. In January 2019, DDC introduced its Strategic Blueprint for Construction Excellence in order to comprehensively improve the capital project delivery process. A one-year update to the Blueprint completed immediately prior to the pandemic showed significant progress toward reducing overall project durations. With pandemic-related activity diminishing, the agency will continue to pursue its Blueprint initiatives to reduce timelines even further. This includes advocating for the use of alternative construction management methods that were proven to be effective during the pandemic, and for reform of the highly restrictive lowest-bidder system for awarding City contracts.

In Fiscal Year 2021 there were 23 construction-related accidents at DDC-managed construction sites, nine more than Fiscal 2020 but one fewer than in Fiscal 2019. There were also 23 construction-related injuries, nine more than the previous year but three fewer than Fiscal 2019. To improve safety at construction sites and to align with established industry safety metrics, DDC continues reporting on the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities that occur at or involve DDC-managed construction sites. All reported accidents are investigated to determine root causes and to identify necessary corrective actions to prevent further occurrences. Contractor safety compliance and implementation of corrective actions are verified by the Office of Construction Safety through safety audits and inspections. Contractors are required to immediately report and investigate all safety related accidents and incidents to DDC, where established protocols dictate follow-up and reporting requirements. A completed construction accident report must be submitted to the Agency's Office of Construction Safety by project staff within 24 hours of the time of an accident or incident. However, notification of any accident and/or incident needs to be reported within two hours of occurrence.DEPARTMENT OF DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION | Page 367 Performance on DDC-managed construction sites NA 32 24 14 23 * * NA Down \u00ab Construction-related injuries on DDC-managed construction sites NA 32 26 14 23 \u00f2 \u00f2 NA Down \u00ab Construction-related fatalities on DDC-managed construction sites* NA 0 1 0 0 \u00f2 \u00f2 NA Down \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 1c Improve customer satisfaction ratings.

DCP works with communities and elected officials to build healthier, more equitable and resilient neighborhoods; develop land use policies and zoning regulations to advance the agency's strategic objectives; and, in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), share perspectives on growth and community needs with its sister agencies, elected officials and members of the public. DCP's work builds on New York City's greatest strengths, its unparalleled diversity and resilient spirit, and helps to ensure that investments, including private investments, benefit the city as a whole. DCP's six strategic objectives are: (1) catalyzing long-term neighborhood equity and improvement through integrated planning and targeted public investments; (2) encouraging the production of affordable and quality housing; (3) promoting economic development and job growth; (4) enhancing resiliency and sustainability of neighborhoods; (5) ensuring integrity, timeliness and responsiveness in land use reviews; and (6) supplying objective data and expertise to a broad range of planning functions and stakeholders. DCP supports the City Planning Commission (CPC) in its annual review of hundreds of land use applications and works closely with OMB in developing the City's Ten- Year Capital Strategy.FOCUS ON EQUITY Racism has long undermined the health and vitality of New York City's communities. As DCP examines its own role and the role of the planning profession in perpetuating practices that stymie fair, inclusive planning, the agency is committed to aggressively tackling racism and fostering a more equitable city. DCP supports Where We Live , the City's process to support fair housing principles and better understand and address how segregation and discrimination harm New Yorkers. Through projects that focus on affordable housing and job creation, DCP works to incentivize affordability and increased housing opportunities, and help improve the quality of life for marginalized populations. Through Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) and Zoning for Quality and Affordability (ZQA) , DCP supports Housing New York , a suite of initiatives to help New Yorkers of all income levels and backgrounds find safe, affordable housing in neighborhoods throughout the city. DCP advances resiliency through work on the Comprehensive Waterfront Plan and Zoning for Coastal Flood Resiliency (ZCFR) . It also seeks to coordinate transit improvements and land use decision-making that encourages the growth of business districts outside of the Manhattan Core, thus bringing jobs closer to where New Yorkers live. This work includes Elevate Transit: Zoning for Accessibility , an initiative to expand zoning mechanisms to better coordinate new development with subway station accessibility improvements, and the Health and Fitness Text Amendment , to make it easier for gyms, spas and other health-related businesses to open. DCP strives to improve transparency through numerous digital tools that provide data, make it easier for New Yorkers to get involved in planning for their communities and connect the public to upcoming meetings. For example, DCP works with OMB and all 59 community boards on annual Statements of Community District Needs and Budget Requests, which are posted on DCP's Community District Profiles , and provides training for community boards on planning principles, initiatives and more. DCP also recently launched NYC Engage , a portal that New Yorkers can use to participate in public meetings.Page 372 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Shape the use and development of land in the City's neighborhoods, business districts and waterfront through participatory planning and zoning changes.

Goal 1a Advance land use projects and proposals for public review that promote housing and affordability, economic development, sustainability and neighborhood quality of life. Furthering objectives of expanding housing and economic development opportunities, prioritizing projects that will help the City's recovery from COVID-19, and fostering more livable, equitable and resilient neighborhoods through community planning, DCP advanced and presented 35 land use proposals and initiatives to the public during Fiscal 2021, a decrease from the 55 presented in Fiscal 2020. This decrease is largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading DCP to change its approach, building out online community engagement tools and consolidating interactive surveys and presentations that often reached broader audiences than a typical in-person meeting. In Fiscal 2021, DCP advanced several major initiatives, furthering its affordable housing, economic development, equity and resiliency goals. Following a series of community meetings on specific topics, such as stormwater rules, accessible transit and the publicly owned Gowanus Green site, the Gowanus Neighborhood Plan began public review in April 2021. Based on extensive outreach and planning with community members and local elected officials, this Plan will facilitate a true mixed-use neighborhood with 3,000 affordable homes, 3,500 jobs, commercial and industrial businesses, new public spaces and improved resiliency. DCP also released the Gowanus IBZ Vision Plan , to guide future development in an industrial area adjacent to the Gowanus Neighborhood Plan. Similarly, following a series of information sessions on topics such as housing, the public realm, and arts and culture, the SoHo/NoHo Neighborhood Plan began public review in May 2021. Growing out of the Envision SoHo/NoHo report , the SoHo/NoHo Neighborhood Plan is a historic proposal to create 900 permanently affordable homes, support existing historic districts, enhance arts and culture via an innovative arts fund model, and introduce flexible zoning to support small businesses in these two high opportunity neighborhoods. In Fiscal 2021, DCP also advanced several citywide zoning measures meant to help the economic recovery from COVID-19 and to make New York City's communities healthier and more accessible. DCP's proposed expansion of the Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) program aims to bring this zoning incentive for high-quality grocery stores to another 11 lower-income districts throughout the City. Another citywide proposal, the Health and Fitness Text Amendment, aims to remove an antiquated requirement for a special permit for gyms, spas and licensed message therapy, a change that would support small businesses, improve equity, and make health and fitness facilities easier to open. DCP also collaborated with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities on Elevate Transit: Zoning for Accessibility , which would improve accessibility to mass transit via expanded provisions that require land owners building near stations to leave space in their buildings for the MTA to build an elevator or access points. It also expands the range of high-density sites that can earn a floor area bonus for building, and maintaining, elevators from the street to the station platform. Lastly, DCP collaborated with the Department of Transportation on the Permanent Open Restaurants Text Amendment , which would help make permanent the Open Restaurants program put into place during the pandemic by removing Zoning Resolution restrictions on where sidewalk caf\u00e9s are allowed throughout New York City. All four of these proposals entered the public review process in the spring or early summer of 2021. Throughout Fiscal 2021, DCP continued its work on how to improve one of the City's defining resources\u2014its 520 miles of waterfront. In May 2021, ZCFR was approved by the City Council and went into effect, providing much-needed zoning flexibility for new or retrofitted buildings to be more resilient in the long-term, as well as improving the ability of the city's coastal communities to withstand and recover quickly from future storms. DCP also held a series of remote workshops to receive feedback on the draft goals and strategies of the Comprehensive Waterfront Plan , due for release in fall 2021.

DCP publicly presented 421 initiatives, planning reports, presentations and datasets\u2014including digital tools\u2014in Fiscal 2021. This increase from 315 in Fiscal 2020 is due to the publication of the Housing Database, which contains all Department of Buildings-approved housing construction and demolition jobs filed or completed since Jan. 1, 2010. Planning initiatives or policy reports released during Fiscal 2021 include Retail Activity in NYC: COVID Recovery Across 24 Neighborhoods , a report on storefront activity during the city's reopening from COVID-19 shutdowns; COVID-19 Impacts on Transportation , which compiled data on how the pandemic is affecting the city's transportation network; and Housing Production Snapshot , a report on the number of homes that were completed, received building permits or were in the pipeline throughout 2020. DCP also released information briefs on the Net Change in Housing Units from 2010-2020 , a data platform outlining the NYC Metro Region's Monthly Employment Change Since January 2019 . On a lighter note, DCP released an Animals of NYC activity book to teach about urban design and social distancing while highlighting the contributions of our essential workers. DCP continues to collect, analyze and share data with stakeholders on land use, zoning, housing and population, releasing datasets and applications of software, data and geographic base map files to the public as free downloads, known under the umbrella name of BYTES of the BIG APPLE . PLUTO and MapPLUTO, datasets that contain extensive land use and geographic data at the tax lot level, were issued more frequently, increasing to eight releases during the fiscal year.

Goal 3a Conduct timely and thorough review of land use and environmental review projects, subject to City Planning Commission review, to ensure project submissions are technically complete and adhere to all applicable requirements and procedures. In Fiscal 2021, DCP certified/referred a total of 250 projects compared to 178 in Fiscal 2020. This change is attributable to several factors, but the largest driver was the resumption of the public review process post a COVID-19 related pause, which decreased the amount of certifications in FY20. DCP certified/referred a greater number of projects across all categories: simple zoning actions (90 in Fiscal 2021 versus 52 in Fiscal 2020), renewals/Staten Island actions (52 vs 48), and zoning actions with CEQR (79 Environmental Assessment Statement and Environmental Impact Statement projects vs 37). Only non-zoning City projects saw a decrease, with 29 projects referred vs 41 in Fiscal 2020. DEPARTMENT OF CITY PLANNING | Page 375 Overall, 79 percent of Fiscal 2021 projects were certified or referred within their target timeframes, nine percent higher than the target, and four percent higher than Fiscal 2020. This improvement was a result of additional agency focus on completing application reviews during the COVID-19 pause, a period when relatively fewer new applications were being submitted. DCP's ability to meet target timeframes remains highly dependent on applicants filing adequate supporting materials and being able to avoid multiple rounds of revision by applicants. In July 2020, DCP launched a portal for applicants to submit initial components of the land use application process online. This launch was a crucial milestone towards the goal of having fully digital land use applications, enhancing the agency's ability to provide documents publicly more quickly, and realizing cost and time savings for the agency in reviewing and processing applications. In Fiscal 2021, DCP also made enhancements to its cloud-based digital project management system, the Zoning Application Portal (ZAP) . ZAP allows New Yorkers to review and download recent land use applications, including all related environmental review filings, making it easier than ever for the public to easily access and digest the details of a land use proposal.

Through the New York City Industrial Development Agency (NYCIDA), Build New York City Resource Corporation (Build NYC) and the New York City Neighborhood Capital Corporation (NYCNCC), NYCEDC helps eligible businesses and registered nonprofits meet financing needs for property acquisition, expansion, new equipment, renovation and working capital through low-cost, tax-exempt bonds, exemptions and abatements of selected City and State taxes and New Markets Tax Credits.FOCUS ON EQUITY NYCEDC fosters inclusive economic development across all five boroughs by helping to lay the foundations of growth, advancing quality jobs across sectors and promoting access to opportunity. Through investments in community facilities, affordable housing, parks, open space, streetscapes, infrastructure and resiliency projects, NYCEDC works with local communities to create dynamic and accessible neighborhoods across New York City. NYCNCC, a community-development entity administered by NYCEDC, applied for an additional New Market Tax Credit (NMTC) allocation in November 2019 and received notice in July 2020 that a third allocation of $50 million was granted by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, bringing NYCNCC's total amount awarded through the NMTC Program to $160 million to support health centers, community facilities, grocery stores and industrial projects in low-income communities. NYCEDC helps Minority, Women-Owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (M/W/DBEs) overcome challenges to winning government contracts for public projects through its Opportunity M/W/DBE program. The ConstructNYC program helps small to midsized M/W/DBEs in the construction sector pre-qualify for the opportunity to work on NYCEDC projects. NYCEDC's Emerging Developer Loan Fund provides low-interest loans to emerging M/W/DBE developers taking on real estate projects. A strong network of innovation spaces and programs across the five boroughs provide the resources companies need to grow in areas like advanced manufacturing, life sciences and digital technology. In addition, NYCEDC's HireNYC program helps connect low-income residents to job opportunities created by the organization's development projects.Page 380 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Develop and build physical assets and infrastructure in all five boroughs.

Goal 1a Support industry growth by improving the connectivity and livability of neighborhoods and investing in infrastructure and area-wide redevelopment. NYCEDC executed two land sales in Fiscal 2021 and, operating through the New York City Land Development Corporation (NYCLDC), entered into one ground lease. Collectively, these three transactions leveraged more than $589 million in private investment. In the South Bronx, NYCLDC facilitated the ground lease of a 103,000 square foot site for the first phase of the Bronx Point development. Once complete, this phase of Bronx Point will transform an underutilized waterfront site into a mixed-use development with 542 permanently affordable homes. The project will also deliver a 50,000 square foot permanent home for the Universal Hip-Hop Museum, an early childhood space run by BronxWorks, local retail space and a publicly accessible esplanade along the waterfront portion of the site. The developer is Bronx Point Owner, LLC, a joint venture partially controlled by a Woman-owned Business Enterprise and the recipient of a predevelopment loan through NYCEDC's Emerging Developer Loan Fund. As the City continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, NYCEDC expects to close more real estate transactions in Fiscal 2022 and beyond that will drive increased private investment across the five boroughs. Capital expenditures for Fiscal 2021 totaled approximately $412 million. Over the past year, NYCEDC has continued its capital construction work to improve the quality of life for New Yorkers. Construction is well underway for several economic development projects, including the construction of new ferry landings through our Citywide NYC Ferry service project, new infrastructure in the Lower Concourse area of the Bronx and Hudson Square Streetscape in the West Village. Construction is also progressing for projects undertaken on behalf of other City agencies, including Coney Island Hospital and Public Health Labs for NYC Health + Hospitals, Pier 42 and Manhattan Greenway East Midtown for NYC Parks, the Downtown Brooklyn Cultural Center for the Department of Cultural Affairs and our green infrastructure work throughout Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx for the NYC Department of Environmental Protection. NYCEDC's graffiti removal program, Graffiti-Free NYC (GFNYC), was suspended for most of Fiscal 2021 due to COVID-19 related budgetary constraints. The program resumed operations in May, however, and cleaned more than 200,000 square feet of graffiti across nearly 300 sites by the end of June. The GFNYC program will continue rebuilding its cleaning capacities to pre-pandemic levels over the course of Fiscal 2022. The NYC Ferry system served over 3.7 million riders across six routes in Fiscal 2021. As with other modes of transit, the pandemic and remote work trends continued to impact NYC Ferry service during the year, resulting in a 25 percent decrease in overall ridership from nearly 5 million riders in Fiscal 2020. Nonetheless, NYC Ferry ridership continued to climb over the course of the year and by June was carrying 60-70 percent of typical pre-pandemic ridership. Construction on the St. George ferry landing continued in Fiscal 2021 with the St. George route, Coney Island route and Ferry Point Park landing scheduled for launch in the first half of Fiscal 2022. Another milestone during Fiscal 2021 was the completion of construction of the 38th and final vessel in the NYC Ferry fleet, which is currently the largest passenger ferry fleet in the United States. The increased fleet size will set the stage for continued successful operation and growth of the NYC Ferry system in Fiscal 2022 and beyond.Page 382 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT and funding agreements) $217.6 $233.2 $216.0 $342.5 $412.0 * cleaned 9,861 11,090 14,236 10,557 299 * * Down * Square feet of graffiti removed (000) 5,720 6,139 7,087 5,360 208 * * Down * NYC Ferry - Average monthly ridership NA 341,672 472,571 413,921 312,082 * * NA Up \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None SERVICE 2Manage, maintain and enhance City assets to attract businesses. Goal 2a Leverage City assets to support business growth and strengthen communities' economic vitality. During Fiscal 2021, the square footage of City assets actively managed by NYCEDC increased slightly to 64.5 million and portfolio revenue generated increased by approximately $29 million to $252 million. The occupancy rate at NYCEDC- managed properties also increased slightly to 98.7 percent. The increase in square footage is due in part to the execution of a ground lease for the 103,000 square foot Bronx Point site in the Lower Concourse Neighborhood of the South Bronx. The increase in occupancy rate was driven by leasing activity at Brooklyn Army Terminal (BAT). In Fiscal 2021, NYCEDC also selected a developer for the Made in New York film and TV production hub ground lease at Bush Terminal in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, which is expected to support more than 2,200 permanent jobs and 1,800 additional construction jobs.

Goal 3a Grow and diversify the City's economy by enhancing the competitiveness of industries and businesses. During Fiscal 2021, NYCEDC served 6,200 businesses, primarily through efforts to assist in the City's COVID-19 pandemic response and recovery work. Although the financial constraints brought on by the pandemic limited our ability to run traditional business-support programs, there were notable accomplishments during the reporting period, including local production of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical supplies in collaboration with more than 100 local manufacturers and the launch of the NYC Small Business Resource Network (SBRN), which served nearly 5,000 businesses through one-on-one consultations aimed at helping businesses navigate programs to aid in their COVID-19 recovery. Looking ahead to Fiscal 2022, disruption from COVID-19 is expected to have lingering impacts on the current portfolio of business support programs. Nonetheless, NYCEDC remains committed to creating new opportunities to serve as many businesses as possible with a specific emphasis on supporting equitable economic recovery. New York City's businesses continued to be severely affected by COVID-19 and the NYS on PAUSE order during Fiscal 2021. As a result, the average unemployment rate for the year increased to 13.1 percent, up from 7.4 percent in Fiscal 2020.

The New York City Industrial Development Agency (NYCIDA) closed six transactions during Fiscal 2021. Together, these projects are expected to generate over $170 million in City tax revenue, leverage more than $30 million in new private investment and create 285 jobs within the first three years of their respective terms. A significant driver of this impact was the closing of two refunding bond transactions for Yankee Stadium and Citi Field. As a result of both transactions, workers at both stadiums will now be subject to and be protected by City prevailing wage laws and will see an immediate increase in their wages. The NYCIDA also closed a transaction under the Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) program for a 6,000-square-foot supermarket located within a new mixed-use affordable housing development in Harlem. The store will be operated as a Bravo Supermarket and it will be approximately twice the size of the original supermarket, which the owner has operated in the same location since 1991. The project will expand food access in a neighborhood that is chronically underserved by supermarkets. Build NYC Resource Corporation (Build NYC) closed 12 transactions during Fiscal 2021. Collectively, these projects are expected to generate more than $185 million in City tax revenue and leverage more than $460 million in private investment over the course of their respective terms. Among the new transactions, Build NYC provided financial assistance through tax-exempt bonds to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) to acquire and furnish a 12,277 square foot condominium unit in a new mixed-use building in Manhattan's Hudson Yard District, which has served as the organization's headquarters since 2019. The project will enable CPJ to commit to be headquartered in New York City for years to come while saving on rent costs. CPJ hopes to offer more interactive programming activities at this facility, including press conferences, screenings, panel discussions, receptions and other events. Build NYC also issued tax-exempt bonds to New World Preparatory Charter School for the construction of a 91,300 square foot three-story building to serve approximately 800 students in kindergarten through eighth grade in the Port Richmond neighborhood of Staten Island. The value of funding disbursed from City funding agreements in Fiscal 2021 exceeded $82 million. Notable highlights include funding for the construction of a 22,000 square foot cultural center by the Irish Arts Center. Once construction is completed later this year, the new cultural center will provide educational and community programming and is expected to serve 100,000 attendees annually. Separately, NYCEDC closed a funding agreement during Fiscal 2021 to support BioBAT, Inc., a not-for-profit organization created by the Research Foundation for SUNY that converts unfurnished space into wet lab and office space for leasing to life science companies at affordable rates. The funding of BioBAT contributes to the City's broader objectives of expanding the life sciences industry while growing good paying jobs for local communities.

The agency promotes the construction, rehabilitation and preservation of affordable, high-quality housing for low and moderate-income families in thriving and diverse neighborhoods in every borough. HPD enforces housing quality standards, finances affordable housing development and preservation, and ensures sound management of the City's affordable housing stock.FOCUS ON EQUITY Using a variety of preservation, development, enforcement, contracting, and community outreach strategies, HPD strives to improve the availability, affordability and quality of housing in all neighborhoods of New York City, while creating opportunities for economic advancement. By enforcing the Housing Maintenance Code, HPD works to ensure that New Yorkers live in safe and habitable neighborhoods and homes. By developing affordable housing, HPD seeks to serve households of a wide range of incomes, in all neighborhoods, with special attention to those with extremely low incomes, special needs, seniors, and the formerly homeless. Using a targeted, neighborhood-based approach to preservation, HPD is working to protect the ability of low-income families to remain in their current neighborhoods if they wish to do so, even as rents increase. At the same time, the Department's neighborhood planning team seeks to engage communities in shaping developments that pair new housing opportunities with the schools, healthcare facilities, retail, parks, community, commercial and open space, and other assets that neighborhoods need to thrive. As part of the continued effort to affirmatively further fair housing, in October 2020, the City of New York published Where We Live NYC, a comprehensive plan to advance fair housing, informed by extensive public engagement with a diverse group of New Yorkers. The Where We Live NYC plan is centered on addressing the legacy of discrimination in New York City and across the country, which has perpetuated inequities among New Yorkers based on race, disability, national origin, and other protected characteristics under federal, state, and local laws. To advance the goals outlined in Where We Live NYC, HPD enacted a number of new policies last year to expand access to financing, ownership opportunities, and capacity building for M/WBE and non-profit partners. HPD also updated its Design Guidelines to promote the health, equity, and sustainability of its affordable housing by facilitating broadband access, increasing energy efficiency, improving indoor air quality and ventilation, and expanding access to cooling and outdoor space. In partnership with the Department of City Planning (DCP), HPD is seeking public approval to bring new, deeply affordable housing to amenity-rich neighborhoods, including SoHo/NoHo and Gowanus. HPD is also implementing the Bedford-Stuyvesant Housing Plan, which focuses on the challenges facing a neighborhood that is home to one of the largest concentrations of Black residents nationally and has long been a beacon for Black culture. In addition, in partnership with DOHMH, HPD will expand proactive inspections of buildings with high health-risks, which contribute to disparities by race and by neighborhood in the prevalence of asthma and other harmful health conditions. These buildings are disproportionately located in majority Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, such as East Harlem and the South Bronx.Page 388 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Enforce the Housing Maintenance Code.

Goal 1a Resolve housing maintenance complaints efficiently. HPD saw a rise in the number of reported emergency complaints, which increased by 13 percent to 293,985 complaints. Compared to Fiscal 2020, heat and hot water complaints increased by 16 percent, while lead complaints increased by 46 percent. In Fiscal 2020, overall complaint numbers, including those for heat and hot water were artificially depressed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the months of March, April, and May. In Fiscal 2021, there was also a change to the definition of lead-based paint complaints in July 2020 pursuant to a change in local law, whereby a lead complaint will now be identified if there is a child under six who spends 10 or more hours in an apartment. The prior definition included only apartments where a child under six resided. In Fiscal 2021, HPD closed emergency complaints in 13.3 days, faster than the 20-day target for the agency. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency reassigned some of its inspectors to COVID-19 duties like inspecting businesses operating in COVID-19 clusters, including restaurants with indoor dining. HPD was also unable to make additional hires during the pandemic that would have allowed it to maintain its average response times from previous years. Despite this, 75 percent of all emergency complaints were closed within 12 days of receipt, higher than the previous four fiscal years. In Fiscal 2021, the average time to close nonemergency complaints was 25.6 days, about half a day slower than HPD's target of 25 days. For much of this period, HPD prioritized only immediate emergency conditions and heat and hot water complaints, delaying the response to other types of emergency and nonemergency complaints to protect the health of both tenants and staff. Overall, 74 percent of nonemergency complaints were closed within 20 days. The agency completed more than 627,958 inspections, which include complaint inspections, proactive inspections initiated by HPD and re-inspections of open violations. 466,320 * * reported 334,242 327,359 351,133 261,339 737,216 571,622 627,958 570,000 675,000 Down * Inspection visits per team per day 12.3 12.4 12.3 12.5 13.7 * * Neutral Up Ratio of completed inspections to attempted inspections (%) 80% 79% 80% 81% 83% * 541,216 532,571 568,822 415,228 467,079 * * closed 334,143 328,180 350,676 260,097 294,810 * * Down hot water 115,262 114,641 121,757 104,225 120,548 27,938 30,362 18,637 26,575 * 185,601 198,557 137,235 147,687 * * Down * \u00ab Average time to close emergency complaints (days) 12.4 11.4 10.4 10.9 13.3 20.0 12.0 Neutral Down \u00ab Average time to close nonemergency complaints (days) 21.0 17.5 17.7 21.4 25.6 25.0 20.0 Up Down \u00ab Emergency complaints closed within 12 receipt (%) 71% 72% 72% 75% \u00f1 \u00f1 Neutral Up of receipt (%) 73% 77% 78% 69% 74% * * Neutral Up \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 1b Improve compliance with the Housing Maintenance Code. The agency uses various tools to enforce the Housing Maintenance Code to ensure housing quality and compliance with legal and regulatory obligations. Enforcement and Neighborhood Services (ENS) works closely with other HPD divisions and community partners to identify buildings with housing quality issues, assess conditions and develop appropriate strategies to address those properties. ENS also works closely with responsible owners to develop plans to improve conditions. If HPD finds violations during inspections, the agency directs the landlord to perform repairs within a timeframe specified by law. Page 390 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT In Fiscal 2021, HPD issued 620,108 violations, a 31 percent increase compared to Fiscal 2020, with nonemergency violations accounting for much of this increase. Fiscal 2021 was also the first year the agency enforced the requirements for all multiple dwelling properties to file an annual bedbug report as required by Local Law 69 of 2017. As a result, HPD issued 103,000 class A violations in Fiscal 2021 for failure to file the Annual Bedbug Report. Many property owners responded to these violations and, as of June 30, 2021, HPD closed 32,971 bedbug filing violations. HPD's Housing Litigation Division (HLD) initiates cases in Housing Court to enforce compliance with the housing quality standards contained in the New York State Multiple Dwelling Law and the New York City Housing Maintenance Code. HLD seeks correction of conditions; civil penalties for failure to correct violations, filing false certifications of violations and failure to register a multiple dwelling building; the appointment of a 7A administrator; or access warrants. In Fiscal 2021, HLD initiated 1,778 cases, a 51 percent decrease from Fiscal 2020. Housing Court only addressed immediate emergency cases like heat violations, with all other HPD activities suspended or severely curtailed. In Fiscal 2021, 1,173 cases were settled, and 149 judgments related to cases initiated by HPD were entered in Court. Annually, HPD designates severely distressed multiple dwellings for participation in the Alternative Enforcement Program (AEP). Selection criteria include the number of hazardous (class \"B\") and immediately hazardous (class \"C\") Housing Maintenance Code violations along with the cost of emergency repair charges incurred because of work performed by HPD. AEP allows HPD to issue orders to correct violations and replace building systems. If a property owner fails to comply with AEP requirements for discharge from the program within the first four months, HPD issues Orders to Correct, conducts regular inspections and imposes significant fees. Since its inception in Fiscal 2008, AEP has successfully discharged 2,580 buildings. As of June 30, 2021, 557 buildings remained active in the AEP program, down 11 percent from the prior year. In the last quarter of Fiscal 2020 due to COVID-19, the City suspended re-inspections, an often-used mechanism for buildings in AEP to get their violations dismissed and get discharged from the program. Re-inspections resumed in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, resulting in more buildings discharged in Fiscal 2021. 474,619 620,108 * * issued 81,750 76,887 86,258 89,614 89,200 * * Up hot water 10,340 11,143 11,481 9,838 10,380 10,990 13,770 9,619 9,489 * 58,636 54,754 61,007 70,157 69,331 * 445,312 517,810 385,005 530,908 * * Up * \u00ab Violations issued and removed in the same fiscal year (%) 42% 43% 41% 44% 38% 40% 40% 55% 57% 57% 53% 50% 55% 55% (%) 10% 9% 8% 8% 510,713 539,777 467,785 443,278 * * Neutral Up corrected by owner 193,461 219,318 258,035 216,473 208,133 * * Neutral by HPD 6,371 7,093 4,957 3,656 1,778 * * Down * Housing Court cases initiated by HPD that were disposed 6,222 6,938 5,245 2,970 1,666 5,056 5,546 3,901 2,164 1,173 * * Down * - Cases resulting in judgments 578 671 563 349 149 * * Down * Total dollars spent on emergency repairs (excluding demolition and AEP) ($) $10,009,946 $10,680,843 $9,500,718 $9,500,718 $10,441,654 * * Neutral * Alternative Enforcement Program - Buildings currently active 579 553 491 628 557 * * Neutral * - Buildings discharged (cumulative) 1,558 1,834 2,146 2,259 2,580 * * Up * - Buildings discharged from program (%) (cumulative) 73% 73% 78% 80% 81% * * Up Up Total dollars spent on emergency repairs in the Alternative Enforcement Program ($) $2,738,310 $2,322,680 $2,353,336 $2,678,697 $2,308,657 * * Neutral * \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * NoneHOUSING PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT | Page 391 SERVICE 2Preserve and create quality affordable housing.

In Fiscal 2021, under Housing New York 2.0, the City financed the creation and preservation of 28,310 affordable units (homes), exceeding its goal of 25,000 and remaining on track to build or preserve 300,000 affordable homes by 2026. In the seventh full fiscal year of the Mayor's 12-year plan, the City financed 11,322 new construction units, the most new construction units ever for a fiscal year in HPD's history, and preserved 16,988 units, nearly 2,000 more units than the agency's preservation target, bringing the total housing starts under the Housing New York Plan to 194,481. The City has now created or preserved more than 25,000 affordable homes annually for the last four years. The agency completed 10,523 units in Fiscal 2021, about 2,800 units short of its overall completions target. The restrictions and precautions enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic halted and/or delayed construction, tenant relocation, and stalled inspections, affecting the completions for the fiscal year. Additionally, for both new construction and preservation projects, HPD continued its effort to aggressively follow up with its development teams to ensure the timeliness of project completion schedules. Despite these completion delays, the agency remains on track to accomplish its overall Housing New York plan goals.

Goal 3a Improve financial and physical stability of existing affordable housing. HPD's Division of Asset Management is responsible for ensuring the longevity and affordability of units that the agency has created or preserved. In Fiscal 2021 HPD increased the rental projects in its portfolio by nine percent, while the co-op projects in its portfolio increased by less than one percent, with only two additional co-op projects added to the portfolio compared to the previous fiscal year. The Asset Management portfolio of rental projects has grown as additional affordable housing units financed by HPD are leased up and transferred to Asset Management. More growth is expected in future years, based on additional development projects under the Housing New York plan. The agency tracks information on the physical and financial condition of projects it has financed, and oversees regulatory agreements ensuring the affordability of projects financed or receiving tax exemptions. This tracking is intended to be used as an early warning system to detect and mitigate potential risks to projects and affordability. For Fiscal 2021, nearly nine percent of rental projects and 27 percent of co-op projects in the Asset Management portfolio were at high risk of physical deterioration, financial distress, or noncompliance with federal requirements. Staff use these risk metrics to prioritize outreach and intervention efforts in collaboration with owners, partners and multiple divisions of HPD. Through interventions such as financial assistance, management changes and ownership changes, the agency works to proactively identify and address at-risk projects before physical or financial distress escalates.

Goal 4a Maximize federal rent subsidies to make housing affordable for low-income New Yorkers. The Housing Choice Voucher program, also known as Section 8, provides federal funding for subsidies for eligible low- income families to rent quality, safe, and affordable housing in neighborhoods of their choice. Families pay approximately 30 percent of their income toward rent and the subsidy, paid by HPD directly to the landlord makes up the difference within specified limits. The dwelling unit must also meet federal Housing Quality Standards (HQS) and is inspected prior to move in and then biennially. In Fiscal 2021 the overall voucher utilization rate was 97.2 percent, less than one percentage point below the target of 98 percent. The number of vouchers issued decreased by ten percent, to 2,663. While there was a decrease in vouchers issued because of a significant drop in application submission and an adjustment in client-facing operations at the height of the COVID-19 outbreak, all of HPD's vouchers remain committed per the preference categories in HPD's administrative plan. The timing of issuing those committed vouchers was impacted, but voucher issuance increased at the start of Fiscal 2021. In total, the number of households receiving a rent subsidy through all the voucher programs increased by two percent to 41,276 Performance 96.6% 3,227 2,951 2,663 * 39,694 39,526 39,906 40,636 41,276 * * Neutral Up Section units in abatement (%) 3% 2% 3% 2% 1% * * Down Down \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 4b Target HPD financed housing to the lowest income New Yorkers.

More than 5,200 of these units, or nearly 20 percent of the Fiscal 2021 total production are for extremely low income families earning up to $32,220 for a family of three. The agency has already exceeded the plan's goal of creating or preserving 75,000 units, or 25 percent of the entire Housing New York plan, for extremely low and very low income households by nearly 15,000 units. HPD also created nearly 3,300 units that serve seniors, and more than 2,800 units for formerly homeless New Yorkers - both records for this administration.

NYCHA serves 349,997 authorized residents in 168,100 apartments within 285 housing developments through the conventional public housing program (Section 9) and 20,201 authorized residents in 9,511 units within 50 developments that were converted to the PACT program (Section 8). Through federal rent subsidies (Section 8 Leased Housing Program), NYCHA also provides rental subsidies to approximately 88,516 families in locating and renting units. In addition, NYCHA facilitates access to social services through a variety of programs. NYCHA is at a critical moment in its 85- year history. Years of disinvestment and deterioration have led to an emergency situation that requires an urgent and extraordinary response. Through its Blueprint for Change proposals, NYCHA aims to strengthen its business model and raise much-needed capital funding for its developments. In January 2019, NYCHA and the City of New York signed an Agreement with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which outlined a set of reforms and performance targets across six pillar areas: inspections, lead, mold, pests/waste, heating, and elevators. An independent monitor is in place, working with NYCHA on these goals and issuing quarterly reports on compliance with the agreement. NYCHA is also investing in environmental resiliency and sustainability initiatives and other critical projects using funding from the recently approved City Capital Action Plan and other public funding sources. Finally, NYCHA continues to pursue NYCHA 2.0 initiatives that fund vital building and apartment upgrades while also exploring innovative strategies to build new 100% affordable housing.FOCUS ON EQUITY NYCHA promotes equity by providing quality housing for New Yorkers that is sustainable, inclusive, and safe, while fostering opportunities for economic mobility for its residents. NYCHA develops and implements programs, policies, and partnerships to support residents in the areas of employment, training, education, and health. In Fiscal Year 2021, NYCHA engaged 102,133 residents in the design and implementation of key initiatives, including planning for PACT conversions and collecting public comments and feedback on the Blueprint for Change. The Authority also facilitated an extensive engagement plan for the Transformation Plan , including a public comment process to ensure that all residents and stakeholders had the opportunity to share their feedback and ideas for change, townhalls meetings for stakeholders and staff, and various staff surveys. NYCHA is committed to delivering better services for residents, transforming as an organization, and investing capital across its portfolio to give residents the homes they deserve.Page 396 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Operate as an efficient and effective landlord.

Goal 1a Improve rent collection. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted NYCHA's rent collection. The cumulative rent collection decreased by eight percent, from 86.4 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 78.1 percent in Fiscal 2021 and did not meet the target of 97.5 percent. The rent delinquency increased from 37 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 40.2 percent in Fiscal 2021. The COVID-19 crisis changed the ways NYCHA engaged with residents to support rent collection for those who were delinquent. NYCHA followed all local, state and federal guidelines. The number of households that owe money for more than one month increased by 17 percent from 41,994 in June 2020 to 49,162 in June 2021. The Authority has received and processed more interim rent adjustments as a result of income reductions, which are contributing factors to the rising numbers. Residents concerned about paying their rent or who are experiencing financial hardship can apply for rent hardship through a simplified process which allows self-certification without the documents that were previously required (pay stubs, etc.). NYCHA is also encouraging residents who are in arrears to apply for the state's Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP). 34.9% 37.0% 40.2% * * Up Down \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 1b Expedite maintenance and repairs. The average time to resolve emergency complaints remained stable at 16.5 hours and was below the target of 24 hours in Fiscal 2021. The average time to resolve non-emergency service requests increased by 29 percent, from 27.6 days in Fiscal 2020 to 35.5 days in Fiscal 2021. NYCHA attributes this increase primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. NYCHA instituted work order guidance limiting staff from conducting certain lower-priority in-unit repairs during the pandemic. Following the advice of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), HUD and federal, local and state public health professionals, this guidance was put in place in mid-March 2020 to protect the health and safety of NYCHA's residents and employees. This limitation on the type of work that can be performed in apartments has negatively impacted the resolution time for non-emergency work orders. NYCHA has resumed work in apartments to address non-emergency repairs and other repairs which were not performed earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic. Through its Transformation Plan, NYCHA is rolling out several work order initiatives which will improve repair time through better planning and scheduling, improved staffing allocation, increased visibility in the work order process, as well as worker accountability and productivity through constant monitoring. Heat outage figures are reported for the heating season, which began on October 1, 2020 and ended on May 31, 2021. The average hours to resolve heat outages was 7.3, which was well below the target of 12 hours required in the January 2019 agreement with HUD. These positive results can be attributed to the continued utilization of a heating team dedicated to FY 21 FY 20 FY 19 FY 18 FY 17Average Time to Resolve Non-Emergency Service Requests (days) 19.418.617.527.635.5 Elevator Outages Emergency Service RequestsFY 21 FY 20 FY 19 FY 18 FY 17Average Time to Resolve Emergency Service Requests and Elevator Outages (hours) 10.311.712.113.112.7 9.6 9.516.7 11.116.5Page 398 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT resolving service interruptions 24/7, the activation of a \"Situation Room\" during periods of extreme cold to coordinate the response to interruptions and mobilization of resources in real time, and the constant monitoring of outage data through the use of dashboards and reports to identify issues proactively. The average time to resolve elevator outages increased 18 percent, from 9.5 hours in Fiscal 2020 to 11.1 hours in Fiscal 2021 and was higher than the target of 10 hours. The average outage per elevator per month increased from 0.97 to 1.09. The elevator service uptime dropped to 98.2 percent but was better than the target of 97 percent. In the early months of the pandemic, the COVID-19 work order guidance severely limited preventive maintenance in single car as well as duplex buildings, which led to a higher number of outages and subsequently a longer resolution time. NYCHA resumed preventive maintenance in its elevators in September 2020 and improved the resolution time to 9.9 hours for the second half of the fiscal year. Other efforts to improve elevator service include the hiring and training of additional elevator mechanic teams and investing in air conditioners in motor rooms, door lock monitors, and other equipment. NYCHA will continue to monitor this indicator. The percentage of elevator outages due to vandalism dropped to seven percent in Fiscal 2021 from 9.6 percent in Fiscal 2020. The decrease in vandalism is the result of continued reporting and training to accurately identify vandalism causes. The number of alleged elevator injuries decreased from nine in Fiscal 2020 to seven in Fiscal 2021. NYCHA's consistent training and continued safety communication to field staff and residents has helped reduce the number of injuries. The management cost per dwelling unit per month slightly increased from $1,077 in 2020 to $1,132 in Fiscal 2021. Operating expenses increased by $71 million as compared to Fiscal 2020 during the same period, led by $51.6 million in maintenance and operation costs, primarily for building sanitizing costs directly related to COVID 19 pandemic. This was followed by increases of $12.3 million of insurance premium and professional services in general and administrative expenses and $6.7 million in utilities.

In Fiscal 2021, the average time to prepare vacant apartments for re-rental dropped slightly to 111.2 days, compared to 114.5 days in Fiscal 2020. NYCHA continues to face challenges in prepping and turning over units as they require extensive work, especially in the areas of carpentry, plastering, painting and lead abatement. The turnaround time to re-occupy apartments increased 17 percent from 97.8 days to 114.2 days partly due to the long prep time for vacant apartments. In addition to the use of vendors to expedite the apartment prep process, NYCHA is also exploring policy modifications to improve the prospective tenant's experience during the apartment selection process by reducing the time between the apartment selection and the move-in date. These efforts should help reduce the overall time for re-occupancy.NEW YORK CITY HOUSING AUTHORITY | Page 399 Performance (days) 45.2 50.8 83.5 114.5 111.2 20.0 20.0 Up Down \u00ab Average (days) 55.1 51.8 76.5 97.8 114.2 30.0 30.0 Up Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 1d Improve safety and security.

NYCHA is also developing ways to boost resident engagement; work with resident leadership and their associations to secure additional funding for security enhancements such as LED lighting, closed-circuit television (CCTV), and Layered Access Control (LAC) entrances; and increase communication about safety and security issues with residents. As part of the Mayor's Action Plan for Neighborhood Safety (MAP), construction has been completed for new exterior lighting at 14 MAP developments. Construction is completed at 13 of the 15 MAP developments that are receiving CCTV/ LAC installation. As of June 30, 2021, CCTV and LAC installations have been completed at 57 of the 63 developments, and work is ongoing at five remaining sites. An additional 28 non-MAP developments are projected to have security enhancement work to begin in Fiscal Year 2022. This includes exterior site lighting, CCTV, and LAC.

Goal 2a Preserve the public and affordable housing asset. The percentage of active capital projects in construction on schedule was 89 percent in Fiscal 2021, down from 94.2 percent in Fiscal 2020. The percentage of all active capital projects on schedule was 73.0 percent in Fiscal 2021, compared to 78.9 percent in Fiscal 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted on time performance. It caused a six-month moratorium on city funded projects which was lifted in November 2020. The performance of non-city funded projects already in progress was restricted by CDC guidelines, which limited the number of staff that could be within a specific space on the site. Some vendors elected not to continue their work at the peak of the pandemic. A shortage of labor and supplies resulted in project delays. Department of Buildings and other regulatory inspections were also paused during this time. NYCHA's Capital Projects Division (CPD) continues to assess the risks and deploy strategies to remediate issues and improve the delivery time of the portfolio. Announced in November 2018, NYCHA is addressing $12.8 billion in overdue repairs in 62,000 apartments through public-private partnerships as part of its Permanent Affordability Commitment Together (PACT) initiative, which includes the federal Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program. All 62,000 apartments will be converted to Section 8 funding and remain permanently affordable. Section 8 funding provides a more stable flow of federal subsidy and allows NYCHA and its development partners to raise external financing to address a development's capital repair needs. Quality private managers will maintain and operate the buildings. Residents will pay rent limited to 30 percent of their income and retain robust rights and protections. Partnerships also deliver valuable social services from nonprofit partners to residents. NYCHA selects sites for the PACT program that have the highest capital needs and operating challenges. To date, NYCHA has converted 9,517 apartments through PACT since the initiative's launch, raising more than $1.75 billion to fund comprehensive repairs. Renovations are complete at more than 3,200 apartments in Queens and the Bronx. Major upgrades are underway at approximately 6,300 apartments and another 6,475 apartments across New York City are part of projects that are currently in predevelopment for comprehensive repairs.Page 400 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT 73.0% 75.0% 75.0% Neutral Up \u00ab schedule (%) 89.8% 77.3% 94.2% 89.0% 85.0% 2,418 2,351 2,252 * * Down * Number of developments transitioned (RAD/PACT Portfolio) NA NA 18 14 17 * * NA * Number of buildings transitioned (RAD/PACT Portfolio) NA NA 67 97 38 * * NA * Number of apartments transitioned through PACT/RAD (RAD/ PACT Portfolio) NA NA 2,458 3,940 1,718 * * NA * \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 2b Optimize access to affordable housing in public housing developments to income-eligible families. NYCHA's occupancy rate has remained stable at 98.6 percent in Fiscal 2021 compared to 98.8 percent in Fiscal 2020. As of June 2021, NYCHA had 168,100 Section 9 units. The number of applicants placed in public housing decreased by nine percent, from 3,330 in Fiscal 2020 to 3,035 in Fiscal 2021. Among the contributing factors to the decrease is the availability of fewer units due to RAD/PACT conversions, including those scheduled for conversion later this year as new rentals have stopped at these sites. The longer apartment prep time has also impacted placements. NYCHA will continue to monitor this indicator. The overall number of homeless households placed in housing in Fiscal 2021 was 13 percent lower compared to Fiscal 2020. The number of homeless placed in public housing dropped from 1,913 to 1,597 and the number of homeless placed through Section 8 decreased from 749 to 726. The trend in homeless placements was reflective of the decrease of available apartments as noted for NYCHA's overall placements.

The number of families on the Section 8 waiting list decreased to about 34,000 in Fiscal 2021 from 40,000 in Fiscal 2020. Over the past year, NYCHA's Section 8 program conducted outreach to the applicants to update its waiting list. The decrease is a result of those applicants who did not confirm continued interest in remaining on the waiting list. The maximum allowable Section 8 vouchers increased slightly from 104,054 in Fiscal 2020 to 106,410 in Fiscal 2021. The funded Section 8 vouchers slightly increased from 87,285 to 88,880. The increase reflects new program admissions and PACT conversions. The percentage of biennial Section 8 inspections completed declined from 93 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 61 percent for the same period in Fiscal 2021. Following the COVID-19 guidance, the Leased Housing Department suspended all Housing Quality Standards inspections, which severely impacted the inspection completion rate. In January 2021, NYCHA resumed the inspection process through remote video. The percentage completion of annual Section 8 recertifications remained stable at 99 percent due to a continued focus on productivity and streamlined case processing.NEW YORK CITY HOUSING AUTHORITY | Page 401 The number of applicants placed through Section 8 vouchers decreased by 34 percent, from 3,632 in Fiscal 2020 to 2,397 in Fiscal 2021. Although NYCHA continues to issue vouchers, there were fewer placements due to the ongoing state of emergency under COVID-19. NYCHA's Leased Housing Department modified its operations to continue issuing vouchers and receiving rental packages via email. This is still in place while the walk-in centers are closed.

Launched in December 2018, the Build to Preserve (BTP) program is expected to address approximately $2 billion in capital repairs over the next 10 years across approximately 10,000 NYCHA apartments. NYCHA will use this new model to develop new mixed-use, mixed-income housing on underused public-owned land and dedicate 100 percent of the proceeds to repairs at the surrounding development. Any remaining funds will be invested in repairs at other NYCHA developments in the neighborhood. New buildings will be subject to Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) levels of affordability and will increase the City's permanently affordable housing stock. NYCHA released an RFP in April 2021 to implement a community-driven preservation and investment strategy at Fulton, Chelsea, Chelsea Addition, and Elliott Houses in the Chelsea neighborhood. The four developments, which include 2,073 apartments across 24 buildings in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, have an estimated total of $366 million in extensive capital need and repair costs ranging from heating infrastructure to building security improvements.

NYCHA's emergency transfer priority is available to NYCHA residents who are victims of domestic violence, intimidated victims, intimidated witnesses, or child sexual victims as well as all categories defined under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). VAWA includes victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The priority is intended to enhance safety for at-risk residents by providing confidential relocation to another NYCHA development. The number of residents approved for an emergency transfer increased by 28 percent, from 1,776 in Fiscal 2020 to 2,266 in Fiscal 2021. The emergency transfer disposition time was up by 15 percent, from 14.9 days in Fiscal 2020 to 17.2 days in Fiscal 2021. There was a significant increase in domestic violence transfer requests, anecdotally due to pandemic related social factors. The increased volume led to a slight increase in the processing time, but it remains well below the 45-day target. Page 402 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT The referrals to supportive services provided to senior residents almost doubled from 41,586 in Fiscal 2020 to 81,176 in Fiscal 2021. The increase in supportive services is attributed to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wellness calls were conducted by all Community Engagement and Partnerships (CEP) departments and executive staff. Residents were referred to an array of services such as home care, health care, entitlements, addressing rent, and repair needs. Residents were also connected to food delivery services through GetFoodNYC and other community-based food services; NYC Well Health; DOE Grab and Go; and Capsule for free medication. They also received free tablets with training and free air conditioners through the Mayor's Office. The initial social service tenant contacts conducted within five days increased slightly by two percent, from 91 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 93 percent in Fiscal 2021.

There were 1,411 overall resident job placements in Fiscal 2021 compared to 2,127 in Fiscal 2020. This indicator includes 1,175 direct placements through NYCHA's Office of Resident Economic Empowerment and Sustainability (REES) and Human Resources Department as well as 236 partner placements. The decrease can be attributed to COVID-19 pandemic, which began in mid-March 2020 and immediately caused NYCHA to pause hiring in many of its titles. NYCHA employer contractors also paused much of their hiring and Jobs-Plus partners experienced a shortage of employment opportunities with New York on pause. The percentage of job placements to program graduates decreased from 90.6 percent in Fiscal 2020 to 86 percent in Fiscal 2020. From our observations, many things played into the placement numbers for the training programs. The COVID-19 epidemic lead to the physical closing of NYCHA's REES offices beginning in March 2020, and those of many of our partners. Most of the training provider partners had to pause and transition to primarily virtual outreach, information session, workshops and trainings\u2014many amid cohorts that had already begun prior to March. In addition, due to social distancing requirements, cohorts that were still meeting in person had reduced class size. Further complicating completions and placements during FY2021 was the lack of, or absence of connectivity, which caused residents to not participate fully and/or dropping prior to completion/placement because they did not possess the necessary technology equipment. The youth placed in jobs through youth employment programs dropped to 3,231 in Fiscal 2021 from 3,896 in Fiscal 2020. NYCHA continues its collaboration with the City's Department of Youth and Community Development to support them and their providers on two NYCHA-specific initiatives under the Summer Youth Employment Program: Career First and MAP for $uccess. Both programs provide reserved slots for NYCHA youth and young adults from select NYCHA developments. In addition to these two programs, NYCHA also directly hired youth through its seasonal program and the City's Clean Up Corps.

Currently, NYCHA is not in compliance with several federal regulations and is working to assess the extent of noncompliance. On January 31, 2019, NYCHA signed an agreement with HUD to resolve claims brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, including on behalf of HUD and the Environmental Protection Agency. The agreement establishes a framework by which NYCHA will continue to evaluate its compliance with federal requirements. The agreement also requires NYCHA to take certain actions and meet certain standards and deadlines related to health and safety. NYCHA has not yet met certain standards and deadlines set forth in the agreement and continues to work with an independent monitor to improve its compliance with these requirements. The monitor is in place with access to NYCHA information and personnel and has issued and will continue to issue quarterly reports on NYCHA's compliance with the agreement.

The agency reviews applications for work on designated properties, investigates complaints of illegal work and initiates action to compel compliance with the Landmarks Law. LPC also administers a federally funded Historic Preservation Grant Program that provides financial assistance to low-to-moderate income New Yorkers to help fund work on designated properties.FOCUS ON EQUITY LPC is committed to ensuring equity in all aspects of the agency's work and to reaffirm that commitment, LPC launched an Equity Framework in January 2021 to guide agency priorities for the year and into the future. This includes prioritizing designations that represent New York City's diversity and designations in areas less represented by landmarks. During Fiscal 2021, LPC designated several landmarks and historic districts as part of its equity framework, including the Dorrance Brooks Square Historic District, the first historic district named after an African American, and which has strong associations with notable figures in the Harlem Renaissance; the Kimlau War Memorial, the first NYC landmark that specifically recognizes Chinese American history and culture; and on Staten Island, The Aakawaxung Munahanung (Island Protected from the Wind) Archaeological Site, the first NYC landmark specifically recognizing the many generations of Indigenous peoples who lived here. LPC responded quickly to the pandemic to ensure equitable access and continuity in all critical functions. The agency instituted e-filing and virtual hearings to continue to issue permits and allow for robust public engagement. In addition, LPC has been working to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency in regulation, so that all property owners understand the agency's processes and have equal access to resources and technical assistance. In June 2021, the agency launched LPC's Open Office Hours initiative for homeowners considering work on their designated buildings. This initiative enables property owners to virtually meet one-on-one with preservation staff to discuss their potential projects and ask questions about LPC permitting. Finally, the agency applied equity through education and outreach programs focused on the benefits and responsibilities of preservation in communities across all five boroughs. As a regulatory agency, it is essential for applicants to understand the agency's processes and have equal access to resources. During Fiscal 2021, LPC organized 15 virtual community-focused outreach events and informational presentations, targeting neighborhoods like Central Harlem in Manhattan, and Ridgewood and Addisleigh Park in Queens. LPC also hosted a citywide grants and tax benefits webinar on funding opportunities through LPC's Historic Preservation Grant Program, tax credits from the New York State Historic Preservation Office and other financial incentives offered by the New York Landmarks Conservancy, and a citywide webinar on filing permit applications with LPC.Page 406 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Identify and protect qualifying architectural, historical, cultural and archaeological assets in all five boroughs.

Goal 1a Identify and designate as landmarks, eligible individual buildings, interiors, scenic landmarks and historic districts. In Fiscal 2021, the Commission completed 10 designations including eight individual landmarks and two historic districts, for a total of 339 buildings and sites. Among the new individual landmarks are Holyrood Episcopal Church-Iglesia Santa Cruz, which fills a gap in representation of New York City's Latino community; 70 Fifth Avenue, significant as the former home of the national office of the NAACP in the early-20th century, as well as many progressive organizations that advanced social justice and equality; and the Harriet and Thomas Truesdell House at 227 Duffield Street, a rare surviving 19th-century abolitionists' home in Downtown Brooklyn. The Commission also surveyed less represented areas like East Flatbush in Brooklyn, where the agency designated its first historic district, East 25th Street Historic District, which recognizes both the architectural quality and the residents' incredible stewardship of their historic homes and their block. Designations are impacted by COVID-19, which slowed or suspended certain Agency activities and operations by necessity as part of citywide efforts to minimize person to person contact and contain the spread of the virus, including many of the types of in-person meetings, targeted outreach activities, field surveys and research work that are typically part of the designation process.

The number of permit applications received in Fiscal Year 2021 was 10,907 and the Commission acted on 10,075 applications, both a decrease from Fiscal Year 2020. This decrease is due to COVID-19's impact on the economy and real estate activity in New York City. In Fiscal Year 2021, approximately 84 percent of Certificates of No Effect (CNEs) were issued within 10 business days. This is a slight decrease from 85 percent in Fiscal Year 2020 and falls just below LPC's target of 85 percent. Expedited Certificates of No Effect (XCNEs) issued within two days remained stable at 100 percent. The average number of days from completed submission to issuance for CNEs was 5.9 days, up from 5.7 days the year prior. Permits for Minor Work (PMWs,) increased to 6.4 days from 5.9 days. This half-day increase is likely due to the logistics surrounding the implementation of the Agency's new e-filing system, which was developed internally in response to COVID-19. For XCNEs, it remained stable at 1.0 days. Through continuous evaluation of both LPC's reporting and permitting processes, the Agency aims to further enhance the efficiency and efficacy of its services and continue to execute its mission.

There is no correlation between the number of complaints received and the number of enforcement actions taken. While some complaints result in multiple violations, others do not warrant enforcement action after investigation. Complaint trends often reflect which neighborhood groups have higher number of engaged advocates who report violations. As a consequence of the economic impact of COVID-19 on City property owners, the Agency decided to immediately act on only more serious violations or violations where there is on-going work, and held off on pursuing enforcement for less significant issues.

Its commitment to equity, effectiveness and sustainability guides its work with City agencies on recruiting, hiring and training employees; providing facilities management for 55 public buildings; acquiring, selling and leasing City property; purchasing more than $1 billion in supplies and equipment each year; and implementing energy conservation and safety programs throughout the City's facilities and vehicle fleet.FOCUS ON EQUITY DCAS's commitment to equity means ensuring that City government leads the way on having a diverse and inclusive workplace and providing all New Yorkers with an opportunity to get ahead. To reach this goal, during Fiscal 2021 DCAS participated in 216 career outreach events, many of which were conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure an inclusive workplace for City employees, DCAS trained 202,329 City employees on equity and inclusion. DCAS participated in four virtual M/WBE outreach events during Fiscal 2021 and awarded a total of $51.5 million in contracts to M/WBEs\u2014$17.7 million COVID-related goods and $33.8 million for non-COVID-related goods and services. DCAS also registered 47 contracts with City-certified M/WBEs using the M/WBE noncompetitive small purchase method (PPB Rule 3-08(c)(1)(iv)), totaling $5 million. This method allows agencies to purchase goods and services from M/WBEs in amounts not exceeding $500,000 without competition. DCAS is the backbone of City government and its focus on equity sets the tone for the work of all City agencies.Page 414 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Help City agencies fulfill their workforce needs.

Goal 1a Increase the public's access to information about employment opportunities in City government. In Fiscal 2021 the number of applications received for all DCAS civil service exams decreased four percent compared to Fiscal 2020. Although applicants had the ability to submit civil service exam applications via the Online Application System (OASys) during the COVID-19 pandemic, applicants were presented with fewer open application periods as restrictions on gatherings led to the suspension and cancellation of various civil service exam-related activities conducted by DCAS. Under pre-COVID-19 conditions, DCAS made Computer-based Testing and Application Centers (CTACs) available for the public to apply for, take and find information on civil service exams offered by DCAS. Due to COVID-19 related restrictions, applicants who did not have the ability to apply online due to limited resources may have been affected by the closure of the CTACs. However, DCAS foresees exam applications increasing in Fiscal 2022 given that various exams and activities previously suspended have resumed, including the re-opening of the CTACs in mid-May of 2021, allowing applicants to safely submit applications in-person again. In Fiscal 2021 the number of employment applications received via NYC Jobs decreased 54 percent when compared to Fiscal 2020, although job seekers had the ability to submit job applications online via NYC Jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease in NYC Jobs applications is directly attributed to a 49 percent decrease in job openings citywide as hiring was suspended due to budget cuts. The possible limited computer and internet availability for applicants, potentially due to restrictions on public gatherings at locations like libraries and community centers during COVID-19 may have also contributed to the decrease in NYC Jobs applications. In the meantime, DCAS continues to increase public access to information about employment opportunities in City government online at NYC.gov/jobs and by posting annual civil service exam schedules and monthly application schedules on the DCAS website. DCAS also partners with other City agencies and attends in-person and virtual career fairs with community-based organizations and educational institutions to educate the public about careers in civil service. To continue building a workforce pipeline for the City, in Fiscal 2021 DCAS attended 52 career and job fairs and provided 164 civil service information sessions, all which were held virtually. DCAS targeted underserved, and under-represented groups at 63 career outreach events, including 30 for persons with disabilities, 10 for the Asian community, 10 for the Hispanic/Latino community, eight for veterans and five for the LGBTQI+ community.

In Fiscal 2021, minority hires represented approximately 77 percent of new hires at mayoral City agencies, decreasing approximately one percentage point compared to Fiscal 2020, but remaining stable over the last five fiscal years. The DCAS Office of Citywide Recruitment's career outreach events may have contributed in part to the stability of the high rate of minority new hires through continually targeting underserved and under-represented groups. Female new hires decreased approximately 13 percentage points, which is not unique to the City of New York and is attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and a larger national trend of women leaving the labor force. A June 2021 report from the National Women's Law Center showed women gaining about 56.2 percent of jobs added back to the economy in May 2021, but this gain was not enough to offset pandemic-related losses.1Page 416 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT During the pandemic, DCAS continued to assist agencies in enhancing recruitment efforts that build a workforce reflecting the diverse City it serves. DCAS develops the City's future leadership by identifying and cultivating present talent. DCAS supports other agencies in their review of trends in employee demographics by providing relevant and timely metrics to stakeholders on the status of its equal employment opportunity (EEO) efforts; through quarterly demographic reports to agencies summarizing incumbents, new hires, promotions, separations and under-representation by race/ethnicity and gender; and a biennial EEO-4 report to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the target of 185 civil service examinations open for filing by DCAS was not met in Fiscal 2021. The suspension and cancellation of scheduled multiple-choice civil service exams that are normally administered in-person at the Computer-based Testing and Application Centers (CTACs) due to the COVID-19 related restrictions, significantly impacted DCAS' ability to meet the Fiscal 2021 target. Because the end of the pandemic-related restrictions was unknown, it was not feasible for DCAS to safely resume in-person exam events until the latter part of Fiscal 2021. Despite the pandemic, DCAS was still able to open application periods for civil service exams appropriate for virtual formats due to the technological investments the Department made prior, including the deployment of the Qualified Incumbent Exam (QIE) and the Education and Experience Exam (EEE). As a result, these online exam types were prioritized for administration and conducted in place of in-person multiple choice exams. The median time from exam administration to exam results completion for DCAS-administered exams exceeded its target, taking 318 days in Fiscal 2021 compared to 299 the prior year. The increase is also attributed to the suspension of various in-person exam activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted post-exam activities for civil service exams administered prior to the start of the pandemic. DCAS expects the median to remain close to or potentially exceed the target in Fiscal 2022 until the City resumes full operations due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic, DCAS strives to work towards a Fiscal 2022 target of a median 290 days (approximately nine months) from exam administration to exam results completion for DCAS-administered exams, as the City moves towards resuming pre-COVID activities. In Fiscal 2022 DCAS plans to continue monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic to fully resume all in-person exam activities safely. In the meantime, DCAS will continue to enable applicants to apply for civil service exams online for all exam types and continue to administer QIEs and EEEs online, which have a much shorter exam completion time due to successful automation efforts. Additionally, DCAS looks forward to continuing investments in technology that moves the City closer to potentially administering multiple-choice exams remotely.

DCAS exceeded its target for the average rating of professional development training sessions by three percentage points and increased its average rating by two percentage points in Fiscal 2021 when compared to the prior year. As a result of the suspension of in-person training activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, DCAS was unable to meet its Fiscal 2021 target for the number of City employees/participants trained in Citywide Managerial and Professional Development programs. In Fiscal 2022 the reopening of the DCAS Citywide Training Center (CTC) and in-person training is expected to increase participation in managerial and professional development programs that should allow DCAS to meet its target for this indicator in the year ahead. In Fiscal 2021 DCAS exceeded its target for 'City employees/participants trained in Equity and Inclusion' primarily due to the online availability of the mandated equity and inclusion trainings. However, there was a 14 percent decrease for this indicator in Fiscal 2021 compared to the previous fiscal year, which is attributed to the suspension of in-person classes at the CTC and limited computer and internet availability for some employees at the beginning of the fiscal year when employees were still making the transition to remote work during the pandemic. As the City reopens in Fiscal 2022, DCAS will work to gradually resume in-person training and expand online training within the broader training portfolio. Emphasis will be placed on exploring alternative training methods for employees who continue to work remotely and in non-traditional workspaces. 63,410 33,900 56,346 55,364 Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None SERVICE 2 Manage and operate City-owned office buildings.

The average number of bidders per bid increased from 2.7 in Fiscal 2020 to 4.0 in Fiscal 2021 due to continuous efforts to promote upcoming procurements to vendors. Mayoral agency spending on services against DCAS City government-wide master contracts decreased to 16 percent in Fiscal 2021, a five percentage point decrease compared to the same period in Fiscal 2020. This decrease was primarily due to two factors: in-person non-essential operations ceasing starting in March 2020 paired with the implementation of emergency telecommuting policies due to COVID-19, and the emergency suspension of Procurement Policy Board rules in March 2020 to facilitate expedited purchasing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical equipment to meet the City's needs responding to the pandemic.

DCAS served as the chief agent for sourcing and procuring PPE and medical products, which it did by utilizing a large pool of vendors. All COVID-19 related items delivered in Fiscal Year 2021 were shipped to the DCAS Central Storehouse or other New York City-managed warehouses for distribution to medical facilities, City agencies and other public entities to combat COVID-19 and keep New Yorkers safe. In Fiscal 2021, the Central Storehouse distributed $172.632 million worth of product including PPE to medical facilities, City agencies and other public entities. In Fiscal 2021 inspections deemed non-compliant decreased by 31 percent compared to Fiscal 2020 as more vendors adhered to the contract specification requirements. The value of cost avoidance decreased 16 percent compared to Fiscal 2020. This decrease was attributable to fewer non-compliant COVID goods compared to the previous year.

Goal 5a Maximize citywide efforts to monitor and reduce energy use to reach greenhouse gas reduction goals. In Fiscal 2021 the City purchased 27.8 trillion British Thermal Units (BTUs) of energy (electricity, natural gas and steam), down one percent compared to Fiscal 2020. For the first six months of Fiscal 2021, total energy use decreased month- over-month. In February and March, gas and steam usage increased approximately 17 percent and 21 percent, respectively. This increase in usage corresponds to a greater number of heating degree days (cumulative temperature differences below 65 Fahrenheit) in February and March in Fiscal 2021 compared to February and March in Fiscal 2020. Beginning in May electric consumption increased by about 6 percent with a 12 percent increase in June. This increase in electrical consumption is likely attributable to employees returning to work DCAS supports agency participation in Demand Response (DR) programs, which aim to reduce building electric load during periods of high strain on the electric grid. More than 515 facilities across 31 agencies (including 11 cultural institutions) participated in DR in Fiscal 2021, and final Fiscal 2021 performance will be announced in late 2021. Total Summer 2021 commitments are 103.6 MW, equivalent to removing approximately 415 mid-size schools from the electric grid. City government commitments in the New York State grid program account for 20.2 percent of DR reductions in New York City. To support increased DR participation, DCAS has installed real-time meters for 196 utility accounts in Fiscal 2021. Installations through Fiscal 2021 put DCAS at 60 percent of capturing City electricity peak demand with a target of capturing 80 percent of City electricity peak demand by Fiscal 2022.

With the passage of the Climate Mobilization Act (CMA) of 2019, City government operations are required to reduce their overall emissions 40 percent by Fiscal 2025 and 50 percent by Fiscal 2030 compared to a Fiscal 2006 baseline. These are key milestones on the path to achieving citywide carbon neutrality by 2050 while showing City government's commitment to leading the fight against climate change impacts. In the past five years (Fiscal 2017-2021), DCAS has completed nearly 2,800 energy efficiency projects in over 1,700 unique public facilities, resulting in estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions of nearly 262,300 metric tons annually, the equivalent of taking more than 57,045 typical passenger vehicles off the road. In Fiscal 2021 DCAS completed 839 energy efficiency projects that are estimated to reduce GHG emissions by more than 23,600 metric tons annually, equivalent to removing 5,133 cars from the road. On-site work across DCAS's programs was hampered by site access restrictions and facilities staff shifting focus to critical operations in response to COVID-19.

COVID-19 slowed all on-site work, including construction, inspection and interconnection, site feasibility assessments and existing system operations and maintenance during Fiscal 2021. Despite the slowdown, DCAS has installed nearly 14 MW of solar photovoltaics as of the end of Fiscal 2021, an increase in total installed capacity of 28 percent from the prior year. Additionally, DCAS has active solar projects totaling nine MW, with an additional 31 MW in the project pipeline that is planned to be completed in the upcoming years.

To achieve this, the Department ensures that City records are properly maintained following professional archival and record management practices and makes materials available to diverse communities both online and in person. The Department's website provides the public with access to more than 1.6 million historical photographs, maps and a growing online collection of more than 23,000 reports and publications issued by City agencies. The Municipal Archives and Library staff annually respond to more than 60,000 reference requests and provide the public and City agencies access to approximately 185,000 cubic feet and 100 terabytes of historical City records and photographs, as well as a collection of more than 400,000 books, government reports, studies and other publications. Approximately 77 percent of the holdings require preservation work and the Conservation Unit implements the necessary rehousing, conservation treatments and other specialized measures. The Municipal Records Management Division develops and administers City government's records management policies, operates records storage facilities, provides records management services to 65 government entities and oversees the government's transition to digital records management.FOCUS ON EQUITY The Department of Records and Information Services (DORIS) has expanded the public's access to government records by establishing a centralized Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) portal and an online repository of reports City agencies are required to publish. This expanded access makes important contemporary government actions available to the general public. In addition, DORIS has focused on bringing primary source material to new audiences that might otherwise not think that historical records had relevance. The records of City government serve critical functions\u2014recording government decisions, showing interactions between residents and policymakers and documenting the lives of individual New Yorkers. A focus on identifying previously hidden collections, repairing the records, inventorying and digitizing them allows the Department to show the complexity of these interactions. One example is the collection of claims filed with the City after the 1863 Draft Riots which documents what mostly Black and immigrant residents lost and, in the process, provides insight into those lives. DORIS has devoted attention to showing the relevance and diversity of City government's records through several initiatives including an oral history project, exhibits and social media posts. The Department continues to expand outreach to New Yorkers by diversifying public speakers, conducting community outreach and increasing digital promotion of the Archives. The Department's story-gathering initiative in Bedford-Stuyvesant continues to document the lives of long-term community residents. The Women's Activism project partnered with organizations throughout the City to gather stories of everyday women leaders and sponsored programs including a screening of the film \"The Incorrigibles\" and panel discussions with historians and juvenile justice advocates.Page 426 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Provide the public and City agencies with access to public records and publications.

Goal 2c Dispose of all records according to their scheduled retention period.DEPARTMENT OF RECORDS & INFORMATION SERVICES | Page 427 HOW WE PERFORMED IN FISCAL 2021 SERVICE 1Provide the public and City agencies with access to public records and publications. Goal 1a Increase the volume and availability of public records and publications. During Fiscal 2021, the number of images produced in the Department's digital laboratory increased 57 percent, rising to 2,285,564 items compared to 1,448,706 items during Fiscal 2020. The higher volume is attributable to the digitization of microfilmed historical death certificates using a more expedient methodology than reformatting the original material. The number of visitors to the Department's website and related online platforms increased 120 percent, from 268,000 in Fiscal 2020, to 592,000 in Fiscal 2021. Closure of the public facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting migration to the agency's website and online platforms for access to digitized materials and information accounts for the significant increase in this measurement. During Fiscal 2021, 5,055 publications and reports were acquired by the Municipal Library, an increase of 13 percent over the 4,455 items acquired in Fiscal 2020. The percent of required agency reports submitted to the Library publications portal decreased to 40 percent during Fiscal 2021 compared to 61 percent submitted in Fiscal 2020. As agencies return to regular operations during the next fiscal year, this indicator is expected to recover, and the Department will continue efforts to receive the required reports. Historical records accessioned into the Municipal Archives decreased 72 percent, from 399 cubic feet in Fiscal 2020 to 111 cubic feet during Fiscal 2021. COVID-19 health and safety restrictions impeded performance of this function and staff were assigned tasks that could be carried out remotely such as improving descriptions of records previously accessioned. The volume of visitors and program attendees fell 45 percent from 1,884 in Fiscal 2020 to 1,031 in Fiscal 2021. The decrease is attributable to closure of the public exhibition space due to COVID-19 health and safety restrictions. Unable to host in-person events, the Department promoted awareness of its holdings of contemporary and historical records to diverse audiences through on-line exhibitions and related programing. These included workshops highlighting Womens Activism and the Neighborhood Stories projects, panel discussions, and author and artist talks. New virtual exhibits featured on the agency website are \"Ebb & Flow: Tapping into the History of New York City's Water,\" and \"Public Record\" by the Department's artist-in-residence, The Department also launched its 'Lunch and Learn' program with a presentation about the Manhattan building plan preservation project.

In Fiscal 2021 the quantity of records transferred into the Municipal Records Center continued in a downward trend, decreasing to 487 cubic feet from 661 in Fiscal 2020, and 5,121 in Fiscal 2019. The decrease is attributed to agencies using the City's requirements contract for their off-site storage needs, the pivot to storing records in digital format, and the closure of agencies and courts due to COVID-19 health and safety measures.

DOF records property- related documents, administers property tax exemption and abatement programs, assists New Yorkers with tax payment issues through the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate, adjudicates parking tickets, administers the City's bank accounts, manages the City's cash flows, and administers its business and excise taxes. Through the Office of the Sheriff, DOF enforces court mandates, orders, warrants of arrest, property seizures, and a wide variety of state and City public safety mandates. The Sheriff's Office investigates deed fraud, the trafficking of illegal and untaxed tobacco products and the sale of synthetic narcotics. In addition, the Sheriff's Office performed activities related to the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the year, such as providing enforcement of rules and regulations. Through the Mayor's Office of Pensions and Investments, DOF advises the administration on the management of the City's five pension systems. DOF is committed to providing exceptional customer service. The agency utilizes a customer-centric business model, incorporating reforms and initiatives. DOF, leveraging Lean Six Sigma and technology, continues to streamline processes and improve cycle times. This furthers the mission and enables a better customer experience for the City's taxpayers.FOCUS ON EQUITY DOF administers several programs to ensure the fair treatment of all New Yorkers and ensure their access to City services and information. The agency's five borough- based business centers and its Customer Contact Center provide all residents and businesses with support regarding payments, property exemptions and business taxes. This fiscal year, DOF business centers served more than 700,000 customers and the Contact Center received 51,000 calls from constituents. DOF administers key property tax exemption programs such as the Senior Citizens Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE), the Disability Rent Increase Exemption (DRIE), the Senior Citizen Homeowners' Exemption (SCHE) and the Disability Homeowners' Exemption (DHE), which help qualifying renters and homeowners remain in their homes. The Taxpayer Advocate and the Parking Summons Advocate provide additional means for taxpayers and other constituents to address issues with their taxes or parking violations, respectively. During the pandemic, DOF adapted its programs and procedures to meet the needs of constituents facing hardships. For example, DOF created new payment plans for those with outstanding judgment debt to account for pandemic-related hardships. Also, in order to ensure a safe means for constituents to conduct business with DOF and to ensure the safety of DOF employees, the agency expanded online capabilities to schedule appointments with the City Register, Senior-Disabled Centers, Adjudications, Court Assets (Bail Services), the Office of the Parking Summons Advocate, the Tax Map unit, and the Business Centers. DOF also implemented virtual appointments that allow a customer to book an appointment for a direct home-phone contact by a DOF representative. To expand services available online, DOF launched a new tenant access portal that allows SCRIE and DRIE participants and their representatives to access benefit information and new applicants to file Rent Freeze applications online. Portal enhancements to allow existing participants to file renewal applications online are scheduled to be complete in the second quarter of 2022. Lastly, DOF also expanded payment options for constituents through the launch of PayPal and Venmo.Page 432 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Bill and collect property and other taxes.

Goal 1a Increase the proportion of individuals and businesses that are in compliance with tax and revenue laws. The increase in the turnaround time to complete audits is due to the continued challenges taxpayers and representatives faced during the COVID-19 pandemic with providing business records requested of them by auditors. DOF expects improvements during Fiscal 2022 as offices reopen and business representatives gain greater access to their business records. By closing a higher proportion of larger taxpayer audits and through the refinement of case selection and assignment, the percentage increase in audit-related tax liability was significantly higher than in prior years. The refinements enable DOF to prioritize cases of higher complexity that take longer to close, but generate larger increases in tax liability. The tax lien sale that started in February 2020 was cancelled in Fiscal 2021 due to a gubernatorial executive order prohibiting local governments from conducting lien sales. Before the cancellation, DOF outreach efforts throughout calendar 2020 reduced the tax lien sale at-risk pool from 18,907 properties in February to 3,006 properties at year-end. A 2021 tax lien sale was not scheduled prior to the end of Fiscal 2021 due to the executive order.

Due to COVID-19 health and safety measures, taxpayers were encouraged to use Electronic Fund Transfers (EFT) for their refunds. The increase of electronic refunds contributed to the reduced turnaround times. Additionally, employees continue to seek opportunities to streamline the Property Tax System (PTS) refund process.

Summonses adjudicated were down and parking ticket hearings increased in Fiscal 2021 as compared to Fiscal 2020, as fewer summonses were adjudicated per hearing. The turnaround time for in-person hearings was 1.3 minutes, which is lower than the historical average. This was due to a much lower volume of in-person hearings following COVID-19 health and safety measures. No in-person hearings were held during the first three months of the fiscal year. Twenty- three percent of parking ticket fines were reversed on appeal in Fiscal 2021 compared to 16 percent in Fiscal 2020 due to a large number of on-duty healthcare workers with permits receiving parking tickets during the COVID-19 pandemic and then granted a reversal.

Goal 3a Promptly review applications for exemption programs. The average time to process Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption (SCRIE) and Disability Rent Increase Exemption (DRIE) applications rose during the fiscal year primarily because DOF reallocated some SCRIE and DRIE resources in order to process Senior Citizen Homeowners' Exemption (SCHE) and Disability Homeowners' Exemption (DHE) applications by specific deadlines. While the passage of Chapter 381 of the Laws of 2020 (COVID-19 Emergency Eviction & Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2020) allowed for the auto-renewal of benefits for SCHE and DHE program participants, reviews were needed for program participants who claimed a higher benefit as part of renewal and because of the enactment of a local law that allowed removal of certain program participants from the auto-renewal pool due to specific reasons such as a property transfer. Applications for SCRIE and DRIE declined during the year. This decline in new applicants was likely the result of pandemic-related developments such as the eviction moratorium and curtailment of in-person outreach activities.

Goal 4a Through the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate, promptly address inquiries and resolve cases. The successful launch and operation of DOF's Customer Contact Center in July 2019 has altered the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate (OTA) workload by filtering most simple property tax exemption inquiries from its queue. However, OTA saw an influx of more complicated cases. In order to provide excellent service, OTA has engaged with other divisions in DOF, such as Property and Payment Operations, via regular monthly meetings and other streamlined communication channels. As a result, OTA increased its year-over-year total cases closed for the past two years and improved its average days closure rate for both cases and inquiries.

Goal 5a Increase the percentage of online property recording transactions. DOF leveraged virtual outreach to encourage the public and the title industry to file electronically by explaining and highlighting the benefits of doing so. During this last fiscal year, with many companies working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the volume of electronic submissions increased. The average time to record and index property documents increased year over year. During the fiscal year, the agency implemented Optical Character Recognition capability to the ACRIS system to upgrade the document review process and make it more efficient. As with any system upgrade, employees needed time to adapt to the new functionality which was a contributing factor in processing times. In the final quarter of the fiscal year, as the title industry returned to office, there was a sharp increase in the submission of documents related to re-financing and mortgage modifications, which further contributed to extended review time.

Goal 6a Increase the proportion of judgments, orders and warrants that are successfully served/executed. Arrest warrants successfully executed dropped as a result of the Family Courts being closed due to COVID-19 health and safety measures.

Tisch, CommissionerDEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & TELECOMMUNICATIONS | Page 439 WHAT WE DO The Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) provides the technology that enables City services for all who live, work, do business in, and visit the City of New York. Whether through DoITT's management and development of the City's 911 voice and text systems, the NextGen 911 transformation program, the City's wired and radio networks, data centers, NYC.gov , the Open Data portal, the citywide rollout of 5G wireless communications on pole tops, administration of the City's mobile telecommunication franchises, oversight of major interagency technology initiatives and procurements, DoITT connects NYC. DoITT's efforts help make City government more accessible, transparent and effective, empower the public, and keep our five boroughs safe, strong, and vibrant. FOCUS ON EQUITY DoITT's efforts to strengthen the equitable and transparent delivery of services to all New Yorkers are central to all of our work. In April 2020, DoITT resumed management of the 311 Customer Service Center, the primary gateway for the public to access government services and wait times for critical COVID-19 related services for New Yorkers throughout Fiscal 2021 were de minimis. DoITT issued a broadband solicitation specifically designed to encourage an expansion of affordable residential and commercial internet infrastructure and offerings in underserved communities. DoITT not only received approval for its 5G shroud design to roll out the next generation of connectivity across the City in an equitable manner, it kicked off the reservation process for franchise holders to start the build-out. DoITT oversees the LinkNYC franchise program, which provides free access to the internet across the City, and received Franchise and Concession Review Committee (FCRC) approval to reboot the program with a new financial model that will push 5G and improved Wi-Fi coverage outside of Manhattan's core business district. DoITT led the City's effort to build out high-speed Wi-Fi in each apartment at 170+ homeless shelters that serve families to ensure children in these shelters have the connectivity needed for remote learning. DoITT continues to run and grow its robust minority and woman-owned business enterprise (M/ WBE) program that encourages more City contracting with M/WBEs. DoITT's continued response to COVID-19 demonstrated its commitment to supporting vulnerable and underserved New Yorkers, including working with the Department of Education to procure 100,000 additional iPads for all public school children who did not have access to an internet-connected device to use in remote learning; building the Tenant Resource Portal for the Mayor's Office to Protect Tenants, the City's first online resource to help residential renters access free resources from the City to help prevent evictions and keep tenants stably housed; continuing to develop and enhance the City's contact tracing system, which is a key driver of the City's efforts to trace and contain the spread of COVID-19, a disease that has disproportionately affected communities of color; building, enhancing and maintaining the technology that supports the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH)'s vaccination program citywide, which has administered more than 1.9 million vaccinations since January 2021; making the City's vaccination call center available for all persons, no matter their internet access, to schedule a vaccination appointment; expanding New Yorkers' access to vaccinations through private and not-for-profit providers by enrolling them in the technology platform that supports DOHMH's vaccination program; and building the City's incentive program into the technology that supports the DOHMH vaccination program.Page 440 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT OUR SERVICES AND GOALS SERVICE 1 Deliver City IT services including hardware, software and technical support.

Goal 1a Provide quality service delivery and performance monitoring. As in Fiscal 2020, technology was the key to enabling City government to continue functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic and to pivot from containing the spread of the virus to combatting it through the City's vaccination effort. DoITT built out the technology platform for the City's vaccination efforts, which includes an online portal that is used by members of the public scheduling vaccination appointments; vaccination site staff managing persons who receive a vaccine; and vaccinators administering doses. DoITT stood-up and continues to manage the City's vaccination call center, which allows New Yorkers to schedule vaccination appointments no matter their access to the internet. DoITT led the City's effort to onboard private and not-for-profit vaccination providers through its vaccination technology platform. DoITT built out the City's incentive program into the vaccination technology platform to expand the vaccination program's impact. DoITT maintained and enhanced the City's COVID-19 contract tracing application, which DoITT released in June 2020 to support the City's Test & Trace Corps, which remains an essential part of the City's efforts to contain the spread of the virus. DoITT maintained and enhanced the technology that powers the GetFood program, which has been used to deliver more than 115 million meals to New Yorkers in need. DoITT worked with DOE to procure, configure and distribute 100,000+ iPads, in addition to the 300,000+ iPads from Fiscal 2020, to enable remote learning for the City's public school children who did not have access to an internet- connected device. DoITT spearheaded and completed Wi-Fi build-out in more than 170 homeless shelters that serve families in the City, and work is underway at 40 more sites. DoITT continued to maintain the infrastructure that enabled more than 100,000 City employees to remotely access the City's network to quickly facilitate the safe transition to a work-from-home model. DoITT maintained the City's COVID-19 portal, consolidating links to resources and information from dozens of agencies. DoITT expanded the City's first online marriage license system to enable online marriage ceremonies as well as allow New Yorkers to schedule in-person marriage license appointments online to enable the City Clerk's Office to reopen to the public. DoITT built the online business inspection and enforcement application for the City's Open Dining enforcement efforts. DoITT built the City's COVID Zone finder for New Yorkers to easily access and reference whether they lived in a neighborhood with additional restrictions due to New York State policies. Even with all of the COVID-related projects, the general work of the agency did not slip: DoITT began a citywide effort to decommission legacy systems at other agencies and offices to reduce vulnerability to security threats. Text-to-911 was in operation for a full calendar year by June 2021, with no outages and more than 20,000 text sessions between New Yorkers and 911 operators. Page 442 | MAYOR'S MANAGEMENT REPORT DoITT began the rollout of a new eSubpoena system for the New York City Policy Department (NYPD) and District Attorneys' Offices to replace the 15-year-old legacy eSubpoena system. DoITT completed Fiscal 2021 with no critical public safety outages. manages 220 238 253 351 365 * * Up * \u00ab Newly completed projects that provide new services to the public 4 7 7 48 69 * * Up * \u00ab Incidents that directly impact services provided to the public NA NA NA 106 92 \u00f2 \u00f2 NA Down \u00ab Critical public safety outages 0 0 2 0 0 \u00f2 \u00f2 Neutral Down \u00ab Total outage time for critical public safety infrastructure (minutes) 0 0 15,841 0 0 \u00f2 \u00f2 Neutral Down \u00ab Critical Indicator Equity Indicator \"NA\" Not Available \u00f1\u00f2 Directional Target * None Goal 1b Resolve all service disruptions within targeted levels.

In Fiscal 2021, DoITT continued to provide a higher level of support for other City agencies and the public than in fiscal years before Fiscal 2020. This was primarily driven by the need for new applications, some of which were part of the City's response to the pandemic, as well as the growing need for IT infrastructure, security and public safety initiatives at other agencies.

Goal 2a Increase the public's use of City government information through NYC.gov. In Fiscal 2021, more than 312 million pages were viewed on NYC.gov, which was an increase of 8 percent compared to the prior fiscal year. Similarly, the number of unique visitors (average monthly) increased by 18 percent.

Goal 4a Maximize usefulness, operability and cleanliness of public telecommunication services on City streets. DoITT administers the LinkNYC franchise, which replaces outdated public pay telephones with kiosks that provide free, high-speed Wi-Fi and free domestic calling. On June 7, 2021 the FCRC approved the third amendment to the LinkNYC franchise agreement. The amendment was negotiated through the COVID-19 pandemic by DoITT. Under the amendment's terms, the City will be repaid what CityBridge, the franchise holder, owed as of March 2020\u2014$60 million. The City has already received $26.8 million from CityBridge toward that debt. The amendment pivots the franchise from a financial model based solely on advertising revenue to a mixed one based on advertising and the build-out of new 5G infrastructure on the Links by CityBridge. The amendment contemplates new Link structures that can house 5G small cell equipment that will improve the coverage of Link's high-speed Wi-Fi. The advertising dimensions for the new structures would not change.

Duplicate systems were identified in the historical totals of the metric 'Systems DoITT manages' and 'Active projects for new services to the public.' The values for historical years have been corrected. In the reporting of the metric 'Newly completed projects that provide new services to the public,' previously published numbers represented cumulative totals when they should have been reported as yearly unique totals. The historical values have been updated. The historical totals for some reported service desk incidents included a small number of tickets generated from automated alerting processes. To improve data quality, the historical ticket counts in the metrics 'Incidents by severity level\u2014High,' 'Incidents by severity level\u2014Medium,' and 'Incidents by severity level\u2014Low' have been corrected. Because these automated tickets were a small fraction of the total number of tickets, their removal did not change the calculated average SLA resolution times. As noted in DoITT's Fiscal 2020 MMR, starting in calendar year 2019 DoITT improved the process for determining the actual resolutions of customer cable complaints. Prior to Fiscal 2020, the reported customer service metrics 'Percent meeting time to close\u2014cable complaint\u2014video service (15 days),' 'Percent time to close\u2014cable billing (30 days),' and 'Percent meeting time to close\u2014miscellaneous (30 days),' represented the date of SR creation to the date when the Service Request (SR) was sent to the Franchisees.

The Chief Fleet Officer works with the more than 50 City agencies and offices that operate fleet units, especially the 12 major fleet agencies of NYPD, FDNY, known as the Fleet Federation. DCAS Fleet leads initiatives in safety, sustainability, cost efficiency, transparency, and emergency management, while also providing direct services in areas including repair, collisions management, subrogation, fuel, auction and parts. DCAS manages the City's central fleet management systems and FleetStat reporting. As part of Vision Zero, the City's fleet operations are undertaking a series of initiatives to improve safety and reporting relating to vehicle collisions. These initiatives currently include: 1. Training all authorized City fleet drivers in defensive driving. DCAS Fleet is leading the initiative to train all City drivers. Uniformed drivers at NYPD, FDNY and DOC receive separate driver training for their emergency response vehicles. In 2020, DCAS established a first online version of the training in response to COVID-19 requirements. Over 8,000 staff enrolled in the first year. 2. Assessing the safety outfitting of City vehicles and developing a Safe Fleet Transition Plan. As part of this initiative, the City has a policy to install side-guards on all fleet units. DCAS is also implementing a safety camera project for City trucks. The City is also working with private fleets to assess and promote best industry practices. DCAS Fleet has barred the use of hands-free phone devices by City fleet operators. Over 62,000 safety improvements have been implemented since FY17. 3. Improving the tracking of vehicle collisions. DCAS Fleet introduced new indicators to this Vehicle Fleets and Maintenance table of the Mayor's Management Report (MMR) to refine reporting on fleet safety. DCAS now provides collision rates by vehicle miles travelled (VMT), which is the standard fleet industry reporting metric. DCAS also reports on fatalities and injuries by VMT and reports on whether these incidents were deemed preventable or not through agency evaluations. 4. Installing tracking devices in City fleet vehicles. Tracking devices provide data to be used to monitor driving habits and enable DCAS to create a Safety Index to help improve safe driving of City vehicles. DCAS uses multiple telematics providers as part of this initiative and completed an upgrade of this technology for 12,000 units in Fiscal 2019. DCAS manages this data through a Fleet Office of Real Time Tracking (FORT). The City is also implementing a series of sustainability initiatives as part of the OneNYC and NYC Clean Fleet plans, including efforts to expand electric and hybrid vehicles; install additional diesel particulate filters; increase the use of fossil fuel alternatives; and introduce anti-idling and other technologies. Fleet has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2025 and to establish an ell-electric on-road fleet by 2040. As of FY21, over 19,500 fleet units use some type of cleaner alternative including electric, hybrid, and biodiesel. This is the largest alternative fuel using fleet in the US, public or private. DCAS achieved the goal of 2,000 on-road electric vehicles (EV) six years earlier than the plan originally outlined in the NYC Clean Fleet initiative. The revised goal is at least 4,000 EV units by 2025. DCAS has now put in place over 1,000 EV charging ports including the nation's largest portable solar carport project and a large increase in fast charging. In FY21, DCAS opened 8 of its new fast chargers to general public access. DCAS Fleet has also worked to increase the transparency of citywide fleet operations. The daily vehicle readiness report, the Fleet weekly newsletter, and a wide variety of other public reporting is available online. The roll-out of fleet systems to better track, monitor and share fleet assets, parts and fuel, and driving behaviors, will increase understanding of fleet operations; allow for better management oversight; and facilitate further service improvements. In 2020, DCAS Fleet establish a Compliance Unit to better ensure proper use of City vehicles by employees citywide.
