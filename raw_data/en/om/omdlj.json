Paez, Marsha S. Berzon, and Morgan Christen, Circuit Judges. Opinion by Judge Paez COUNSEL Gregory Weston (argued) and David Elliott, The Wes- ton Firm, San Diego, California; Ronald A. Marron, The Law Offices of Ronald A. Marron APLC, San Diego, California; for Plaintiff-Appellant. App. 2 Steven N. Feldman (argue d) and John C. Hueston, Hueston Hennigan LLP, California; for Defendant-Appellee. OPINION PAEZ, Circuit Judge: Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f ) allows a liti- gant to seek an interlocutory appeal of a district court's order granting or denying class certification. This case is about whether and when the fourteen-day Rule 23(f ) deadline may be tolled. In a matter of first impression for this court, we hold t hat the Rule 23(f ) deadline is not jurisdictional, thus equitable exceptions apply. We therefore hold that a motion for reconsideration filed within the Rule 23(f ) deadline will toll the deadline. Parting ways with some of our sister circuits, we fur-ther hold that additional equitable circumstances may also warrant tolling. As a re sult, we hold that the Rule 23(f ) deadline was tolled here, when counsel for the lead plaintiff, within fourteen days of the district court's decertification order, informed the court of his intention to seek reconsideration, explained his rea-sons for doing so, and the co urt set a date for filing the motion with which counsel co mplied. As for the merits of the Rule 23(f ) petition, we hold that the district court abused its discretion in decertifying the class, and therefore reverse and remand. App. 3 I. Lambert purchased \"Cobra Sexual Energy,\" an al- leged aphrodisiac dietary supplement manufactured and marketed by Nutraceutical, which the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") had not approved. La- bels on Cobra Sexual Energy boasted that it contained performance-enhancing herbs that would provide us- ers with \"animal magnetism\" and \"potency wood.\" On the basis of these labels, Lambert believed that the product would enhance his se xual performance and in- crease the frequency with which he could engage in sexual activity. Had he known that the labels' claims were false, he would not have purchased the product. According to Lambert, Cobra Sexual Energy vio- lated the FDA's aphrodisiac drug rule because it claimed to increase sexual desire but had not been through clinical testing, as required by 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.528(c); nor had it received FDA approval, as re- quired by 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 310.528(b). The product also failed to display prominently a disclaimer that it had not been evaluated by the FDA, in alleged violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(r)(6)(C). Moreover, Lambert alleges that the supplement contained an ingredient, yohimbe, which is dangerous for certain persons in certain doses, yet the product label contained no warning of that risk. Lambert brought a consumer class action for vio- lations of California's Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\") (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a717200 et seq.), False Advertis- ing Law (\"FAL\") (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17500 et App. 4 seq.), and Consumer Lega l Act (\"CLRA\") (Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1750 et seq.). Lambert brought his class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), which provides that a class may be certified if \"questions of law or fact common to class members pre- dominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\" The district court initially granted class certifica- tion on the basis of the fu ll refund damages model. That model applies when a product is shown to be worthless, and damages may be calculated by multi- plying the average retail price by the number of units sold. In granting class certification, the district court concluded that Lambert put forth a \"tenable theory that monetary relief can be ascertained on a classwide basis . . . [that] can be readily calculated using Defend- ant's sales numbers and an average retail price.\" The case was subsequently reassigned to a different dis-trict judge because the original judge retired. Discov- ery proceeded and closed. Nutraceutical then filed a motion for decertification of the class, upon which the newly assigned district judge held a hearing. On February 20, 2015, the district court granted the motion to decertify. The district court found that Lambert's full refund damages model was \"consistent with his theories of liabilit y.\" The court proceeded to find, however, that Lambert \"failed to provide the key evidence necessary to apply his classwide model for damages,\" so common issues did not predominate. The district court required Lambert to provide the actual App. 5 average retail price, and Lambert had provided only the suggested retail price. During a March 2, 2015 status conference, ten days after the order decertifying the class, Lambert in- formed the court of his inte ntion to file a motion for reconsideration. Counsel expl ained that he had a dam- ages model and evidentiary support for it. The district court instructed Lambert to file the motion for recon- sideration within ten days - i.e., within twenty days in total from the order decertifying the class. As directed by the district court, ten days later, on March 12, 2015, Lambert mo ved for reconsideration and asked for recertification. In his motion for recon- sideration, Lambert pointed to evidence he had pre-sented in his class certification motion showing that the suggested retail price could be used in conjunction with other evidence to establish the full refund dam-ages model. Lambert also argued for the first time that, as an alternative, he could prove damages through non-restitutionary disgorgement. The district court denied Lambert's motion for re- consideration three months later. The court rejected Lambert's contention that the average retail price could be calculated from the suggested retail price. The district court also rejected Lambert's non-restitutionary disgorgement argument, reasoning that he waived it by presenting it for the first time in his motion for- reconsideration. The court proceeded to hold that even if Lambert had not waived the non-restitutionary dis- gorgement argument, it was improper under California App. 6 law, as restitution should be measured by what the plaintiffs lost, not by what the defendants gained; in other words, the district court held, non-restitutionary disgorgement is not available under California law.1 In addition to declining to rece rtify the class, the order set forth a plan for notifying the class regarding decertifi- cation. Within fourteen days of the order denying his mo- tion for reconsideration, Lambert filed in this court a Rule 23(f ) petition for permission to appeal the district court's orders granting the motion for class decertifica- tion and denying the motion for reconsideration. Upon the filing of that petition, the district court stayed pro- ceedings pending appeal. A motions panel of this court conditionally granted Lambert's Rule 23(f ) petition, instructing the parties \"[i]n addition to all other issues the[y] wish to raise in their briefs in the appeal, [to] . . . address the timeliness of this petition.\" II. Because the motions panel only conditionally granted the petition and referred the issue of timeli-ness to this panel, we rev iew de novo its timeliness. See Briggs v. Merck Sharp & Dohme , 796 F.3d 1038, 1045- 46 (9th Cir. 2015) (reviewing the timeliness of a Rule 1 While non-restitutionary damages refer to the defendant's revenues regardless of the plaintiff's relationship to those dam-ages, restitutionary damages refe r to the portion of the defend- ant's revenues over which the plai ntiff has some ownership claim. See Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. , 63 P.3d 937, 941 (Cal. 2003). App. 7 23(f ) petition after the pe tition was conditionally granted by a motions panel). As to the merits of the petition, we review the dis- trict court's class decertifica tion ruling for an abuse of discretion. Pulaski & Middleman, LLC v. Google, Inc. , 802 F.3d 979, 984 (9th Cir. 2015); Yokoyama Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 594 1090-91 (9th Cir. 2010). \"A district court woul d necessarily abuse its dis- cretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\" United States v. Hinkson , 585 F.3d 1247, 1259 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Cooter & Gell v. Hartmax Corp. , 496 U.S. 384, 405 (1990)). We review findings of fact in the class certification determination for clear error. Abdullah v. U.S. Sec. Assocs., Inc. , 731 F.3d 952, 956 (9th Cir. 2013). Rule 23(f ) governs interlocutory appeals of \"or- der[s] certification.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f ). The Rule requires that a petition for permission to appeal be filed \"within 14 days after the order is entered.\" Id. Rule 23(f ) is silent as to the effect of motions for recons ideration on this deadline. Here, the district court decertified the class on Febru-ary 20, 2015. Lambert's Rule 23(f ) petition, however, was not filed until June 24, 2015, fourteen days after the court denied his motion for reconsideration. Under the plain text of Rule 23(f ), Lambert's petition would be untimely because it was not filed within fourteen App. 8 days of the district court's initial order decertifying the class. In other words, unless an exception applies, Lambert's Rule 23(f ) petition would be barred. To determine whether Lambert's Rule 23(f ) peti- tion is timely, we must first determine whether Rule 23(f ) is jurisdictional. We conclude that it is non-juris-dictional, and that equitable remedies softening the deadline are therefore generally available. Specifically, we hold that a motion for reconsideration filed within fourteen days of the certification order tolls the Rule 23(f ) deadline. We al so hold that the deadline can be tolled as a result of additional equitable circumstances. In light of the circumstances in this case, we conclude that the Rule 23(f ) deadline was tolled and deem Lam- bert's petition timely. A. We turn first to whether the fourteen-day deadline in Rule 23(f ) is jurisdictional. Two Supreme Court cases primarily guide our inquiry. In Eberhart v. United States , the Court held that a deadline in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure was not jurisdic-tional because it was a procedural claim-processing rule, as opposed to a rule t hat delineated the classes of cases or persons within a court's adjudicatory author-ity. 546 U.S. 12, 15-16 (2005). Several years later, the Court held in Bowles v. Russell that deadlines con- tained in statutes are jurisdictional, but non-statutory deadlines, such as those in the Federal Rules of Civil App. 9 or Criminal Procedure, may instead be procedural \"claims-processing\" rules. 551 U.S. 205, 211-14 (2007). We have not yet had occasion to apply these cases to Rule 23(f ). We have, however, concluded that an immigration regulation requiring a petitioner to file his notice of appeal wi th the Board of Immigra- tion Appeals within thirty days of the immigration judge's adverse ruling is not jurisdictional because it is regulatory, rather than statutory. Irigoyen-Briones v. Holder , 644 F.3d 943, 948-49 (9th Cir. 2011). In Irigoyen-Briones , we also noted that the regulatory provision that contained the deadline did not use the word \"jurisdiction,\" and that the Supreme Court had narrowly defined jurisdictional rules as those that re- move a court's authority to hear a case. Id. The Third Circuit has had occasion to consider the jurisdictional nature of Rule 23(f ). In Gutierrez v. Johnson & Johnson , the Third Circuit held that in light of Bowles , the Rule 23(f ) deadline is not jurisdic- tional because it is set fo rth in a rule promulgated by the Supreme Court, not a statute enacted by Congress. 523 F.3d 187, 197-98 (3d Cir. 2008). Other circuits have likewise suggested that the Rule 23(f ) deadline is not jurisdictional. See, e.g. , Boeing Co. , 456 F.3d 1183, 1190 n.1 (10th Cir. 2006) (noting that al- though the court had previously held Rule 23(f ) to be jurisdictional, Eberhart \"casts doubt\" on that NY , 448 F.3d 490, 491- 92 (2d Cir. 2006) (declining to decide whether Rule 23(f ) is jurisdictional, but noting that Eberhart \"calls the jurisdictional nature of Rule 23(f ) into question\"). App. 10 We conclude that under Bowles and Eberhart , the Rule 23(f ) deadline is not jurisdictional because it is procedural, does not remove a court's authority over subject matters or persons, and is in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rather than in a statute. B. Because the Rule 23(f ) deadline is not jurisdic- tional, equitable exceptions, such as tolling, may ap- ply. 2 When deadlines are not jurisdictional, courts may apply judicial equitable exceptions to avoid or soften the time limitations. Bowles , 551 U.S. at 211-14; Gutierrez , 523 F.3d at 197 (\"The i mport of this distinc- tion between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional rules, according to the Supreme Court, is that courts cannot create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional time limits.\"). Equitable exceptions arise from the \"traditional power of the courts to apply the principles . . . of equity jurisprudence. The classic example is the doctrine of equitable tolling, which permits a court to pause a statutory time limit when a litigant has pursued his rights diligently but some extraordinary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely action.\" Cal. Pub. Emps. Ret. Sys. v. ANZ Sec., Inc. , 137 S. Ct. 2042, 2051 (2017) (citations and internal quotation marks 2 Equitable exceptions includ e tolling, the unique circum- stances doctrine, and others. See Gutierrez , 523 F.3d at 197. Be- cause we resolve this case on the basis of tolling, we need not address the unique circumstances doctrine. App. 11 omitted). \"At bottom, the purpose of equitable tolling is to 'soften the harsh impact of technical rules which might otherwise prevent a good faith litigant from hav- ing [her] day 1043, 1055 (9th Cir. 2015) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Buckles , 647 F.3d 883, 891 (9th Cir. 2011)). C. All circuits to consider tolling the Rule 23(f ) dead- line have held that the deadline may be tolled when a litigant files a motion for reconsideration within the fourteen-day deadline. 3 These circuits have reasoned, for example, that \"federal courts long have held that a motion for reconsideration tolls the time for appeal, provided that the motion is made within the time for appeal.\" Blair v. Equifax Check Servs., Inc. , 181 F.3d 3 See Gutierrez , 523 F.3d at 193 (holding that \"for the pur- pose of tolling the time within which to file a Rule 23(f) peti- tion, a 'timely' motion to reconsider is one that is filed within the [fourteen]-day period set forth in Rule 23(f)\"); Nucor Corp. v. Brown , 760 F.3d 341, 343 (4th Cir. 2014) (stating that a motion for reconsideration filed within fo urteen days of the order grant- ing or denying class certification can toll a Rule 23(f) deadline); Fleischman v. Albany Med. Ctr. , 639 F.3d 28, 31-32 (2d Cir. 2011) (same with respect to a motion to amend); In re DC Water & Sewer Auth. , 561 F.3d 494, 496 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (same with respect to a motion for reconsideration); Jenkins v. BellSouth Corp. , 491 281 Cir. 2005) (same); Gary v. Sheahan , 188 F.3d 891, 892 (7th Cir. 1999) (same); Shin v. Cobb Bd. of Educ. 1061, 1064 Check Servs., Inc. , 181 F.3d 832, 836-37 (7th Cir. 1999) (same). App. 12 832, 837 (7th Cir. 1999). We agree, and therefore hold, as a baseline matter, that a motion for reconsideration filed within fourteen days of a certification decision tolls the Rule 23(f ) deadline. D. Of course, in this case, that holding does not end the inquiry. Lambert did not file his motion for recon-sideration until twenty days after the district court de- certified the class. We no netheless hold that Lambert is entitled to tolling given the history of this case. Equitable exceptions such as tolling are meant to allow a \"a good faith litigant \" to have \"[her] day in court.\" Rudin , 781 F.3d at 1055 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, in de- termining when equitable circumstances beyond a mo-tion for reconsideration filed within the fourteen day Rule 23(f ) deadline can toll that deadline, we look to equitable factors such as whether the litigant \"pursued his rights diligently,\" and whether external circum- stances, such as a deadline imposed by the district court, 4 affected the litigant. Cal. Pub. Emps. Ret. Sys. , 137 S. Ct. at 2050. 4 Petitions for certiorari in the Supreme Court provide a use- ful analogy. The advisory committee notes to Rule 23(f ) provide that \"[t]he court of appeals is given unfettered discretion whether to permit the appeal, akin to the discretion exercised by the Su-preme Court in acting on a petition for certiorari.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f ) advisory committee's note to 1998 amendment. In discuss-ing the timeliness of a Rule 23(f ) petition, the Eleventh Circuit cited the advisory committ ee's certiorari analogy. Jenkins , 491 App. 13 We also look, as a factor , to whether a litigant took some other action similar to filing a motion for recon- sideration within the fourt een-day deadline, such as a letter or verbal representat ion conveying an intent to seek reconsideration and providing the basis for such action. We are not alone in considering this as a factor. In McNamara v. Felderhof , the Fifth Circuit considered whether tolling of Rule 23(f )'s deadline was available when a litigant stated in a court filing that he would seek reconsideration of certification within fourteen days, but did not file a formal motion for reconsidera- tion within that time. 410 F.3d 277, 279-80 (5th Cir. 2005). The Fifth Circuit conc luded that a \"Trial and Case Management Plan\" (\"the Plan\") could toll the Rule 23(f ) filing deadline. Id. The Plan specifically sought \"revisitation and modification\" of the class cer-tification ruling. Id. at 280 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Fifth Circuit reasoned that the Plan should be considered a motion for reconsideration for tolling purposes because it \"called into question the correctness of the district co urt's [certification] order.\" Id. The Fifth Circuit also reached this conclusion be- cause it \"d[id] not read Ru le 23(f ) as so limiting in F.3d at 1290; cf. Blair , 181 F.3d at 833-34 (looking to petitions for certiorari to determine substantiv e standards for Rule 23(f )). Pe- titions for certiorari must be filed within ninety days, but may be filed later when a timely petition for rehearing is granted or when the court of appeals entertains an untimely petition for rehearing. Sup. Ct. R. 13(1), (3). By analogy, much like the courts of appeals' authority to affect the Supreme Court's certiorari petition dead-line, district courts have authority to affect the Rule 23(f ) dead-line. App. 14 nature.\"5 Id. The Seventh Circuit has stated, similarly, that it does not \"matter[ ] what caption the litigant places on the motion to reconsider.\" Gary v. Sheahan , 188 F.3d 891, 893 (7th Cir. 1999). Accordingly, an im-portant factor in the tolling analysis is whether the lit- igant provided, within the Rule 23(f ) deadline, notice of the intent to seek reconsideration. Here, a number of equitable factors support tolling the Rule 23(f ) deadline. Lamb ert clearly conveyed his intention to file a motion for reconsideration seeking recertification on the tenth day after entry of the order decertifying the class. At a status conference, Lambert specifically informed the court of his intention to seek recertification and briefly explained his reasons for do- ing so. The district court then instructed Lambert to file his motion within ten days, which allotted him twenty days in total from the decertification order. The district court imposed the deadline after an exchange with Lambert's counsel as to whether it was reasona- ble. Lambert complied, and filed his motion for recon- sideration within the period set by the district court. Lambert also filed the Rule 23( f ) petition within four- teen days after the district court denied the motion for reconsideration. We hold that because Lambert in-formed the court orally of his intention to seek recon- sideration of the decertifica tion order and the basis for his intended filing within fourteen days of the decerti-fication order and otherwis e acted diligently, and be- cause the district court se t the deadline for filing a 5 McNamara ultimately dismissed the petition as untimely because the Plan was not filed within the Rule 23(f ) deadline. App. 15 motion for reconsideration with which Lambert com- plied, the Rule 23(f ) deadline should be tolled. We recognize that other circuits would likely not toll the Rule 23(f ) deadline in Lambert's case. To the extent other circuits limit Rule 23(f ) tolling only to the circumstance where a motion for reconsideration is filed within fourteen days of the certification order, we part ways with them. Other circuits have, for example, held that a motion for reconsideration filed more than fourteen days after a certification order will not toll the deadline even when the distri ct court set or influenced that deadline. In a case in which a district court ex-tended the time to file a motion for reconsideration well beyond the Rule 23(f ) deadline, the Third Circuit held that even if a motion for reconsideration is timely for the district court's purpos es, it is untimely if it is filed outside of Rule 23(f )'s fourteen-day period. Gutierrez , 523 F.3d at 193 n.5 (\"[A] motion to recon- sider that is filed more t han [fourteen] days after an order granting or denying class certification will not toll the time to file a 23(f ) petition, even if the motion is 'timely' as defined by the district court's rules or its scheduling order.\"); see also Jenkins v. BellSouth Corp. , 491 F.3d 1288, 1289 (11th Cir. 2007) (providing that a district court cannot manipu late the timeliness of a Rule 23(f ) petition by vacating and reentering the or- der denying class certification to make it timely); Delta Airlines v. Butler , 383 F.3d 1143, 1145 (10th Cir. 2004) (holding that even if a district court extended the time to file a Rule 23(f ) peti tion, this could not toll the fourteen-day period because the district court lacked App. 16 such authority). Similarly, the Third Circuit held that an informal letter to the district court conveying an in- tent to seek reconsideration of a certification decision filed within fourteen days would not toll the time to file a Rule 23(f ) petition, because it did not specifically re- quest certification nor provide reasons why the certifi- cation order was wrong. Gutierrez , 523 F.3d at 194-95. The reasons offered by other circuits for strictly limiting the availability of Rule 23(f ) tolling, by only allowing for tolling when a mo tion for reconsideration is filed within the fourteen-day period, are not persua- sive. First, the fourteen-day deadline is for filing a Rule 23(f ) petition, not for filing a motion for reconsidera-tion in federal court. Thus, the fourteen-day limitation on tolling has no basis in Rule 23 or any other Rule, but instead is a judicial construct. Litigants have no reason to know that their de adline for filing a motion for reconsideration is effectively fourteen days, rather than whatever the district judge has ordered. Second, those circuits that have strictly construed the Rule 23(f ) fourteen-day deadline have reasoned that Rule 23(f ) petitions slow down litigation, are dis- ruptive, and inject uncertainty into class action litiga- tion. 6 For example, the District of Columbia Circuit 6 In defining the substantive standards of Rule 23(f), we adopted much of the reasoning discussed by other circuits with respect to timing: First, the rule provides a mechanism through which appellate courts, in the intere sts of fairness, can restore App. 17 explained that \"[c]ourts generally disfavor interlocu- tory appeals because they disrupt ongoing trial court proceedings and squander resources.\" In re DC Water & F.3d 494, 497 (D.C. Cir. Bd. of Educ. , 248 F.3d 1061, 1064 (describing 23(f ) petitions as \"an avenue of last resort\" and \"inherently disruptive, time-consuming, and expensive\"). The Third Circuit in Gutierrez explained that, as a result, the Rule 23(f ) deadline is purposely short, to \"ensure that interlocu-tory appeals of class certification decisions are heard and decided in a timely manne r, so as no t to disrupt the proceedings at the district court level.\" 523 F.3d at 199 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f ) advisory committee's note to 1998 amendment). The Eleventh Circuit has expressed concern that appellate court review gener-ally takes more time than disposition by a trial court. Shin , 248 F.3d at 1064. Moreover, the Seventh Cir- cuit explained that because class certification can have major consequences for litigation strategies and equilibrium when a doubtful class certification ruling would virtually compel a party to abandon a potentially meritorious claim or defense before trial. And second, the rule furnishes an avenue . . . [to] take earlier-than-usual cognizance of important, unsettled legal ques-tions, thus contributing to both the orderly progress of complex litigation and the orderly development of law. . . . Interlocutory appe als are are disruptive, time-consuming, and ex-pensive. Chamberlan v. Ford Motor Co. , 402 F.3d 952, 957-59 (9th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (citations and internal quotation marks omit-ted). App. 18 resources, and for the possibility of settlement, allow- ing for only one short window of review \"permit[s] the parties to proceed in confidence about the scope and stakes of the case.\" Sheahan , 188 F.3d at 893. 23(f ) petitions are disrup- tive and slow is not universally true and we decline to adopt any hard and fast rule on the basis of such an idea. First, Rule 23(f ) petitions do not actually slow down litigation. Rule 23(f ) petitions do not automati-cally stay district court proce edings - only the district court can grant a stay, as it did in this case, and it has discretion whether or not to do so. See Blair , 181 F.3d at 835 (suggesting that such stays will be infrequent). Likewise, district courts are bound to experience delay when they are confronted with motions for reconsider-ation, irrespective of any Rule 23(f ) petition. The dis- trict court in this case, for example, kept Lambert's motion for reconsideration under submission for more than three months; and statistical studies by the Fed- eral Judicial Center show that median ranges for deci- sions on class certification motions range from seven to fifteen months. See Thomas E. Willging et al., Fed. Judicial Ctr., Empirical Study of Class Actions in Four Federal District Courts: Final Report to the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules 27 (1996), http://www.uscourts. govisites/default/files/rule2 3_1.pdf. The Third and Elev- enth Circuits' suggestions that district courts \"ordinar-ily\" rule on motions for reconsideration more quickly than appellate courts, and are \"expect[ed]\" to do so, are vague and lack persuasive force in light of the evidence to the contrary. See Gutierrez , 523 F.3d at 199; Shin , App. 19 248 We recognize that Rule 23(f ) peti- tions may lengthen litigation. But so do motions for re- consideration of a class action decertification decision when no 23(f ) petition is filed, which every circuit to consider the question has treated as valid grounds for equitable tolling. Third, Rule 23(f ) petitions do not uniquely dis- rupt or inject uncertainty into the litigation. Rule 23(c)(1)(C) allows modifying or amending an order granting or denying class certification up to the time of final judgment, at the discretion of the district court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C) 7; see In re DC Water & Sewer Auth. , 561 F.3d at 497 (noting that district courts may reconsider and modify class certification throughout the case); Shin , 248 F.3d at 1064 (explaining that dis- trict courts have the ability, \"and perhaps even a duty,\" to reconsider certification as the case progresses). If the district court may change its class certification de-cision at any time, interlocutory review should not af- fect the parties' level of certainty as to the finality of that decision, nor should it be unusually or particu- larly disruptive. See Michael G. McLellan, If at First You Don't Succeed: The Varying Standards Applicable to Renewed Motions for Class Certification , 30 A.B.A. A NTITRUST 89, 92 (Summer 2016) (suggesting that Rule 23(f ) and Rule 23(c)(1)(C) ar e strategic alternatives available to class action litigants). 7 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (c)(1)(C) provides: \"An order that grants or denies cla ss certification ma y be altered or amended before final judgment.\" App. 20 If anything, Rule 23(f ) appellate review may in- crease the level of certainty for litigants. Once an ap- pellate court speaks to class certification issues in a Rule 23(f ) appeal, the district court can no longer re-consider those issues under Rule 23(c)(1)(C), or at least its authority to do so will be narrowed by the court of appeals' ruling, thus enhancing certainty for the par-ties and the district court. See McLellan , supra , at 92 (explaining that a Rule 23(f ) decision constrains the district court's ability to alter or amend certification under Rule 23(c)(1)(C)) (citing Gene & Gene, L.L.C. v. BioPay, L.L.C. , 624 F.3d 698, 703 (5th Cir. 2010)). In sum, we hold that (1 ) Rule 23(f )'s deadline is not jurisdictional, (2) equitable exceptions therefore apply, such that (3) motions for reconsideration filed within fourteen days toll that deadline. We also hold that (4) equitable circumstances beyond a formal mo- tion to reconsider filed within fourteen days can toll the Rule 23(f ) deadline. As discussed above, equitable circumstances tolled the Rule 23(f ) tition was timely filed in this court. 8 8 The parties also debate whether an order granting a motion for reconsideration provides a new fourteen-day window to file a Rule 23(f) petition, because such an order is \"an order granting or denying class certification.\" This would be another issue of first impression for this court. Other ci rcuits to consider the issue have held that petitioners receive an additional fourteen days to file a Rule 23(f) petition if a motion for reconsideration is granted and changes the status quo of class ce rtification, regardless of when the motion is filed. See Nucor Corp. , 760 F.3d at 343; Fleischman , 639 F.3d Sewer Auth. , 561 F.3d at 496; App. 21 IV. As Lambert's petition was timely, we turn to the merits, and conclude that th e district court abused its discretion in decertifying the class on the basis of Lam- bert's inability to prove restitution damages through the full refund model. Lambert brought his consumer class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3). \"Under Rule 23(b)(3), the court must find that 'questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.' \" Pu- laski , 802 F.3d at 985. A Rule 23(b)(3) plaintiff must show a class wide method for damages calculations as a part of the assessment of whether common questions predominate over individual questions. Leyva v. Med- line Indus. Inc. , 716 F.3d 510, 514 (9th Cir. 2013). The party seeking to maintain class certification bears the burden of demonstrating that the Rule 23 require- ments are satisfied, even on a motion to decertify. Mario v. United Parcel Serv., Inc. , 639 F.3d 942, 947 (9th Cir. 2011); United Steel Workers v. ConocoPhillips Co., 593 F.3d 802, 807 (9th Cir. 2010). We have repeatedly emphasized that uncertain damages calculations should not defeat certification. In Yokoyama , we held that \"damage calculations alone Gutierrez , at McNamara , 410 F.3d at 281. We need not decide this question, as we hold that Lambert's petition was timely under a tolling theory, and, in any case, the district court denied Lambert's motion. App. 22 cannot defeat certification.\" 594 F.3d at 1094. After our decision in Yokoyama , the Supreme Court held in Com- cast that a Rule 23(b)(3) plaintif f must show that \"dam- ages are capable of measurem ent on a classwide basis.\" Comcast Corp. v. Behrend , 133 S.Ct. 1426, 1433 (2013). We have since reconciled our holding that uncertain damages cannot destroy cl ass certification with Com- cast's holding that plaintiffs must show that their damages are capable of classwide measurement. In Leyva , we reaffirmed that uncertain damages calcula- tions alone cannot defeat cl ass certification because Comcast stood only for the proposition that \"plaintiffs must be able to show that their damages stemmed from the defendant's actions that created the legal lia- bility.\" Leyva , 716 F.3d at 513-14. Uncertainty regarding class members' damages does not prevent certification of a class as long as a valid method has been proposed for calculating those damages. Id. at 514; see also Alaska Rent-A-Car, Inc. v. Avis Budget Grp., Inc. , 738 F.3d 960, 970 (9th Cir. 2013) (explaining that the law \"requires only that damages be capable of measurement based upon reliable fac- tors without undue speculation\"). \"[T]he fact that the amount of damage may not be susceptible of exact proof or may be uncertain, contingent or difficult of as- certainment does not bar recovery.\" Pulaski , 802 F.3d at 989 (quoting Marsu, B.V. v. Walt Disney Co. , 185 F.3d 932, 939 (9th Cir.1999)); see also Just Film, Inc. v. Buono , 847 F.3d 1108, 1121 (9th Cir. 2017) (reaffirming that so long as the proposed damages model is at-tributable to the plaintiff 's legal theory of the harm, App. 23 and damages can be determined without excessive dif- ficulty, decertification is not warranted). Class wide damages calculations under the UCL, FAL, and CLRA are particularly forgiving. California law \"requires only that some reasonable basis of com- putation of damages be used, and the damages may be computed even if the result reached is an approxima- tion.\" Pulaski , 802 Dannon Co. , 255 F.R.D. 658, 670 (C.D. Cal. 2009) (providing that courts also have \" 'very broad' discretion to determine\" damages under the CLRA); Leatherman Tool G.T., Inc. , 38 Cal. Rptr. 3d 36, 61 (Cal. Ct. App. 2006) (explaining that damages under the UCL and FAL \"must be of a measurable amount to restore to the plaintiff what has been ac- quired by violations of the statutes, and that measura- ble amount must be supported by evidence\"). Under California law, because restitution \"damages may be computed even if the result reached is an approxima- tion,\" GHK Assocs. v. Mayer GT., Inc. , 274 Cal. Rptr. 168, 179 (Cal. Ct. App. 1990), uncertain damages should not prevent class certification, B.W.I. Custom Kitchen v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. , 235 Cal.Rptr. 228, 237 (Cal. Ct. App. tual determinations of damages] ha[ve] prevented a court from aiding the class to obtain its just restitu- tion.\"). Lambert proposed measuring class wide damages under the full refund model. The full refund model measures damages by presuming a full refund for each App. 24 customer, on the basis that the product has no or only a de minimis value. FTC v. Figgie Int'l, Inc. , 994 F.2d 595, 606 (9th Cir. 1993) (\"Customers who purchased rhinestones sold as diamonds should have the oppor-tunity to get all of their money back.\"). Here, Lambert presented evidence that the product at issue was val- ueless and therefore amenable to full refund treat-ment. We agree with the district court that the full refund model is consistent with Lambert's theory of liability. Accordingly, Lambert was required only to show that the full price amou nt of retail sales of the product could be approximated over the relevant time period, even if that figure or the data supporting it - in this case the average reta il price multiplied by the number of units sold - was uncertain. 9 Leyva , 716 F.3d at 514. Although Lambert did not present evidence of the actual average retail price, he did present evidence of both unit sales and the suggested retail price over the relevant time period. 10 There may well be additional evidence that Lambert could present at trial to support 9 This is not to say that every case proceeding under a full refund theory must produce figures for the average price and unit sales of a product. As Lambert ar gued in his motion for class cer- tification, point-of-sale data appr oximating the total retail ex- penditure would also be an appropriate method of calculating restitution on a worthless item. So, too, would evidence of the defendant's wholesale revenue, if reasonably capable of being weighed or adjusted by the trier of fact to account for possible dif- ference between wholesale and retail values. 10 Notably, the suggested retail price was cited as one of the original grounds for certifying the class. App. 25 an average retail price. For example, the record con- tains evidence that Lambert paid $16-$18 per 30-count bottle of the product and t hat Nutraceutical, through its website, sold 30-count bo ttles for $14.39 during this time frame. The suggested retail price in conjunction with Lambert's other evidence suggests that a trier of fact could calculate or sufficiently approximate the av-erage retail price for the product. We recognize that a suggested retail price does not \"automatically configure an average,\" but such a pre- cise average is unnecessary for class certification. At this stage, the question is only whether Lambert has presented a workable method. We conclude that he has. Accordingly, because Lambert's damages model matched his theory of liability, and because Lambert had shown that his damages model was supportable on evidence that could be introduced at trial, the class should not have been decertified. The district court abused its discretion in holding otherwise, contrary to our law. See Hinkson , 585 F.3d at 1261-62 (holding that legal error is an abuse of discretion); see also Pulaski , Whether Lambert could prove dam-ages to a reasonable certainty on the basis of his full refund model is a question of fact that should be de-cided at trial. 11 11 Because we hold that Lambert showed damages sufficient to avoid decertification under the full refund model, we need not reach the question of whether he waived his non-restitutionary disgorgement argument, or whether that arguments fails on the merits. App. 26 V. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Lam- bert's Rule 23(f ) petition was timely, reverse the dis-trict court's order decertify ing the class, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. REVERSED AND REMANDED. App. 27 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA TROY LAMBERT, P l a i n t i f f , NUTRACEUTICAL CORPORATION, Defendant. Case No. ED CV 13-05942- AB (SPx) ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE COURT'S ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR CLASS DECERTIFICATION (Filed Jun. 24, 2015) Pending before the Court is Plaintiff Troy Lam- bert's Motion for Reconsideration, (Motion, Dkt. No. 183), of the Court's order, (Order, Dkt. No. 175), grant- ing Defendant Nutraceutical Corporation's Motion for Class Decertification. Defend ant filed an Opposition and Plaintiff filed a Reply. (Dkt. Nos. 189, 192.) The Court took this matter under submission on April 23, 2015. (Dkt. No. 194.) For the reasons discussed more fully below, Plaintiff fails to satisfy the requirements for reconsideration, and the Court DENIES the Mo- tion. I. BACKGROUND The full factual and procedura l history of this liti- gation is familiar to the Parties. The case centers on a App. 28 product called Cobra Sexual Energy (\"Cobra\"), a die- tary supplement. Defend ant manufactures and mar- kets Cobra. Plaintiff brought a consumer class action suit against Defendants for Violation of the Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"), Unlawful Prong (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17200 et seq. ); Violation of the UCL, Un- fair and Fraudulent Prong (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17200 et seq. ); Violation of the False Advertising Law (\"FAL\") (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17500 et seq. ); Viola- tion of the Consumer gal Remedies (\"CLRA\") (Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1750 et seq. ). (See Second Amended Complaint \"SAC,\" Dkt. No. 56.) In June 2014, the Honorable Audrey B. Collins granted Plaintiff 's Motion for Class Certification un- der Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 23(b)(3). (See generally Dkt. No. 80.) The class was certified un- der Plaintiff 's FAL, UCL, and CLRA theories and the theories were to be measur ed using the full refund damages model theory. ( Id.) Judge Collins anticipated calculating damages using Defendant's sales data and an average retail price. ( Id. at pp. 12-13.) After the completion of discovery, Defendant moved for class decertification based on, inter alia , Plaintiff 's inability to demonstrate a classwide calcu- lation of damages using his evidence. ( See Dkt. Nos. 111, 122.) The Court agreed with Defendant and granted its Motion. ( See Order.) The Order only ad- dressed the inadequacy of Plaintiff 's damages model, which was dispositive of the entire question in decerti- fying class. ( See Order.) After the Court entered judg- ment, Plaintiff moved for reconsideration. App. 29 II. LEGAL STANDARD Generally, a motion for reconsideration brought within 28 days of the entry of judgment is treated as a motion under Rule 59(e). See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 59(e) (motions to alter or amend judgment under that rule must be brought within 28 days of entry of judgment); see also In re Benham , No. CV 13-00205-VBF, 2013 WL 3872185, at *1 (C.D. Cal. May 29, 2013) (\"A motion for reconsideration filed within 28 days of a judgment is typically treated as a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e).\"). \"U nder Rule 59(e), a motion for reconsideration should not be granted, absent highly unusual circumstances , unless the district court is presented with newly di scovered evidence, commit- ted clear error, or if ther e is an intervening change in the controlling law.\" 389 Orange St. Partners v. Arnold , 179 F.3d 656, 665 (9th Cir. 1999). Reconsideration is an \"extraordinary remedy, to be used sparingly in the in-terests of finality and cons ervation of judicial re- sources.\" Carroll v. Nakatani , 342 F.3d 934, 945 (9th Cir. 2003). \"For reasons of judicial economy and final-ity, such motions are disfavored and are rarely granted.\" Resolution Trust Corp. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 873 F. Supp. 1386, 1393 (D. Ariz. 1994) Reconsideration \"may not be used to relitigate old matters, or to raise arguments or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\" Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker , 554 U.S. 471, 485 n.5 (2008) (quotation omitted). A motion to reconsider may not \"rehash[ ] what ha[s] been before the court when it ruled\" on the prior motion. Faysound Ltd. v. United App. 30 Coconut Chemicals, Inc. , 878 F.2d 290, 296 (9th Cir. 1989); accord Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole v. CBI Industries, Inc. , 90 F.3d 1264, 1270 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"Reconsideration is not an appropriate forum for re-hashing previously rejected arguments or arguing matters that could have been heard during the pen- dency of the previous motion.\"). Nor does reconsidera-tion afford a party an opportunity to try out new arguments or evidence that it could have, but did not, discover or advance the first time around. U.S. v. Westlands Water Dist. , 134 F.Supp.2d 1111, 1130 1299 (E.D. Cal. 1997). Generally, the aim of reconsider-ation is to accommodate a fundamental change in cir- cumstances going to the heart of a court's original analysis. Alternatively, reconsideration may also be used as a narrow vehicle to correct a \"clear\" or \"manifest\" error of law or fact in a court's earlier ruling. Roschewski v. Raytheon Co. , 471 F. App'x 588, 589 (9th Cir. 2012) (cit- School Dist. Multnomah 1262-63 (9th Although the Ninth Circuit has not yet ar- ticulated what constitutes a \"clear\" or \"manifest\" error for the purposes of reconsideration, other circuits have. As the Fifth Circuit has noted, \" 'clearly erroneous' is a very exacting standard. Mere doubts or disagreement about the wisdom of a prior de cision . . . will not suffice for this exception. To be c learly erroneous, a decision must strike us as more than just maybe or probably wrong; it must be dead wrong.\" Hopwood v. State of App. 31 Texas , 236 F.3d 256 (5th Cir. 2000) (internal quotes omitted); see also Campion v. Old Republic Home Prot. Co., No. 09-CV-748-JMA NLS, 2011 WL 1935967, at *1 (S.D. Cal. May 20, 2011) (citing Hopwood and applying this standard on motion for reconsideration). Similarly, a \" 'manifest error' is not demonstrated by the disap- pointment of the losing party. It is the wholesale disre-gard, misapplication, or failure to recognize controlling precedent.\" Oto v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. , 224 F.3d 601, 606 (7th Cir. 2000); see v. , No. 1:13-CV-00904-SKO, 2014 WL 6893825, at *3 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 8, 2014) (citing Oto and applying this stand- ard on motion for reconsideration). 1 III. DISCUSSION Plaintiff seeks reconsideration on the ground that the Court committed clear and manifest error in not considering Plaintiff 's alternative disgorgement model. ( See Mot.) According to Plaintiff, he properly proposed an alternative damages model to measure 1 In moving for reconsideration, Plaintiff seeks to treat this as a renewed motion for class cert ification under Rule 23. (Mot., p. 5 (\"[R]ule that class certific ation orders are inherently tenta- tive should govern over the general rule for motion for reconsid-eration.\").) At the March 2, 2015 Status Conference, the Court already denied Plaintiff 's reques t to file a renewed motion for class certification. (Dkt. No. 177, 5:6-20 (\"[F]eel free to file your motion for reconsideration . . . [Defendant] will be looking very carefully to make sure that it is not a new motion [for class certi- fication]. . . .\").) Consequently, th is Motion is discussed under the reconsideration standard and the Court does not conflate this standard with any other the legal standards. App. 32 restitution and the Court erred in not accepting this alternative.2 A. The Court Did No t Err in Rejecting Plaintiff 's Full Refund Model and Did Not Ignore Plaintiff 's Newly Proposed Disgorgement Model Plaintiff argues that the Court failed to consider his alternative disgorgement model. (Mot., pp. 7-8, 10- 11.) Plaintiff contends that this alternative damages model was proposed during the December 22, 2014 oral argument and was also pre sented in his Summary Judgment briefing. (Mot., p. 11 (\"The Court.. erred in disregarding this model . . . which Plaintiff 's counsel expressly brought to the Court's attention during oral argument[ ]. . . .\"); Gregory Weston Declaration, Dkt. No. 187, \u00b6 2.) The Court stresses that a request to reconsider is not an opportunity to raise arguments or present evi- dence for the first time when one could have reasonably raised these contentions earlier in the litigation. Kona Enterprises, Inc. v. Estate of Bishop , 229 F.3d 887, 890 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing 389 Orange St. , 179 F.3d at 665) 2 The Parties again focus their arguments on irrelevant is- sues - the materiality prong of Plaintiff 's state law claims and the typicality prong under Rule 23. (Dkt. No. 80; cf. 17- 18; Opp., 14- 18.) The Court previously disre- garded these identical arguments in its Order, and Plaintiff does not assert clear error in not addr essing those arguments therein. (Order, p. 4 n. 1.). Consequently , the Court will not address these contentions within this discussion. App. 33 (emphasis added). Neither should the Court have to search other pleadings in the litigation to ascertain a party's arguments. Independent Towers of Washington v. Washington , 350 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir. 2003) (\"Judges are not like pigs, hunting for truffles buried in briefs\" or oral arguments.\" (quoting United States v. Dunkel , 927 F.2d 955, 956 (7th Cir. 1991))). As the Parties recall, Defendant moved to decer- tify class on various grounds, namely that Plaintiff 's damages model was insufficient, and Plaintiff opposed the motion contending that his full refund damages model was sufficient using on ly Defendant's sales data. (Dkt. Nos. 111, 141.) The Court granted Defendant's Motion to decertify class because restitutionary dam- ages could not be calculated using only Defendant's sales data. (Order, pp. 7-11. ) Now, Plaintiff no longer rests his measurement of classwide damages on the full refund damages model - a model he suggested in certifying the class. (Dkt. No. 65, p. 22 (\"Finally, not only is a full refund [model] of the purchase price . . . consistent . .\"); cf. Dkt. No. 141, p. 10 (\"As further explained below, Plaintiff 's full refund damage model is con- sistent with his liability theory that Cobra is ineffec-tive and illegal.\").) The Court's Order did not address Plaintiff 's alternative disgorgement model for the sim- ple reason that Plaintiff did not propose this alterna-tive disgorgement model anywhere in his opposition to decertify class or during oral argument. ( See generally Dkt. No. 141; see also Dkt. No. 147 (the \"Hearing\").) App. 34 In reviewing Plaintiff 's opposition to the motion to decertify class, it is abundant ly clear that Plaintiff 's newfound disgorgement model and arguments in sup- port of that model were w ell outside the record before the Court. To the extent Plaintiff thought proposing this alternative model was material to opposing De- fendant's motion for class decertification, he was free to make that contention in his opposition. He failed to do so. Only now does Plaintiff extensively cites to his papers in support of Summary Judgment. (Mot., pp. 10-11 (citing Dkt. No. 161 [Pl. Reply to 129 [Pl. Summ. J. Mot.] at 23- 24).) First, these citations to his summary judgment motion and the reply brief are not mentioned any- where in his opposition to decertify class. ( See gener- ally Dkt. No. 141.) Second, Plaintiff 's assertion of clear error because the Court should have considered argu- ments outside of the four corners of his opposition to class decertification lacks legal support. 3 It is unrea- sonable for Plaintiff to expect the Court to extrapolate this alternative damages model from his Summary Judgment briefing. In effect, Plaintiff seeks to trans-form the Court into \"the lawyer for [Plaintiff ], 3 Plaintiff has every right to cite to evidence attached to a separate motion for summary judgment. Fair Housing Council of Riverside County, Inc. v. Riverside Two , 249 F.3d 1132, 1135-36 (9th Cir. 2001) (noting on cro ss-motions for summary judgment, district court is required to review evidence filed in support of an- other motion so long as that evidence is \"specifically identified in [the] moving papers.\"). But a party (Plaintiff) opposing a motion who wishes to have the court consider evidence cited in a separate motion for summary judg ment must actually cite the evidence in its opposition papers. Id. App. 35 performing the lawyer's duty of setting forth specific [arguments]. . . .\" Carmen v. San Francisco Unified School Dist , 237 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir. 2001) (con- sidering whether a judge must consider materials out-side the motion papers). It would have been \"unfair\" to the Court and \"profoundly unf air\" to Defendant to re- quire the Court \"to search the entire record for [argu-ments], even though [Plainti ff ] [did] not set [them] out in the opposition papers.\" Id.; in accord In re E.R. Fegert, Inc. , 887 F.2d 995, 957 (9th Cir. 1989) (the \"ar- gument must be raised sufficiently for the trial court to rule on it.\") (citation omitted); Independent Towers , 350 F.3d at 929 (\"Our adversarial system relies on the advocates to inform the discus sion and raise the issues to the Court.\"). Plaintiff 's next argument is that the Court \"disre- garded\" this alternative damages model despite \"Plaintiff 's counsel expressly [bringing] [the alterna-tive damages model] to the Court's attention during oral arguments.\" (Mot., p. 11 \u00b6 2.) The Court's review of the hearing transcript reveals not one reference to the word \"disgorgement\" or \"alternative.\" ( See Hear- ing.) Plaintiff 's counsel a pparently suggests he had somehow proposed an alternative damages model when he cited the summary judgment briefing during oral argument. 4 (Weston Decl., \u00b6 2.) Even if it had been 4 In highlighting a portion of the Hearing, Plaintiff 's counsel declares that he \"referred the Court to Plaintiff 's Motion for Summary Judgment and Reply in Support of Motion for Sum-mary Judgment.\" (Weston Decl., \u00b6 2.) Though it is true that Plain-tiff did reference such briefs during oral argument, (Hearing, App. 36 proper to propose an alternative damages model at oral argument, the record reflects that Plaintiff did no such thing. Instead Plaintiff made a fleeting reference to his summary judgment papers without any refer-ence to an alternative damages model. ( See generally Hearing.) The Court's duty during oral argument is not to deduce arguments from implicit statements. Inde- pendent Towers , 350 F.3d at 929 (\"The art of [oral] ad- vocacy is not one of mystery.\"). To argue otherwise would be unreasonable. Simply put, this is the first time Plaintiff has brought this alternative damages model to the Court's attention, and there is neithe r a single sentence in his opposition nor any reference made during oral argu- ment regarding an alternative damages model. ( See Dkt. Nos. 129, 141; see also Hearing.) In hindsight, Plaintiff may wish he had proposed an alternative damages model much earlier. See, e.g. , Brown v. Hain Celestial Group, Inc. , No. C 07-01882 JF (RS), 2010 WL 760433, at *1142 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (Proposing multiple damages models (dominant-fi rm and regression mod- els) in a motion to certify cl ass). But reconsideration is not an opportunity to take a second bite at the apple. Campion v. Old Repub. Home Protection Co., Inc. , No. 09- CV-00748-JMA(NLS), 2011 WL 1935967, at *1 (S.D. Cal. May 2011). It is an opportunity to correct the Court's error, not Plaintiff 's. FDIC v. Jackson - Shaw Partners, No. 46, Ltd. , 850 F.Supp. 839, 845 (N.D. Cal. 1994) (motions for reconsideration \"are not to be used 7:20-23, 8:1-4, 17: 11-25), the statements had nothing to do with any purported alternative damages model. App. 37 to test new legal theories that could have been pre- sented when the original motion was pending.\"). Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff 's failure to explicitly raise this ne wly proposed alternative dam- ages model arguments in his opposition papers or oral argument amount to a waiver of this argument. Moreno Roofing , 99 F.3d at 343 (passing remarks on an issue in opposition to summa ry judgment were insuffi- cient to avoid waiver); U.S. v. George , 291 Fed. App'x. 803, 805 (9th Cir. 2008) (holdin g party's \"failure to ad- equately develop these arguments in his brief operates as a waiver\"); accord John-Charles v. California , 646 F.3d (9th Cir. 201 1) (the party \"failed to develop any argument on this front, and thus has waived it\"); JustMed, Inc. v. Byce , 580 Fed.Appx. 566, 567 (9th Cir. 2014) (\"Because [Defendant] did not properly raise this argument before the district court . . . the argument is 107 F.3d 712, 715 n.2 party fails to \"co- herently develop[ ]\" an argument on appeal \"we deem it to have been abandoned\"). But even if Plaintiff had not waived this argument and proposed this alternative disgorgement model within his opposition to class decertification, his alter- native damages model still does not undermine the Court's reasoning. App. 38 B. The Undisputed Evidence Shows that Plaintiff Still Cannot Present a Viable Damages Model Under His New Disgorge- ment Model The remainder of Plaintiff 's Motion for Reconsid- eration concerns his alternative disgorgement model. (Mot., pp. 6-17.) Under this disgorgement model, Plain- tiff contends that there was sufficient evidence to measure classwide restitutionary damages. (Mot., pp. 11-14.) Plaintiff 's contention that the Court's ruling erred rests on several pieces of evidence. 1. Restitution and the Disgorgement Remedy As a preliminary matter, it is necessary for the Court to address the appropriate standard of law in measuring restitution. Under Plaintiff 's theories of recovery, \"[t]he False Advertising Law, the Unfair Competition Law, and the CLRA authorize a trial court to grant restitution to pri- vate litigants. . . .\" Colgan v.

Rptr. 2d 29, 40 (California Supreme Court stating that \"[w]hile ex- press authority to order restitution was added to the UCL, courts were not given similar authorization to or- der nonrestitutionary disgorgement.\"). Restitutionary disgorgement is limited to (1) money or property once in the plaintiff 's possession and (2) money in which the plaintiff has a vested interest. Korea Supply Company , 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 29, 41-42 (\"Under the UCL, an indi- vidual may recover profits unfairly obtained to the ex-tent that these profits represent monies given to the defendant or benefits in which the plaintiff has an ownership interest.\"). The distinction between restitutionary and non- restitutionary disgorgement turns on whether the money the plaintiff seeks is money that was originally obtained by the defendant from the plaintiff. See, e.g. , Kraus v. Trinity Mgmt. Servs. Inc. , 23 Cal. 4th 116, 126- 27, 96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 485 (Cal. 2000) superseded on other grounds, as recognized in Arias v. Superior Court , 46 App. 40 Cal. 4th 969, 95 Cal. Rptr. 3d 588 (Cal. 2009). If that is the case, the disgorgement is restitutionary in nature. Id. To the extent the plaintiff seeks to disgorge monies that were not taken from the plaintiff, such monetarily relief is nonrestitutionar y and unavailable under the UCL. Korea Supply Company , 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 29, 36- 46. 2. Using Plaintiff 's Methodology In Cal- culating the Average Retail Price Produces a Nonrestitutionary Dis- gorgement Model Which Is Impermis- sible Under California Law Here, Plaintiff disputes the Court's underlying conclusion that failing to present an average retail price was fatal to his full refund damages model. (Mot., pp. 6-7.) Now, Plaintiff presents evidence to calculate an average retail price. ( Id.) According to Plaintiff, a jury could determine the average retail price of Cobra using his suggested retail prices. ( Id.) The suggested retail prices derive from (1) Defendant's product guides that are distributed to its retailers, (2) Plain- tiff 's deposition, and (3) Defendant's website where it sells Cobra directly to consumers. ( Id.) Plaintiff claims that a quantifiable sum can be calculated using any of these retail prices. ( Id. at pp. 14-15 (citing to Pl. Summ. J. Briefing).) Although the retail prices have fluctuated over time, Plaintiff contends that the prices have con- tinued to stay consistent with one another. ( Id. at p. 6 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, Weston Decl. Exs. 1-4 (since 2009, the sug- gested retail prices from Defendant's product guides App. 41 vary from $13.79 for a 30 co unt bottle, between $23.79 to $24.29 for a 60 count bottle, and between $35.39 to $ 36.19 for a 120 count bottle).)5 According to Plaintiff, the prices need not be exa ct and are in fact adequate for a jury to ascertain an average retail price. ( Id. at p. 7 \u00b6 1.) Although a quantifiable sum can be calculated using these prices and restitution need not be precisely measured at this stage, the newly presented evidence is unreliable and renders the alternative disgorgement model nonrestitutionary in nature. First, in examining the suggested retail prices in Defendant's product guides, (Weston Decl., Exs. 1-4.), the Court finds such evidence to be unreliable in deter- mining the average retail price. As the Court discussed in its prior ruling, the prices wholesalers suggest to its retailers are not the prices at which retailers sell the product. ( See Order, p. 10 (citing U.S. v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 32 80 S.Ct. 503, 506 4 L.Ed.2d 505 (1960) (\"[D]rug retailers in the two cities advertised 5 Again, this evidence Plaintiff relies on for this proposition is nowhere to be found in any of his opposition to decertify class. (See generally , Dkt. No. 141.) Plaintiff does not claim that this evidence is newly discovered. Therefore, such evidence should have been presented to the Court in those previous opposition pa-pers, not a motion for reconsiderat ion. Local Rule 7-9 (The oppos- ing party shall file \"the evidence upon which the opposing party will rely in opposition to the motion and a brief but complete memorandum which shall contain a statement of all the reasons in opposition thereto and the points and authorities upon which the opposing party wi ll rely. . . .\"); cf. Local Rule 7-18 (\"A motion for reconsideration of the decision on any motion may be made only on the grounds . . . (c) a manifest showing of a failure to con-sider material facts presented to the Court before such decision.\"). App. 42 and sold several [ ] vitamin products at prices substan- tially below the suggested minimum retail prices.\").) In his Reply, Plaintiff appears to challenge the assertion that retailers set their own pricing for the products they receive from wholesalers. (Reply, pp. 5-6.) Because there is no evidence of an example where a vendor marked Cobra's suggested retail price up or down, Plaintiff seeks to move forward under the assumption that vendors accept the price suggestions within the product guides and do not make any price adjustments whatsoever. ( Id.) Plaintiff 's logic is flawed. Retailers have the ability to set their own prices (mark-up or mark-down) for the products they buy from the whole-salers because that is how retailers make a profit. F.T.C. v. Figgie Intern., Inc. , 994 F.2d 595, 606 (9th Cir. 1993) (\"[Defendant] sells heat detectors for cash to dis- tributors, who apparently have complete discretion to set their own mark-ups.\"). The same can be said about Defendant and the vendor s who sell Cobra. ( See Dkt. No. 111, Ex. H., 144:17-21, Jeffery A. Hinrich's Tran- script (\"The retailer sets their own pricing. [Defendant has] a price that [Defendant sells] to [Defendant does] not know retailer] price . . . what [the retailer] will put as a once [the retailer receives] the product.\").); in accord Astiana v. Ben & Jerry's Homemade, Inc. , No. C 10-4387 PHI, 2014 WL 60097, at *12-13 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2014) (denying class certification because, inter alia , plaintiff provided no evidence to account for the \"prices in the retail market [that] are affected by the nature and location of the outlet in which [the product] [is] sold.\") (citation omitted). Plaintiff 's use of these App. 43 suggested retail prices fails to take into account the re- tailer's discretion which is why the Court expected Plaintiff to collect data and present an average retail price. Second, using Plaintiff 's deposition as a basis to calculate an average retail price is not only unreliable but illogical. Defendant contends that Plaintiff 's depo- sition is unreliable because of the inconsistency in Plaintiff 's statements. In his complaint, Plaintiff states that he bought Cobr a at a local Rite-Aid for about \"$16$17\" which is inconsistent with Plaintiff 's deposition where he recalls buying Cobra for about \"$16-$18.\" (Dkt. No. 189 (\"P1. Depo.\"), 40:25; cf. Dkt. No. 56 (Second Amended Complaint), \u00b6 18.) Plaintiff 's inconsistencies are evident, but the Court is more con-cerned with the illogical request Plaintiff asks of the jury. For Plaintiff to ask a juror to determine the aver- age retail price based on one particular value a vendor (Rite-Aid) used in selling Cobra makes no sense. As mentioned earlier, retailers have discretion in setting prices for their products whic h is why a product's price varies from vendor to vendor . Plaintiff 's recollection of one price at Rite-Aid in 2012 represents only one piece of the puzzle in formulating an average retail price. The Court expects an average retail price, not one re- tail price. 6 6 To the extent Plaintiff simply seeks to use Plaintiff 's depo- sition as evidence of the consistency in value between these three sets of prices, the Court still is not persuaded. There is a clear inconsistency between Plaintiff 's testimony and his complaint. (Pl. Depo. 40:25; cf. Second Amended Complaint, \u00b6 18.) Plaintiff App. 44 Third, using Defendant's website where it sells Cobra directly to consumers is, as Defendant argues, rife with problems. (Opp., pp. 5-7.) This is the price De- fendant (not the retailers) utilizes in selling Cobra to consumers. Defendant has alre ady stated that it rarely sells Cobra through its website. (Hinrichs Decl., Dkt. No. 189-5, \u00b6 3 (stating that since 2009, 44 bottles of Co- bra have been sold through Defendant's website).) More importantly, Plaintiff does not seek to disgorge profits from Defendant's dire ct sales to consumers. If Plaintiff sought to disgorge those profits, then an aver- age retail price would be unnecessary because Defend- ant's direct sales to consumers are profits that Plaintiff and class members have an ownership interest in. But, Plaintiff does not seek to disgorge profits from Defend- ant's direct sales to consumers. Instead, Plaintiff seeks to disgorge profits from Defendant's sales to the retail- ers. This is inappropriate under California law because Plaintiff and the class members do not have an owner-ship interest in Defendant's sales to third party ven- dors. 7 Madrid v. Perot Systems Corp. , 130 Cal. App. 4th has not produced a receipt or any other concrete documentation to support his statements, (Pl. De po., 41:6-7.), yet he seeks to use this price he remembers (from purchasing Cobra in 2012) as evi-dence within his damages model. Because of the inconsistences and lack of evidentiary proof regarding this price, the Court does not consider such evidence as being consistent with the other sug-gested retail prices. 7 The Court agrees with Plaintiff on one point. (Reply, p. 8 \u00b6 2.) Defendant does not walk away free from liability because it never sold Cobra directly to cons umers. Nor is Plaintiff required to sue all of the retailers who sold Cobra directly to consumers. What the Court is saying is that Plaintiff needs both pieces of ev- idence under this model - Defendant's sales to its retailers and App. 45 440, 455-462, 30 Cal. Rptr. 3d 210 (Cal. App. 2005) (\"Plaintiff 's generalization fails to acknowledge the specific limitation applicab le in the UCL context - that restitution means the return of money to those persons from whom it was taken or who had an ownership in- terest in it.\") (citation omitted). Rather, the class mem- bers have an ownership interest in the retail sales, i.e., amounts they paid directly to the retailer. ( See Order, p. 8.) This is why an average retail price is so essential because it is the sole vari able to which Plaintiff and the class members have an ownership interest in. De- fendant's website prices do not reflect the ownership interest class members have in Cobra's retail profits and to allow Plaintiff to us e this data as a means to calculate an average retail price would be improper. Lee Myles Assoc. Corp. v. 1144 (S.D. Cal. 2008) (\"Disgorgement of profits earned by defendant s as a result of allegedly unfair practices, where the money sought to be dis-gorged was not taken from the plaintiff and the the average retail price used in selling Cobra - to bridge the gap between Defendant's gains and Plaintiff 's ownership interest within those gains. Johns v. Bayer Corp. , Civil No. 09-CV-1935- AJB (DHB), (\"because [Defendant's] profits for its Men' s Vitamins would seemingly have originated from the class member s' purchases of the products, Plaintiffs contention that they are seeking restitutionary dis-gorgement of Bayer's profits is arguably accurate.\" But \"it is for the District Judge to determine which measure of restitution is appropriate in this case . . . \" and Plaintiffs' duty is to obtain \"the evidence which supports a theory of restitutionary disgorge-ment. . . .\"). App. 46 plaintiff did not have an ownership interest in the money, is not authorized.\"). Ultimately, Plaintiff 's alternative disgorgement model and the accompanying retail price suggestions do not address the previously highlighted impasse - the inability to calculate restitution.8 (Order, p. 11.) For the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Plaintiff 's new evidence is insufficient. And since the discovery deadline has lapsed, Plaintiff must again 8 Even assuming arguendo that such retail prices are appro- priate in measuring restitution, Plaintiff leaps to the conclusion that a jury could somehow determ ine an average retail price us- ing these set of numbers. (Mot., pp. 6-7; cf. Opp., p. 9.) In his Re- ply, Plaintiff states that the jury would weigh the evidence (the suggested retail prices) and then determine for itself what it be- lieves the actual retail price is. (Reply, pp. 6-7 n.1.) Plaintiff con- tinues to claim that the calculatio ns will not be difficult, simply multiply the average retail price by the number of bottles sold using Defendant's sales data. ( Id.) But Plaintiff ignores the ques- tion of how picking one suggested retail price (one price for each bottle count) automatically configures an average. Judge Collins and this Court expected Plaintiff to produce an average retail price under this damages model, but Plaintiff 's ev- idence does not reflect a set of retail values of Cobra that typify a set of various vendors. For example, the prices within Defendant's product guides are in fact suggestions made to retailers. No evi- dence demonstrates that these su ggested prices match the prices various retailers set for Cobra. The Court recognizes that calcu-lating damages need not be exact or \"mathematically precise\" at this stage, but the Court will no t ignore Plaintiffs speculative ap- proach in relying on price suggestions within a product guide as a basis to determine an average retail price. Alaska Rent-A-Car, Inc. v. Avis Budget Group, Inc. , 738 F.3d 960, 970 (9th Cir. 2013) (the law \"requires only that dam ages be capable of measurement based upon reliable factors without undue speculation. \") (empha- sis added). App. 47 solely rely on Defendant's sales data, which the Court has already considered and found insufficient in calcu- lating restitution. ( See (C.D. Cal. Apr. 15, 2014) (\"[C]lasswide damages cannot accurately be measured based on De- fendant's sales data alone.\").) Using the sales data alone, Plaintiff seeks to di sgorge Defendant of what Defendant received from its wholesale sales, but as previously mentioned, Plaintiff and his class members do not have an ownership interest in those sales. To move forward with only one of these variables (Defend- ant's sales data) undermines the purpose of restitution and the requirement of having an ownership interest in the disgorged profits. Shersher v. Superior Court , 154 Cal. App. 4th 1491, 1499, 65 Cal. Rptr. 3d 634 (2007) ( Korea Supply only requires \"that the plaintiff must be a 'person in interest' (that is, the plaintiff must have had an ownership interest in the money or prop-erty sought to be recovered).\") (citing Korea Supply , 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 41). Plaintiff continues to argue that the Court is being too restrictive in applying restitution. (Mot., pp. 12-13.) The definition of restitution is clear-cut, and courts will only award class-wide restit ution when it \"serves to provide what the class me mbers lost, not what the [d]fendant gained\" unless the class members have an ownership interest in defendant's gains. ( See Order, p. 8 (citing Astiana , 2014 WL 60097, at *12-13); see also Company , 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 29, 35-46. Plaintiff is attempting to evade the requirements App. 48 under this definition. The problem with Plaintiff 's ev- idence and his reoccurring arguments is that he seeks an award of monies that exceed his ownership interest. Moreover, Plaintiff 's arguments that equitable princi-ples favor his disgorgement model are equally unper- suasive. (Mot., pp. 15-16.) Fo r Plaintiff to argue in favor of equitable principles on one hand but then request the Court to compromise on such equitable require- ments on the other hand is inconsistent. In any case, such a contention is ineffective because Plaintiff 's model fails to restore class members back to the status quo. Korea Supply , 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 41. Amidst his equitable policy considerations and other unpersua-sive contentions, Plaintiff cannot avoid what is clear - his measurement of restit ution does not meet the Ko- rea Supply threshold. Johns , 2012 WL 1520030 at *4 (\"[D]isgorgement is available to the extent it is restitu- tionary.\") (citations omitted). Plaintiff 's continued attempt to manipulate his evidence to satisfy a restitutionary measurement is ob- vious. If Plaintiff 's goal is to move forward with an ad- equate damages model, Plaintiff could have achieved that goal any time since June 2014 when Judge Collins certified this class action. (Dkt. No. 80.) From the mo-ment the class was certified, Plaintiff was well aware of Judge Collins's expectation (an expectation of an av- erage retail price). ( Id.) As discovery proceeded, the re- sponsibility of obtaining evidence to \"readily calculate[ ] [classwide rest itution] using Defendant's sales numbers and an averag e retail price\" rested squarely on Plaintiff. (Dkt. No . 80, p. 13.) He choose not App. 49 to gather the data to formulate an average retail price and has since (until now) fa iled to propose an alterna- tive damages model. Accordingly, Plaintiff 's arguments (new and old) have not changed the Court's stance, thus, the Court will not disturb its previous ruling. C. Class Notice Finally, Plaintiff argues that the Court's Order is defective because it did not address the issue of class notice upon decertifying class. (Mot., pp. 19-20.) Again, this is an argument that Plaintiff failed to set forth in his opposition to class decertification. That is sufficient grounds to disregard this contention under the recon- sideration standards. Independent Towers , 350 F.3d at 929. Irrespective of that standard, Plaintiff is correct that class members must re ceive notice following class decertification, but it is Plaintiff 's duty to address and bear the cost of class notice, not the Court. See Culver v. City of Milwaukee , 277 F.3d 908, 915 (7th Cir. 2002) (recognizing that the plaint iff bears the cost of class notice following decertification); see also Radmanovich v. Combined Ins. Co. of America , 271 F.Supp.2d 1075, 1078 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (plaintiff bringing forth a motion for class notice under Rule 23(e) following a denial of class certification) (citing Culver , 277 F.3d 908); Barner v. City 3316, 2004 WL 20920009, at *7 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (granting plaintiff 's request for class notice following a clas s decertification) (citing App. 50 Culver , 277 F.3d 908). The Court's duty is to oversee the dissemination of class notice. Furthermore, Plain- tiff argues that Defendant's decertification motion was defective for not providing a plan for class notice, but Plaintiff fails to recognize that this is his class action and he is responsible for be aring the costs of class no- tice when class is certified and decertified. Eisen v. Car- lisle and Jacquelin , 417 U.S. 156, 178, 94 S. Ct. 2140 (1974) (\"The usual rule is that a plaintiff must initially bear the cost of notice to th e class.\"). Class notice is the responsibility of Class Counsel. Accordingly, the Court disagrees with Plaintiff and does not reconsider its ruling based on his final argu- ment. IV. CONCLUSION In light of the foregoing, the Court DENIES Plain- tiff 's Motion for Reconsideration. Plaintiff does not identify any new evidence or law that it could not have, with reasonable diligence, presented to the Court in his opposition papers. Nor does Plaintiff identify any material evidence or authorities cited in his opposition papers that the Court ignored or disregarded such that the Court can be said to have committed clear or man- ifest error. Furthermore, the Court ORDERS Plaintiff to file a proposed notice with respect to class decertification no later than twenty-one (21) days following the issu- ance of this Order. Plaintiff will bear the cost of class notice. Culver , 277 F.3d at 915. App. 51 This case shall move forward with Summary Judgement and Trial. Because the Court previously vacated all dates, (Mt. No. 178), a status conference is scheduled for July 27, 2015 at 10:00 am to reset dates and discuss the possibility of supplemental Summary Judgment briefing considering this ruling. IT IS SO ORDERED. Dated: June 24, 2015 /s/ Andre Birotte Jr. HONORABLE ANDR \u00c9 BIROTTE JR. UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT JUDGE App. 52 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA TROY LAMBERT, P l a i n t i f f , v. NUTRACEUTICAL CORPORATION, Defendant. Case No. CV 13-05942-AB (Ex) ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR CLASS DECERTIFICATION (Filed Feb. 20, 2015) Pending before the Court is Defendant Nutraceu- tical Corporation's Motion for Class Decertification. (Mot., Dkt. Nos. 111, 122.) Plai ntiff Troy Lambert filed an Opposition and Defendant filed a Reply. (Opp., Re-ply, Dkt. Nos. 141, 144.) A hearing was held on Decem- ber 22, 2014. (Dkt. No. 147. ) Having considered the materials submitted and the oral argument presented at the hearing, the Court hereby GRANTS the Motion. I. BACKGROUND This consumer class action involves a dietary sup- plement called Cobra Sexual Energy (\"Cobra\"). ( See Second Amended Complaint \"SAC,\" Dkt. No. 56.) fendant manufactures and markets Cobra. ( Id.) \"De- fendant's product Cobra pri marily consists of a 'proprietary blend' of small amounts of extracts from herbs, roots, [ ] other organi c substances . . . \" and other plant-based materials. ( Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 26-30.) From May 2011 through December 2011, on numerous occasions, App. 53 Plaintiff bought Cobra from different locations in Cal- ifornia. ( Id. at \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff contends that Defendant \"falsely market[s] [Cobra] as having beneficial health and aphrodisiac properties and being scientifically for- mulated to improve virility, despite that none of the in- gredients in Cobra, individually or in combination, provide such benefits.\" ( Id. at \u00b6 1.) On March 14, 2013, Plaint iff filed a class action complaint against Defendant alleging the following: Violation of the Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"), Un- lawful Prong (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17200 et seq. ); Violation of the UCL, Unfair and Fraudulent Prong (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17200 et seq. ); Violation of the False Advertising Law (\"FAL\") (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17500 et seq. ); Violation of the Consumer (Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1750 et seq. ). (Id.) On June 19, 2014, this Court certified Plaintiff 's class action. (Dkt. No. 80.) The class is defined as: All persons (excluding officers, directors, and em- ployees of [Defendant]) who purchased, on or af-ter August 14, 2009, [Defendant's] Cobra Products (in all packaging sizes and iterations) in California for their own use rather than for resale or distribution. (See Dkt. No. 83 (emphasis in original)). Now that discovery is completed, Defendant moves for class decertificat ion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 23. Plaintiff opposes decertifi-cation on several grounds. App. 54 II. LEGAL STANDARD Rule 23 governs class certification in federal court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. Although it is not an express compo-nent of Rule 23, \"courts have held that the class must be adequately defined and clearly ascertainable before a class action may proceed.\" Zeisel v. Diamond Foods, Inc., C 10-01192 JSW, 2011 WL 2221113, at* 6 (N.D. Cal. June 7, 2011). A district court's decision to decer- tify a class is committed to its sound discretion. See Knight v. Kenai Peninsula Borough School Dist. , 131 F.3d 807, 816 (9th Cir. 1997) . The standard used in re- viewing a motion to decertify is the same as the stand-ard used in evaluating a motion to certify. A district court \"must conduct a 'rigorous analysis' into whether the prerequisites of Rule 23 are Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc. , 97 F.3d 1227, 1233 (9th Cir. 1996) (citing In re American Medical Sys. , 75 F.3d 1069, 1078- 79 (6th Cir. 1996)). A court may choose to decertify a class on a party's motion or sua sponte at any time after the court condi- tionally certifies the class. Fe d. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1). Even on a motion to decertify, the party seeking to maintain class certification bears the burden of demonstrating that the Rule 23 requirements are satisfied. Marlo v. U.P.S. , 639 F.3d 942, 947 (9th Cir. 2011). Based on discovery or other developments, a party may move to decertify the class on the basis that the prerequisites and grounds for certification do not exist. See Pierce v. County of Orange , 526 F.3d 1190, 1200 (9th Cir. 2008); Owner-Operator Independent Drivers App. 55 Ass'n, Inc. v. Landstar System, Inc. , 622 F.3d 1307, 1326 (11th Cir. 2010) (concluding that decertification was appropriate where the court ultimately determined that damages cannot easily be calculated for all class members). III. DISCUSSION This Court certified this class action under Rule 23(b)(3). (Dkt. No. 80, p. 16 \u00b6 1.) Rule 23(b) states that a court may certify a class if \"the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members pre-dominate over any questions affecting only individual members. . . .\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). \"A court must de- cide 'whether there are so many questions common to all of the plaintiffs that having class action treatment would be far more efficient than having a number of separate trials.' \" Slaven v. BP America, Inc. , 190 F.R.D. 649, 657 (C.D. Cal. 2000) (citation omitted). Defendant moves to decertify the class on the ground that individual issues predominate over com- mon issues. Most importantly, Defendant argues that Plaintiff 's full refund model fails because it does not satisfy the Comcast common methodology test, and be- cause Plaintiff failed to obtain the evidence necessary to calculate damages. (Mot., pp. 11-14 (citing Comcast Corp. v. Behrend , 133 S.Ct. 1426, 1430, 185 L.Ed.2d 515 (2013)). Plaintiff opposes Defendant's Motion, arguing that Plaintiff 's proposed damages methodology is con-sistent with his theories of liability. ( See Opp., pp. 12- 15.) App. 56 The Court finds that class decertification is war- ranted because although Plai ntiff 's full refund model is consistent with his theories of liability, Plaintiff has not presented enough evidence to demonstrate that classwide damages can be measured. 1 1. Plaintiff 's Theory for Measuring Dam- ages is Consistent with Plaintiff 's The-ories of Liability The class was certified under Plaintiff 's FAL, UCL, and CLRA theories and the theories we re to be measured using the full refund damages model theory, which would be \"readily calculated using Defendant's sales numbers and an average retail price.\" ( See SAC; Dkt. No. 80, p. 13.) a. The Legal Standa rd for Classwide Damages To maintain a class under Rule 23(b)(3), a plaintiff must demonstrate that damages are measurable on a classwide basis through use of a \"common methodol- ogy.\" Comcast Corp. v. Behrend , 133 S.Ct. 1426, 1430, 1 The Court finds that the issue pertaining to the full refund model is dispositive and therefore need not reach the remaining issues involving the reliance and materiality prongs of Plaintiff 's state law claims. ( See Mot., pp. 5-11; Opp., pp. 2-10.) Because the Court certified this class under Rule 23(b)(3), the Court will not reach the Parties' arguments addre ssing certification under pp. 15-17.) to cer- tify the class under Rule 23(b)(2) has passed pursuant to Local Rule 23-3. App. 57 185 L.Ed.2d 515 (2013); Chavez v. Blue Sky Natural Beverage Co. , 268 F.R.D. 365, 379 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (\"[a]t class certification, plainti ff must present a likely method for determining class damages. . . .\"). In order to certify a class, plaintiff 's damages model must be consistent with the theory of liability against a defend- ant. Id. at 1433-34. In Comcast , the Supreme Court conducted a \"rigorous analysis\" of the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement and concluded that the plaintiff \"failed to estab lish that damages could be measure[d] on a [classwide] basis\" because the com- mon methodology in measuring damages was in excess of the liability theories asserted. Id. at 1431-32. b. Plaintiff 's Claims Seek Classwide Damages Under the Full Refund Model Plaintiff 's claim under the FAL is defined to in- clude any statements, pictures, or labels made in con-nection with the sale of good s or services that is likely to deceive the reasonable consumer. See Williams v. Gerber Prods. Co. , 552 F.3d 934, 939 (9th Cir. 2008). A UCL action defines unfair competition to \"mean and include any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or mis-leading advertising and any act prohibited by [the FAL].\" See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code \u00a7 17200; see also In re Tobacco II Cases , 46 Cal. 4th 298, 312, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 559 (Cal. 2009). Under the CLRA, a defendant is li- able if it misrepresents its goods to contain certain characteristics, uses, or benefits that the goods do not App. 58 have or advertises goods intending not to sell them as advertised. Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1770(a)(5), (7), (9) and (16). Plaintiff seeks restitution under these claims. \"The False Advertising Law, the Unfair Competition Law, and the CLRA authorize a trial court to grant res- titution to private litigants asserting claims under those statutes.\" Colgan v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. , 135 Cal. App. 4th 663, 694, 38 Cal. Rptr. 3d 36 (Cal. App. 2006) (citations omitted) . \"The proper measure of restitution in a mislabeling case is the amount neces- sary to compensate the purchaser for the difference be- tween a product as labeled and the product as received.\" Werdebaugh v.

Plaintiff uses the full refund model to measure restitution. The full refund model assumes the class members did not benefit from the product at issue, and therefore are entitled to a full refund. In re POM Won- derful LLC , No. at *3 n.2 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2014) (\"[T]he Full Refund model depends upon the assumption that not a single consumer received a single benefit. . . .\"); cf. In re Vioxx Class Cases , 180 Cal. App. 4th 116, 131 (Cal. App. 2009) (\"The difference between what the plaintiff paid and the value of what the plaintiff received is a App. 59 proper measure of restitution.\"). For a damages model such as this, \"[c]alculations need not be exact.\" Com- cast, 133 S.Ct. at 1433. c. Plaintiff 's Damages Model Matches His Theories of Liability Defendant contends that this full refund model does not match Plaintiff 's clai ms because it fails to ac- count for the benefit that so me class members got from Cobra. (Mot., p. 11 (citing Caldera v. POM , 2014 WL 1225184 at *3 n.2. Defendant argues that its experts and Leslie Garvin's declaration establis h that at least some class members received a benefit from Cobra, which renders the full refund model inapp licable on a classwide basis. (See, e.g. , Leslie Garvin Declaration, Dr. Eli Seggev Re- port, Gershwin Repo rt, Dkt. Nos. 111-1, 111-5, 111-8.) As a result, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff 's damages model exceeds his li ability theories and is not a valid \"common methodology,\" making individual is- sues predominate over common issues. Comcast , 133 S.Ct. at 1431. Plaintiff has presented evidence support- ive of his principal theory that Cobra is valueless. ( See, e.g., Dr. George E. Belch Repo rt, Dr. David L. Rowland Report, Opp., Exs. 1, 2, (stating, inter alia , that Cobra's ingredients are ineffective and unreliable for sexual enhancement purposes)). The Court finds that Plaintiff 's full refund dam- ages model matches his theor ies of liability. Plaintiff App. 60 claims that Cobra is valu eless, and Plaintiff has pro- duced evidence that supports hi s claim. If the finder of fact finds that Cobra is in fact valueless then that jus- tifies fully refunding the class for their purchases. In re POM , 2014 WL 1225184, at *3 n.2 (\"[T]he Full Re- fund model depends upon the assumption that not a single consumer received a single benefit . . . from De-fendant's [products].\"). 2. Class Decertificati on is Warranted Be- cause Plaintiff Cannot Demonstrate a Classwide Calculation of Damages The Court certified this class under Rule 23(b)(3) based on Plaintiff 's representations regarding the full refund model. Based on these representations, the Court anticipated calculating damages using Defend-ant's sales data and an average retail price. (Dkt. No. 65, pp. 20-21 (\"Thus, using th e average suggested retail sales price for [Cobra], which can also be obtained in discovery, multiplied by th e number of units sold, will establish total amount of re stitution dollars owing to the class.\")). However, Plaintiff has not produced an av-erage retail price or any othe r point-of-sale data to sup- port his damages model. Instead, Plaintiff uses Defendant's sales data and unit sales as the only means of calculating damages. (Opp., p. 14; cf. Dkt. No. 65-2, Exs. 5-6.) Defendant argu es that its sales data by itself cannot be used to ca lculate damages under Plain- tiff 's full refund model, and without the average retail price, no restitution can be calculated. App. 61 The average retail price is essential in this action. Normally, under the UCL full restitution standards, restitution is calculated by taking the average market price the consumer actually paid and deducting it from the true market price. Werdebaugh , 2014 WL 7148923, at *8 (citation omitted). Courts routinely require the use of an average retail price to calculate damages. Chambers v. CVS Pharmacy, Inc. , No. 09cv0419 JAH(RBB), 2009 WL 2579661, at *3 (S.D. Cal. 2009) (using the average retail price of $2.45 to determine that the plaintiff 's causes of action could not exceed minimum amount in controversy required for diversity jurisdiction); OS Enterprise, LLC v. Fairline Develop- ment Canada (1992) Ltd. , No: C 11-4375 SBA, 2014 WL 1389540, at *3 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (accepting the magis- trate's default judgment recommendation which calcu-lated Plaintiff 's lost profits using an average retail price of $13.00 per bird for the chicken brand). In this context, the price Defendant sold Cobra to its wholesalers does not reflect the price class members actually paid. It is the average retail price that reflects the price class members act ually paid. Obtaining the average retail price does not require Plaintiff to deter- mine the individualized price each consumer spent. In-stead, the average retail price is a standard amount each class member would be refunded based on the re- tail information gathered through discovery. Although the average retail price does not have to be exact, it is nevertheless critical at this stage of the litigation. Missing this calculation is a defect in Plaintiff 's evi- dence that is fatal to his class claims because App. 62 restitution serves to provide what the class members lost, not what the Defendant gained. Astiana v. Ben & Jerry's Homemade, Inc. , No. C 10-4387 PJH, 2014 WL 60097 at *12-13 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 7, 2014) (\"Restitution-ary relief is an equitable re medy, and its purpose is 'to restore the status quo by returning to the plaintiff funds in which he or she has an ownership interest.\") (citing Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp. , 29 Cal. 4th 1134, 1149, 131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29 (Cal. 2003)). Plaintiff stated that he would use the average re- tail price to calculate damages and proposed no alter- native method. (Dkt. No. 65, pp. 20-21.) However, during oral argument, it became clear that Plaintiff could only provide Defendant's own sales data and could not provide an average retail price. (Dkt. No. 147, 8:21-25; 9:7-10 (\"Q: Help me understand how you're go- ing to calculate the averag e retail price of this prod- uct.\" A: \"Well, we have - what we had is we had the sales information for almost the entire class but not quite the whole class, and we took that . . . The UCL allows restitution of all fund s received by way of unfair competition. And the defendants have told us what funds they received as a result of unfair competi- tion.\")). Plaintiff already produced Defendant's sales data at the certification stage, which the Court relied upon in granting class certification based on Plaintiff 's rep- resentations that he would supplement Defendant's sales data with the averag e retail price. (Dkt. No. 80, p. 13.) Now discovery is closed, and Plaintiff seeks to establish monetary relief on a classwide basis through App. 63 Defendant's sales data only. Yet, without the average retail price, classwide damages cannot be calculated. Caldera , 2014 WL 1477400 at *4 (\"[C]lasswide dam- ages cannot accurately be measured based on Defend-ant's data alone.\"); Astiana , 2014 WL (denying class certification because, inter alia , plaintiff provided no evidence regarding damages, and that \"[e]stablishing a high er price for a comparable product would be difficult because prices in the retail market differ and are affe cted by the nature and loca- tion of the outlet in which they are sold\"). Plaintiff claims that da mages can be calculated based solely on Defendant's sa les data but does not ex- plain how to do so without the average retail price. (Opp., p. 14; cf. Dkt. No. 65-2, Exs. 5-7; Dkt. No. 147, 37:11-19.) The Court understands that the theory be- hind Plaintiff 's claims is that consumers are not re- ceiving any benefit because Cobra is illegal; therefore, restitution is warranted using a full refund model. However, Plaintiff has not provided the Court with a damages expert or any affirmative evidence as to how this restitutionary calculation will be achieved come trial. Absent any retail data that would identify the ac- tual class injury, the Court could only speculate as to the extent of any classwide injury using only Defend- ant's sales data. For instanc e, retailers set their own pricing for Cobra, marking the prices up or down. ( See Dkt. No. 111, Ex. H., 144:17-21, Jeffery A. Hinrich's Transcript (\"The retailer sets their own [De- fendant has] a know what [the App. that pri ce . . . what [the retailer] will once [the retailer receives] the product.\")); U.S. v. Parke, Davis & Co. , 362 U.S. 29, 32 80 S.Ct. 503, 506 4 L.Ed.2d 505 (1960) (\"[D]rug retail- ers in the two cities adverti sed and sold several [ ] vit- amin products at prices substantially below the suggested minimum retail prices.\"); see also F.T.C. v. Figgie Intern., Inc. , 994 F.2d 595, 606 (9th Cir. 1993) (\"[Defendant] sells heat detectors for cash to distribu- tors, who apparently have complete discretion to set their own mark-ups.\"). Because of the discrepancy in retail pricing, Defendant's sa les data or what Defend- ant charges its wholesalers cannot be a substitute for the average retail price. Plaintiff contends that the average retail price is unnecessary because individual damage calculations alone do not defeat class certification. ( See Opp., pp. 10- 11 (citing Leyva v. Medline Indus. Inc. , F.3d 510, 514 (9th Cir. 2013)). In Leyva , the Ninth Circuit held that \"the presence of individualized damages cannot, by itself, defeat class certification under Rule 23(b) (3).\" (Id.) In justifying this position, the appellate court un- derstood that within a wage and hour context, a class of aggrieved employees may very well have individual-ized damages owed to them because not every class member gets paid the same rate or works the same amount of hours. Thus, \"so long as the damages can be determined and attributed to a plaintiff 's theory of li- ability, damage calculations for individual class mem- bers do not defeat certification.\" Lindell 841738, at App. 65 *14 (E.D. Cal. Mar. Leyva 514). Leyva is distinguishable. In Leyva , individualized damage calculations did not defeat certification be- cause the plaintiffs had a workable damages model that matched their theory of liability. In the instant case, there simply is no evidence to calculate damages under Plaintiff 's damages model is what stops the analysis. The absence of an average retail price makes it impossible to calculate damages either classwide or on an individual basis. Thus, the Court is presented with a full refund model that relies exclusively on De-fendant's sales data, and that evidence alone does not suffice to calculate damages. After a full opportunity to conduct discovery, Plaintiff has failed to produce the evidence needed un- der the full refund model. Moreover, Plaintiff has not presented an alternative damages model to address this impasse. The Court cannot allow this class to move forward if the damages model cannot be applied. Free- land v. AT&T Corp. , 238 F.R.D. 130, 135-36 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (denying certification because the plaintiffs' damages analysis was incomplete and defective). Accordingly, because Plaintiff failed to provide the key evidence necessary to apply his classwide model for damages, the Court canno t find that common issues predominate under Rule 23(b)(3). Therefore, class de- certification is warranted. App. 66 IV. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Decertify Class is GRANTED. IT IS SO ORDERED.

Counsel, please step forward and state your ap- pearances. MR. WESTON: Good morning, Your Honor. Greg Weston for the plaintiffs. THE COURT: Good morning. App. 70 MR. HUESTON: Good morning, Your Honor. John Hueston and Steve Feldman of Hueston Henni- gan for defendant, Nutraceuticals. THE COURT: Good morning. If I under- stand correctly, we are here on a status conference. Obviously, the Court - I assume the parties have re-ceived the motion with respect to the decertification. I guess the question - the first question that comes to mind, in light of that mo tion - I'm curious as to the parties' position whether or not this Court still has ju- risdiction based on that because at least looking at - I think the last filing was the Second Amended Com- plaint. There was a - there may be - there exists diver- sity jurisdiction, but, looking at paragraph 18, it appears that [4] Mr. Lambe rt purchased the item ap- proximately ten times at about $17 per bottle. I wonder if we've reached the monetary amount. So I would be curious as to th e parties' view relative to that. MR. WESTON: Your Honor, my understand- ing is that diversity jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act is established at the time the Complaint is filed based on the Complaint's allegation and the Court does not lose jurisdiction by denying class certi-fication. THE COURT: Is that your understanding, Mr. Hueston? I suspect you might have a different view. App. 71 MR. HUESTON: Well, the case law is actu- ally not 100 percent clear on this. I do think the case law leans in favor of retained jurisdiction. We'll do a little more thinking on that, but I don't think there is a clear basis at this point. THE COURT: All right. And then I guess moving forward - we vacated the trial date. I have some proposed dates, but I guess the question in my mind is have the parties talked in light of the ruling? Is there any opportunity or possibility for settlement in this matter? Or are we ready to proceed for trial? MR. WESTON: Your Honor, I believe I would like to ask the Court now if we could have leave to file a renewed motion for class certification. And the reason is we do [5] have a damages model and support for it. At the time that we filed our initial motion, we pro- posed a model and then later not all the facts that we needed to support that model came through the discov-ery process simply because it wasn't available in terms of the retail prices. However, we can show in a renewed motion that there is very strong support in California law for a model based on the data we do have, which is the de-fendant's wholesale data. And that was the sole reason the Court decertified the class. And I think this is something that we could do in five pages, assuming we don't need to brief any othe r issues. And that would - App. 72 THE COURT: Let me let me ask you this, Mr. Weston: Where was this evidence before? I mean, is this something that's new that you just came up upon? Help me understand. MR. WESTON: Well, we did point to it both in our summary judgment brief and in our opposition to the motion to decertify. It was hard to know - we didn't treat it in detail. It was hard to know exactly what issue the Court would find most persuasive be-cause the defendants moved to decertify in a large number of issues, not just the one the Court granted the motion upon. So I - would this not going to require any more [6] discovery? We have it. In fact, we've already briefed it a little bit, but it really is something that we have the information for, we have the support for, and it's simply a matter of providing the Court with this. And, you know, just as the Court can decertify a class at any time, I think that the Court should at least consider our argument on why the information we have now is a viable model under California precedent for remedying the harm that defendant has caused many Californians. THE COURT: All right. I'd like to hear from counsel for Nutraceutical. Mr. Hueston, what's your position with respect to this? MR. HUESTON: Well, we would oppose a re- newed motion. The record is cl osed. That's part of what App. 73 the Court pointed out, that you made a very clear point of asking - or it was made clear at the earliest point in the course of the litigation that the damages model needed to be provided. It was not provided. Of course, he can file a motion for reconsideration. That's different. That's based on the existing record. He doesn't get to renew a motion and bring in new models, figures, frankly, or anything else outside the record. We'll also note, Your Honor, there were multiple [7] reasons for denying class certification here. It was our view that the Court chose the narrowest and strongest ground. Again, that could be considered in a motion for reconsideration. That would be the only vehicle, I think, that would be appropri ate for plaintiffs at this time. THE COURT: Mr. Weston, I tend to agree. Look. You are more than entitled to file a motion for reconsideration. That's entirely your right. But, I guess, to the extent that you are contemplat- ing it, which I suspect you w ill, I think you need to fo- cus on what was in the existing record. It sounds like you are suggesting that it may have been in the record. Obviousl y, the Court took a differ- ent view. But feel free to file yo ur motion for reconsidera- tion, if that's what you desire. But, obviously, Mr. Hueston will be looking very carefully to make sure that it is not a new motion with newly - that tends to App. 74 bring out, at least from your perspective, some newly discovered evidence. So you are absolutely entitled to so, and you can file your motion for reconsider ation. I suggest you do it sooner than later because I had some proposed dates that I wanted to pose out to the parties because we've got cross motions for summary judgment, a pretrial conference, and a [8] trial date. My proposal was to have summary judgment hear- ing on April 27th of 2015 with a pretrial conference in May - May 18th of 2015, and then a trial date of June. Throwing out those dates, do any of those dates cause any major complications for either side? MR. WESTON: Your Honor, I would just say that we will want to file a motion for reconsideration. And in that respect, I think it makes sense to just hold summary judgment and trial in abeyance without a particular date unless the Court is confident it can rule in, you know, on - within a specified time on it. And that's just in part because our summary judg- ment motion, for instance, you know, is predicated on there being a certified class. And we would have to at least supplement that at least a little bit in order to transform it into a individual summary judgment mo-tion. THE COURT: All right. Mr. Hueston, what is your position with respect to the proposed dates? App. 75 MR. HUESTON: Yes, Your Honor. The only one that gives me heartburn would be trial. I currently have a trial in Hawaii in June and then - THE COURT: You would rather be in Los Angeles than Hawaii? MR. HUESTON: Actually, I would rather be in [9] Los Angeles. It's not a good place to try a case out there, in Honolulu. I have one in June and another in late July. The earliest I could set a trial date would be September. They're both long trials. So at at this point, Your Honor, I would agree with plaintiffs' suggestion to hold scheduling in abeyance on motion for summary judgment, pretrial, and trial, if we could do so. THE COURT: Okay. All right. We can do that. When do you anticipate filing your motion for re- consideration? And I don't mean to put you on the clock. I am just curious as to , sort of, the timing. Is this going to be in the next tw o to three weeks? Next week? Because I understand the parties' position about per- haps not setting the trial date, but I just don't want this to linger on in the meantime. MR. WESTON: We certainly could have it within three weeks of today, if not sooner. If the Court prefers, we could rush it and get it done in two weeks without any real issue. App. 76 THE COURT: All right. I think in light of what you said - you have alluded to the fact that you believe that there is evidence - either existed in the existing motion. Seems to me you could get something on file no later than March the 12th, which would give you ten days [10] from today. I don't think that's unreasonable. This way we can sort of resolve this issue and get this case back on cal- endar. MR. WESTON: Your Honor, that would be fine. March 12th is no problem. THE COURT: All right. So the motion for re- consideration will be filed on or before March 12th. And then the Court will then set dates once it's had an opportunity to review the motion. I anticipate, obviously, because the Court dealt a lot of time into the existing motion, I don't think there will be as big a lag time trying to resolve this issue be-cause we are sort of versed and attuned it to, but we'll set some dates after the motion for reconsideration. MR. WESTON: Thank you, Your Honor. And I just - if it's all right with the Court, can we refer back to our prior class certification brief, sort of incorpo-rated them - THE COURT: It's part of the record; so ab- solutely. App. 77 MR. WESTON: That will just make the briefing a lot shorter. And I think that covers every- thing. THE COURT: All right. Anything else from defense? [11] MR. HUESTON: No. Thank you, Your Honor. THE COURT: Thank you both for coming in. And I'll look forward to getting your papers on or be- fore March the 12th. MR. HUESTON: Thank you, Your Honor. THE COURT: All right.
