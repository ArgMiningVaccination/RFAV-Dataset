The Einstein Expert P anel, named to inspire the experts to challenge convention and \" think big,\" was convened by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, with the support of the Center for Health and Justice at Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC). SAMHSA convened th e panel as an important listening opportunity for Federal agencies concerned with improving systems and outcomes for people with substance use issues involved in the criminal justice system. Through th e Einstein process , SAMHSA conven es teams of experts to discuss and brainstorm the future of policy and practice on key topics at the intersection of behavioral health treatment and justice. The October 2011 panel was the second Einstein panel. The first was held in May 2011, whe n a similar group of experts kicked off the Einstein process by discussing the broad topic of integration of behavioral health treatment in criminal justice settings. The first meeting was designed to look at the big picture: the major dynamics, forces, and knowledg e that have led to the current state of policy and practice. The October 2011 meeting was the first subject -specific panel. Subsequent meetings will be premised around specific topics or challenges that will shape the future of behavioral health care and criminal justice. Preparation The October 2011 Einstein panel consisted of substance abuse and mental health treatment providers, criminal justice practitioners, researchers, State justice policy administrators, and representatives of key constituent groups, each with decades of service in their respective fields. The group was facilitated by Melody M. Heaps, President Emeritus of Illinois TASC. Prior to the meeting, the Center for Health and Justice at TASC, with the assistance of Dr. Robert Schwartz and Dr. Shannon Gwin Mitchell, disseminated background information to panel members , including the following : A summary of the research on MAT in justice settings, along with a listing of current but as yet unpublished research projects A summary of attitudinal surveys on the use of MAT in justice settings Einstein Expert Panel: Medication -Assisted Treatment and the Criminal Justice System 2 A listing of justice programs that currently have MAT programs using the medications Vivit rol or S uboxone A portfolio of key relevant articles In preparation for the meeting, the group was asked to consider issues, challenges, and principles that arise around the adoption of MAT in justice settings. These topics would form the framework f or the 2-day panel discussion. This document presents the overarching issues discussed during the meeting. The broad and forward -thinking nature of the discussion and resulting consensus points are intended as themes for consideration by criminal justice officials, substance abuse treatment providers, clinical staff, policymakers, legislative bodies, budget authorities, and practitioners working with individuals with substance use and behavioral health disorders who are involved in the criminal justice sy stem. Future issues to consider are highlighted throughout this document, indicating issues, examples, or perspectives the panel deemed relevant to the issue of MAT in justice settings but beyond the immediate purview of the panel or the limits of the pane l process. Presentations To start the discussion, panel members heard presentations on the topics discussed below . As the presentations were given, panelists offered information and observations , which were incorporated in the sections that follow. Where a formal presentation was made, it has been included in the appendices to this report. Presentation 1: The Science of MAT . Dr. Robert Schwartz, Medical Director, Friends Research Institute, provided an overv iew of medications currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the U nited States for the treatment of alcohol dependence (e.g., acamprosate, A ntabuse, oral and extended release naltrexone) and opioid addiction ( e.g., buprenorphine, methadone , oral and extended release naltrexone). Highlights included the following : Pharmacological actions of and differences between the available medications (including comparison of opioid agonist versus antagonist effects) Relative ef fectiveness of different medications in reducing alcohol and drug use, HIV risk, and potentially associated criminal behaviors Typical settings in which these medications are used and the need to individualize the length of time used and the expected outco mes Characteristics of effective use of medications Einstein Expert Panel: Medication -Assisted Treatment and the Criminal Justice System 3 Presentation 2: MAT and Diversion. Loren T. Miller, Chief of Liaison and Policy Section, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) , and Denise Curry, Deputy Direct or, Office of Diversion Control, DEA, presented statistics on the prevalence and challenges of diversion of legitimately prescribed medications into illicit distribution channels. Highlights included the following : Overview of the Narcotic Treatment Program registration process, including a breakdown of the roughly 1.4 million current registrants , up from 480,000 in 1973 Overview of security, recordkeeping , and inspection protocols Common recordkeeping challenges regarding inventories, dispensation, thefts or losses, and disposal Expansion in the prescription of buprenorphine and its related association with expansion in illicit diversion Overview of the potential factors that may lead to diversion of medications in justice settings, including the transient na ture of patients and practitioners, guest dosing, disposal of unused medications, unauthorized access, security , and recordkeeping Presentation 3: Attitudes About MAT . Mark Parrino, President of the American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Depende nce, noted that the National Institutes of Health, the Office of National Drug Control Policy , and the World Health Organization support the use of medications in the treatment of opioid dependence in the criminal justice system. He and Dr. Josiah Rich of Miriam Hospital at Brown University Medical Center presented the preliminary results of a nationwide survey of attitudes toward agonist therapy in drug courts, including responses from drug court administrators and judges from 47 State s. Highlights include d the following : Prescription opioids were more likely than heroin to be cited as the primary opioid problem facing drug courts (61 percent versus 32 percent). In 50 percent of the drug courts, agonist therapies (methadone or buprenorphine) were not permitted under any circumstances. Responses d emonstrated high levels of uncertainty about or knowledge of the positive and negative effects of both buprenorphine and methadone. In most State s, only one or two drug courts responded to the survey. Considering the wide variety in style, structure , and protocols in drug courts from State to State and jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the survey should be understood as an indicator of conditions that may exist within drug courts, but it is not statistically indicative of drug courts universally. Presentation 4: MAT and Legal Issues. Sally Friedman, Legal Director of the Legal Action Center, provided an overview of a recently published paper examining the legality of criminal Einstein Expert Panel: Medication -Assisted Treatment and the Criminal Justice System 4 justice agencies' denial of access to medications to treat opiate addiction. Highlights included the following : Overview of the two primary Federal statutes that could be used to challenge the denial of access to MAT : the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Case law establishing that these laws apply to public entities such as courts, prisons and jails, and community corrections Case law establishing that opiate -addicted individuals w ho need or receive MAT are \"individuals with a disability\" and therefore protected under these laws Case law describing criteria for discriminatory denial of treatment Why prisons and jails that deny access to MAT could be violat ing the 8th and 14th amen dments to the U.S. Constitution Presentation 5: MAT and National Policy. Dr. Timothy Condon from the Center on Alcoholism, Substance Abuse, and Addiction at the University of New Mexico , formerly with the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the National Ins titute on Drug Abuse, described some of the key issues currently affe cting the highest levels of drug policy. Highlights included the following : The economic crises faced by individual State s, as exemplified by a recent conversation in which Dr. Condon was asked how many people one could \"get out of jail\" by investing money in treatment The pending impact of health care reform and the many unknowns regarding who will be eligible and what will be covered The reality that prescription drugs may be an even greater problem than heroin, and the need to train clinicians in the proper prescribing of opioids for pain Dr. Condon stated that the 2010 -2011 National Drug Control Strategy, p ublished by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, endorses the increased use of MAT as clinically appropriate . Historical and Current Context Before addressing the formal questions posed around MAT , the expert panel first looked at the historical and current context. Recognizing that larger dynamics are at play, the panel convey ed the importance of understanding those dynamics to fully realize the potential for MAT in justice settings. Historica l Context. The panel recognized that the substance abuse treatment field emerged out of a social model. While science and technology are helping to catalyze the medical model for the field, the personal/social/moral perspective toward individuals abusing drugs or alcohol is still p revalent in our society. Indeed, many existing drug laws emerged out of a public Einstein Expert Panel: Medication -Assisted Treatment and the Criminal Justice System 5 perception of personal and moral failure, and attitudinal surveys reflect that some policymakers, justice practitioners, and even treatment providers may still attach a moral stigma to the problem of drug or alcohol use, despite the great advances made in neuroscience, genetics , and pharmacotherapy. The panel also recognized that the medical model continues to evolve. The last decade has seen signific ant advancements and improvements in our understanding of how drugs and alcohol affect the brain; our understanding of the physiological, social, and behavioral aspects of treatment and recovery ; and tools and treatment methodologies to aid in clinical ass essment and treatment. This knowledge is continually expanding, and the treatment field is adopting new processes to measure, refine , and improve its effectiveness. However , the field is still maturing, and part of that maturation process is the commitment to science and research, and the dissemination and adoption of evidence -based practices as they develop. The transition from a moral perspective to a scientific perspective may contribut e to a \"power to cure\" mentality that panel members see in some justice practitioners and treatment providers. With other medical conditions, the treating clinician provides guidance, sets expectations, and where appropriate prescribes medication, but the onus of \"success\" is on the patient. In the justice context, the supervising justice authority or the treating professional may assume too much of the responsibility to \"cure\" the problem or the person, may assume that a cure is the only positive outcome, and may even attach consequences for outcomes that fall short of a cure. Finally, the panel acknowledged that racial disproportionality remains rampant in justice systems, and that there is a racial and socioeconomic perspective on substance use, justice, and public safety that cannot be ignored but is beyond the purview of this panel discussion . Current Context. The panel focused on two major dynamics driving behavioral health treatment policy and practice: recovery orientation and individualized care. Recovery orientation , exemplified by SAMHSA's recovery -oriented syste m of care emphasis, indicates that available support resources could be aligned to the particular needs of the patient to best pursue recovery, including education, housing, family and life skills, case management, job training, peer mentoring, and others. The panel acknowledged, however, that \"recovery\" has different meanings to different people . Ultimately , how recovery is defined and how the role of recovery is indicated at different stages of justice involvement will dictate the level of buy -in and expe ctations for outcomes for the individual and for justice and community stakeholders. Individualized care recognizes that patients ' circumstances and clinical needs are different, and that the best outcomes will be achieved when services are aligned with n eeds. Individualized care also includes a patient choice component, wherein the patient is presented with treatment options and expectations and has a voice in the course of treatment selected. The panel acknowledged that individualized care is not always consistent with the criminal justice process or philosophy ; options may be limited by availability, funding, or the justice mandate. Some justice clients have antisocial disorders, and drug abuse treatment may not change the criminal Einstein Expert Panel: Medication -Assisted Treatment and the Criminal Justice System 6 behavior. Effort must be made to define individualized care in justice settings, combining a proportionate justice response with the best opportunity for rehabilitation and a return to stability in the community. Implementation C hallenges. The panel discussed trends and challe nges around implementation of new ideas or methodologies. While the field is maturing, there is a tendency to overrely on replication of new models . What works for one group of clients at one stag e of justice involvement does not necessarily work (and in f act may even be contraindicated) for other clients at other stages of justice involvement. This challenge is compounded when the justice system overrelies on a specific treatment modality to achieve its public safety goals. The most obvious example is the reliance on residential treatment to best supervise and manage community corrections populations. R esearch is critical to overcoming these barriers, as it can be used to set appropriate expectations and inform the use or nonuse of specific treatment method ologies. The panel noted that drug laws may not be keeping pace with changing attitudes and public policy. For example , a New Jersey law mandated 6 months of residential treatment for anyone wishing to avoid a mandatory minimum sentence for a school zone offense. Ten years of advocacy were required to change that law. Similarly, a Rhode Island law made syringe possession a felony offense, mandating 5 years of prison per syringe. The panel articulated the need for a deliberate review of, and amendments to, laws, administrative rules , and other policies that pose barriers to recovery -oriented, individualized care , and the use of MAT . The panel spoke at length about the need to understand culture and context when communicating with justice system stakeholders about recovery. Some may be persuaded by research, while others may prefer a holistic approach. The panel discussed the need to seek the perspective of justice system stakeholders and use language that reflects a desire to achieve success for them and for the client s who come through the system . Finally, the panel acknowledged the need to work with relevant Federal agencies as collaborative partners, not barriers, on both a programmatic and funding level. Funding, restrictions , and program requirements are all major factors in the development of local programs. Local stakeholders can be actively engaged with Federal agencies to help identify needs, set priorities, and discuss what is possible at given funding levels. Issues Specific to MAT. The panel acknowledged that MAT should not be presented as a cure - all but rather as a tool to help achieve public safety and personal recovery goals. MAT is best understood as \"treatment including medication where appropriate\" and not a compartmentalized program. Medication can assist individuals in reducing or ceasing their alcohol or drug use , thereby achiev ing a level of normalcy and stability that allows them to consider and pursue recovery, including other services. At the same time, by reducing opioid Einstein Expert Panel: Medication -Assisted Treatment and the Criminal Justice System 7 and/or alcoho l use, drug -related criminal behavior will decrease.1 However, many opioid - dependent individuals are polydrug users ; while MAT may be useful in treating opiate or alcohol dependence , other drug use will still need to be treated appropriately with psychosoc ial approaches. For justice systems, the panel identified the need to act as educators. As identified in the attitudinal surveys, there still are varying levels of acceptance of MAT in justice settings, and even where it has been accepted, appropriate expectations, goals , and planning need to be incorporated. Affordable Care Act . As a separate consideration, the panel discussed the pending provisions of the Affordable Care Act that will be implemented beginning in 2014. Dr. Mady Chalk, Director of the Treatment Research Institute, Center for Policy Analysis and Research, said estimates suggest that 6 -10 million new people with substance abuse or mental health disorders will be covered under the new laws , and up to 60 percent of individuals with criminal justice involvement will be newly covered. The extent of benefits covered under Medicaid expansion or the new health exchanges is unclear, as there is likely to be wide variability across States . There will be an essentia l benefits package that includes behavioral health treatment, but coverage for MAT is unclear. There will also be changes in service delivery structures and partners, as federally qualified health centers and health homes become active partners in care man agement. The overarching theme of this discussion was the need to be vigilant about and, where possible , involved in State -level conversations about these issues. Question 1: What are the biggest issues and challenges around adoption of MAT in the justice context? The panel identified the following issues and challenges: Communication and M essaging. One fundamental challenge is articulat ing MAT's effective ness at achieving both public safety and personal recovery goals. Pure reliance on research and science, no matter how valid, may not be convincing and may be viewed by some as opinion . There are also many pervading myths around medications, such as the inaccurate belief that FDA has never approved methadone for treatment of opiates . (A SAMHSA TIP on MAT indicates in a table that methadone was not approved by FDA; this should be corrected in the next printing.) Myths can be addressed through education about how medications work and the ir benefits and downsides . The panel suggested that any communication with stakeholder s should 1 National Treatment Improvement Evaluation Study (NTIES) Findings on Changes in Criminal Behavior.

URL: https://www.ncjrs.gov/nties97/crime.htm Einstein Expert Panel: Medication -Assisted Treatment and the Criminal Justice System 8 start by identifying mutual goals, engaging them about helping them to do their jobs more effectively, and helping to identify the medications that are most effective at achieving their mutual goals based on the target population. There is a need to acknowledge that all medications have side effects, and there are problems such as diversion of medication from legitimate treatment programs to the black market. S ome of the burden of solving these issues falls on prescribers. The c hallenges are not sufficient to reject medications entirely given their proven benefits. Furthermore, research has shown that the shortage of medication availability in the community for the treatment of opioid dependence contributes to diversion by creating a market for opioid users who wish to reduce or stop opioid use but cannot or w ill not access formal treatment. Thus, paradoxically, increasing access to treatment in the community and in jails and prisons could lead to a reduction in diversion by reducing market demand. Finally, the current language around MAT may be counterproductive to the goals of pursuing broader adoption. Medications have been proven effective an d are approved for use in the United States, and yet \" MAT \" implies that medication helps the treatment but is not the actual treatment itself and hence can be considered optional. As a comparison, people do not consider insulin to be medication- assisted diabetes treatment, but rather medication used in the treatment of diabetes . The implication is a much stronger corollary between the medication and the desired treatment outcome. Other exa mples include the phrase \"behavioral health ,\" which implies personal responsibility, or inherently negative terms such as \"dirty drug screen\" or calling people \"offenders\" (or ex -offenders) even after their sentence has been served. Evolution of the langua ge will be an essential aspect of advancing the field. Financing. With significant changes in public and third- party funding associated with health care reform, there is a strong need for Federal agencies to facilitate communication with State s to understand pending policy or appropriation changes in possible funding mechanisms (e.g. , Medicaid, block grants ), and particularly proposed benefits packages and eligibility for special populations (e.g., criminal justice) or specific modalities such as MAT. Workforce I ssues. Counseling staff will need training in the use of existing medications for the treatment of alcohol and drug dependence and in new medications and vaccines that may be approved in the future. When implemented in counseling programs, m edication s may increase treatment retention, provide stability , and help clients resist cravings. Counselors may therefore be able to spend less time in sessions dealing with \"trigger management,\" potentially freeing them to work with patients more directl y on accessing recovery support services. This type of change is overwhelmingly positive, but it does suggest a need to retrain clinical staff to focus on areas they may not have had the capacity to address previously . Continuity of C are. Transition into, through, and out of justice supervision may prove particularly problematic for individuals on medication. Some components of the system may elect to allow the continuation of prescribed medication while other s may require the individual to stop treatment. Maintenance of prescribed medication from arrest to Einstein Expert Panel: Medication -Assisted Treatment and the Criminal Justice System 9 For Future Consider ation The panel acknowledged that the manufacturers of medications may position medications competitively, and that not all medications are available in all jurisdictions. Manufacturers, therefore, need to be active cooperative partners in the planning and implementation process to promote the greatest possible adoption of the largest number of medication choices appropriate for the target population . incarceration , probation, prison, and community corrections requires an understanding of the use of medications, communication and coordination between agencies at each juncture, and a commitment to continuity of care. Movement from system dependence to independence in the community requires education, access, and in some instances enrollment in publicly funded care. Throughout the process, MAT must be seen as one of many tools in a recovery -oriented strategy that can be utilized in tandem with traditional behavioral health treatment. Standards. Currently there are no set standards regarding MAT access and care in justice settings. Research, education, and best practices are needed to guide the develo pment and implementation of MAT models for each juncture of justice involvement, considering their challenges and outcome expectations. Policy and Legal B arriers. In many jurisdictions, statutory, administrative , and other policy and practice barriers may restrict or deny access to MAT. Examples have been described above, such as mandatory minimum penalties, disallowance of medication as a condition of supervision or participation, use of one medication but not another, and termination rather than suspensi on of public benefits. Question 2: What are the principles of incorporating MAT in justice settings? The panel focus ed on high -level strategic considerations rather than specific components of incorporating MAT within justice settings . Clinical care and justice response driven by the circumstances and needs of the client and case : Where possible, there should be a range of treatment options, including MAT, and the supervising justice entity and client should be informed about those options and their attendant expectations so the client and physician can make an informed choice about the most appropriate medication and care plan. Clinical decisionmaking guided by the treating physician, in collaboration with justice stakeholders : At no point should mandates for a client to consume or terminate medications be levied without the input of the client and treating physician , who can assess the benefits and/or detriments of doing so. Similarly, individuals already receiving MAT should not be in eligible for a particular program or service. At the same time, the treating physician must work with the Einstein Expert Panel: Medication -Assisted Treatment and the Criminal Justice System 10 For Future Consideration The panel identified the following considerations as relevant but beyond its immediate charge and purview: Multidrug use. Many drug users are polydrug users, and medication may only be effective at dealing with opiate or alcohol dependence. Comorbidity. Similarly, many drug users present for co -occurring mental illness. Medication may assist in stabilizing these individuals to more optimally pursue treatment. Legitimate acute pain. Some individuals may present for acute pain for which opioid or other medications may be prescribed. relevant justice stakeholders to ensure that clinical decisions don't frustrate the supervisory and public safety go als of the justice mandates. Justice decisionmaking without advocating one medication over another : Wherever possible, justice systems should have access to the full array of FDA -approved medications to meet the circumstances and needs of patients . Those c ircumstances and needs may change, so flexibility is crucial. Clinical assessments and tre atment recommendations made independently, based on the presenting needs of the individual : These deliberations should not be influenced by the possibility of self -referral (assessing agent s refer individual s to their employer for treatment, thereby creating a conflict of interest) or by the nature or tenor of justice supervision. When an independent assessment or recommendation agent is not available, the role must be performed by certified alcohol and drug abuse clinicians at minimum. Continuity of care, with psychosocial treatment and especially with MAT , as people come into contact with and move through the justice system and reintegrate back into the community : Recognizing that the justice system is not a true system but rather an amalgam of entities with different mandates, requirements , and funding streams, continuity of care requires deliberate coordination and partnership, identification of gaps, and alignment of resources to fill those gaps. Recognition that illicit diversion of medication s is an ongoing justice concern: To minimize the potential illicit diversion of medications, there may be a need for changes in policies, rules, recordkeeping, and patient testing. It must also be recognized that continuity of care may help solve diversion issues by eliminating medicatio n doses that go unused or missing during transitions from one stage of justice involvement to another, and by prevent ing demand, which in part drives the diversion market. Community corrections, jails , and prisons will likely have contracted medical provid ers to work closely with and monitor patients and keep the justice system informed as to compliance and progress in treatment. Probation or parole systems may not have contracted providers for MAT, which could yield a lack of communication, verification of care and compliance, testing , and continuity. It is important therefore that dedicated MAT providers work collaboratively with probation/parole and the psychosocial treatment provider. This will maintain fidelity of the individualized treatment plan. If there is no ability to contract with a provider, probation or parole systems might establish a Einstein Expert Panel: Medication -Assisted Treatment and the Criminal Justice System 11 collaborative relationship with a few selected physicians for referral, assessment, testing (to confirm consumption) , and treatment. Question 3: What specific themes underlie the utilization of MAT in justice settings? The culmination of the expert panel was the development of key themes that underlie the utilization of MAT in criminal ju stice settings . The panel began by articulating the problem: the use of MAT for substance abuse and dependence is not fully accepted in the criminal justice system, compromising both clinical outcomes and public safety. The panel then articulated a vision: persons will have access to clinically appropriate treatment, including medications, across the justice system, thereby promoting and facilitating public health, retention in treatment , and recovery support with the promise of improvement in public safety . These persons will have ongoing access to treatment beyond their justice involvement. The panel also identified the current opportunity: with many State s facing unprecedented fiscal crises, MAT offers the potential for improved treatment and rehabilitative outcomes for opiate - and alcohol -involved offenders ; improved public safety ; and decreased reliance on costly enforcement, supervision , and incarceration. H ealth care reform, including Medicaid expansion , could dramatically increase the number of peopl e with insurance coverage and the funding for treatment and recovery -oriented services , of which medications may be a significant component. The panel grouped key themes into six categories . Culture and Communication Professionals in the treatment, justice, and government fields could\u2014 Foster efforts to bridge cultural gaps between treatment and justice, including differences in mandates, language, expertise, priorities , and philosophies, seeking instead to identify shared goals of recovery, rehabilitation , and public safety. Acknowledge that different points in the system require different approaches and protocols. What works at one point may be unsuitable at another point. For example, Antabuse is an antagonist for alcohol use, causing a negative reaction when a person drinks alcohol. For a person sentenced to a long prison term, it would be inappropriate for an alcoholism treatment plan to include Antabuse, but it would be appropriate for a reentry program. Provide education about medication , common misconceptions , evidence of benefit, and effectiveness for certain conditions and settings. Einstein Expert Panel: Medication -Assisted Treatment and the Criminal Justice System 12 For Future Consider ation Based on the paper and presentation from the Legal Action Center, the panel acknowledged that Americans With Disabilities Act issues and liability exist for structures that refuse medication to a class of people. While it was beyond the scope of the panel to recommend pursuit of remedies along legal lines, the panel acknowledged other situations where Federal case law and consent decrees have driven statutes, policy, and practice as a result of a jurisdiction's failure to accommodate the needs of its justice population. Promoting Access Professionals in the treatment, justice, and government fields could \u2014 Develop methodologies and structures to encourage independent, individualized clinical assessment , which will inform appropriate clinical and supervisory strategies. Encourage State s to review health and justice legislation and administrative rules governing access to care and medication and take immediate steps to remove barriers . Identify and resolve practical challenges, such as the need to clearly articulate possible approaches for DEA approval for providing opioid agonist treatment in jails and prisons , and to disseminate information to interested parties. Educate individuals and families on the use of different types of medication, their benefits, and long -term considerations to engage the whole family in care decisionmaking and recovery. Financing Models Professionals in the treatment, justice, and government fields could\u2014 Identify existing and potential financing mechanisms and articulate them to State s and to the treatment and justice fields. Incentivize continuity of care by recognizing and encouraging the use of financing models for seamless transition of medications and prescriptions into, through, and out of the justice system. Examine rate structures for m edication -assisted therapies in current justice treatment settings and settings that may emerge under health care reform, such as health homes or federally qualified health centers. Advocate to health care reform planners at the Federal and State level s for the inclusion of MAT as part of the essential benefits package to cover criminal justice populations. Encourage State s to analyze cost savings from MAT and the reinvestment of those savings in expansion of recovery supports. Einstein Expert Panel: Medication -Assisted Treatment and the Criminal Justice System 13 Information Technology Professionals in the treatment, justice, and government fields can promote health information technology and its role in information sharing between criminal justice and substance use treatment systems . Implementation: Strategy, Structure , and Relationships Professionals in the treatment, justice, and government fields could seek to promote and facilitate MAT implementation in the following ways: Promote continuity of care, especially in and through jails, by providing links and ready access to DEA's registration and medication management process, and by developing and disseminating guidelines for State s regarding MAT within de tention centers. Promote and facilitate local planning processes around MAT by providing training, cross - training , and technical assistance to State s and local governments regarding MAT , including basic education, guidelines for service coordination, new partnerships under health care reform, information sharing and technology, best practices for continuity of care, education around tolerance and overdose prevention, and other core clinical and practical considerations. Identify and articulate treatment workforce issues and needs that will result from the implementation of MAT , such as basic education and mythbusting, changes in counseling strategy, setting of proper clinical expectations, and transition from justice system dependence. Federal registries of effective practices could include all FDA- approved medications for alcohol, tobacco , and opioid dependence and recommend that State s include those medications in their formularies. Public Safety and Recovery Public safety and health are overarching considerations . Recovery -oriented planning positions individuals for compliance with their justice mandates and ultimately for health, stability , and productivity in their communities. The criminal justice system has jurisdiction over the sanctions and supervision of the individual, and within that context, clinical recommendations can be made to the justice system that reinforce the individual 's responsibility for his or her recovery.

There are at present three medications approved by the FDA for the treatment of opiate dependence, including methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. Buprenorphine is approved in two formulations, a tablet containing only buprenorphine and a second in a tablet or in a film containing buprenorphine and naloxone (to induce opiate withdrawal if misused intravenously). Naltrexone is approved in two formulations, a tablet taken orally and an extended-release formulation taken intramuscularly which can be administered monthly. At present there are also three medications approved by the FDA for the treatment of alcohol dependence. These include disulfiram (antabuse), acamprosate, and naltrexone (the later in both tablet and extended release formulation). The efficacy of these medications in reducing opiate and alcohol misuse, respectively, has been proven with the same rigor required by the FDA for approval of medications for the treatment of all other medical disorders including cancer, diabetes, and schizophrenia. Thus, randomized clinical trials of all of these medications (with the possible exception of antabuse) have shown superior reductions in alcohol or heroin use for the medication as compared to the placebo assigned groups. The clinical trials research conducted with these medications for alcohol (except antabuse) or opiate dependence have also been subject to rigorous and standardized meta-analyses, which use statistic techniques to combine the results across clinical trials. Such an approach is widely used in evidence-based medicine across diseases and treatments. The most widely accepted of these metanalyses are conducted by the international Cochrane Collaboration. Medications for alcohol and opiate addiction have been the subject of several Cochrane reviews. The Cochrane reviews of opiate medication treatments were conducted comparing methadone to placebo or no treatment (Mattick et al., 2009), buprenorphine compared to placebo or to methadone (Mattick et al., 2008); oral naltrexone (Minozzi et al., 2011) and sustained release naltrexone. 3 Methadone compared to placebo or no methadone examined 11 studies with 1,969 participants and concluded that methadone is effective and retains patients in treatment and decreases heroin use better than treatments without methadone or other opiate agonist treatment. Buprenorphine compared to placebo or to methadone was examined in 24 studies with 4,497 participants. The review concluded that buprenorphine is an effective treatment in retaining patients in treatment and decreasing heroin use as compared to placebo but may not be as effective as methadone when the latter is used in adequate doses. These reviews and other research has found that patient outcomes with opiate agonist treatment (methadone or buprenorphine) are dose and time dependent, in that higher doses are generally more effective in suppressing heroin use and that longer time in treatment also is associated with better outcomes. In terms of opiate antagonist treatment, the review of oral naltrexone examined 13 studies with 1,158 participants and concluded that oral naltrexone is not superior to placebo or other treatments unless there was coercion to take the medication, in which case it was superior in terms of treatment retention and abstinence. Thus, oral naltrexone was not considered at that point a treatment proven superior to other types of treatment. Finally, the Cochrane Review of sustained release naltrexone was conducted prior to the conclusion of the pivot trial conducted in Russia (Krupitsky et al., 2011) which led to its FDA- approval for the prevention of relapse to opiate dependence. Thus it was not possible to conduct a metanalysis of the effectiveness of sustained release naltrexone because of only one clinical trial had been concluded at the point of the report's publication. In addition to efficacy studies (randomized trials), there are numerous research publications from large-scale, multi-site longitudinal studies conducted over the past 4 decades in typical community-based treatment programs which demonstrate that methadone treatment is highly effective in reducing drug use (Hubbard et al., 1997; Simpson & Sells, 1992; Sells et al., 1976) and criminal behavior (Simpson & Sells, 1992; Sells et al., 1976) criminal behavior during treatment. The Cochrane reviews of medication treatments for alcohol dependence were conducted comparing acamprosate vs. placebo or other active treatments (Rosner et al., 2010) and naltrexone vs. placebo or other active treatments (Rosner et al., 2010). There were 24 randomized trials of acamprosate with 6,915 participants. The authors concluded that 4 acamprosate was a safe and effective treatment in supporting continuous abstinence. The review of opiate antagonists (oral and sustained release naltrexone) examined 50 studies with 7,793 participants and concluded that naltrexone is safe and effective treatment to reduce the amount and frequency of drinking. The purpose of this report is to present abstracts of studies published in the scientific literature available on PUB MED of clinical research with medications to treat alcohol and opiate dependence that focused solely on individuals in the US criminal justice system. The abstracts are taken verbatim and were intentionally not subject to our interpretation. The report includes a reference list of cited studies for those who wish more information about the methodology and results of the individual papers. Since there are no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of cocaine and methamphetamine dependence, clinical research for those drugs is not included in this report. In addition, the report contains the investigators' abstracts of ongoing research studies in the US criminal justice system, which have not yet been subject to publication. The report is divided into two distinct parts (A. Published Abstracts and B. Abstracts of Ongoing Research). Each of these two distinct parts is further divided by studies of (1) opiate dependence treatment and (2) alcohol dependence treatment. Finally, opiate and alcohol dependence are divided by locus of service in the criminal justice system: Community Supervision (probation, parole, work release and drug court), Jails and Prisons. In general, where there are multiple reports from the same study, only the final abstract is captured below. A. Published Abstracts I .Opiate Dependence Treatment a. Community Supervision i. Brahen LS, Henderson RK, Capone T, Kordal N. (1984) Naltrexone treatment in a jail work-release program. J Clin Psychiatry, 45(9 Pt 2):49-52. Inmates with a history of opiate addiction have traditionally been excluded from jail work-release programs because of their high likelihood of returning to drug use. In 1972, a new jail work-release program was begun in the Nassau County (New York) Jail, to 5 which addicted inmates, who had formerly been excluded automatically, could request admission if they took the opiate blocking agent naltrexone. Inmates received naltrexone twice a week and had routine urine checks for drugs of abuse and an alcohol breath test when indicated. Psychological and vocational testing and weekly psychotherapy sessions were provided. For those no longer incarcerated, the adjacent hospital outpatient clinic was available for naltrexone treatment. Naltrexone has proved to be a completely effective opiate blocking agent with no major side effects in 691 patients over a 10-year period. ii. Brecht ML, Anglin MD, Wang JC. (1993) Treatment effectiveness for legally coerced versus voluntary methadone maintenance clients. Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse. 19(1):89-106. Analyses examined whether addicts reporting themselves coerced into drug abuse treatment by actions of the criminal justice system differed from voluntary admissions in their response to treatment, and whether such responsiveness varied across gender or ethnicity. Six hundred eighteen methadone maintenance clients admitted to programs in six southern California counties were categorized into high, moderate, and low legal coercion levels. Multivariate analysis of variance procedures for repeated measures (before, during, and after initial treatment episode) were used to test relevant hypotheses. Dependent variables included criminal justice system contact, criminal activities, drug and alcohol involvement, and measures of social functioning. Few differences within any measured domain were found among the three groups. All groups were similar in showing substantial improvement in levels of narcotics use, criminal activities, and most other behaviors during treatment with some regression in these behaviors posttreatment. Results support legal coercion as a valid motivation for treatment entry; those coerced into treatment respond in ways similar to voluntary admissions regardless of gender or ethnicity iii. Cornish JW, Metzger D, Woody GE, Wilson D, McLellan AT, Vandergrift B, O'Brien CP. probationers or parolees with a history of opioid addiction were referred by themselves or their probation/parole officer for a naltrexone treatment study. Participation was voluntary and subjects could drop out of the study at any time without adverse consequences. Following orientation and informed consent, 51 volunteers were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to a 6-month program of probation plus naltrexone and brief drug counseling, or probation plus counseling alone. Naltrexone subjects received medication and counseling twice a week; controls received counseling at similar intervals. All therapy and medication were administered in an office located adjacent to the federal probation department. Fifty-two percent of subjects in the naltrexone group continued for 6 months and 33% remained in the control group. Opioid use was significantly lower in the naltrexone group. The overall mean percent of opioid positive urine tests among the naltrexone subjects was 8%, versus 30% for control subjects (p < .05). Fifty-six percent of the controls and 26% of the naltrexone group (p < .05) had their probation status revoked within the 6-month study period and returned to prison. Treatment with naltrexone and brief drug counseling can be integrated into the Federal Probation/Parole system with favorable results on both opioid use and re-arrest rates. iv. Coviello DM, Cornish JW, Lynch KG, Alterman AI, O'Brien CP (2010). A randomized trial of oral naltrexone for treating opioid-dependent offenders. Am J Addiction, 19(5):422-32. Offenders with a history of opioid dependence are a particularly difficult group to treat. A large proportion of offenders typically relapse shortly after release from prison, commit drug-related crimes, and then are arrested and eventually re-incarcerated. Previous research demonstrated that oral naltrexone was effective in reducing opioid use and preventing recidivism among offenders under federal supervision. The 111 opioid- dependent offenders in this study were under various levels of supervision that included county and federal probation/parole, a treatment court, an alternative disposition program, and an intermediate punishment program. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 6 months of either 300 mg per week of oral naltrexone plus standard psychosocial treatment as usual (n = 56) or standard psychosocial treatment as usual (TAU) without naltrexone (n = 55). While the TAU subjects who remained in treatment used more 7 opioids than the naltrexone subjects who remained, the high dropout rate for both groups made it difficult to assess the effectiveness of naltrexone. The study provides limited support for the use of oral naltrexone for offenders who are not closely monitored by the criminal justice system. v. Desmond DP, Maddux JF. (1996) Compulsory supervision and methadone maintenance, JSAT, 13(1):79-83. Treatment outcomes of 296 subjects admitted to methadone maintenance while on probation or parole are compared to those of 314 subjects admitted without such compulsory supervision. Equivalent treatment services were offered to both groups. The pretreatment differences between groups were small except for time incarcerated. All subjects were followed for one year. The compulsory supervision group had worse outcomes with respect to retention, productive activity, and incarceration. The differences were small except for incarceration. The mean number of months incarcerated was 2.1 for the compulsory supervision group and 0.7 for the voluntary group. Of subjects discharged from treatment, a higher percentage of the compulsory supervision group was discharged because of incarceration, but a higher percentage of the voluntary group was discharged for noncompliance with program requirements. The findings do not support a policy of exclusion of opioid users from methadone maintenance because they are on probation or parole. vi. Gryczynski J, Kinlock TW, Kelly S, O'Grady K, Gordon M, Schwartz R (In press) Opioid Agonist Maintenance for Probationers: Patient-level predictors of treatment retention, drug use, and crime. Substance Abuse. This study examined outcomes and their predictors among 181 probationers enrolling in opioid agonist maintenance with methadone or LAAM. Participants were interviewed at treatment entry and 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Treatment retention and frequency of heroin use, cocaine use, and income-generating criminal activity were examined using survival and longitudinal analyses. Participants reported marked reductions in drug use and crime relative to treatment entry. A number of patient characteristics associated with 8 various outcomes were identified. The findings support engaging probationers in treatment and highlight patient factors that might influence outcomes. b. Jail-Based Treatment i. Dole V.P. Robinson J.W. Orraca J, Towns E. Searcy P. Caine E. (1969) Methadone Treatment of Randomly Selected Criminal Addicts. NEJM, 280:1372- 1375. The potential motivation of criminal addicts for methadone treatment was tested in the New York City Correctional Institute for Men. Of 165 inmates seen, all with records of five or more jail sentences, 116 (70 per cent) applied for treatment after a single interview. None of them had previously made application to the methadone program. Of 18 randomly selected from all applicants with release dates between January 1 and April 30, 1968, 12 were started on methadone before they left jail and then referred to the program for aftercare. None of them became readdicted to heroin, and nine of 12 had no further convictions during the 50 weeks of follow-up study. All of an untreated control group became readdicted after release from jail, and 15 of 16 were convicted of new crimes during the same follow-up period. ii. Magura S, Rosenblum A, Lewis C, Joseph H (1993) Effectiveness of In-Jail Methadone Maintenance. Journal of Drug Issues, 23(1):75-99. (abstract cited from: https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=153290) The main study examined inmates who were not enrolled in methadone at arrest. Eighty percent were drug injectors (usually both heroin and cocaine) who admitted committing an average of 117 property crimes and 19 violent crimes in the 6 months before being jailed. Methadone program participants' postrelease outcomes were compared with outcomes for similar addicts who received 7-day heroin detoxification in jail. Multivariate analyses indicated that program participants were more likely than controls to apply for methadone or other drug abuse treatment after release and to be in treatment at a 6.5-month followup. Moreover, being in treatment at follow-up was associated with lower drug use and crime, but rates of retention in community treatment after release 9 were modest. KEEP participants have more chronic and severe social and personal deficits than other addicts applying for treatment. The in-jail program was most effective in maintaining postrelease continuity of methadone treatment for inmates already enrolled in methadone at arrest. The process evaluation yielded several recommendations to help overcome client-centered, administrative, and systemic obstacles to improved outcomes for this difficult-to-treat population of criminally involved addicts. iii. Magura S, Lee JD, Hershberger J, Joseph H, Marsch L, Shropshire C, Rosenblum A. (2009) Buprenorphine and methadone maintenance in jail and post-release: a randomized clinical trial. Drug Alcohol Depend, 99(1-3):222-30. Buprenorphine has rarely been administered as an opioid agonist maintenance therapy in a correctional setting. This study introduced buprenorphine maintenance in a large urban jail, Rikers Island in New York City. Heroin-dependent men not enrolled in community methadone treatment and sentenced to 10-90 days in jail (N=116) were voluntarily randomly assigned either to buprenorphine or methadone maintenance, the latter being the standard of care for eligible inmates at Rikers. Buprenorphine and methadone maintenance completion rates in jail were equally high, but the buprenorphine group reported for their designated post-release treatment in the community significantly more often than did the methadone group (48% vs. 14%, p<.001). Consistent with this result, prior to release from Rikers, buprenorphine patients stated an intention to continue treatment after release more often than did methadone patients (93% vs. 44%, p<.001). Buprenorphine patients were also less likely than methadone patients to withdraw voluntarily from medication while in jail (3% vs. 16%, p<.05). There were no post- release differences between the buprenorphine and methadone groups relapse to illicit opioid use, self-reported re-arrests, self-reported severity of crime or re- incarceration in jail. After initiating opioid agonist treatment in jail, continuing buprenorphine maintenance in the community appears to be more acceptable to offenders than continuing methadone maintenance. 10 iv. McMillan GP, Lapham S, Lackey M (2008). The effect of a jail methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) program on inmate recidivism. Addiction, 103(12):2017-23. The purpose of this study was evaluate the effects of a jail-based continuation of methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) on subsequent inmate recidivism risks. The study used a prospective, longitudinal, observational design and was conducted in a large, Southwestern United States jail that continued MMT for heroin-addicted inmates on MMT at the time of booking. The sample consisted of 589 inmates booked between November 22, 2005 (the start date for the MMT program) and October 31, 2006. The outcome measure was time from release to subsequent re-booking in the jail. Predictors included binary dosing with methadone in the jail , final dose received (mg), age, gender, race/ethnicity, previous bookings and days in jail . Random effects Weibull proportional hazards models were fit to the recidivism times to estimate the impact of treatment with MMT in the jail on re-booking risks. There was no statistically significant effect of receiving methadone in the jail or dosage on subsequent recidivism risks (hazard ratio = 1.16; 95% confidence interval = 0.8-1.68). Offering jail-based MMT does not increase recidivism risks by eliminating the deterrent effect of imposed withdrawal, nor does it reduce recidivism in this high-risk population. v. Tomasino V, Swanson AJ, Nolan J, Shuman HI. (2001) The Key Extended Entry Program (KEEP): a methadone treatment program for opiate-dependent inmates. Mt Sinai J Med, 68(1):14-20. The Key Extended Entry Program (KEEP) is the only known methadone treatment program for incarcerated opiate-dependent inmates in the United States. Initiated in 1987, KEEP performs approximately 18,000 detoxifications and 4,000 admissions for methadone treatment per year. Of those methadone treatment patients discharged to the community, mostly to outpatient KEEP programs, 74-80% report to their designated program. Recidivism rates reveal that 79% of KEEP patients were incarcerated again only once or twice during a recent 11-year period. Finally, KEEP data point to the importance of dedicating slots in the community for released inmates and maintaining 11 them on sufficient blocking doses to eliminate the craving for heroin. About 6% of KEEP patients, some with mental illness have a high incidence of recidivism. c. Prison-Based Treatment i. Garcia CA, Correa GC, Viver AD, Kinlock TW, Gordon MS, Avila CA, Reyes IC, Schwartz RP. (2007) Buprenorphine-naloxone Treatment for Pre-release Opioid- dependent Inmates in Puerto Rico. J Addict Med, Sep;1(3):126-32. The following study, conducted in Puerto Rico, examined the feasibility of providing daily buprenorphine-naloxone (bup-nx) in prison and on release to 45 male inmates with histories of heroin addiction. Participants were assessed at study entry and at 1 month after release (N = 42; 93.3% follow-up rate). Treatment completers compared with noncompleters had significantly greater reductions in self-reported heroin use, cocaine use, and crime and were less likely to be opioid-positive according to urine drug testing. Despite study limitations, the short-term outcomes of this study suggest that bup-nx may contribute to reductions in readdiction to heroin and in criminal activities among re- entering male prisoners. ii. Heimer R, Catania H, Newman RG, Zambrano J, Brunet A, Ortiz AM. (2006) Methadone maintenance in prison: evaluation of a pilot program in Puerto Rico. Drug Alcohol Depend, 28;83(2):122-9. OBJECTIVES: To describe and evaluate a pilot methadone maintenance program for heroin-dependent inmates of Las Malvinas men's prison in San Juan, Puerto Rico. METHODS: Data from self-report of inmates' drug use before and during incarceration, attitudes about drug treatment in general and methadone maintenance in particular, and expectations about behaviors upon release from prison and from testing inmates' urine were analyzed comparing program patients (n=20) and inmates selected at random from the prison population (n=40). Qualitative data obtained by interviewing program staff, the correctional officers and superintendent, and commonwealth officials responsible for establishing and operating the program were analyzed to identify attitudes about methadone and program effectiveness. RESULTS: Heroin use among prisoners not in 12 treatment was common; 58% reported any use while incarcerated and 38% reported use in past 30 days. All patients in the treatment program had used heroin in prison in the 30 days prior to enrolling in treatment. While in treatment, the percentage of patients not using heroin was reduced, according to both self-report and urine testing, to one in 18 (94% reduction) and one in 20 (95% reduction), respectively. Participation in treatment was associated with an increased acceptance of methadone maintenance. Prison personnel and commonwealth officials were supportive of the program. CONCLUSIONS: The program appears to be a success, and prison officials have begun an expansion from the current ceiling of 24 inmates to treat 300 or more inmates. iii. Kinlock TW, Battjes RJ, Schwartz RP; MTC Project Team. (2005) A novel opioid maintenance program for prisoners: report of post-release outcomes. Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse, 31(3):433-54. Because prisoners with pre-incarceration heroin dependence typically relapse following release, a pilot study examined a novel opioid agonist maintenance program whereby consenting males initiated levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) treatment shortly before release from prison with opportunity to continue maintenance in the community. Treated prisoners (experimental group) were compared with controls who received community treatment referral information only and prisoners who withdrew from treatment prior to medication regarding treatment participation and community adjustment during nine months post-release. Nineteen of 20 (95%) prisoners who initiated maintenance in prison entered community treatment, compared with 3 of 31 (10%) controls, and 1 of 13 (8%) who withdrew. Moreover, 53% of experimental participants remained in community treatment at least six months, while no other participants did so. Differences in heroin use and criminal involvement between experimental participants and each of the other two groups, while not consistently statistically significant, uniformly favored the experimental group. Despite study limitations, robust findings regarding treatment attendance suggest that this intervention is highly promising. Additional published outcome data from the same study: 13 Kinlock, T.

Kinlock TW, Gordon MS, Schwartz RP, Fitzgerald TT, O'Grady KE.(2009) A randomized clinical trial of methadone maintenance for prisoners: results at 12 months postrelease. JSAT, 37(3):277-85 This study examined the impact of prison-initiated methadone maintenance at 12 months postrelease. Males with pre-incarceration heroin dependence (N = 204) were randomly assigned to (a) Counseling Only: counseling in prison, with passive referral to treatment upon release; (b) Counseling + Transfer: counseling in prison with transfer to methadone maintenance treatment upon release; and (c) Counseling + Methadone: counseling and methadone maintenance in prison, continued in the community upon release. The mean number of days in community-based drug abuse treatment were, respectively, Counseling Only, 23.1; Counseling + Transfer, 91.3; and Counseling + Methadone, 166.0 (p < .01); all pairwise comparisons were statistically significant (all ps < .01). Counseling + Methadone participants were also significantly less likely than participants in each of the other two groups to be opioid-positive or cocaine-positive according to urine drug testing. These results support the effectiveness of prison-initiated methadone for males in the United States. Further study is required to confirm the findings for women.

Kinlock TW, Gordon MS, Schwartz RP, Fitzgerald TT. (2010) Developing and Implementing a New Prison-Based Buprenorphine Treatment Program. J Offender Rehabilitation, 49(2):91-109. Research suggests that buprenorphine treatment may be a promising intervention for incarcerated individuals with heroin addiction histories. However, its implementation varies from corrections-based methadone because of unique challenges regarding dosing, administration, and regulation. Describing the first randomized clinical trial of prison- initiated buprenorphine treatment in the United States, this manuscript focuses on how these obstacles were overcome through collaboration among correctional, treatment, and research personnel. Building on the present authors' work in developing prison-based methadone treatment, and considering the lack of experience in implementing corrections-based buprenorphine programs in the United States, this manuscript may serve as a guide for interested corrections officials, treatment providers, and researchers. d. Post-release from Jail i. Cropsey KL, Lane PS, Hale GJ, Jackson DO, Clark CB, Ingersoll KS, Islam MA, Stitzer ML. (2011). Results of a pilot randomized controlled trial of buprenorphine for opioid dependent women in the criminal justice system. Drug Alcohol Depend. (in press). Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of both methadone and buprenorphine when used with opioid dependent men transitioning from prison to the community, but no studies have been conducted with women in the criminal justice (CJ) system. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of buprenorphine for relapse prevention among opioid dependent women in the CJ system transitioning back to the community. METHODS: 36 women under CJ supervision were recruited from an inpatient drug treatment facility that treats CJ individuals returning back to the community. Nine were enrolled in an open label buprenorphine arm then 27 were randomized to buprenorphine (n=15) or placebo (n=12; double-blind). All women completed baseline measures and started study medication prior to release. Participants were followed weekly, provided urine drug screens (UDS), received study medication for 12 weeks, and returned for a 3-15 month follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed for all time points through 3 month follow-up. RESULTS: The majority of participants were Caucasian (88.9%), young (M\u00b1SD=31.8\u00b18.4 years), divorced/separated (59.2%) women with at least a high school/GED education (M\u00b1SD=12\u00b11.7 years). GEE analyses showed that buprenorphine was efficacious in maintaining abstinence across time compared to placebo. At end of treatment, 92% of placebo and 33% of active medication participants were positive for opiates on urine drug screen (Chi-Square=10.9, df=1; p<0.001). However, by the three month follow-up point, no differences were found between the two groups, with 83% of participants at follow-up positive for opiates. CONCLUSIONS: Women in the CJ system who received buprenorphine prior to release from a treatment facility had fewer opiate positive UDS through the 12 weeks of treatment compared to women receiving placebo. Initiating buprenorphine in a controlled environment prior to release appears to be a viable strategy to reduce opiate use when transitioning back to the community. ii. McKenzie M, Macalino G, McClung C, Shield DC, Rich JD. (2005) Opiate replacement therapy at time of release from incarceration: Project MOD, a pilot program. J Opioid Manag, 1(3):147-51. Approximately 7 million people in the United States are in jail, in prison, or on probation or parole, many as a result of drug-related offenses. Individuals who use opiates account for a significant minority of this population. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) of opiate addiction is highly effective in reducing drug use, drug-related criminal activity, and risk of human immunodeficiency virus transmission. Recently released inmates are at particularly high risk for overdose and disease transmission. Project MOD (Managing Opioid Dependency) provides services to eliminate logistical and financial barriers to MMT entry immediately on release from incarceration. Such programs provide a promising opportunity to facilitate reentry into the community, combat disease transmission, and reduce recidivism. e. Mention of international research There are reports of findings from a randomized trial of methadone in prison in Australia (Dolan et al., 1998; 2003; 2005), or methadone vs. naltrexone implants in prison in Norway 16 (Lobmaier et al, 2008; 2010) and methadone vs. oral naltrexone in prison in Australia (Shearer et al., 2007), and quasi-experimental longitudinal studies of buprenorphine in prison in France (Levasseur et al., 2002; Marzo et al., 2009). Importantly, a recently published randomized trial of sustained release naltrexone in Russia showed the superiority of naltrexone as compared to placebo in suppressing heroin use (Krupitsky et al., 2011). f. Structured literature review (international) i. Larney S. (2010) Does opioid substitution treatment in prisons reduce injecting- related HIV risk behaviours? A systematic review. Addiction, 105(2):216-23. OBJECTIVES: To review systematically the evidence on opioid substitution treatment (OST) in prisons in reducing injecting-related human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviours. METHODS: Systematic review in accordance with guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration. Electronic databases were searched to identify studies of prison-based opioid substitution treatment programmes that included assessment of effects of prison OST on injecting drug use, sharing of needles and syringes and HIV incidence. Published data were used to calculate risk ratios for outcomes of interest. Risk ratios were not pooled due to the low number of studies and differences in study designs. RESULTS: Five studies were included in the review. Poor follow-up rates were reported in two studies, and representativeness of the sample was uncertain in the remaining three studies. Compared to inmates in control conditions, for treated inmates the risk of injecting drug use was reduced by 55-75% and risk of needle and syringe sharing was reduced by 47-73%. No study reported a direct effect of prison OST on HIV incidence. CONCLUSIONS: There may be a role for OST in preventing HIV transmission in prisons, but methodologically rigorous research addressing this question specifically is required. OST should be implemented in prisons as part of comprehensive HIV prevention programmes that also provide condoms and sterile injecting and tattooing equipment. 17 II. Alcohol Dependence Treatment a. Community Supervision i. Finigan MW, Perksin T, Zold-Kilbourn P, Parks J, String M (2011) Preliminary evaluation of extended-release naltrexone in Michigan and Missouri drug courts. JSAT 41(3): 288-293. This pilot study, a retrospective case series analysis, examined the feasibility and effectiveness of treating alcohol dependence with extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in the drug court setting. In two Michigan courts and in one Missouri court, 32 clients were treated with XR-NTX and were matched with 32 clients with standard care in an open-label, voluntary recruitment design. Treatment with XR-NTX was associated with relative risk reductions (RRRs; p = ns) of 57% fewer missed drug court sessions, a 35% reduction in the monthly ratio of positive drug and alcohol tests to total tests, and 35% fewer individuals with greater than 25% overall positive alcohol or drug tests. In the principal end-point analysis of annualized number of new arrests, 26% of standard-care clients were rearrested 8% on = 69%; p < .05). Treatment with XR-NTX appeared to be feasible and was associated with a consistently large treatment effect across multiple outcomes relevant to the drug court setting. ii. Haynes SN (1973). Contingency management in a municipally-administered antabuse program for alcoholics. J of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 4(1):31-21. A municipally-administered Antabuse program involving contingency management for chronic alcoholics is described. Chronic \"revolving door\" alcoholics were given the option of the usual jail sentence or a 1 yr probation with continued Antabuse treatment. Participants in the program were required to visit the probation office twice a week to take their Antabuse; failure to appear resulted in immediate reinstatement of the suspended jail sentence. The Antabuse program in conjunction with contingency control was effective in reducing the rate of arrests. 18 iii. Lapham SC, McMillan GP. (2011) Open-label pilot study of extended-release naltrexone to reduce drinking and driving among repeat offenders. Addict Med, Sept 5(3):163-9. OBJECTIVES: A high proportion of persons convicted of driving while impaired repeat the offense. Many continue drinking and driving, even when faced with long jail terms. Hence, they pose a serious public health threat. This preliminary study evaluated extended-release, injectable naltrexone suspension (XR-NTX) and supportive therapy in reducing (1) drinking and (2) attempts to drive after drinking among repeat driving while impaired offenders with an ignition interlock device installed in their vehicles. METHODS: Treatment-seeking volunteers received medical management therapy and 3 monthly injections of XR-NTX. We compared data on alcohol consumption, alcohol biomarkers, and interlock information before, during, and after treatment using summary measures and Sign tests. RESULTS: Of 12 consented subjects, 10 received at least 1 injection, and 7 received all 3 injections. All subjects receiving medication reported a decrease in average drinks per day (P < 0.01) and abstinent days (P = 0.02) while on treatment versus pretreatment levels. Average daily drinks decreased by 77%, from 3.0 to 0.69 (P < 0.01), during treatment with XR-NTX. Average drinks per drinking day also declined by 39% during treatment, from 6.6 to 4.0 (P = 0.04). Percent days abstinent increased by 31%, from 56.8 to 81.96 (P = 0.02), which persisted after treatment completion. Biomarkers were consistent with reduced drinking. The percentage of vehicular failures to start due to elevated breath alcohol decreased from 3.1% of tests to 1.29% of tests. CONCLUSIONS: A randomized, controlled clinical trial is needed to demonstrate the efficacy of this promising treatment for repeat offenders. iv.

Am J on Addictions, 12(2):137-143. Am J Addict. 2003 Mar-Apr;12(2):137-43. We hypothesized that court mandate would significantly enhance compliance with supervised disulfiram therapy. We conducted a twelve-week prospective study of outpatient compliance with court-ordered, monitored disulfiram treatment as compared to 19 voluntary, monitored treatment. The court ordered group (n=19) was significantly more compliant than the voluntary group (n=22). Legally mandated subjects attended an average of 87% (+/-21%) of scheduled visits, versus 42% (+/-35%) for the group without court order. Court mandate roughly doubles the compliance rate of monitored disulfir am therapy, effectively enhancing clinic attendance during the first twelve weeks of treatment.

Jails and Prisons There is no research on naltrexone or other pharmacotherapies for treating alcohol dependence among incarcerated populations (Cropsey, Villalobos & St. Clair, 2005) and we found no such abstracts on Pub Med. c. Mention of international research There is a report of a small longitudinal study of the use of probation mandated antabuse treatment for alcohol dependence in the UK (Brewer & Smith, 1983). B. Abstracts of Ongoing Studies of Pharmacotherapy in the Criminal Justice System 1. Opiate Dependence a. Community Supervision (Probation, Parole, and Drug Court Studies) i. Altice, Frederick L. HIV, Buprenorphine, and the Criminal Justice System The criminal justice system (CJS) is disproportionately impacted by people with HIV and substance use disorders, such that one quarter of all HIV+ persons nationally cycle through the CJS annually. The CJS is therefore an important place to seek and 20 empirically test interventions that address the Seek, Test, Treat and Retain (STTR) strategy to reduce community-wide HIV transmission. STTR requires that HIV is maximally suppressed, thereby resulting in decreased infectiousness. HIV+ prisoners maximally suppress HIV replication during incarceration. Unfortunately, viral suppression is lost within 3 months post-release, mostly as a consequence of relapse to opioids. Opioid dependence (OD) is present in 50% of all HIV+ prisoners nationally and 70-85% in the Northeast - OD is therefore a significant co-morbid condition requiring effective treatment. Opioid relapse is associated with decreased HAART adherence, discontinuation of HAART and increased HIV risk behaviors in the setting of viral replication - the perfect storm for HIV transmission. Effectively treating OD interrupts this relationship and has great potential to improve HIV outcomes and reduce community-wide transmission. Our team has confirmed for the first time that treating OD with buprenorphine (BPN) results in sustained viral suppression over the vulnerable 3-month post-release period. Adoption of methadone, despite its confirmed benefit, is minimal within the CJS due to philosophical, safety, regulatory and staffing concerns. BPN, a partial opioid agonist, is a more attractive option due to its safer profile and reduced regulation. Generic formulation now makes it affordable. Therefore, strategies examining the efficacy of BPN to improve adherence and retention in care, has great appeal to benefit the individual, but also to reduce HIV transmission within the community. Our specific aims are: 1) to conduct a placebo-controlled RCT of BPN for HIV+ prisoners with OD who are transitioning to the community and 2) to model the impact of BPN treatment on reducing HIV transmission. In the RCT, HIV treatment (HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4 count, ART adherence, retention in care), substance abuse (time to relapse to opioid use, % opioid negative urines, opioid craving), and HIV risk behaviors (sexual and drug-related risks) outcomes will be compared in 152 released prisoners and followed for 12 months. ii. Brow, Randall T. Treatment for Opioid Dependent Offenders This pilot study is examining the feasibility of a primary care (for suboxone treatment) and a specialist treatment (for methadone or suboxone treatment) model of treatment for 21 15 offenders who are part of two community supervision programs: Drug Court and the Treatment Alternative Program (TAP) in Dane County. The questions addressed by future larger studies based upon the current pilot-feasibility study will center around whether access to primary health care as opposed to more traditional methadone treatment services will improve the health and criminal justice outcomes for participants. The proposed study will (1) determine feasibility of monitoring Dane County Drug Treatment Court and Treatment Alternative Program participants in primary care as opposed to the usual standard of specialty care; (2) identify barriers to treatment initiation and retention; and (3) foster a multi-disciplinary collaborative treatment model. iii. Lee, Joshua D. Extended-Release Naltrexone for Opioid Relapse Prevention Following Release from Jail This protocol randomizes persons soon-to-be-released from a large urban jail to treatment with extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), a full opioid antagonist that prevents the activity of heroin and other opioids. Investigators at NYUSOM and NYC DOHMH will recruit heroin dependent persons from NYC jails who are soon-to-be-released, not accessing opioid agonist pharmacotherapy, with lowered tolerance due to incarceration, and extremely likely to relapse and risk accidental overdose at release. All N=40 participants receive a two-session, individual psychosocial intervention, Motivational Interviewing. Half (n=20) will be randomized to pre-release treatment with XR-NTX. Immediately and one month following release, participants will be offered continued psychosocial and medication-assisted treatment (naltrexone, buprenorphine, or methadone) at Bellevue Hospital, including a second XR-NTX dose among XR-NTX arm participants. The primary outcome is relapse to sustained opioid use during the first 30 days post-release. We hypothesize an XR-NTX arm will report significantly lower rates of sustained opioid relapse following release. 22 iv. O'Brien, Charles P. (PI) Treatment Study Using Depot Naltrexone Opioid addiction has remained widespread throughout the United States since the 1960s and a large proportion of users are involved in crimes to support their habits. After release from incarceration, relapse to opioid addiction is very common and this leads to more crimes and re- incarceration. Treatment advances in the area of medications have not reached this population. Effective medications such as methadone and buprenorphine are not well accepted by prosecutors and judges. Permission to conduct research on the most effective treatment approaches is very difficult to obtain for patients under legal restraint because informed consent is problematic. Naltrexone, an opiate receptor antagonist, has demonstrated pharmacological efficacy in preventing relapse to opioid addiction and it has been reported to be clinically effective in parolee populations although it is rarely used. Recently a depot formulation with a one month duration has received FDA approval for the treatment of alcoholism. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a monthly injection of naltrexone is practical and useful in the prevention of relapse and when compared to treatment as usual. We will also monitor HIV risk behaviors to determine whether the intervention reduces risk of HIV and hepatitis C infections. This collaborative project will take place in six treatment sites where there is a large population of parolees with a history of opiate addiction. b. Jail or Prison i. Kinlock, Timothy W. Prison Buprenorphine This five-year study examines the effectiveness of buprenorphine treatment provided to previously-addicted inmates (N=320; 160 males, 160 females) initiated in prison and continued in the community. The study also examines the extent to which the setting of post-release buprenorphine is provided. It is expected that participants receiving in- prison buprenorphine will have superior outcomes compared to participants who did not receive in-prison buprenorphine. Participants will be randomly assigned, within gender, 23 to one of four treatment conditions: 1) buprenorphine and counseling in prison, with referral for continued treatment at an OTP upon release; 2) buprenorphine and counseling in prison, with referral for continued treatment at a CHC upon release; 3) counseling only in prison, with referral for buprenorphine and counseling at a OTP upon release; and 4) counseling only in prison, with referral for buprenorphine and counseling at a CHC upon release. Participants will be assessed at study entry and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following their release from prison. Outcome measures include: treatment entry and retention in the community, heroin use, cocaine use, HIV infection, HIV-risk behaviors, criminal activity, and employment. ii. Rich, Josiah D. A Randomized Trial of Continued Methadone Maintenance vs. Detoxification in Jail Opiate addiction is a chronic, relapsing medical condition that can be effectively treated through long-term opiate replacement therapy (ORT). Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is the most widely used form of ORT and has been used to treat opiate addiction for over thirty years. MMT has been proven to reduce injection drug use, HIV risk behaviors and recidivism, yet inmates are routinely detoxified from methadone upon incarceration, thus causing an interruption in the treatment of their opiate dependence. Even if inmates are referred to community methadone programs upon release, there is a chance that they will delay or forgo re-entry or will engage in behaviors that put them at high risk for HIV infection or reincarceration before returning to methadone maintenance treatment. Maintaining inmates on methadone therapy during short-term incarceration may facilitate their prompt re-entry into community methadone maintenance programs after release, minimizing the risk of drug relapse, HIV risk behaviors and overdose. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the impact of interruption of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) during short-term incarceration (jail) as this is the standard practice in nearly all correctional facilities in the United States. We will compare methadone detoxification with continued methadone maintenance treatment using a randomized trial and examine continuing treatment post release, relapse to drug use, HIV risk behaviors, reincarceration, and the costs associated with continued MMT vs. methadone detoxification. The targeted population will be 450 individuals who, while 24 enrolled in community methadone treatment, become incarcerated for less than 6 months. Follow-up interviews will occur 1 month post release from incarceration and 6, 12, and 18 months from baseline at an independent study site. Both groups will receive a risk behavior reduction counseling intervention and linkage to community methadone treatment upon release. If this project is able to demonstrate that maintaining inmates on methadone for short-term incarcerations is more beneficial and/or less costly than detoxification, then this can inform correctional policy to encourage collaboration with community substance use treatment providers and to minimize disruption of treatment during short term incarceration. iii. Springer, Sandra A. Naltrexone for Opioid Dependent Released HIV+ Criminal Justice Populations The specific aim for this study is to conduct a placebo-controlled trail (RCT) of d-NTX among HIV+ persons in jails and prisons meeting DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence who are transitioning to the community. HIV treatment outcomes (HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4 count, Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) adherence, retention in care), substance abuse (time to relapse to opioid use, % opioid negative urines, opioid craving), adverse side effects and HIV risk behavior (sexual and drug-related risks) outcomes will be compared in 150 recruited prisoners and jail detainees in Connecticut (CT) and Massachusetts (MA) who will be randomized 2:1 to either d-NTX or depot- placebo. The primary outcome of interest will be the proportion with a HIV-RNA <400 copies/mL at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include mean CD4 count, antiretroviral adherence, retention on HAART and in HIV care, HIV risk behaviors, time-to-relapse to opioid use, percent opioid negative urines, retention on d-NTX and HIV quality of life. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed for an additional 6 months after completion of the intervention. If this placebo-controlled trial of d-NTX among released HIV+ criminal justice system (CJS) persons with opioid dependence demonstrates efficacy and safety, it is likely to become an evidence-based intervention to intervene with this extremely marginalized population in a way that will meet Healthy People 2010's goals to increase the quality and years of life, decrease health disparities particularly among minorities, break the cycle of addiction, reduce the numbers of people 25 within the CJS and launch a number of new and innovative trials and second generation questions for future research. As such, the individual, our health care system and society have a high likelihood to benefit. This will not only be true for strategies here in the U.S., but may have even greater application for geographic areas where the interface between opioid disorders and HIV is even greater. 2. Alcohol Dependence a. Community Supervision (Probation, Parole, and Drug Court Studies) i. Weaver, Michael F. The Use of Acamprosate for Preventing Alcohol Relapse Among Alcohol Dependent Drug Treatment Court Participants Acamprosate has been an available treatment for alcohol dependence outside the United States and has recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an effective therapy for alcohol dependence. In the past ten years, drug court programs have been implemented as one possible solution to reduce the burden placed on state and federal correctional systems. These programs are generally focused on non-violent drug dependent offenders and are offered as an alternative to incarceration. However, the use of acamprosate has never been examined for alcohol relapse prevention among a drug court population, or among those on probation or parole. The purpose of this study is to test how tolerable and effective acamprosate is when used to prevent alcohol relapse in criminal justice supervisees (those on probation, parole, or in drug court). b. Jail or Prison i. Springer, Sandra A. Alcohol Pharmacotherapy for HIV+ Prisoners This is a randomized controlled trial injectable intramuscular naltrexone (XR-NTX) versus intramuscular placebo among HIV-infected prisoners meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for alcohol 26 dependence or problem drinking, who are transitioning to the community and seeking treatment to prevent relapse to alcohol use. In this study, we conduct a placebo-controlled trial to determine if naltrexone has an effect in this group, which could be important in making the case for having naltrexone available to alcohol dependent or problem drinking HIV+ prisoners prior to release. We will compare their HIV treatment (HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4 count), alcohol treatment (time to relapse to heavy drinking, percent of days drinking, percent of days abstinent and alcohol craving) and HIV risk behavior (sexual and drug-related risks) outcomes. We hypothesize that extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX) will result in improved HIV outcomes (lower log10 HIV-1RNA levels and higher CD4 count) as well as improved alcohol treatment outcomes, and reduced drug/sex HIV related risk behaviors and decreased rates of reincarceration. 3. Drug and Alcohol Dependence a. Community Supervision (Probation, Parole, and Drug Court Studies) i. Friedmann, Peter D. Medication-Assisted Treatment Implementation in Community Correctional Environments The goal of this study is to see whether or not a strategic planning process is able to introduce and sustain improvements in the working relationship between probation/parole departments and community-based addiction treatment agencies that provide medication assisted therapy (MAT) for individuals with opioid or alcohol dependence. In addition, this study seeks to improve probation/parole agency personnel's knowledge and perceptions about MAT, and increase the number of appropriate referrals to community treatment agencies that provide MAT. There are three phases to this study. Phase 1 includes a pilot study to determine the quality and availability of client level records and the collection of baseline data (the pilot study protocol was previously submitted to TMH IRB). Phase 2 will consist of a Knowledge, Perceptions and Information (KPI) intervention during which probation/parole agencies will undergo training to increase knowledge about the effectiveness of MAT, and complete a post training assessment to 27 evaluate the effectiveness of the KPI intervention. During Phase 3, probation/parole agencies will be randomly assigned to a 12-month Organizational Linkage Intervention (OLI) condition or to control (no further intervention). Agencies assigned to the OLI will establish a Pharmacotherapy Exchange Council (PEC) that consists of staff from both the probation/parole and community treatment agencies. The PEC will undergo a strategic planning process to increase the availability of MAT for opiate and/or alcohol dependent individuals who are on probation/parole. 28 References Brahen LS., Henderson RK, Capone T, & Kordal N.

Drug and Alcohol Abuse Studies Acamprosate Bup- renorphine Methadone Naltrexone Probation, Parole, and Drug Court Primary Aim of Study Friedmann, Peter D. Medication -Assisted Treatment Implementation in Community Correctional Environments (MATICCE) The purpose of this study is to see whether a strategic planning process is able to introduce and sustain improvements in the working relationship between probation /parole departments and community - based treatment agencies that provide MAT for opioid or alcohol dependence. In addition, this study seeks to improve probation /parole agency personnel's knowledge and perceptions about MAT, and increase the number of appropriate MAT referrals. Attitudes on MAT in the Criminal Justice System Selected articles and research Results from Survey on Medication Assisted Treatment in the Criminal Justice System: A Nationally Representative Survey of Drug Courts Prepared by Harlan Matusow, Andrew Rosenblum (National Development and Research Institutes) and Josiah Rich, Samuel Dick man (Miriam Hospital, Brown University Medical School), September 30, 2011. Medication Assisted Treatmen t (MAT) in the Drug Courts Respondent Demographi cs (tables 1-5): The majority of respondents (67%) were drug- court coordinators followed by administrators (18%). Percentages for other drug court roles were less than five percent. Four-fifths (81%) of respondent s had worked in their respective profession for more than 5 years; 20 % for more than 20 years. More than half (57%) of the respondents had worked in drug courts for at least 5 years. The most frequently endorsed professional disciplines (within the drug court) were drug treatment professional (39%), social worker (30%) and counselor (12%); 10% described their discipline as lawyer or judge . Almost two-fifths (38%) ha d a bachelor's degree and advanced degree (40% Ma sters, 9% JD, 3% PhD). Drug Court Statistics (tables 6, 7): Aside from South Dakota, Montana, and New Jersey surveys were received from every state plus Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. Thirty- two percent of our responde nts were urban courts, 37% suburban, and 31% rural. Twenty-nine percent of the courts have 25 or fewer clients, 27% have 26-50, 14% have 51 to 100, and 29% have more than 100 clients. Characteristics of Drug Cour t Participants (tables 8,9) : Almost half (45%) of the drug courts estimated that more than 20% of thei r clients were addicted to opioids; 20% estimated that 10-20% of their clients were a ddicted to opioids, and 30% estimated that 1-10% of their clients were addicted to opioi ds; Only 1% reported that none of their clients were addicted to opioids . Prescription opioids were more likely than heroin to be cited as the primary opioid problem (61% vs. 32%; 6% endo rsed \"don't know\"). Prevalence of MAT (table 10) : We asked the courts to estimate the percentage of opioid- addicted clients that receive d specific medications. Answer choices ranged from 0 to 100% with a \"don't know\" option. For the pur poses of this analysis, we interpreted \"don't know\" as not zero, meaning that at leas t 1 or more drug court clients had received the indicated medication (although the respondent was unable to estim ate the percent of clients using the indicated medication). Usi ng this convention, the percentage of drug courts providing medications for the treatmen t of opioid dependence were: some type of under which agonist therapy is offered (table 11): Circumstances under which agonist therapy (buprenorphine or me thadone) was available varied widely. Across all categories buprenorphine was more widely available than methadone. For example, for clients who were already maintained on agonist therapy 22% of drug courts offered methadone and 32% offered buprenorph ine (a total of 40% offered any agonist medication). For opioid-addicted pregnant clients not alrea dy receiving agonist medication, approximately three-quarters do not receive either buprenorphine or methadone. Fifty percent of courts surveyed did not permit agonist medication under any circumstances, 47% metha done and 42% buprenorphine. . Attitudes about MAT (table 12): While drug court personnel were generally more likely to endorse favorable/accurate views toward agonist therapy than disagree with such views, the most widely selected choice for the large majority of attitudinal questions - more so for buprenorphine than for methadone - was \"uncertain.\" For example, while 47% of respondents agree that \"buprenorphine helps reduce relapse,\" 48% answered \"uncertain.\" By comparison, 44% agree that methadone helps reduce relapse, and 35% were uncertain. Seventeen and 9% of res pondents agree that the use of methadone and buprenorphine, respectively, \"rewards criminals for being drug users;\" 51% of respondents disagreed with this item (for bot h drugs). Examples where respondents were more likely to endorse an inaccurate or biased view toward agonist therapy included the item that methadone \"prolongs addiction\" (36% agree and 23% disagree) and that it should be used as a maintenance therapy ( 30% agree and 36% disa gree). Respondents were also more likely to disa gree than agree with the item that agonist therapy was more likely to retain patients in treatm ent than non-pharmacological approaches. Reasons Buprenorphine or Methadone might not be offered (table 13): Frequently endorsed obstacles to agonist medication were drug (buprenorphine 43%; methadone 27%), lack from the treatment provide r (buprenorphine 32%; methadone 52%), and that clients were supervision (buprenorphine 40%; methadone 43%). \"Don't know\" comprised a sizeable mi nority of answers for many questions in both the buprenorphine and methadone sections. Introducing or Expanding the use of Agnonist Therapy (tables 14, 15): Fifty-four percent of respondents answered that it would be possible to introduce or expand the use of agonist medication in their courts \"if evidence were available that methadone or buprenorphine improved outcomes for drug court clients.\" Medications for Alcoholism (table 16): Fifty percent of the surveyed courts offered MAT for their alcohol-addicted part JudgeOther 5.

PARRINO, M.P.A. The National Institutes of Health convened a consensus development panel in 1997, \"Effective Medical Treatment of Opiate Addiction,\" which issued a statement indicating that addiction to opioids is not a matter of will power but a medical, brain-related disorder that should be treated like any other disease. The statement held: \"For decades, opioid dependence was viewed as a problem of motivation, willpower, or strength of character. Through careful study of its natural history and through research at the genetic, molecular, neuronal, and epi- demiological levels, it has been proven that opiate addiction is a med- ical disorder characterized by predictable signs and symptoms\" (NationaI Institutes of Health, 1997). It has been scientifically established that opioid addiction can be effectively treated through a number of interventions, including the use of maintenance pharmacotherapy using methadone and buprenor- phine. Methadone has been used to effectively treat opioid addiction in the United States for the past 40 years and buprenorphine was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use tn treating opioid addiction as well. It has also been well documented that addiction to drugs in general and to heroin in particular carries an enormous social stigma. This stigma is all encompassing and affects society's view of any individual who uses, misuses, and becomes addicted to opioids. In spite of proven and replicable scientific research to support the fact that opioid addic-Providing Treatment for Opioid Addiction in Prisons 121 tion is a medical disorder and is treatable, the stigma that surrounds addiction has interfered in providing access to care both for the gen- eral public and for incarcerated individuals. In a recent survey of U.S. jails, Fiscella and associates examined how inmates rvho had been enrolled in methadone maintenance programs at the time of incarceration gained access to continued care following incarceration (Fiscella et a\\.,2004). They found that \"very few jails elected to continue methadone following arrest.\" This study collected information from 246 jails and found that analgesics were routinely used to treat opioid withdrawal in 133 of the iails. Clonidine was rou- tinely used to treat opioid withdrawal in 127 of the jails while metha- done was used in 33 jails during the inmates' period of incarcerarion. These findings indicated \"the need for the establishment of national standards for management of arrestees/inmates in methadone pro- grams in U.S. jails as r,r'ell as the need to provide improved education to help professionals rvorking in correctional facilities regarding ap- propriate management of persons enrolled in methadone programs\" (Fiscella et al.. 2004). In view of the fact that opioid addiction has been found to be a treat- able medical disease, one might question why so few jails in the U.S. provide access to such medications for opioid-addicted inmates. The stigma already alluded to has had an overwhelming effect that has sub- verted the implementation of sound public policy responses to resolve cleariv understood problems. Based on their 2004 survey of corrections staff perspectives on methadone maintenance therapy in a large Southwestern jail, McMil- lan and associates concluded that \"negative attitudes toward metha- done maintenance treatment appear to be related to negative judg- ments about the clients the program serves. The survey results indicate that people don't object to methadone maintenance treatment per se, but they object to drug users in general, and heroin users in particu- lar, getting an,v kind of treatment that might seem to condone their behavior. An unexpected finding was that the older jail staff was much more svmpathetic to methadone maintenance treatment, than the ]-olrnger staff\" (McMillan and Lapham, 2005). McMillan's study holds out promise for educating both policvmakers and corrections staff rvho are involved in resporrding to the health care needs of an inmate population.122 Special Populations Programs for Methadone Treatment of Opioid-Add icted In mates There has been corrsiderable experience in providing access to metha- done mirintenance treatment through an incarcerated population in a major U.S. iail in Nerv York Citv. The Rikers Island KEEP (Key Ex- tended Entry Program) program has been part of the Rikers Island Health Services System since 1987. This service combines pharmaco- therapy and comprehensive therapeutic treiltment for heroin addicrion. The KEEP progrilm treats approximately'4,000 inmates rvith meth- adone each year, with an average treatment duration of 35 dal's' Ap- proximately 70 percent of these inmates are men; among women par- ticipating in the program, 10 percent are pregnant (Parrino,2000). To qualify for the KEEP progrAm, an inmatr' must have been diagnosed as being opioid acldicted by n-redical staff, been charged with either a misdemeanor or low-grade felony, and be serving a misdemeanoll sen- tence. What is most importartt about this program is that approxi- mately 75 percent of all progrrrm participants reported to their assigned outpatient methadone program for continued substance abuse treat- ment services following their release from iail. This 6nding, which has been c<lnsistent throughout the course of the Rikers Island program' demonstrates clearly that providing treatment to opioid-addicted in- mates while they are incarcerated signilicantly reduces the likelihood of a return to the criminal lifestyle that accompanies illicit heroin use. The KEEP prograrr also demonstrates the value of a tightly coordi- nated service delivery systen between a lail-based program and out- patient methadone treatment programs. The Rikers Island experience supports both the conclusion of the 1997 NIH Consensus Panel ancl rhe Natior-t:tl Institute on Drug Abuse's OctcrLrer Drttg Addictiort Treatnrent, which asserts that \"research is demonstrating that treatment for drug addicted of- fenders during and :rfter incarceration can have a significant beneficial effect on future dmg use, crirnilal behavior and social functioning. The carse for integrating drug addiction treatment lpproaches rvithin the criminal iustice system is compelling. Combining prison and commurrity-based rreatment for drug addiction offenders reduces the risks of both recidivisr-n to drug-related crirrinal behavior and relapse to drug use\" (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 1'999).Providing Treatment for Opioid Addiction in Prisons 123 In spite of grou'ing knowledge that this kind of program shotrld be replicated in ;ails throughout the U.S. to reduce recidivism at a low cost, the movement to institute such reform has beerr extremely slow to develop. There is greater likelihood that, in vierv of their shorter sentences, jail inmates will gain access to continued methadone treat- ment than will prison inmates. In addition, jails are generally located in communities and counties r,r,hile prisons tend to be rnore geogr:rph- icalh' isolated from the generirl public. Accordingly, county and munic- ipal jails tend to be more responsive to local political interests. At the time of this r,vriting. methadone malntenance treatment is offered :1s a continlred form of czrre in few jails in the U.S. The Orange Countv Jail in Orlando, Florida, began to provide access to nretha- done treatment for inmiltes who were already enrolled in methadone rreatment programs at the time of their incarceration following two lau'sr.rits that were verv costlv to the county. Tr,vo of jail's inrnates died from causes medicalll' related to rvithdrawal symptoms when their methadone treatment was abruptly stopped. Families of the de- cedents brought the county to court and won significant financial dam- ages. A local methirdone treatment program, the Cer-rter for Drug-Free Living, now delivers methadone to the Orange County Jail uncler an agreement betr'veen the jail and the treatment program. This arrange- ment represents an extremely practical solution to a rerrible medical crisis for those inrnates who are enrollecl in a n-rethadone treatment progrirrn at time of incarceration and cannot gain access ro any effec- tive medical treatment. Several other jail-based methadone treatment prograr.ns also provi.le access to such care, including thclse in the Phila- delphia corrections svstem, correctional facilities in Rhode Island, and scattered jurisdictions throughout the U.S. New jail-based methadone/ buprenorphine-based treatment programs are under consideration in Washingrcln, Marvland, and Vermont. Emerging Case Law l-egal prececlents ancl case lau'erre limited in this area but are develop- ing. One significarrr case is thar of Keith Griggs, rvho brought suir against the Vermont Department of Corrections when the department refused to permit access to continued methadone treatment while he rvas incarcerated. Although the rrial judge directed the Vermont of Corrections N,{r. Griggs's merhadone imme-124 i Special Populations diately, the department did not do so, instead requesting an emergency stay of the order from the Vermont Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the lower court's ruling. The Vermont Department of Correc- tions continued to refuse to allow Keith Griggs access to his metha- done treatment, and rather than comply with the court order, released Griggs from prison before his sentence had been compieted (Boucher, 2003). Boucher's analysis of this and a second similar case from Ver- mont led her to conclude, \"Denying methadone to inmates can no longer pass constitutional muster because it offends the evolving stan- dard of decency that marks the progress of a maturing society, in which scientists have declared opioid dependence a medical disorder treat- able with methadone\" (Boucher. 2003). Serving the Needs of Opioid-Addicted Inmates and Society Several arguments can be made for providing access to methadone/ buprenorphine treatment for opioid-addicted inmates in U.S. jails. First, as the NIH Consensus Panel made clear, heroin addiction is a disease for which effective therapy exists. If inmates who suffer from other medical diseases have access to medical care during their incar- ceration, opioid-addicted inmates should be treated no differently. Second, methadone/buprenorphine treatment is a low-cost medical intervention. In most outpatient programs, the cost for providing ac- cess to this treatment generally amounts to $5,000 per patient per year. This is much lower than the roughly $22,000 per inmate per year cost of incarceration (Boucher, 2003), especially in view of the fact that a large number of methadone patients pay for their own treatment and public costs of correctional systems are steadily rising. Funding will be needed for jail-based treatment programs, espe- cially as more inmate health care programs are provided under con- tract with entities in the private sector. The Rikers Island KEEP pro- gram has demonstrated that providing access to methadone treatment for inmates is extremely cost effective. The funding needed for jail- based programs, and to support continued access to treatment for opioid-addicted inmates as they leave jail or prison and return to soci- ety, could come from federal, state, or county sources. As McMillan's study shows, attitudes need to be changed in order to increase access to methadone treatment for incarcerated addicts.Providing Treatment for Opioid Addiction in Prisons 125 But his findings also suggest that attitudes can be changed. And the KEEP program demonstrates that both opioid-addicted individuals and society benefit when inmates have access to treatment for their addiction. There is no question that society's interests are served by providing opioid-addicted inmates access to methadone and buprenorphine, rvhich are the federally approved medications for treating chronic opi- oid addictron. In view of the established science in this area of medi- cine and in view of the cost savings to society, there are no sound argu- ments against the recommendation to provide access to medicarions ro treat the disease of opioid addiction during the period of an in- mate's incarceration.

Opiate replace- ment therapy (ORT) with methadone or buprenorphine is an effective treatment for opiate dependenceand can reduce drug-related disease and recidivism for inmates. Provision of ORT is nevertheless afrequently neglected intervention in the correctional setting.Objective and methods: We surveyed the 50 state; Washington, District of Columbia (DC); and Federal Department of Corrections' medical directors or their equivalents about their facilities' ORT prescribingpolicies and referral programs for inmates leaving prison.Results: We received responses from 51 of 52 prison systems nationwide. Twenty-eight prison systems (55%) offer methadone to inmates in some situations. Methadone use varies widely across states: over50% of correctional facilities that offer methadone do so exclusively for pregnant women or for chronicpain management. Seven states' prison systems (14%) offer buprenorphine to some inmates. The mostcommon reason cited for not offering ORT was that facilities drug-free detoxication provide referrals for someinmates to methadone maintenance programs after release, which increased from 8% in 2003; 15 states'prison systems (29%) provide some referrals to community buprenorphine providers.Conclusion: Despite demonstrated social, medical, and economic benets of providing ORT to inmates during incarceration and linkage to ORT upon release, many prison systems nationwide still do not offerpharmacological treatment for opiate addiction or referrals for ORT upon release. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction The United States has the world's highest incarceration rate, with approximately 10 million individuals incarcerated each year (Sabol and Couture, 2008; Walmsley, 2008 ). In 2007, over 2.2 million individuals were imprisoned at any given time, and an estimatedseven to eight million others cycled through the country's prisons(facilities designated for long-term connement upon convictionof crimes) and jails (facilities that house individuals detained forshort periods of time, usually 6 months or less, often while theyawait trial) (Sabol and Couture, 2008 ). The number of incarcer- ated individuals has grown steadily since 1980, and in 2007, thenumber of incarcerated individuals rose 1.8% over 2006 ( Sabol and Corresponding author at: Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Division of Infectious Diseases, 164 Summit Avenue, Providence, RI 02906, USA. E-mail Walmsley, 2008 ). Growth in incarceration rates can be largely attributed to the \"war on drugs,\" which has resultedin harsher penalties for drug offenses and has led to a threefoldincrease in drug-related arrests; over half of all sentences in fed-eral prisons are for federal drug-related offenses ( Drucker, 1999; Greinger, 2007). Studies have found that between 50% and 84%of prison inmates have a history of substance use ( Drucker, 1999; Greinger, 2007; Mumola incarceration (Mumola and Karberg, 2006). An estimated 20% ofstate inmates have a history of injection drug use ( Mumola and Karberg, 2006), and approximately 24-36% of all heroin addicts,or over 200,000 individuals, pass through the US criminal jus-tice system each year (Rich et al., 2005a). Moreover, prisonersoften engage in substance use during incarceration ( Clarke et al., 2001; Kang et al., 2005; Krebs and Simmons, 2002; Seal et al.,2008). Inmates face disproportionately higher burdens of disease with mental illness, substance use and infectious diseases, including 0376-8716/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Nunn et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 105 (2009) 83-88 HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, other sexually transmitted infections, tubercu- losis and others (Greinger, 2007; Hammett, 2006). Many inmatesare uninsured, lack adequate access to health services, and comefrom medically underserved communities ( Freudenberg, 2001). Because correctional systems have high turnover rates and rein-carceration rates, inmate health also profoundly affects the healthof the communities to which they return ( Greinger, 2007; Nurco et al., 1991). Providing inmates with comprehensive health services,including treatment for chemical dependency with pharmacolog-ical therapy and counselling services, therefore offers a uniquepublic health opportunity (Bick, 2007; Rich et al., 2005b ). Inmates' transitions back to their communities are often asso- ciated with increased health risks, particularly increased sexualand Visher and Mallik-Cane, 2007 ). Approx- imately 55% of individuals with a history of substance use willrelapse to substance use within 1 month of release from incar-ceration (Nurco et al., 1991). Relapse to substance use is alsoassociated with increased criminal activity (Hanlon et al., 1990;Nurco et al., 1991), risk of HIV and HCV infection (Inciardi andNeedle, 1998), drug overdose (Binswanger death overdose ( Krinsky et al., 2009) and reincarceration (Gore al., 1995; Lipton, 1992 ). Offer- ing inmates pharmacological treatment and counselling for opiatedependence prior to release decreases the likelihood of drug relapse(Gordon et al., 2008; Kinlock et al., 2008a; Martin, 1999 ), over- dose (Gordon et al., 2008; Martin, 1999), recidivism, and HIV riskbehaviors (Springer and Altice, 2007 ) and increases the likelihood of remaining in long-term drug treatment upon release ( Gordon et al., 2008; Kinlock et al., 2002, 2008a; Martin, 1999 ). Incarcera- tion also offers an opportunity to intervene and break the cycle ofaddiction, health risks, criminal behavior, and reincarceration. Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) is an opiate replace- ment therapy (ORT) that has been used in the United States fornearly 50 years to treat chronic heroin addiction ( Dole et al., 1969; McLellan et al., 1993). Methadone prevents withdrawal symptomsand drug cravings, blocks the euphoric effects of other opiates, andreduces the risk of relapse to illicit use of opiates, infectious dis-ease transmission, and overdose death ( Gerra et al., 2003; Kreek, 1992, 2000). MMT use among prisoners, particularly around thetime of release, is associated with reduced drug injection, HIVand HCV transmission (Marsch, 1998; Springer and Altice, et al., 2008; Kinlock et al., 2008b), recidivism, and increased participation in drug treatmentprograms (Gordon et al., 2008; Kinlock et al., 2002, 2008b ). Buprenorphine is an that acts as a partial opioid ago- nist (Fiellin and O'Connor, 2002). Buprenorphine was approved by the FDA in 2002 for the management of opioid addictionby community and correctional physicians ( Comer and Collins, 2002). Buprenorphine is often combined with naloxone and admin-istered sublingually as Suboxone \u00a9to reduce the likelihood of diversion (Comer and Collins, 2002 ). Since its 1996 approval in France, buprenorphine has been prescribed widely for ORT and isassociated with improved stability in housing and employment;reduced self-reported heroin use; and decreased risk of HIV, HBV,and HCV infection; and mortality decline attributable to overdose(Auriacombe et 2004, 2001; Carrieri et al., 2006; al.,2001). Compared with methadone, buprenorphine has fewer regu-lations governing its use, lower likelihood of fatal overdose, and isassociated with less social stigma. Because buprenorphine must beprescribed by a physician, it also provides opportunities for moreroutine medical care. Although the cost of Suboxone \u00a9has been a barrier to its widespread use, its orphan drug status expires in Octo-ber 2009, which will allow generic manufacturing of the medicationand anticipated concomitant decreased cost. Given the health and social risks associated with opiate use, both the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) recommend that correctional systemsoffer health programs to prevent substance use relapse upon com-munity transition (CDC, 2002; WHO, 2007). In addition, WHOincludes both methadone and suboxone in the essential medicineslist (EML) (M\u00f8ller et al., 2007). The EML is a list of pharmaceuticalproducts that WHO recommends that all health systems or govern-ments should make available to their populations. WHO guidelinesalso hold that drugs made available in the community should alsobe made available in prison ( M\u00f8ller et al., 2007). The Commission of the European Communities reports that numerous European Unionmember states have adopted these recommendations: 17 providemethadone maintenance and 10 provide buprenorphine treatmentin prisons, although coverage varies widely ( CEC, 2007). However, most prison systems in the rest of the world do not offer MMT andbuprenorphine in the correctional setting (WHO, 2005, 2007). Our 2003 survey examining the attitudes and practices of med- ical directors of state and federal prisons regarding methadonetreatment found that just under 50% of US prison systems usedmethadone; when used, methadone is limited primarily to thetreatment of pregnant inmates or for acute detoxication (Richet al., 2005b). Only 8% of prison systems referred with ahistory of opiate dependence to community-based methadone benets opiate-dependent prisoners. To assesschanges in attitudes and practices during the last 5 years, and tolearn more about buprenorphine prescribing and referral practicessince its approval, we surveyed the medical directors, their equiv-alents, or appointed designees of state prisons and the District ofColumbia and federal prison systems about their opinions and pre-scribing practices for methadone and buprenorphine. Our surveyalso included questions about prison policies related to referringprisoners to community-based ORT programs upon release. 2. Methods We emailed or faxed a 17-question survey to the medical directors, equivalent health authorities, or their designees of the 50 state Departments of Corrections. The 50 state Departments of Corrections collectively house approximately 1.4 mil-lion prisoners. We also surveyed the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the District ofColumbia prison, which collectively house approximately 200,000 prisoners ( Sabol and Couture, 2008). We subsequently contacted several respondents by email andtelephone to remind them to complete the survey. Survey questions addressed opi-ate screening practices, methadone and buprenorphine provision within the prisonsetting; attitudes about the utility of buprenorphine and methadone; and prison ORTreferral practices for inmates leaving prison. Some questions allowed respondentsto provide open-ended responses to complement close-ended survey questions. Thesurvey concluded with a free response question encouraging respondents to provideany additional comments related to prescribing and referral practices. Respondentsdid not receive any compensation or incentives for responding to the survey. Thesurvey is available online at the Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights:http://www.prisonerhealth.org/ . Respondents who indicated their facilities provided methadone or buprenor- phine were asked to provide information about the circumstances in which each isprescribed, how the medications are provided, and how many patients were usingthe medication. If the respondent indicated that methadone and/or buprenorphinewere not used, they were asked why the medications were not offered to inmates.All respondents were asked to rate the utility of both medications, and whetherthey referred opiate-dependent inmates to community-based ORT providers uponrelease. Respondents submitted the completed survey either by fax or through an online survey service. In nine cases, surveys were administered over the telephonewhen respondents did not answer emails and fax requests. Data were entered intoMicrosoft Excel. Summary statistics and cross-tabulations were created in MicrosoftExcel. 3. Results We received a total of 51 of 52 responses; only one Midwest- ern state, which houses only approximately 1400 prisoners (or less than 0.1% of all prisoners nationwide) ( Sabol and Couture, 2008), declined to complete the survey.

Although methadone is offered more frequentlythan buprenorphine, only 55% of prison systems (including stateand federal systems) offer methadone under any circumstances.Methadone use varies widely across states: some states reporttreating more than 500 patients with methadone, but over 50%who offer methadone do so exclusively for pregnant women, acuteopiate withdrawal, or for chronic pain management. By summingthe reported number of prisoners receiving methadone in all statesand federal jurisdictions responding to our survey, we estimate thatbetween 1614 and 1817 prisoners receive methadone in state andfederal correction systems nationwide. (We note, however, that twostates responded \"do not know\" in response to the question aboutapproximately how many prisoners receive MMT in their systems.)Similarly, 45% of facilities provided some community linkage tomethadone treatment post-release. Seven prison systems (14%) offer buprenorphine in some circumstances and 15 (29%) offer referrals for some inmatesto community buprenorphine providers upon release. By sum-ming the reported number of prisoners receiving buprenor-phine in all states and federal jurisdictions responding toour survey, we estimate that between 57 and 150 prisonersreceive buprenorphine in state and federal correction systemsnationwide. To assess regional differences in provision of ORT in prison systems and linkage to ORT post-release, we stratied the databy geographic region, as dened by the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention (CDC). The proportion of facilities offeringmethadone to incarcerated inmates was similar across the North-eastern, Midwestern and Western regions of the US, while relativelyfew facilities offered methadone to inmates in the South (35%). TheNortheast was the only region of the US reporting common pro-vision of buprenorphine treatment for inmates; nearly a third ofNortheastern prison systems offered this treatment option. Simi-larly, a much greater proportion of prison systems in the Northeastreferred inmates to community-based ORT treatment upon release(78% and 67% for methadone and buprenorphine, respectively).Notably, ve respondents (10%) reported that heroin use is infre-quent in their state, citing low opiate addiction prevalence as theprimary reason they did not offer ORT. The federal prison systemoffers methadone but not buprenorphine and does not provide ORTreferrals upon release. Table 2 describes reasons why ORT is not available in prison systems as well as reasons why ORT referrals are not available Fig. 1.

When asked how benecial methadone is for treating inmates with opiate addiction, they did not know howbenecial methadone is for treating inmates with opiate addiction.The federal prison system respondent responded that methadone is\"somewhat benecial\" (data not shown). When asked how bene-cial buprenorphine is for treating inmates with did not know how benecial buprenorphineis for treating inmates with opiate addiction. The federal prisonsystem respondent responded that buprenorphine was somewhatbenecial. We asked respondents who did not offer ORT during incarcer- ation or upon release why their facilities did not offer ORT andORT referrals. The most common reason why facilities did not offerORT to inmates was that they favored drug-free security aboutproviding methadone to inmates; 20% of facilities cited securityconcerns about providing buprenorphine. An additional barrier toboth provision of ORT to inmates and linkage to ORT post-releasewas lack of partnerships with community ORT providers ( Table 2). Many providers also indicated that their focus on inmate health dur-ing incarceration rather than upon release as another reason for notlinking inmates to ORT post-release (25% of respondents indicatedthis for methadone referrals and 22% referrals).The federal responses were very similar: neither methadone norbuprenorphine referrals were offered because \"prisoners are detox-ied prior to release.\" In addition to the structured survey questions, we provided an opportunity for respondents to comment about ORT in the correc-tional setting. Many comments reflected respondents' opposition topharmacological management of opiate dependence. For example,one respondent remarked that: We don't have ORT programs and inmates are detoxed whenthey leave. I can't think of a better time to get your life straightthan when you have nothing to do but sit and think. We do notsupport long-term maintenance programs for addicted individ-uals. Similarly, with regard to linkage to ORT upon release, one respondent stated that: Inmates are off drugs while in prison, so there's no reason forthem to be referred; they wouldn't t the criteria for referral.They don't need detox because they've been rehabilitated whilein prison. It is assumed that they are no longer [drug] users. Another respondent commented that \"facilitating addiction seems inconsistent with the mission of incarceration.\" A fourthrespondent indicated that ORT is not appropriate for inmates bystating that: \"ORT certainly has a use, but is not appropriate ordesirable in many patients, especially prisoners.\" Several respondents in favor of expanding access to ORT cited institutional barriers beyond their control that limit its implemen-tation. One respondent indicated that even if medical directorsfavor provision of ORT, they must often overcome signicant admin-istrative barriers or undertake dramatic shifts in prison policy, andremarked: We're making a huge effort to improve discharge planning andto connect people with primary care providers. It's a hugeparadigm and cultural shift. Another respondent who favored expansion of ORT provision in his prison system responded: Department of Corrections staff and leadership don't know howto provide ORT and don't have an appreciation of its impor-tance, particularly in an underfunded program like ours whereeverything is broken... There is also a huge political challenge to overcome; a lot of work needs to be done to sensitize peopleabout the importance of this issue. 4. Discussion This is the rst national survey to document important atti- tudes and practices among state and federal correctional medicaldirectors regarding both methadone and buprenorphine prescrib-ing policies. In spite of CDC and WHO guidelines recommendingprovision of ORT during incarceration and upon release, as wellas several studies that demonstrate the efcacy and health andsocial benets of such policies (Dolan et al., 2005; and Altice, just over half of US prison sys- tems provide any methadone. Moreover, the total number of peoplereceiving methadone represents only a minute fraction of the esti-mated 9% (15,689) of federal and 13% (163,005) of state inmatesAuthor's personal copy A. Nunn et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 105 (2009) 83-88 87 who reported regularly using heroin in 2004 (Mumola and Karberg, 2006). Our results also support a 2006 Department of Justice reportthat found that less than 0.5% of state and federal prisoners receiveddrug maintenance therapy (Mumola and Karberg, 2006). Our esti- mates are also similar to results from our 2003 survey that ndsthat only 47% of US prison systems provided methadone to pris-oners, most of which limited MMT provision to pregnant women(Rich et al., 2005a). However, while the 2003 survey nds thatonly 8% of prison systems provided MMT referrals upon release, wend that 46% of prison systems provide referrals in some circum-stances. This suggests there have been considerable increases in thenumber of prisons providing referrals to MMT upon release since2003. Furthermore, since buprenorphine has been approved, someprison systems (14%) provide it, and 29% of prison systems refersome released inmates to community buprenorphine providers.Our results suggest that in spite of a growing body of literature sup-porting the feasibility and demonstrated health and social benetsassociated with ORT use, fewer than 2000 prisoners in state andfederal prisons receive ORT, and access to ORT in the correctionalsetting has improved only slightly since 2003. Our open-ended responses highlight several important discov- eries about ORT and referral provision in the correctional setting.First, there is still a great deal of stigma attached to ORT provi-sion, and a general preference for abstinence-based drug treatmentpolicies rather than pharmacological and therapeutic treatment ofopiate addiction. Many respondents have misperceptions about thenature of addiction and incorrectly associate forced detoxicationwith curing opiate dependence. This attitude ignores importantevidence about common relapse to addiction after forced detox-ication. We also nd that administrative barriers and personalopinions of prison medical directors often influence their facili-ties' ORT prescribing and referral policies in positive or negativeways. For example, one respondent commented that a former med-ical director was personally opposed to the use of pharmacologicalintervention for drug use and thus maintained abstinence-baseddrug treatment policies. When this medical director was replaced,the new director immediately began working to implement ORTwithin the state prison system. Another respondent underscoredthe value of buprenorphine for prisoners, commenting that hisfacility was launching a new buprenorphine treatment and referralprogram for inmates. However, we nd common misperceptionsabout the magnitude of the opiate addiction among prisoners. Forexample, a medical director in one Northeastern state with veryhigh rates of prisoners with a history of heroin use commented thatopiate addiction was not a signicant problem among prisoners. Initiation of ORT for inmates while in prison has been shown to decrease high risk behavior during incarceration and upon release,including transmission of HIV and hepatitis C due to sharing nee-dles and other drug paraphernalia ( Heimer et al., 2006). When correctional-based ORT programs are successfully linked with com-munity ORT providers, they have been shown to reduce relapseto opiate use, mortality, criminality, and recidivism (Dolan et al.,2005). Prisoners who successfully remain on ORT in the commu-nity are also more likely to sustain employment and to improvesocial function (Kakko et al., 2003). In spite of improvements in thenumber of prisons offering ORT referrals since 2003, our ndingssuggest that most prisons are still missing opportunities to breakthe cycle of incarceration and addiction by failing to link inmateswith a history of opiate dependence to ORT programs upon release. We nd that many prison medical directors are not familiar with the potential medical and social benets of providing ORT inthe correctional setting, particularly buprenorphine. Additionally, afocus on inmate health exclusively during incarceration ignores thecommon social, public health and recidivism challenges associatedwith inmate relapse to substance use immediately after release. Insummary, our results suggest that in spite of this evidence base,formidable political and administrative barriers to widespread ORTprovision in and upon release from the US correctional systemremain. Given the proven efcacy of ORT interventions in reduc-ing health and social harms, these barriers have serious health andpublic policy implications. In addition to educating and encouraging correctional admin- istrators and policy makers to improve provision of and linkage toORT for prisoners upon release, ORT providers could be encouragedto develop connections and working relationships with correctionalsystems. This might be facilitated by ORT regulators who couldrequire or encourage such relationships. Also, given the commongoals of reduced drug use, criminal behavior and recidivism, Pro-bation and Parole Departments could also encourage ORT prior toor upon release from prison. In spite of the remarkably high response rate to our survey, our ndings are subject to a few limitations. There are approxi-mately 114 federal prisons nationwide. Although medical and drugpolicies for federal prisons are centralized, there may be local dif-ferences about prescribing attitudes and practices related to ORTthat our survey did not capture. Additionally, our survey focusedexclusively on prisons rather than local jails, so it may not providea comprehensive picture of nationwide ORT prescribing and refer-ral attitudes and practices for all correctional settings. Moreover,our survey relied on the self-report and estimates of each medi-cal director; we were unable to independently conrm the actualnumbers of people prescribed or referred to ORT in each prison par-ticipating in the survey. It is therefore difcult to extrapolate theexact numbers of inmates receiving ORT from our ndings. Finally,while we document an increase in the number of prison systemsreporting referrals to ORT upon release, because our survey did notinclude a question about how many prisoners are referred to ORTupon release, we are unable to estimate the impact of this increaseon the number of prisoners receiving ORT in the community. Thiscould be a potential avenue of new research, as could exploration ofprisoner opinions about ORT in prison and upon release. Addition-ally, given the important role of parole ofcers in helping inmatestransition to the community, new research might explore probationofcers' attitudes about and roles in promoting access to ORT. Our results related to ORT policies may partially reflect regional drug use trends in the United States. Opiate use is twice or threetimes as common in the Northeastern United States than else-where (SAMHSA, 2007 ). Several medical directors commented that heroin addiction was not a common problem among inmates, citingother local drug epidemics such as cocaine and crystal metham-phetamine use. In these cases, lack of ORT programs may bepartially attributable to each state's drug epidemics rather thanlack of prison commitments to ORT; future research should focuson these regional phenomena. 5. Conclusion Our survey suggests that prison systems nationwide have made some progress in providing ORT to prisoners: a few prisons now provide buprenorphine to prisoners, and the number of facilitiesproviding referrals to ORT upon release has increased since 2003.Overall, however, pharmacological treatment of opiate dependenceis still an important but under-utilized intervention in US prisonsettings; the number of prisoners with opiate dependence whoreceive ORT during incarceration remains quite limited. In spite ofthe demonstrated medical, social and economic benets of provid-ing opiate-dependent inmates with ORT (particularly upon returnto the community), federal and state prisons in the US often donot provide ORT to inmates during incarceration or refer them tocommunity ORT programs upon release. This is a missed publichealth opportunity; greater national leadership is needed to changecriminal justice policies that deny addiction treatment services toAuthor's personal copy 88 A. Nunn et al. / Drug and Alcohol Dependence 105 (2009) 83-88 prisoners. Political and administrative opposition to pharmacolog- ical treatment of opiate dependence also suggests that educatingprison staff and policymakers about the medical and social bene-ts of ORT for treatment of opiate dependence, as well as exploringother ways to encourage greater ORT in the correctional setting,should be important public health priorities.

Under the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, the government has an obligation to provide medical care to those people whom it is punishing by incarceration. This right includes the regular medical care that is necessary to maintain your health and safety. Many states also have state statutes requiring prisons to provide medical care to prisoners. What the Law Means by \"Treatment\" The definition of \"treatment\" under the law generally includes three steps: (1) diagnosis (a finding by a doctor or mental health specialist there is a me ntal illness), (2) intervention (a decision to treat with therapy, drugs, or other care), and (3) planning (developing a method to relieve suffering or find a cure). Whether a particular medical action/choice qualifies as \"treatment\" depends on whether it is medically necessary and whether it will substantially help or cure your medical condition. Medical necessity usually involves a serious medical need, which \"could well result in the deprivation of life itself\" if untreated. The test to determine whether treatment is \"necessary\" is not whether a prisoner suffers from mental illness but rather whether that mental illness \"requires care and treatment. Mental Health Care **Mental health care is governed by the same deliberate indifference/serious needs an alysis as physical health care. Most federal circuits have held the right to adequate medical care specifically includes any psychiatric care that is necessary to maintain your health and safety. In Bowring v. Godwin , an important early decision, the Four th Circuit explicitly extended the right to medical care to mental illness treatment, noting that there is \"no underlying distinction between the right [of a prisoner] to medical care for physical ills and its psychological or psychiatric counterpart.\" Page 2 of 4 The Bowring court developed a three -part test to determine whether psychiatric care is necessary for a prisoner. Under the test, a prisoner who suffers from a mental illness is likely to have a right to mental health treatment if a health care provider determines that: (1) the prisoner's symptoms are evidence of a serious disease or injury; (2) that disease or injury is curable, or can be substantially improved; and (3) the likelihood of harm to the prisoner (in terms of safety and health, including mental health) is substantial if treatment is delayed or denied. You should note that the Bowring test is the law only in the Fourth Circuit. Other courts are likely to consider using the standard in similar cases, especially because no court has issued a disagreeing opinion. However, the only courts that must apply the test are federal courts in the Fourth Circuit. You should still cite to Bowring if you are bringing a case in another federal jurisdiction, because the court in your circuit might find it persuasive. Your Right to Treatment for Substance Abuse The American Psychiatric Association incorporates in its definition of mental illness \"substance -related disorders,\" which include illnesses like substance use, abuse, and withdrawal. **The law, however, does not always consider such diseases as rising to the level of seriousness needed to require prison authorities to provide medical care to treat them. But, many courts have found that prisoners have the right to treatment for substance abuse in certain circumstances. The sections below describe these situations. A. No Right to Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation in Prison **As a general rule, you have no right to rehabilitation while in prison. Individual states or corrections departments may decide t hat rehabilitation is an important goal and may implement programs to achieve that aim, but the Constitution does not require them to do so. One application of this rule is that there is no right to narcotics or alcohol treatment programs in prison. Howeve r, courts have at times ordered prisons to implement drug and alcohol treatment programs where their denial would otherwise lead to conditions that were so bad that they violated prisoners' rights to medical care; pri soners Page 3 of 4 often raise these issues success fully in the context of broader claims about unconstitutional conditions of confinement. Additionally, at least one court has found that prisoners should be \"free to attempt rehabilitation or the cultivation of new socially acceptable and useful skills a nd habits.\" It might be possible to argue that failure to receive drug treatment violates that freedom. **There is also no right to methadone or to establishment of methadone maintenance programs in prison. On the other hand, a few courts have found that you do have the right to ongoing drug treatment from programs in which you already participate . This right extends primarily to pretrial detainees unable to post bail. Since such individuals have not yet been found guilty and are instead in jail because they cannot afford to post bail or have been determined to be a flight risk or danger to the community, they cannot be punished beyond detention and the necessary restraint of liberty that it entails. Forced rehabilitation is seen as a punishment, as is the pain suffered when methadone is discontinued. B. Your Right to Avoid Deterioration (Getting More Sick) While Incarcerated Many courts have held that even if you do not have an absolute constitutional right to treatment for certain illnesses like substance abuse, you do have a right to avoid having your illness get worse while you are in prison. Though some courts have not found a right to avoid getting more sick while incarcerated, several have at least found that where conditions are \"so bad that serious physical or psychological deterioration is inevitable,\" you can state an Eighth Amendment claim of cruel and unusual punishment. So, if your drug or alcohol addiction is likely to worsen your condition, you might be able to claim failure to receive adequate treatment violates your right to avoid deterioration while in prison. Even though different judicial circuits have established differing rules as to the extent of that right, at a minimum, if your deterioration results from the State's intent to cause harm, you can claim the State violated your rights. Page 4 of 4 C. Your Right to Care for Withdrawal **Another exception to the general rule that prisons do not need to provide medical care for substance related disorders is that prisons do need to provide care for w ithdrawal, which can be excessively painful and dangerous, and is therefore considered a serious medical condition. Because of the seriousness of withdrawal symptoms, you are entitled to treatment. Most of the cases have arisen in the context of pretrial detainees going through withdrawal just after arrest, but the courts have not explicitly limited the right to treatment to pretrial detainees; if a convicted prisoner is experiencing a serious medical need due to withdrawal, he should receive treatment.

No other coun\u00adtry locks up more of its citizens. For black Americans, especial\u00ad ly men with no college educa\u00adtion, incarceration has become an alarmingly common life expe\u00adrience. By middle age, black men in the United States are more likely to have spent time in prison than to have graduated from col\u00adlege or joined the military, 3 and they are far more likely than whites to be sent to prison for drug offenses despite being no more likely than whites to use drugs. 3 Much of the increase in the prisoner census is a result of the \"War on Drugs\" and our coun\u00adtry's failure to treat addiction and mental illness as medical condi\u00adtions. The natural history of these diseases often leads to behaviors that result in incarceration. The medical profession has the chance both to advocate for changes in the criminal justice system to re\u00adduce the number of people behind bars who would be better served in community \u00adb ased treatment and to capitalize on the tremen\u00addous public health opportunities for diagnosing and treating dis\u00adease and for linking patients to care after release. Deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill over the past 50 years and severe punishment for drug users starting in the 1970s have shifted the burden of care for ad\u00addiction and mental illness to jails and prisons. The largest facilities housing psychiatric patients in the United States are not hospitals but jails. More than half of inmates have symptoms of a psychiatric disorder as defined by the Diag- nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM \u00adI V), and major depression and psy\u00adchotic disorders are four to eight times as prevalent among inmates as in the general population \u2014 yet only 22% of state prisoners and 7% of jail inmates receive mental health treatment while in\u00adcarcerated. 4 The medical care that many inmates receive, in combination with a different environment, can be lifesaving. Yet correctional facilities are fundamentally de\u00adsigned to confine and punish, not to treat disease. The harsh and socially isolating conditions in jail or prison often exacerbate mental illness, especially when inmates are placed under soli\u00adtary confinement, as is common Medicine and the Epidemic of Incarceration in the United States Josiah D. Rich, M.D., M.P.H., Sarah E. Wakeman, M.D., and Samuel L. Dickman, A.B. Over the past 40 years, the number of people in U.S. prisons has increased by more than 600% \u2014 an unprecedented expansion of the criminal justice system. On January 1, 2008, one of every 100 adults,PERSPECTIVE n engl j med 364;22 n ejm.org j une 2, 2011 2082in the \"super maximum\" facili\u00ad ties that have proliferated exten\u00adsively in recent years. Substance use and dependence are highly prevalent in the incar\u00adcerated population. More than 50% of inmates meet the DSM \u00adI V criteria for drug dependence or abuse, and 20% of state prison\u00aders have a history of injection \u00ad d rug use.4 Up to a third of all heroin users \u2014 approximately 200,000 \u2014 pass through the crim\u00adinal justice system annually. With growing numbers of drug users in correctional facilities, the prev\u00adalence of infectious diseases has increased correspondingly. As many as a quarter of all Ameri\u00adcans infected with HIV and one in three with hepatitis C pass through a correctional facility each year. 2 Chronic noninfec\u00ad tious diseases are also dispropor\u00adtionately prevalent in correction\u00adal facilities (see table). The impact of incarceration extends far beyond the approxi\u00admately 10 million people who are put behind bars each year. In low \u00adi ncome minority commu\u00ad nities where a large portion of the male population is in correc\u00adtional facilities at any given time, incarceration delivers a devastat\u00ading blow to stable relationships, resulting in risky sexual partner\u00adships that lead to increased rates of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV transmission and may increase rates of unwanted preg\u00adnancy. The disproportionate in\u00adcarceration of young black men is also associated with low wages and rising unemployment rates, which further exacerbate dispar\u00adities in health. Because no coun\u00adtry has ever incarcerated people at such high rates, the full extent of the social and public health consequences will not be known for years to come. Nearly all prisoners will even\u00ad tually return to the community, and the post \u00adr elease period pre\u00ad sents extraordinary risks to in\u00addividuals and costs to society. In the 2 weeks after release, former inmates are 129 times more like\u00adly to die from a drug overdose than members of the general pub\u00adlic and 12 times more likely to die of any cause. 5 Yet most released inmates lack medical insurance, and Medicaid benefits have often been terminated upon incarcera\u00adtion. 2 Although discharge \u00adp lan\u00ad ning practices vary considerably, inmates are typically released with no more than a 2 \u00adw eek sup\u00ad ply of even crucial medications such as insulin and with no pri\u00admary care follow \u00adu p, so the bur\u00ad den of care falls predominantly on emergency rooms and is fi\u00adnanced primarily by the public sector. 2 Addressing the health needs of this vulnerable popula\u00adtion is thus not only an ethical imperative, but also of crucial importance from both a fiscal and a public health perspective. Correctional facilities are a critical component of the public \u00ad s afety infrastructure, but many observers believe that the social and economic costs associated with the unprecedented expan\u00adsion of the U.S. correctional sys\u00adtem now far outweigh the bene\u00adfits. State correctional spending has increased by 300% since 1980, to $50 billion annually; it's now the fastest \u00adg rowing area of gov\u00ad ernment spending after Medic\u00adaid. 1 In Rhode Island, the aver\u00ad age cost in 2008 of incarcerating an inmate for 1 year was $41,346; for an inmate in a super maxi\u00admum security setting, the cost jumps to $109,026 annually. Five states now spend more on cor\u00adrections than they do on higher education. 1 As alternatives to in\u00ad carceration, addiction and men\u00adtal health treatment programs are Medicine and Incarceration in the United States Prevalence of Medical Conditions among Federal and State Prisoners, Jail Inmates, and the Noninstitutionalized U.S. Population.* ConditionFederal InmatesState InmatesJail InmatesU.S. Population percent medical condition 38.5 42.8 38.7 NA Diabetes mellitus 11.1 10.1 8.1 6.5 Hypertension 29.5 30.8 27.9 25.6 Prior myocardial infarction 4.5 5.7 2.1 3.0 Persistent kidney problems 6.3 4.5 4.1 NAPersistent asthma 7.7 9.8 8.6 7.5 Persistent cirrhosis 2.2 1.8 1.8 NA Persistent hepatitis 4.6 5.7 4.6 NA HIV infection 0.9 1.7 1.6 0.5 Symptoms of mental health disorders 39.8 49.2 60.5 10.6 Major depressive disorder 16.0 23.5 29.7 7.9Mania disorder 35.1 43.2 54.5 1.8 Psychotic disorder 10.2 15.4 23.9 3.1 * Data are from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and a 2009 study from the Cambridge Health Alliance.

Perhaps foremost among these is that opened up by health care reform: the Affordable Care Act will permit most former prison\u00aders to receive health insurance coverage, which will offer them greater access to much \u00adn eeded medical care. Such access could redirect many people with seri\u00adous illnesses away from the re\u00advolving door of the criminal jus\u00adtice system, thereby improving overall public health in the com\u00admunities to which prisoners re\u00adturn and decreasing the costs as\u00adsociated with reincarceration due to untreated addiction and men\u00adtal illness. To achieve these gains, we will need to ensure linkages to medical homes that provide substance \u00adu se and mental health treatment for reentering popula\u00adtions. Partnerships between cor\u00adrectional facilities and community health care providers \u2014 espe\u00adcially community health centers and academic medical centers \u2014 can capitalize on health gains made during incarceration and improve the continuity of care for former inmates during the critical post \u00adr elease period. The success of this effort will deter\u00admine not only the health of re\u00adleased prisoners, but that of our society as a whole. Locking up millions of people for drug \u00adr elated crimes has failed as a public \u00ads afety strategy and has harmed public health in the communities to which these men and women return. A new evi\u00addence \u00adb ased approach is desper\u00ad ately needed. We believe that in addition to capitalizing on the public health opportunities that incarceration presents, the medi\u00adcal community and policymakers must advocate for alternatives to imprisonment, drug \u00adp olicy reform, and increased public awareness of this crisis in order to reduce mass incarceration and its collateral consequences.

Greene, M.D. It has been 40 years since the Journal published a seminal ar\u00ad ticle by Herbst et al. (1971;284: 878 \u00ad8 1) noting the association of in utero exposure to a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen, diethylstil\u00adbestrol (DES), and the develop\u00adment of a rare clear \u00adc ell adeno\u00ad carcinoma (CCA) of the vagina in young women 15 to 22 years later. The identification of an in utero exposure that caused alter\u00adations to the anatomical and his\u00adtologic structure of the female genital tract, infertility, and malig\u00adnant transformation has changed medical thinking about both the embryologic development of the genital tract and the mechanism of carcinogenesis. DES was developed in 1938 and used widely, including as a supplement to cattle feed in the 1960s and in humans for symp\u00adtom relief from estrogen \u00add efi\u00ad ciency states, postpartum lacta\u00adtion suppression, and treatment of prostate and breast cancer. De\u00adspite some evidence to the con\u00adtrary, a 1948 study suggested that DES taken in early pregnancy pre\u00advented miscarriage. 1 Over the subsequent two decades, and de\u00adspite mounting evidence of lack of efficacy, DES was commonly prescribed for that purpose. Ulti\u00admately, however, it was acknowl\u00adedged to be ineffective in the pre\u00advention of miscarriage. The exact number of offspring exposed to DES in utero is unknown but is thought to be several million.
