Millions of workers had lost their jobs, hundreds of thousands of businesses closed, supply chains were snarled, and schools were still shuttered. Families across the Nation were feeling real pain. But today, 230 million Americans have been vaccinated. We have created a record 12 million jobs, and unemployment is at a more than 50-year low, with near-record lows for Black and Latino workers and women. Wages are rising, inflation is slowing, manufacturing is booming, and our economy is growing. More Americans have health insurance than ever before, and a record 10 million Americans have applied to start a small business\u2014each application an act of hope. Our economic plan for the Nation is working, and American families are starting to have a little more breathing room. I ran for President to rebuild our economy from the bottom up and middle out, not from the top down\u2014because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do well. We all do well. For too long, though, the backbone of America, the middle class, has been hollowed out. Too many American jobs were shipped overseas. Unions were weak - ened. Once-thriving cities and towns have become shadows of what they were. My economic vision is about investing in those places and people who have been forgotten. That is what we have done in these historic past 2 years. Together, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act are among the most significant public investments in our Nation's history, expected to draw more than $3.5 trillion in public and private funding for infrastructure and industries of the future\u2014including clean energy. It is simple: you cannot be the number one economy in the world unless you have the best infrastructure in the world. So we are finally rebuilding our roads, bridges, railways, ports, airports, water systems, and more to keep our people safe, our goods moving, and our economy growing. We have already announced over 20,000 projects and awards, creating tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs while requiring that all construc-tion materials are made in America. Americans everywhere can take pride in seeing shovels in the ground for that work. Meanwhile, the CHIPS and Science Act is making sure America once again leads the world in developing and manufacturing the semiconductors that power everything from cellphones to cars. The United States invented those chips, and it is time that we make them at home again so our economy never again relies on chips manufactured abroad. Private companies have already pledged $300 billion in new investments in American manufacturing, many thanks to this law, and they are breaking ground on facilities that will employ tens of thousands of Americans with good jobs and breathe new life into communities across the United States. At the same time, we are taking on powerful special interests to cut costs for working fami- lies\u2014for example, lowering healthcare and prescription drug costs by extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and capping insulin prices and out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare. The Inflation Reduction Act also gives Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices, lowering prices for Americans and saving taxpayers billions of dollars a year. It makes the world's most 2 THe BUDG eT MeSSAG e OF TH e P R e SID e NT significant investment in fighting the existential threat of climate change\u2014lowering families' utility bills, building cleaner and more resilient water systems, investing in rural communities, and leading the world to a clean energy economy. Throughout, we have delivered on our commitment to fiscal responsibility, cutting the defi - cit by more than $1.7 trillion in the first 2 years of my Administration\u2014the largest reduction in American history. I have signed into law additional deficit reduction by finally making the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share, including with a new 15 percent minimum tax on billion-dollar corporations, many of which had been paying zero in taxes. We have also stood firm in our commitment to not raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 a year. Now, it is time to finish the job, building on the ambitious progress we have made with new investments in America's future. My 2024 Budget is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America in a fiscally responsible way that leaves no one behind. The Budget continues lowering costs for families\u2014with new measures to expand health coverage, cap prescription drug costs, invest in quality child care, build affordable housing, reduce home energy bills, make college more afford - able, and more. This Budget protects and strengthens Social Security and Medicare\u2014lifelines that tens of millions of seniors have paid into their whole lives with every paycheck so they can retire with dignity. It rejects any cuts to these programs, extends the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by at least 25 years, and invests in service delivery so that seniors and people with disabilities can access the benefits they have earned. This Budget also keeps growing our economy by investing in the foundation of its strength: the American people. That means help - ing families by providing paid family and medical leave and restoring the full Child Tax Credit, which cut child poverty in half in 2021 to the lowest level in history. It means expanding small business loans; standing up for workers and their fundamental right to organize; investing in science and innovation; expanding access to preschool; and improving pathways to community college, career-connected high schools, and other high-quality job training. It also means work - ing hard to make our communities safer, expanding access to mental healthcare, ending cancer as we know it, and much more. In addition, this Budget cements our commitment to confronting global challenges and keep - ing America safe. It outlines crucial investments to out-compete China globally and to continue support for Ukraine in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression. It also continues our work to restore America's global leadership\u2014reviving key alliances and partnerships, strengthening our military, fostering democracy and human rights, protecting global health, honoring our veterans, fixing our immigration system at home, and advancing cybersecurity through implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy I just signed. Importantly, my Budget does all of this while lowering deficits by nearly $3 trillion over the next decade. We more than fully pay for these investments in our future by asking the wealthy and big corporations to pay their fair share. We propose a billionaire minimum tax, requiring the wealthiest Americans to pay at least 25 percent on all of their income, including appreci - ated assets\u2014because no billionaire should ever pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter. This Budget also proposes quadrupling the tax on corporate stock buybacks, so companies invest more in production to improve quality and lower prices, and less in buybacks that only benefit shareholders and C eOs. This Budget closes tax loopholes for the wealthy and cracks down on tax cheats, and it once again ensures that no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more in new taxes, period. Today, our Nation is at an inflection point that will determine our future for decades to come. But because of the investments that we have made, the United States of America is better THe BUDG eT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 3 positioned to lead than any Nation on earth. The Budget reflects our values as a Nation\u2014a Nation of good people, growing in a new age of possibilities, and standing as a beacon to the world. Together, let us put those values into practice and prove that democracy delivers as we keep building a stronger, fairer economy that leaves no one behind. JOSePH R. BID eN JR. The WhiTe hoUse, March 20235DELIVERING RESULTS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE When the President took office, America faced acute and historic challenges: a once-in-a-centu- ry pandemic; an economy gripped by the most severe downturn since the Great Depression; a worsening climate crisis; and a legacy of racial in - justice. From the first days of his Administration, the President moved swiftly to tackle these chal - lenges, deliver results for the American people, and ensure the Nation emerged stronger than ever. Two years later, while significant challeng - es remain, America has made historic progress under the President's leadership. GROWING THE ECONOMY FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND MIDDLE OUT In January 2021, the President inherited a pandemic that was raging and an economy that was reeling. Roughly one percent of Americans were fully vaccinated, less than half of the Nation's schools were open for in-person instruc - tion, and the virus had dramatically upended the lives of Americans all across the Nation. More than 10 million Americans were unable to find work and the unemployment rate stood at 6.3 percent. Millions of women were forced to drop out of the labor force. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses had shuttered. The American economy was facing one of its darkest moments in a generation. In the face of these crises, the President imme - diately took action to rescue the economy. Within months of taking office, he signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (American Rescue Plan), which helped change the course of the pandemic and jumpstart a historic recovery. The American Rescue Plan funded an unprec- edented vaccination campaign that has helped fully vaccinate nearly 230 million Americans against COVID-19, re-opened schools for in-per - son learning, helped 200,000 child care provid-ers keep their doors open, helped cut child pov- erty nearly in half in 2021, provided emergency rental assistance payments to households that may have otherwise faced eviction, and delivered critical relief to American families. even as the President took urgent action to bring the economy back from the pandemic and jumpstart a recovery, he also began implement - ing his strategy to rebuild the U.S. economy from the bottom up and middle out\u2014not from the top down. Over the course of just two years, the President amassed a series of historic legisla - tive accomplishments and took executive actions that are laying the foundation for steady and stable growth over the long term\u2014rebuilding America's infrastructure and building a clean energy economy, fueling a manufacturing boom that is bringing record investment and jobs back to the United States, supporting workers and small businesses, promoting fair competition, and lowering costs for families on everything from prescription drugs to healthcare to energy bills. Just over two years after the President took of- fice, it is clear that his economic strategy is work - ing. Since January 2021, the economy has added more than 12 million jobs\u2014more jobs created in just two years than any president has ever cre - ated in an entire four-year term. The job mar - ket has recovered all of the jobs that were lost 6 DeLIVeRING ReSULTS FOR TH e A M e RICAN Pe OPL e during the pandemic\u2014and faster than in the past three recoveries. The unemployment rate has fallen from 6.3 percent to 3.4 percent\u2014the lowest level in 54 years. Hispanic and African American unemployment rates are near record lows. As of January 2023, women's unemployment, which was more severely impacted by the onset of the pandemic, is at its lowest level in 70 years. More Americans are working than at any point in American history. 2021 and 2022 were the two best years for small business creation on record. Companies have invested more than $300 billion in American manufacturing since the President took office. The President's actions to lower pre - scription drug costs and make the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share will reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming decade. To close tax loopholes that allow some of the most profitable corporations in the United States to avoid paying Federal income taxes, the President signed into law a 15-percent minimum tax on the profits that large corporations\u2014those with over $1 billion in profits\u2014report to share - holders. He signed into law a surcharge on cor - porate stock buybacks, which encourages busi - nesses to invest in their growth and productivity as opposed to paying out corporate executive prof - its or funneling tax-preferred profits to wealthy shareholders. The President signed legislation into law that will crack down on wealthy tax cheats\u2014without increasing audit rates for fami-lies or small businesses making under $400,000 per year. Providing Families More Breathing Room and Economic Security As the economy continues to transition from a historically strong recovery to stable, steady growth, the President has remained laser-focused on his top economic priority: taking action to lower costs for working families and give the American people more breathing room. While more work remains\u2014and the Nation could see setbacks along the way\u2014there are clear signs that the President's economic strategy is working: annual inflation has fallen over the past six months, even as the labor market remains strong and real wag - es are rising. The strength of America's jobs recovery, along with the Administration's policies designed to help workers and families, have left families more economically secure than before the pan - demic. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, house-holds are now less likely to be delinquent on their credit card bills and mortgages, and more likely to have health insurance. A record-setting 16.3 million people signed up for Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) coverage this year, and the national uninsured rate hit an all-time low last year. Families are facing fewer evictions and foreclosures than they were before the pandemic, and bankruptcy rates are lower as well. This economic security is giv-ing families peace of mind and breathing room that they did not have before the pandemic. Child poverty also fell to a historic low in 2021, and the President has taken action to lift nearly one mil - lion children out of poverty by modernizing nutri-tion benefits. Last summer, the President signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (Public Law 117-169), his-toric legislation to lower costs for families, build a clean energy economy and combat the climate crisis, reduce the deficit, and finally ask the larg - est corporations to begin to pay their fair share\u2014 all while ensuring that no one making less than $400,000 per year would pay a penny more in tax-es. The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescrip-tion drug costs by capping out of pocket expenses for seniors at $2,000 per year and finally letting Medicare negotiate prices. It lowers healthcare costs by ensuring millions of Americans continue to save hundreds per year on health insurance premiums. Consumers in these plans saved an average of $800 on their premiums in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan. It lowers ener - gy costs by putting America on track to meet the President's climate goals, which will save families an average of $500 per year on their energy costs. At the beginning of this year, key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act took effect that BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 7 are already delivering results for the American people. As of January 2023, insulin is capped at $35 for a monthly prescription, more recom - mended vaccines\u2014including shingles and teta - nus\u2014are free for Americans on Medicare Part D, and pharmaceutical companies have to write a check to Medicare if they raise drug prices faster than inflation. When working- and middle-class Americans buy an electric vehicle or make their homes more efficient, they can now get a tax cred - it\u2014putting money back in their pockets while helping accelerate a clean energy transition that leaves no one behind. At the same time, the Administration has worked to unsnarl pandemic-driven supply chain bottlenecks that contributed to higher prices, helping further ease inflationary pressures. Within months of taking office, the President signed two landmark executive Orders direct - ing agencies to fortify the Nation's critical supply chains. The President also launched a first-ever Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force, designed to pivot, adapt, and surge support to immediate and evolving supply chain challenges. Together, these actions have made an impact. Despite dire warnings of a looming supply chain meltdown ahead of the holidays in 2021, holiday season delivery times were below pre-pandemic levels and more than 97 percent of packages were de - livered on time or with minimal delays. Progress strengthening America's supply chains continued in 2022. The average cost of shipping an ocean container is trending down, congestion at major ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach has eased, and more than 90 percent of goods at grocery stores and drug stores are in stock and available on shelves\u2014in line with pre-pandemic averages. The President has also taken bold action to help address high gas prices resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last year, the President au - thorized the historic release of 180 million bar - rels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and he rallied international partners to release an unprecedented amount of oil to stabilize global markets. Today, gas prices in the United States have fallen sharply from their summer peak in 2022, even as the economy and job growth have remained strong. Promoting Competition and Entrepreneurship The President's economic plan is also focused on promoting fair competition across the American economy to help ensure small businesses and en - trepreneurs have an opportunity to thrive. As the President has said, \"capitalism without competi - tion isn't capitalism. It's exploitation.\" In July 2021, the President signed a his- toric executive Order creating a White House Competition Council and directing Federal agen-cies to take action to spur greater competition across industries. Since then, agencies have made significant progress implementing the executive Order\u2014taking more than 90 actions across ma-jor sectors of the economy. Already, those actions have helped level the playing field for small businesses and unlocked real savings for the American people. The Administration's actions to crack down on unfair hidden junk fees are producing results. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has targeted overdraft and bounced check fees, sur - prise overdraft fees, and surprise depositor fees\u2014 efforts that have already driven changes at 15 of the largest 20 banks and that are expected to re - duce fees by more than $1 billion annually. The Department of Transportation (DOT) proposed a rule to require airlines and online booking ser - vices to show the full price of a plane ticket up front. DOT also published a dashboard of airline policies when flights are delayed or cancelled due to issues under the airlines' control, leading nine airlines to change policies to guarantee coverage of hotels and 10 airlines to guarantee coverage of meals, none of which were guaranteed before. The Federal Communications Commission re - leased new rules that will go into effect next year to require broadband providers to use \"nutrition labels\"\u2014similar to those used for food products\u2014to convey key information to consumers about in - ternet service options in an accessible format. 8 DeLIVeRING ReSULTS FOR TH e A M e RICAN Pe OPL e At the same time, the President has taken ac- tion to help lower the average cost of hearing aids by as much as $3,000 per pair by allowing Americans to purchase hearing aids over-the- counter\u2014producing savings for the nearly 30 million Americans with hearing loss. The Federal Trade Commission released a proposed rule to ban non-compete clauses, which stifles wage growth for American workers by making it more diffi - cult for workers to leave for higher-paying jobs. In December 2022, the President signed into law the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, which updated merger filing fees for the first time in more than 20 years, raising them on the larger mergers that contribute to consolidation and re- duce competition while lowering fees on smaller acquisitions. To help lower shipping costs, the President also worked with the Congress to pass the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022, which will cut costs for shippers, and in turn American families, and ensure fairer treatment for exports sent by American farmers and ranchers. Powering a Manufacturing Boom across America A core part of the President's economic plan is an industrial strategy to revitalize America's manufacturing base, strengthen supply chains, and position U.S. workers and businesses to lead in global competition\u2014and that strategy is pay - ing off. Since January 2021, the economy has added more than 800,000 manufacturing jobs, the most jobs added over a two-year period in over 35 years. Manufacturing as a share of Gross Domestic Product has returned to pre-pandemic levels\u2014a faster recovery than any other busi - ness cycle since 1953. The President's plan has catalyzed private investment that will grow the economy, ensure that those benefits are broadly shared in communities across the Nation, and bring good-paying manufacturing jobs back from overseas. In August 2022, the President signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act (Public Law 117-167)\u2014historic bipartisan legislation that is help-ing power America's manufacturing boom and bringing supply chains\u2014and jobs\u2014back to the United States. The law serves as a down pay- ment on the future of discovery that will create good-paying manufacturing jobs, support local economies and communities, connect regional industries with high-tech research and devel - opment, and bolster U.S. competitiveness glob - ally. The CHIPS and Science Act, along with the Inflation Reduction Act, have sent clear signals to the private sector about the demand for clean energy and innovative technologies. In just the two years since the President took office, the Administration's actions have spurred more than $700 billion in private investment in manufac - turing, utilities, and energy from more than 200 companies in all 50 States. The President has also delivered on his com- mitment to make the promise of Buy American real. In his first week in office, he issued an executive Order that created the first-ever Made in America Office within the Office of Management and Budget, strengthened and cen - tralized the waiver review process, and directed the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council to close loopholes in Buy American regulations. Since then, the FAR Council published the most significant updates to the Buy American Act in nearly 70 years to ensure taxpayer dollars create good-paying jobs here at home, strengthen criti- cal supply chains, and position U.S. businesses to compete in strategic industries. These new rules already raised the domestic content threshold to qualify as Made in America from 55 percent to 60 percent\u2014part of a phased increase up to 75 percent by 2029. BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 9 DELIVERING PROGRESS ACROSS AMERICA As the President's economic plan continues to produce results, the Administration has also de- livered historic progress that is helping build a better America\u2014rebuilding the Nation's crum-bling infrastructure, leading the world in tack - ling the climate crisis, delivering for veterans, making America's communities safer, promoting women's health, and advancing equity across the U.S. economy and Nation. Rebuilding America's Infrastructure For decades, members of both parties in Washington have talked about the urgency of rebuilding America's crumbling infrastructure\u2014 without ever delivering. But in the fall of 2021, after working across the aisle to forge consen - sus and compromise, the President signed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law)\u2014a once-in-a-generation investment in the Nation's infrastruc - ture and competitiveness that is ushering in an infrastructure decade. In the year-and-a-half since the President signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Administration has been hard at work delivering on the law's promise: rebuilding roads, bridges, ports, and airports; upgrading public transit and rail systems; replacing lead pipes to provide clean water; cleaning up pollution to protect the health of Americans; providing affordable, high-speed internet to every family in America; delivering cheaper and cleaner energy; and creating good-paying jobs. To date, the Administration has announced nearly $200 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and more than 20,000 spe - cific projects, reaching over 4,500 communities across all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Territories. That funding has allowed the Administration to: launch 3,700 bridge repair and replacement projects across the Nation; begin re- pair of over 69,000 miles of roadway; award funds for more than 3,000 new clean transit school buses; increase enrollment in the Affordable Connectivity program that helps ensure house - holds can afford the high speed internet they need for work, school, healthcare, and more to over 16 million households; and approve State plans for water funding, electric vehicle charging networks, and high-speed internet deployment. earlier this year, the President announced awards for regionally or nationally-significant projects, including over $2 billion to upgrade some of the Nation's most economically signifi- cant bridges and over $1.2 billion in Mega grants. These infrastructure investments will create good-paying jobs\u2014including union jobs and jobs that do not require a four-year college degree. The projects will grow the economy, strengthen sup - ply chains, improve mobility for residents, and make America's transportation systems safer for all users. To ensure projects are delivered on time, on task, and on budget, the Administration released The Biden-Harris Permitting Action Plan to Rebuild America's Infrastructure, Accelerate the Clean Energy Transition, Revitalize Communities, and Create Jobs to strengthen Federal permitting and environmental reviews, as well as The Biden-Harris Action Plan for Accelerating Infrastructure with more than 20 commitments from Federal agencies pledging to speed progress. The Administration also launched the Infrastructure Talent Pipeline Challenge, with more than 350 commitments from companies, colleges, and non - profits to invest in workforce development. Leading the World to Tackle the Climate Crisis In the two years since taking office, the President's leadership to tackle the climate crisis has boosted U.S. manufacturing and deployment of cost-cutting clean energy technologies, put the Nation on a durable path aligned with limiting warming to 1.5 \u00b0C, galvanized global action by partners and the private sector, and advanced en - vironmental justice.10 DeLIVeRING ReSULTS FOR TH e A M e RICAN Pe OPL e On the first day of his Administration, the President rejoined the Paris Agreement\u2014 strengthening international partnerships that are key to addressing the climate crisis on the global stage. The President set an ambitious do - mestic goal to reduce greenhouse gas pollution 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 and has rallied countries around the world to make their own bold contributions. At the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the President an - nounced that America would lead the way as the first Nation to require major Federal contractors to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emis - sions and climate-related financial risks and set science-based emissions reduction targets. In signing the Inflation Reduction Act last year, the President secured the largest invest-ment to advance energy security and combat cli - mate change in American history. The Inflation Reduction Act makes direct investments in inno - vation and deployment of cost-saving clean ener - gy technologies while lowering costs for American families who electrify their homes, purchase electric vehicles, and install rooftop solar. As cli - mate disasters continue to threaten communities across the Nation, the law also includes critical investments in climate resilience. The Inflation Reduction Act will spur unprecedented actions to ensure that these transformative investments create good-paying and union American jobs and benefit low-income and disadvantaged communi - ties\u2014including through a new $3 billion grant program for community-based organizations that work to address local pollution concerns. At the same time, the Administration has launched numerous initiatives to accelerate America's clean energy future and conserve America's ecosystems. To jumpstart an electric transportation future that is Made in America, the President brought together automakers and autoworkers around an ambitious goal that 50 percent of vehicles sold by 2030 will be electric. The Administration has announced new climate-smart agriculture and forestry initiatives, protec - tions for cherished landscapes and habitats, and the America the Beautiful Initiative to conserve 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. To ensure no one is left out of the benefits of the clean energy economy, the President established the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plan Communities and economic Revitalization to direct Federal technical assistance and re - sources toward investments in the places that kept America's lights on for generations. environmental justice is embedded in all the work the Administration is doing to tackle the climate crisis. The President's Justice40 initia-tive ensures that 40 percent of the benefits from Federal investments in climate and clean en - ergy are delivered to disadvantaged communi- ties. The Administration launched a Climate and economic Justice Screening Tool to help agencies better identify communities that can benefit from the Justice40 Initiative. Honoring America's Commitment to the Nation's Veterans One of the Nation's most sacred obligations is to care for America's veterans, their families, care- givers, and survivors. The President delivered on this commitment by signing the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), the most significant bill in American history to address veterans' exposure to burn pits and other toxic substances. Under the law, more than five million veterans will be eligible for services, including expanded access to healthcare and disability compensation benefits. The PACT Act also expands access to benefits and services for veterans' families, caregivers, and survivors, and strengthens the President's Cancer Moonshot ini - tiative, making progress toward addressing rare cancers that make up approximately 25 percent of all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) cancer diagnoses. The Administration is also taking key steps to address veteran suicide. In July 2022, VA tran-sitioned the Veterans Crisis Line to the new 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline's national network, making it easier for veterans in crisis to connect BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 11 to more than 500 suicide prevention coordinators and ensuring follow-up services. Recognizing the diversity of America's veter - ans, the Administration is also taking action to advance equity across veterans' services. In the last year, VA committed to improving maternal health and expanded access to specialized cancer screenings and reproductive healthcare. In addi - tion to ending the ban on transgender service, the Administration is committed to providing gender affirming care to the Nation's veterans\u2014and last year, the VA announced that it was extending survivor benefits to certain survivors of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex veterans. Making America's Communities Safer From day one, the President has taken deci - sive and historic action to make America's com-munities safer. Last year, the President brought Members of Congress from both parties together to secure the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act\u2014the first significant piece of legislation to address the epidemic of gun violence in America's com - munities in three decades. This historic legisla - tion expands background checks and funds crisis intervention, including red-flag laws, and helps keep guns out of the hands of people, including convicted dating partners, who are a danger to themselves and others. The Act makes historic investments in violence prevention and reduction programs, addresses the youth mental crisis by expanding community violence prevention pro - grams, and expands trauma-informed services to mitigate the impact of violence. It also builds on the Administration's efforts to crack down on ghost guns, rogue dealers, and gun trafficking. The President has also been clear about the Administration's commitment to investing in safe, effective, and accountable community po - licing and crime prevention. In December 2022, the President signed the bipartisan funding bill that increased funding for the Department of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Solutions Office by more than $150 million and included $50 million for the Agency's Community Violence Intervention programs. In addition to these criti - cal investments, the President issued a historic executive Order last year to advance effective accountable policing and reform America's crimi - nal justice system. The Administration is also strategically deploying historic funding to reduce gun crime. The Administration made certain American Rescue Plan funding\u2014$350 billion in State and local funding, and $122 billion in K-12 funding\u2014available as unprecedented resources for States and cities to invest in hiring officers for accountable community policing, as well as crime prevention and intervention. Promoting Women's Healthcare and Defending Reproductive Rights In June 2022, the Supreme Court issued the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated a woman's constitutional right to choose, taking away a right from the American people that had been the law of the land for nearly 50 years. In the wake of this ruling, the President has been clear that the only way to secure a wom - an's right to choose is for the Congress to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe. In addition, the President has defended reproductive rights and protected access to safe and legal abortion\u2014 including signing two e xecutive Orders and a Presidential Memorandum to safeguard access to medication abortion and contraception, ensure patients receive emergency medical care and healthcare free from discrimination, protect pa - tients' and doctors' privacy, and support patients traveling out of State for medical care. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act and the Administration's work to protect and expand it, more Americans have healthcare coverage than at any other time in history\u2014and women can no longer be charged more for health insur - ance simply because they are women. Last year, the Administration approved requests from more than half of the States and the District of Columbia to extend postpartum Medicaid 12 DeLIVeRING ReSULTS FOR TH e A M e RICAN Pe OPL e coverage to 12 months. In June 2022, the President and Vice President released the Administration's Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis, a whole-of-Government approach for com - batting maternal mortality and morbidity and re- ducing persistent disparities. Advancing Equity On his first day in office, the President signed a sweeping e xecutive Order directing the entire Federal Government to advance an ambitious equity and racial justice agenda\u2014not as a one-year project, but as part of a sustained commit - ment to make the promise of America real for every American. Since then, the Administration has made significant progress advancing equity across the Federal Government, including by re- leasing a second executive Order that strength - ens its ability to create opportunities for commu-nities and populations that have been historically underserved, and continues to build an America in which all can participate, prosper, and reach their full potential. The President also hosted the first White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in over 50 years and released the Biden-Harris Administration National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health (National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health) to end hunger and reduce diet-related chronic diseases, which dis- proportionately impact historically underserved communities, by 2030. The National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health provides a road-map of actions Federal agencies will take and makes a call to action to all sectors of society to collectively achieve the President's goals. The Administration has also announced new steps to advance economic justice. These include taking action to eliminate administrative bar - riers that disproportionately impact workers of color, delivering equitable infrastructure invest- ments through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, advancing environmental justice through the Justice40 Initiative, and making his - toric investments in tribal communities. The Administration has also made progress deliver - ing on the President's goal of increasing the share of awards to small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) from roughly 10 percent to 15 percent by 2025. In 2021, the Administration awarded a record level of contracting dollars to SDBs, and based on initial data, 2022 is expected to exceed that record. The Administration has deployed record in - vestments to tribal nations and Native commu- nities, including through the American Rescue Plan, the largest direct Federal investment in Indian Country in history, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest single investment in infrastructure for Indian Country ever. The Administration has taken additional steps to: im - prove and standardize tribal consultation; expand protections for tribal victims under the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022; develop new public safety and justice strategies for Native communities, including to address the epidemic of missing or murdered Indigenous people; and secure\u2014for the first time in history\u2014 advance appropriations for the Indian Health Service, which would ensure a more predictable funding stream and improve health outcomes across Indian Country. In April 2022, the President launched the Rural Partners Network (RPN), which is now support - ing 37 rural communities across 10 States and Puerto Rico. RPN is an all-of-Government pro - gram that partners with rural and tribal people to access resources and funding to create local jobs, build infrastructure, and support long-term economic stability on their own terms. Through RPN, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is hiring new full-time Federal staff who are from the region to work hand in hand with RPN com - munity leaders. There are 20 Federal agencies, including regional commissions, contributing to RPN to ensure selected rural communities have access to the full breadth of resources across the Federal Government. The President has also signed historic bipar - tisan legislation to ensure women and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 13 Americans are treated equitably under the law. Last year, the President signed the Respect for Marriage Act to ensure that every American\u2014 no matter their race, gender, or sexual orienta - tion\u2014can marry the person they love without the threat of government interference. The bipartisan funding bill the President signed in December 2022 included the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act\u2014which provides long-overdue protections for pregnant workers\u2014as well as $700 million for the Violence Against Women Act, the highest funding level in history for the landmark law the President first authored and championed in 1994 and reauthorized in March 2022. Making Progress to End Cancer as We Know It One year ago, the President and First Lady reignited the Cancer Moonshot, setting an ambi- tious, achievable goal: to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years, and improve the experience of people and families living with and surviving cancer, ul - timately ending cancer as we know it today. The Cancer Moonshot has spurred tremendous action across the Federal Government and from the public and private sectors, building a strong foundation for the work ahead. The President stood up the first-ever Cancer Cabinet to mobilize the Federal Government, and called on individu- als, healthcare providers, and leaders across sec - tors to step up and take action in five key priority areas: 1) close the screening gap; 2) understand and address environmental and toxic exposure; 3) decrease the impact of preventable cancers; 4) bring cutting-edge research through the pipe - line to patients and communities; and 5) support patients and caregivers. To date, the Cancer Moonshot has announced over 25 new programs, policies, and resources to address these five priority areas. More than 60 private companies, non-profits, academic institutions, and patient groups have also stepped up with new actions and collaborations. Notably, this includes at least one major ad - vancement in each of these priority areas. To im - prove cancer screening, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued grants as part of an ongoing five-year total investment greater than $1 billion to advance cancer prevention and control reaching every State, Territory, and tribal organizations and the National Cancer Institute launched a large national trial that could identify effective blood tests for the de - tection of one or more cancers. Due to the President's leadership in delivering biparti- san legislation, the environmental Protection Agency, through Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, is cleaning up toxic sites and replacing lead pipes and service lines as part of efforts to address environmental and toxic exposures. In addition, VA is implementing the President's bipartisan PACT Act, which includes cancer as a priority category for veterans' benefits claims, helping these veterans gain more timely access to healthcare and other financial benefits. In cancer prevention, USDA announced its new Agricultural Science Center of excellence for Nutrition and Diet for Better Health to ac - celerate research on diet-related chronic dis- eases, including cancer as part of the Cancer Moonshot and National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health . To drive innovation, the President launched the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, a new agency to deliver new ways to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and other diseases, appointed its first- ever Director, and secured $2.5 billion in ini - tial investment, including $1.5 billion in the bipartisan funding bill the President signed in December 2022. In addition, to support pa - tients, tens of thousands of cancer patients could see their prescription drug costs go down by thousands annually because the President signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 per year for Medicare beneficiaries.14 DeLIVeRING ReSULTS FOR TH e A M e RICAN Pe OPL e KEEPING AMERICA SAFE AND RESTORING AMERICA'S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP As the President delivers results for the American people at home, he has also taken ac - tion to restore American leadership on the world stage\u2014leading with America's values, working in lockstep with America's allies and partners, investing in the Nation's military edge, and ad - dressing the most significant challenges and op- portunities before us. In the early years of what will be a decisive decade, America is better posi - tioned than any Nation on earth to win the com - petition for the 21 st Century. Under the President's leadership, the United States has rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine, deepened America's alliances with europe, and strengthened the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, including through congres - sional support for the accession of two new states, Sweden and Finland. America has provided tens of billions of dollars in direct military and budget - ary support to make sure the Ukrainian govern- ment can defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity and to protect and provide basic servic-es to the Ukrainian people, including healthcare, education, and emergency personnel. As Russia's invasion continues to displace Ukrainians, the United States has welcomed more than 275,000 Ukrainians seeking refuge since March 2022. In the Indo-Pacific, the President has taken ac - tion to deepen America's security and economic partnerships to shape the rules of the road and strengthen America's edge in the competition with China\u2014including hosting the first-ever U.S.- Pacific Islands Summit at the White House. At the 2022 G20 Summit in Indonesia, the President demonstrated the Administration's commitment to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which catalyzes public and private finance to advance climate and energy security, global health security, digital connectivity, gender equity and equality, and transportation infrastruc - ture across the world\u2014all while creating oppor - tunities for American businesses. The President has fostered democracy and shared prosperity in the Western Hemisphere through the Americas Partnership for economic Prosperity, a historic new agreement to drive Western Hemisphere economic recovery and growth and deliver for working people. The President also hosted the U.S.-Africa Leaders' Summit, underscoring America's commitment to expanding and deepen - ing America's partnership with African countries, institutions, and people, including supporting the African Union to join the G20 as a permanent member. Working with allies and partners, the President has moved swiftly to confront a broad range of pressing global challenges. From his first days in office, the President has led with a bold agenda to address the climate crisis and increase energy security at home and around the world. Through the President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE) , the United States is helping vulnerable nations build resilience to the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. The Administration is also embedding the costs of climate change into the investment strategies of U.S. development finance institutions and work - ing with America's partners to do the same. At the President's direction, the United States is also taking action to advance global public health. To protect the Nation and the world, the President committed to directly supporting at least 50 countries, by 2025, to strengthen and achieve regional, national, and local capacity in five critical areas to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. Since day one of the Administration, the President has called for a new mechanism to catalyze global progress to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, and togeth-er with the G20 and other partners, the United States helped launch and support a historic new Pandemic Fund at the World Bank. This fund is working at the national, regional, and global levels to support pandemic prevention, prepared - ness, and response while strengthening local health systems. In the face of growing threats to women's hu - man rights and opportunity around the world, the Administration continues to advance gender BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 15 equity and equality at home and abroad. The Administration has worked to prevent and re - spond to gender-based violence, including where rape is used as a weapon of war. In addition, the Administration has supported the full and equal participation of women and girls in the economy by addressing barriers to participation, which will improve economic security for women and families and promote economic growth and development. As America leads with diplomacy, a principled and adaptive U.S. military underpins America's global leadership. In line with the 2022 National Defense Strategy, the Department of Defense (DOD) is advancing American priorities through integrated deterrence, working seamlessly across all instruments of national power and America's global network of allies and partners, and buttressed by the strongest fighting force the world has ever known. The United States has made disciplined investments to design, develop, and manage a combat-credible force that can deter Chinese and Russian military aggression against vital U.S. national interests, and, if nec - essary, prevail in conflict if deterrence fails. These investments include modernizing America's nu-clear deterrent, building resilience in the cyber and space domains, and investing in new appli - cations of artificial intelligence, quantum science, and biotechnology with the potential to revolu - tionize how U.S. forces operate. America is act - ing urgently to build enduring advantages across the defense ecosystem\u2014not just within DOD, but also across the defense industrial base and the array of private sector and academic enterprises that create and sharpen the Joint Force's techno - logical edge. 17GROWING THE ECONOMY FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND MIDDLE OUT Under the President's leadership\u2014and thanks to the resilience of the American people\u2014 the United States has not only met historic challenges at home and abroad, but is poised to emerge stronger, more resilient, and more prosperous for decades to come. The President's economic strategy is producing results\u2014with record-breaking job creation, strong economic growth, major investments in infrastructure, a resurgence of American manufacturing, and historic legislative accomplishments that are laying the foundation for long-term economic prosperity. America is leading the world in: building a clean energy economy and combatting the climate crisis; turning a generational challenge into an opportunity to create jobs and strengthen U.S. energy security; leading the industries of the future; and advancing environmental justice. The United States has made smart investments in America's communities and people that are creating more opportunities and advancing equity, security, and dignity. The President has restored America's standing and leadership on the world stage\u2014rallying allies and partners to address some of the most pressing challenges around the globe. The President's Budget details a fiscally and economically responsible blueprint to build on this record of progress, deliver on the agenda he laid out in his State of the Union Address, and finish the job: continuing to lower costs for families; protecting and strengthening Medicare and Social Security; growing the economy from the bottom up and middle out by investing in America and its people; and reducing the deficit by asking the wealthy and big corporations to pay their fair share. Building on the historic Inflation Reduction Act and other key administrative actions, the Budget includes a package of proposals that would give the American people more breathing room and lower costs\u2014including for health insurance, prescription drugs, child care and preschool, higher education, and housing. The Budget honors the President's ironclad commitment to protecting and strengthening Medicare and Social Security\u2014rejecting any cuts to these programs, proposing reforms that would extend the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund by at least 25 years, and investing in service delivery to speed up claims processing and ensure Americans receive the Social Security benefits they have earned. The Budget proposes smart, targeted investments to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out by investing in America and its people. The Budget invests in the foundations of America's economic strength\u2014 from manufacturing and infrastructure, to education and job training. The Budget expands access to high quality healthcare, addresses long-standing public health challenges, and helps spur the next generation of medical breakthroughs that improve health outcomes in diseases such as cancer. The Budget makes historic investments to: combat the climate crisis; advance environmental justice; and ensure the clean energy future is invented, built, and made in America. The Budget also advances equity, dignity, and security across America's communities and economy\u2014making 18 GROWING TH e eCONOMY FROM TH e B OTTOM U P AND M IDDL e O UT communities safer and expanding the reach of America's promise. The Budget also reflects the Administration's commitment to achieving a better future of a free, open, secure and prosperous world, as laid out in the President's 2022 National Security Strategy . As America faces challenges from authoritarian powers with revisionist aims, a global climate crisis, and international economic pressures, it is clear that the need for a strong and purposeful American role in the world has never been greater. The Budget supports American leadership by investing in America's inherent national strengths: the ingenuity, creativity, resilience, and determination of the American people; America's values, diversity, and democratic institutions; America's technological leadership and economic dynamism; and America's diplomatic corps, development professionals, intelligence community, and military servicemembers, all of whom remain unparalleled. By investing in the underlying sources and tools of American power and influence, the Budget would help America build the strongest possible international coalition with the power to shape the global strategic environment and solve shared global challenges. In keeping with the President's commitment to fiscal responsibility, the Budget more than fully pays for all of its investments, strengthens the Nation's long-term fiscal health, and keeps the economic burden of debt low. The President's Budget reduces deficits by nearly $3 trillion over the next decade by asking the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair share\u2014while ensuring that no one making less than $400,000 pays a penny in new taxes and cutting taxes for families with children and low-income workers. LOWERING COSTS AND GIVING FAMILIES MORE BREATHING ROOM The President's top economic priority is lowering costs for working families and giving them more breathing room. While more work remains\u2014and while America could see more setbacks along the way\u2014there are clear signs that the President's strategy is working. Annual inflation has fallen for seven consecutive months. Gas prices are down roughly $1.60 per gallon since their peak last summer. Real wages are up over the last seven months for working Americans. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States is lowering costs for prescription drugs, healthcare, and energy for tens of millions of Americans all while lowering America's deficit. The Administration has taken action to eliminate junk fees, unsnarl pandemic-driven supply chain bottlenecks that increased prices, and promote greater competition across the American economy. The Budget builds on this record of progress through additional proposals to continue lowering everyday costs for the American people\u2014from health insurance and prescription drugs, to higher education and housing, to utilities and child care. Lowers Healthcare Costs. The President believes that healthcare should be a right, not a privilege. With enrollment in affordable health coverage at an all-time high, the Budget builds on the success of the Affordable Care Act by making permanent the expanded premium tax credits that the Inflation Reduction Act extended. The Budget also provides Medicaid-like coverage to individuals in States that have not adopted Medicaid expansion, paired with financial incentives to ensure States maintain their existing expansions. Reduces Drug and other Healthcare Costs for All Americans. The Budget builds upon the Inflation Reduction Act to continue lowering the cost of prescription drugs. For Medicare, this includes further strengthening its newly established negotiation power by negotiating more drugs and bringing drugs into negotiation BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 19 sooner after they launch. The Budget also proposes to limit Medicare Part D cost-sharing for high-value generic drugs, such as certain generic drugs used for chronic conditions like hypertension and high cholesterol, to no more than $2. For Medicaid, the Budget includes proposals to ensure Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are prudent purchasers of prescriptions drugs, such as authorizing the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate supplemental drug rebates on behalf of interested States in order to pool purchasing power. For the commercial market, the Budget includes proposals to curb inflation in prescription drug prices and cap the prices of insulin products at $35 for a monthly prescription. Expands Access to Affordable, High- Quality Early Child Care and Learning. The Budget advances the President's goal of ensuring that all families can access affordable, high-quality child care and free, high-quality preschool, helping children learn, giving families breathing room, and growing the economy. The President's plan enables States to increase child care options for more than 16 million young children and lower costs so that parents can afford to send their children to the high-quality child care program of their choice, allowing them to go to work or pursue training with the peace of mind that their children are being set up for a lifetime of success. The Budget also funds a Federal-State partnership that provides high-quality, universal, free preschool, offered in the setting of a parent's choice\u2014from public schools to child care providers to Head Start\u2014to support healthy child development and ensure children enter kindergarten ready to succeed. The proposal enables States to increase preschool access and quality. The Budget provides access to high- quality preschool to all of the approximately four million four-year-old children in the Nation, and gives States the flexibility to expand preschool to three-year-olds after preschool is available to all four-year-olds. The estimated cost of these child care and preschool investments is $600 billion over 10 years.For 2024, the Budget also provides $22.1 billion for HHS's existing early care and education programs, an increase of $2.1 billion over the 2023 enacted level. This includes $9 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, an increase of nearly $1 billion over the 2023 enacted level, to expand access to quality, affordable child care for families across the Nation. The Budget helps young children enter kindergarten ready to learn by providing $13.1 billion for Head Start, an increase of $1.1 billion over the 2023 enacted level. In addition, the Budget includes $500 million for a demonstration program in the Department of education to create or expand free, high-quality preschool in school or community-based settings, including Head Start, for children eligible to attend Title I schools. Increases Affordable Housing Supply to Reduce Costs. To address the critical shortage of affordable housing in communities throughout the Nation, the Budget includes $59 billion in mandatory funding and tax incentives aimed at increasing the affordable housing supply. The Budget also includes $10 billion in mandatory funding to incentivize State, local, and regional jurisdictions to make progress in removing barriers to affordable housing developments, such as restrictive zoning. These investments would increase the development of affordable rental and owner-occupied housing, including units affordable to extremely low-income families. By expanding the supply of housing, the Budget would help curb cost growth across the broader housing market. The Budget also provides $1.8 billion for the HOM e Investment Partnerships Program (HOM e), an increase of $300 million over the 2023 enacted level, to construct and rehabilitate affordable rental housing and provide homeownership opportunities. In addition, the Budget provides $258 million to support 2,200 units of new permanently affordable housing specifically for the elderly and persons with disabilities, supporting the Administration's priority to maximize independent living for people with disabilities; and $459 million for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) rural housing programs to increase rural housing opportunities, reduce rent burdens for low-income 20 GROWING TH e eCONOMY FROM TH e B OTTOM U P AND M IDDL e O UT rural tenants, and also increase the resiliency of rural housing to the impacts of climate change. In addition, the Budget includes $3.4 billion for the Community Development Block Grant program to help communities modernize infrastructure, invest in economic development, create parks and other public amenities, and provide social services. Reduces Costs for Homeowners and Expands Access to Homeownership. To make homeownership more affordable for underserved borrowers, including first-time, low- to moderate-income, and minority homebuyers, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is reducing the annual mortgage insurance premiums new borrowers will pay by about one-third, saving the average FHA borrower approximately $800 in the first year of their mortgage loan and providing continued savings for the duration of the loan. The Budget also reflects a reduction in mortgage insurance fees for Native American borrowers in the Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program, which would save borrowers over $500 on average in their first year. To assist rural low- income homeowners, the Budget includes a new proposal to eliminate the existing low-income borrower penalty that requires individuals to repay subsidy costs for USDA's Single-Family Direct loans. The Budget also includes $10 billion in mandatory funding for a new First- Generation Down Payment Assistance program to help address racial and ethnic homeownership and wealth gaps, as well as $100 million for a HOM e down payment assistance pilot to expand homeownership opportunities for first-generation and/or low-wealth first-time homebuyers and $15 million to increase the availability of FHA small balance mortgages. Expands Access to Affordable Rent through the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) Program. The HCV program currently provides 2.3 million low-income families with rental assistance to obtain housing in the private market. The Budget provides $32.7 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion (including emergency funding) over the 2023 enacted level, to maintain services for all currently assisted families and to expand assistance to an additional 50,000 households, particularly those who are experiencing homelessness or fleeing, or attempting to flee, domestic violence or other forms of gender-based violence. The Budget further expands assistance to another 130,000 households with funding from HCV program reserves. To further ensure that more households have access to safe and affordable housing, the Budget includes mandatory funding to support two populations that are particularly vulnerable to homelessness\u2014youth aging out of foster care and extremely low-income ( eLI) veterans. The Budget provides $9 billion to establish a housing voucher program for all 20,000 youth aging out of foster care annually, and provides $13 billion to incrementally expand rental assistance for 450,000 eLI veteran families, paving a path to guaranteed assistance for all who have served the Nation and are in need. In all, the Budget proposes to expand assistance to well over 200,000 additional households. Improves College Affordability and Expands Free Community College. To help low- and middle-income students overcome financial barriers to postsecondary education, the Budget proposes to increase the discretionary maximum Pell Grant by $500, expanding access to the grant to reach over 6.8 million students with money for college. This request builds on successful bipartisan efforts to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by $900 over the past two years, and creates a path to double the award by 2029. The Budget also invests mandatory funding to expand free community college across the Nation. To lay the groundwork for this program, the Budget includes $500 million in a new discretionary grant program to provide two-years of free community college for students enrolled in high-quality programs that lead to a four-year degree or a good paying job. In addition, the Budget provides mandatory funding for two years of subsidized tuition for students from families earning less than $125,000 enrolled in a four-year Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Tribally Controlled College and University (TCCU), or Minority-Serving Institution (MSI). BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 21 Lowers Home Energy and Water Costs. The Budget provides $4.1 billion, a $111 million increase from the 2023 enacted level (excluding emergency appropriations), for the Low Income Home energy Assistance Program (LIH eAP). Since the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP) expires at the end of 2023, the Budget proposes to increase LIH eAP funding and allow States the option to use a portion of their LIH eAP funds to provide water bill assistance to low-income households. The Budget builds on the $13 billion provided in the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce energy bills for families, expand clean energy, transform rural power production, and create thousands of good-paying jobs for people across rural America. The Budget provides $30 million for grants and $1 billion for loan guarantees for renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements for farmers and rural small businesses. Moves Goods More Quickly through the Nation's Ports and Waterways. The Budget continues support for modernizing America's port and waterway infrastructure initiated under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\u2014helping further address cost pressures. The Budget includes $230 million for the Port Infrastructure Development Program to strengthen maritime freight capacity. In addition to keeping the Nation's supply chain moving by improving efficiency, the Department of Transportation (DOT) will prioritize projects that also lower emissions\u2014reducing environmental impact in and around the Nation's ports. Builds and Protects a Fair and Resilient Food Supply Chain. The Budget supports ongoing actions to develop more diverse, robust, and resilient local and regional supply chains by targeting funding to increase the production capacity among smaller producers, including continuing overtime user fee relief for small and very small meat and poultry establishments as established in the American Rescue Plan. The Budget complements these targeted investments by strengthening market oversight through the Agricultural Marketing Service to support fair markets and competitive meat and poultry product prices for American families and increasing safeguards against invasive pests and zoonotic diseases through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Fosters Competitive and Productive Markets and Targets Corporate Concen-tration. Vigorous marketplace competition through robust enforcement of antitrust law can help reduce costs and raise wages. The Budget advances this effort by including a historic increase of $100 million over the 2023 enacted level for the Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division. The President also supports legislation that would align executives' interests with the long-term interests of shareholders, workers, and the economy by requiring executives to hold on to company shares that they receive for several years after receiving them, and prohibiting them from selling shares in the years after a stock buyback. This would discourage corporations from using profits to repurchase stock and enrich executives, rather than investing in long-term growth and innovation. PROTECTING AND STRENGTHENING MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY The President has always believed that Medicare and Social Security are a promise\u2014a rock-solid guarantee\u2014that generations of Americans have counted on to be able to retire with dignity and security. As the President has made clear, he will reject any efforts to cut the Medicare or Social Security benefits that seniors and people with disabilities have earned and paid into their entire working lives. The Budget honors that ironclad commitment\u2014not only by 22 GROWING TH e eCONOMY FROM TH e B OTTOM U P AND M IDDL e O UT firmly opposing benefit cuts to either program, but by embracing reforms that would protect and strengthen both programs. The President is committed to working with the Congress to ensure Medicare and Social Security remain strong for their beneficiaries, now and in the future. Protects and Strengthens Medicare. The Budget would extend the solvency of the HI trust fund by at least 25 years, without cutting any benefits, or raising costs for people with Medicare. The Budget includes key reforms to the tax code to ensure high-income individuals pay their fair share into the HI trust fund. The Budget also directs the revenue from the Net Investment Income Tax into the HI trust fund as was originally intended. In addition, the Budget directs the savings from the Budget's proposed drug reforms into the HI trust fund. Protects the Social Security Benefits that Americans Have Earned. The Administration is committed to protecting and strengthening Social Security and opposes any attempt to cut Social Security benefits for current or future recipients. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to responsibly strengthen Social Security by ensuring that high-income individuals pay their fair share. In addition, the Administration looks forward to improving the Supplemental Security Income program to help low-income older Americans and people with disabilities afford their basic needs. The Budget also invests in staff, information technology, and other improvements at the Social Security Administration (SSA), providing an increase of $1.4 billion, a 10-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level. These funds would improve customer service at SSA's field offices, State disability determination services, and teleservice centers for retirees, individuals with disabilities, and their families. The Budget also adds staff to process more disability claims and reduce the amount of time claimants have to wait for decisions on vital benefits. INVESTING IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF AMERICA'S ECONOMIC STRENGTH The President's economic strategy is producing results for the American people. Since the President took office, the economy has added more than 12 million new jobs\u2014including more than 800,000 manufacturing jobs\u2014the unemployment rate is at the lowest level in 54 years, and the last two years were the strongest two years for small business applications on record. The President's plan is rebuilding America's infrastructure, promoting workers, making the economy more competitive, and fueling a manufacturing boom that is strengthening parts of the Nation that have long been left behind while creating good jobs for workers, including those without college degrees. The Budget builds on this record of economic progress through additional proposals to continue fueling a resurgence in American manufacturing and investing in infrastructure, supporting workers and entrepreneurs, improving education, and expanding access to housing. Boosting American Manufacturing and Investing in Infrastructure and Emerging Technologies Continues Implementation of the President's Historic Bipartisan Infra- structure Law. Implementation of President's historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is already well underway. The Budget builds on this progress by providing a total of $76.1 billion for highway, highway safety, and transit formula programs, supporting the amounts authorized for year three of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This includes $60.1 billion for the Federal- Aid Highway program, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to 2023 enacted, to continue repairing and upgrading the Nation's highways and bridges and build out a national network of electric vehicle chargers to help reach the President's climate goals\u2014as well as $14 billion to support BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 23 transit agencies across the Nation. The Budget also provides $4.6 billion for DOT to advance the Nation's most urgent and complex transportation infrastructure projects, in conjunction with the significant resources provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These funds would support transformational projects that would increase safety, improve mobility for commuters and freight traffic, and spur shared economic growth. Building on the $1 billion provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 2024 for operating and maintaining Army Corps of engineers\u2014Civil Works program's (Corps) infrastructure, the Budget invests in the Corps' continued operations, maintenance, and improved reliability. Tackles 21 st Century Aviation Challenges. The Budget provides $16.5 billion in discretionary budget authority for the Federal Aviation Administration. This funding would continue the hiring and training surge of air traffic controllers started in 2023 to rebuild the pipeline of new controllers needed to meet projected traffic demands. The Budget increases investment in the facilities and systems that comprise the National Airspace System (NAS) by over $500 million to $3.5 billion, to address maintenance and modernization and to ensure the NAS continues to safely accommodate the growth in traditional commercial aviation traffic alongside new entrants from the commercial space, unmanned aircraft, and advanced air mobility industries. The Budget also includes continued investment in FAA's multiyear effort of reforming aircraft certification, as well as increasing its safety oversight capabilities. Invests in American Manufacturing. To build on the ongoing resurgence of American manufacturing, the Budget provides $375 million for the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Industrial Technology Services, a $163 million increase above the 2023 enacted level. This includes a $98 million increase to Manufacturing USA to support the progress of NIST's existing manufacturing institute, funding for a new institute to be launched in 2023, and $60 million to be awarded competitively across the Government-wide network of manufacturing institutes to promote domestic production of institute-developed technologies. The Budget includes $277 million, a $102 million increase over the 2023 enacted level, for the Manufacturing extension Partnership, a public-private partnership with centers in every State that offers advisory services to an increasingly diverse set of small and medium enterprises so they can thrive in the global economy. The Budget also includes funding to help strengthen U.S. global leadership in the technologies of the future by accelerating the development of key technologies and establishing dynamic, collaborative networks for research and innovation. Strengthens U.S. Leadership in Emerging Technologies. The Budget provides $25 billion, an increase of approximately $6.5 billion from the 2023 enacted level, for CHIPS and Science Act- authorized activities. This includes $11.3 billion at the National Science Foundation (NSF), $8.8 billion at the Department of e nergy's (DO e ) Office of Science, $1 billion at NIST and $4 billion at the Department of Commerce's (Commerce) economic Development Administration ( eDA). These investments include $1.2 billion for the CHIPS and Science Act-authorized Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships within NSF to help accelerate and translate scientific research into innovations, industries, and jobs. The Directorate will work with programs across the Agency and with other Federal and non-Federal entities to expedite technology development in emerging areas that are crucial for U.S. technological leadership. The Budget provides $300 million to invest in NSF's Regional Innovation engines program, bringing together State and local governments, institutions of higher education, labor unions, businesses, and community-based organizations across the Nation to galvanize use-inspired research, technology translation, and workforce development. Within DO e's Office of Science, the Budget supports cutting-edge research at the national laboratories and universities and building and operating world-class scientific user facilities and the largest investment in fusion 24 GROWING TH e eCONOMY FROM TH e B OTTOM U P AND M IDDL e O UT energy in history. The Budget requests more than $4 billion at eDA to fund grants that enable the growth of Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs Program that foster the geographic diversity of innovation and create quality jobs in underserved and vulnerable communities across the Nation. Supporting Workers, Families, Entrepreneurs, and Small Businesses Cuts Taxes for Families with Children and American Workers. The Budget would expand key tax cuts benefitting lower- and middle-income workers and families. The President is calling for the restoration of the full Child Tax Credit enacted in the American Rescue Plan, which cut child poverty in half in 2021, to the lowest level in history. The Budget would expand the credit from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child for children six years old and above, and to $3,600 per child for children under six. In addition, the Budget would permanently reform the credit to make it fully refundable, so that it no longer excludes children in the lowest-income families, and allow families to receive monthly advance payments. The President also calls on the Congress to make the earned Income Tax Credit expansion for childless workers permanent, which would help pull low-paid workers out of poverty. Provides National, Comprehensive Paid Family and Medical Leave. The vast majority of America's workers do not have access to paid family leave, including three out of four private sector workers. Among the lowest-paid workers, who are predominately women and workers of color, 92 percent have no access to paid family leave through their employers. As many as one in five retirees leave the workforce earlier than planned to care for an ill family member, which negatively impacts families as well as the Nation's labor supply and productivity. The Budget proposes to establish a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program administered by SSA. The program would: provide workers with progressive, partial wage replacement to take time off for family and medical reasons; include robust administrative funding; and use an inclusive family definition. The Budget would provide up to 12 weeks of leave to allow eligible workers to take time off to: care for and bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own serious illness; address circumstances arising from a loved one's military deployment; or find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The Budget would also provide up to three days of leave to grieve the death of a loved one. The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to make this critical investment and strengthen America's economy. Calls for Paid Sick Leave for All Workers. Millions of workers in America have to choose between a needed paycheck\u2014or even a job\u2014and taking care of a family member or themselves when they are sick. Workers without paid sick days are more likely to go to work when sick, send their child to school when sick, and do without the healthcare they need to get better. Paid sick days are also good for business, leading to lower employee turnover, increased productivity, and reducing the spread of contagious diseases. The President calls on the Congress to require employers to provide seven job-protected paid sick days each year to all workers and ensure that employers cannot penalize workers for taking time off to address their health needs or the health needs of their families or to seek safety from domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Empowers and Protects Workers. The Budget invests $2.3 billion, an increase of $430 million above the 2023 enacted level, in the Department of Labor's (DOL) worker protection agencies. The Budget would enable DOL to protect workers' wages and benefits, combat exploitative child labor, address the misclassification of workers as independent contractors, and improve workplace health and safety. The Budget also provides resources to support vigorous enforcement of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, especially where BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 25 employers have retaliated against or otherwise penalized employees for taking federally protected leave from work. Similarly, the Budget increases funding for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the equal employment Opportunity Commission ( eeOC), to help level the playing field for workers, protecting their right to fair representation and better working conditions and secure equal opportunity for workers from all walks of life. The Budget would also strengthen the ee OC's steadfast enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to help protect the right of individuals with disabilities to full, equitable participation in the workplace. Expands Penalties when Employers Violate Workers' Rights to Organize, Receive Fair Wages, and Have a Safe and Healthy Workplace Free from Discrimination. employers often receive only a slap on the wrist\u2014 at most\u2014when they fire or retaliate against workers for exercising their right to organize and collectively bargain, steal wages from workers, force workers to work in unsafe conditions, exploit children, or otherwise flagrantly violate the Nation's labor laws. To deter employers from violating workers' rights, ensure those who do violate their rights are held accountable, and level the playing field for responsible employers, the Budget proposes instituting and meaningfully increasing penalties at DOL, eeOC, and NLRB for employers that violate workplace safety, health, wage and hour, child labor, equal opportunity, and labor organizing rules. Expands Workforce Training that Provides Pathways to Good Jobs. The Budget invests in effective, evidence-based training models that would ensure all workers\u2014 particularly women, workers of color, those living in rural areas, workers with disabilities, and others underrepresented in growing fields\u2014have the skills they need to compete for and secure good jobs. The Budget provides $200 million for a new Sectoral employment through Career Training for Occupational Readiness program to support the development and expansion of public-private partnerships between employers, education and training providers, and community-based groups to equitably deliver high-quality training focused on growing industries. The Budget invests $335 million, a $50 million increase above the 2023 enacted level, in Registered Apprenticeship, an evidence-based earn-and-learn model that is a critical tool for training future workforces in the construction, clean energy, semiconductor, transportation and logistics, education, and other growing and in-demand industries. The Budget also invests $100 million, a $35 million increase above the 2023 enacted level, to build community colleges' capacity to work with the public workforce development system and employers to design and deliver high-quality training programs in communities across the Nation. Modernizes, Protects, and Strengthens Unemployment Insurance (UI). The UI program provides a critical safety net for workers who have lost a job through no fault of their own, and helps protect the economy as a whole from further damage during downturns. UI was critical in helping millions of Americans through unexpected job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the pandemic also exposed vulnerabilities in the program. The Budget invests $3.7 billion, an increase of $522 million above the 2023 enacted level, to modernize, protect, and strengthen the UI program. This includes investments aimed at tackling fraud, including funding to support more robust identity verification for UI applicants, help States develop and test fraud-prevention tools and strategies, and allow the DOL's Office of Inspector General to increase its investigations into fraud rings targeting the UI program. In addition, the Budget proposes a comprehensive legislative package of program integrity proposals designed to provide States with new tools and resources to combat UI fraud and improper payments while ensuring equity and accessibility for all claimants. The Budget also proposes principles to guide future efforts to reform the UI system, including improving benefit levels and access, scaling UI benefits automatically during recessions, expanding eligibility to reflect the modern labor force, improving State and Federal solvency through more equitable and progressive 26 GROWING TH e eCONOMY FROM TH e B OTTOM U P AND M IDDL e O UT financing, expanding reemployment services, and further safeguarding the program from fraud. Broadens Access to Capital for Small Businesses. The Budget supports historic lending levels across the 7(a), 504, Small Business Investment Company (SBIC), and Microloan programs. The nearly $58 billion in lending provided in the Budget would address the need for greater access to affordable capital, particularly in underserved communities. Increasing the authorized lending level for the SBIC program by 20 percent to $6 billion would significantly expand the availability of venture capital funding for small businesses. Supports Minority-Owned Business to Narrow Racial Wealth Gaps. The Budget increases the capacity of the Minority Business Development Agency by providing the full $110 million authorized in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which would bolster services provided to minority-owned, including women of color-owned, enterprises by expanding the Business Center program, funding Rural Business Centers, opening new regional offices, and supporting innovative initiatives to foster economic resiliency. Making Historic Investments in Education Invests in High-Poverty Schools. To help ensure that every student receives a high-quality education, the Budget provides $20.5 billion for Title I, a $2.2 billion increase above the 2023 enacted level. This funding would continue historic progress over the past two years, as the Congress has enacted a total increase of $1.9 billion for Title I since 2021. Title I delivers critical funding to 90 percent of school districts across the Nation, helping them to provide students in low-income communities the academic opportunities and support they need to succeed. This increase in funding addresses chronic funding gaps between high-poverty schools\u2014which disproportionately serve students of color\u2014and their wealthier counterparts and would help schools sustain critical investments in accelerated learning and other areas that were made with American Rescue Plan funds. Increases Support for Children with Disabilities. every child with a disability should have access to the high-quality early intervention, special education services, and personnel needed to thrive in school and graduate ready for college or a career. The Budget invests $16.8 billion in Individuals with Disabilities education Act (ID eA) grants to support special education and related services for more than seven million students with disabilities in grades Pre-K through 12, an increase of $2.1 billion above the 2023 enacted level. The Budget also invests $932 million in ID eA Part C grants\u2014an increase of $392 million above the 2023 enacted level\u2014which support early intervention services for infants and families with disabilities that are critical to supporting children's developmental and academic outcomes. The increased funding would support States in implementing important reforms to expand enrollment of underserved children, including children of color, children from low-income families, and children living in rural areas. The Budget also includes funding to develop tools and programs to support children with disabilities in military families and other highly mobile populations. Expands Institutional Capacity at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs, and Community Colleges. The Budget increases institutional capacity at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs, and under-resourced institutions, including community colleges, by providing an increase of $429 million above the 2023 enacted level. This significant funding includes $350 million for four-year HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs to expand research and development (R&D) infrastructure at these institutions. These capacity enhancements complement the Budget's proposal for two years of subsidized tuition for students from families earning less than $125,000 enrolled in a four-year HBCU, TCCU, or MSI.BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 27 EXPANDING ACCESS TO HIGH-QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND STRENGTHENING PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE Since the President took office: a record-setting 16.3 million people signed up for health coverage through the Affordable Care Act; the national uninsured rate has hit an all-time low; and the Administration has taken action to protect millions of consumers from surprise medical bills, cap insulin prescriptions for Medicare beneficiaries at $35 per month, lower healthcare premiums, close the \"family glitch\" loophole, protect American's access to reproductive healthcare, allow Medicare to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices, and supercharge efforts to end cancer as we know it. The Budget expands on this progress through a package of proposals that would expand access to high-quality healthcare and strengthen America's public health infrastructure. Expanding Access to High- Quality Healthcare Expands Access to Quality, Affordable Healthcare. The Budget invests $150 billion over 10 years to improve and expand Medicaid home and community-based services, such as personal care services, which would allow older Americans and individuals with disabilities to remain in their homes and stay active in their communities as well as improve the quality of jobs for home care workers and support family caregivers. Because community health centers\u2014 which provide comprehensive services regardless of ability to pay\u2014serve one in three people living in poverty and one in five rural residents, the Budget puts the Health Center Program on a path to double its size and expand its reach. To bolster the healthcare workforce, the Budget expands the National Health Service Corps, which provides loan repayment and scholarships to healthcare professionals in exchange for practicing in underserved areas, and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical education Program, which trains residents in community-based healthcare clinics in rural and high need areas. The Administration also looks forward to working with the Congress on ways to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid through measures such as improving access to dental, hearing, and vision coverage. Supports Family Planning Services for More Americans. For more than 50 years, Title X family planning clinics have played a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of high-quality family planning and preventive health services. Most Title X clients live in poverty and the uninsured rate of Title X users is twice the national average, making the Title X family planning program a critical part of the public health safety net. The program has served as a point of entry into care for nearly 195 million people over its more than 50-year history. The Budget includes $512 million, a 79-percent increase above the 2023 enacted level, for the Title X Family Planning program to increase the number of patients served to 4.5 million. Advances Maternal Health and Health Equity. The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, and rates are disproportionately high for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native women. The Budget includes $471 million to: support the ongoing implementation of the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis and to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates; expand maternal health initiatives in rural communities; implement implicit bias training for healthcare providers; create pregnancy medical home demonstration projects; and address the highest rates of perinatal health disparities, including by supporting the perinatal health workforce. In addition, the Budget requires all States to provide continuous Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum, eliminating gaps in health insurance at a critical time. To address the lack of data on health disparities and further improve access to care, the Budget strengthens collection and evaluation of sociodemographic data.28 GROWING TH e eCONOMY FROM TH e B OTTOM U P AND M IDDL e O UT Supports Rural Health. Rural America faces persistent disparities in access to healthcare, including higher uninsured rates, limited healthcare provider availability, and rural hospital closures. Providing Medicaid-like coverage to individuals in States that have not adopted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, as the Budget proposes, is critical for rural communities. The Budget also includes investments to improve the health of rural communities, including by helping rural hospitals stay open, expanding the pipeline of rural healthcare workers, and facilitating access to quality care. The Budget provides assistance to rural hospitals at-risk of closure and to support expansion of hospital service lines to meet rural communities' needs. The Budget also supports rural healthcare workforce development and training programs and telehealth. Recognizing that rural communities have higher rates of suicide, and high rates of overdose deaths and mental illness, the Budget provides dedicated funding to rural communities, including rural health clinics, to support behavioral health. The Budget also supports the financing and infrastructure of rural healthcare through USDA's Rural Development Programs. Guarantees Adequate and Stable Funding for the Indian Health Service (IHS). The Administration is committed to upholding the United States' trust responsibility to tribal nations by addressing the historical underfunding of IHS. The enactment of an advance appropriation for 2024 for IHS was a historic and welcome step toward the goal of securing adequate and stable funding to improve the overall health status of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Building on the advance appropriation, the Budget requests an additional $3 billion in 2024 for a total of $8.1 billion in discretionary resources. In addition, the Budget reclassifies contract support costs and leases as mandatory for a total of $9.4 billion in discretionary and mandatory resources in 2024. The Budget proposes all IHS resources as mandatory beginning in 2025. Strengthening Public Health and Improving Health Outcomes Advances the Cancer Moonshot Goals. The Cancer Moonshot Initiative aims to reduce the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years, and improve the experience of people who are living with or have survived cancer, their families, and caregivers. Reaching these goals will require progress in ways to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and ensure that the tools we have and those we develop along the way reach more Americans. Investments across the Cancer Cabinet agencies would be targeted to priority actions including: 1) close the screening gap; 2) understand and address environmental exposure; 3) decrease the impact of preventable cancers; 4) bring cutting-edge research through the pipeline to patients and communities; and 5) support patients and caregivers. The Budget includes $1 billion for dedicated Cancer Moonshot activities across the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), IHS, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration, as well as a total investment at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of $7.8 billion to drive progress on ways to prevent, detect, and treat cancer. In addition, the Budget proposes to increase mandatory funding for the 21st Century Cures Act Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot initiative at NCI through 2026. The Budget also provides an increase of $1 billion for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, for a total of $2.5 billion, to drive innovative health research and speed the implementation of breakthroughs that would transform the treatment, prevention, and early detection of cancer and other diseases. As the Administration works to address the single biggest driver of cancer deaths in this Nation\u2014smoking\u2014the Budget also includes a total investment of $257.5 million in tobacco prevention and control efforts at CDC, including tobacco cessation activities to help Americans quit.BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 29 Transforms Behavioral Healthcare. The United States is facing a behavioral health crisis. Recently enacted legislation, such as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, takes significant steps to address this crisis and the Administration is implementing these behavioral health and school mental health investments. Still, much more can be done. Nearly one in four adults 18 and older, and one in three adults aged 18 to 25, had a mental illness in the past year. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people ages 10 to 24 and teen girls, in particular, are experiencing record high levels of violence, sadness, and suicide risk. More than 46 million people had a substance use disorder, nearly 94 percent of whom did not receive treatment. For people with private health insurance, the Budget expands coverage of mental health benefits and strengthens the network of behavioral health providers. For people with Medicare, the Budget lowers patients' costs for mental health services, requires parity in coverage between behavioral health and medical benefits, and expands coverage for behavioral health providers. The Budget provides historic investments in the behavioral health workforce, youth mental healthcare, Certified Community Based Behavioral Health Clinics, Community Mental Health Centers, and mental health research. The Budget strengthens access to crisis services by investing in the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline to address 100 percent of estimated contacts, scaling follow-up crisis services, and expanding CDC's suicide prevention program to all States, the District of Columbia, and 18 tribal and territorial jurisdictions. Prepares for Future Pandemics and Other Biological Threats. The United States must catalyze advances in science, technology, and core capabilities to prevent and prepare for future biological threats, which could emerge with increasing frequency. The Budget includes $20 billion in mandatory funding for HHS public health agencies in support of the Administration's pandemic prevention and preparedness and biodefense priorities as outlined in the 2021 American Pandemic Preparedness: Transforming Our Capabilities plan and 2022 National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Health Security (National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan). The Budget also includes $400 million in new discretionary resources within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response to prepare for pandemics and biological threats, as well as key discretionary investments for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the Strategic National Stockpile to support advanced development and procurement of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic capabilities against known and unknown high priority threats. In addition, the Budget includes mandatory funding to catalyze development of drugs that address the pandemic threat of antimicrobial resistance. The Budget proposes key new HHS authorities to improve preparedness, incorporating lessons learned from recent public health emergencies, such as to enhance the visibility and the resilience of the medical product supply chain. Invests in the Treatment and Prevention of Infectious Diseases. The Budget invests in the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, including Hepatitis C, HIV, and other vaccine-preventable diseases, by supporting comprehensive programs that would expand access to curative and preventive medications. The Budget includes a new mandatory proposal for a national program to significantly expand screening, testing, treatment, prevention, and monitoring of Hepatitis C infections in the United States, with a specific focus on populations with high infection levels. This program would support Federal procurement of life-saving treatments, while bolstering provider capacity and related public health efforts such as testing, communication, and surveillance. The Budget invests $850 million in the ending the HIV epidemic Initiative across HHS to aggressively reduce new HIV cases, increase access to pre- exposure prophylaxis (also known as Pr eP), and ensure equitable access to services and support for those living with HIV. The Budget also reduces Medicaid costs by eliminating barriers to accessing PreP for Medicaid beneficiaries and proposes a new mandatory program to: guarantee Pr eP at no cost for all uninsured and underinsured individuals; 30 GROWING TH e eCONOMY FROM TH e B OTTOM U P AND M IDDL e O UT provide essential wrap-around services through States, IHS, tribal entities, and localities; and establish a network of community providers to reach underserved areas and populations. In addition, the Budget proposes a new Vaccines for Adults program to provide uninsured adults with access to routine and outbreak vaccines at no cost and expands the Vaccines for Children program to include all children under age 19 enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program. Supports Survivors of Domestic Violence and Other Forms of Gender-Based Violence. The Budget proposes significant increases to support and protect survivors of gender-based violence, including $519 million for the Family Violence Prevention and Services (FVPSA) program to support domestic violence survivors\u2014double the 2023 enacted level. This amount continues funding availability for FVPSA-funded resource centers, including those that support the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex community. The Budget would provide additional funding for domestic violence hotlines and cash assistance for survivors of domestic violence, as well as funding to support a demonstration project evaluating services for survivors at the intersection of housing instability, substance use coercion, and child welfare. In addition, the Budget would provide over $66 million for victims of human trafficking and survivors of torture, an increase of nearly $17 million from the 2023 enacted level. TAKING HISTORIC ACTION TO LOWER ENERGY PRICES, CREATING CLEAN ENERGY JOBS WHILE CONFRONTING THE CLIMATE CRISIS, AND PROTECTING CLEAN AIR AND WATER Under the President's leadership, the United States is leading the world in: building a clean energy economy; tackling the climate crisis; creating clean energy jobs; protecting America's communities from climate disasters; advancing environmental justice; and cutting energy bills for hard working families. The Administration is continuing to implement the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\u2014the largest investments that any country has made in clean energy, energy security, climate change, and clean air and water in history\u2014which is already galvanizing the Nation's clean energy transition and making solar panels, energy efficient homes, and electric cars more affordable for American families. The Budget invests in clean energy across America, bringing jobs to rural communities and cities, leaving no one behind.Cutting Energy and Water Bills for American Families and Creating Clean Energy Jobs Creates Jobs Building Clean Energy Infrastructure and Cuts Energy Cost for American Families. Clean energy has become a centerpiece of the American economy. The Budget invests nearly $4.5 billion to create good paying jobs building clean infrastructure projects all across the Nation. The Budget supports clean energy workforce and infrastructure projects across the Nation, including: $1.8 billion to weatherize and retrofit low-income Americans' homes; $83 million to electrify tribal homes and transition tribal colleges and universities to renewable energy; and $107 million for the Department of energy's Grid Deployment Office to support utilities and State and local governments in building a grid that is more secure, reliable, and resilient and that integrates increasing levels of renewable energy. These investments, which complement and bolster the historic funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, would create BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 31 high-quality jobs while driving progress toward the Administration's climate goals, including carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. The Budget supports efforts at the Department of the Interior (DOI) to meet the Administration's goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and also provides $60 million to expand offshore wind permitting activities at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to allow NOAA to use the best available science to help meet the Administration's deployment goal while protecting biodiversity and promoting sustainable ocean co-use. Makes Historic Investments in Cutting- Edge Research to Advance Clean Energy Innovation. The Budget provides $16.5 billion to support climate science and clean energy innovation. The Budget proposes over $5.1 billion to fund a broad portfolio of research to improve understanding of the changing climate and inform adaptation and resilience measures across multiple agencies, including DOI, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Commerce, NSF, and others. The Budget supports U.S. preeminence in developing innovative technologies that accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy by investing more than $11.3 billion. To boost American innovation and reestablish American leadership in research and scientific discovery, the Budget also provides a historic investment of $8.8 billion for DO e's Office of Science and $1.2 billion at NSF, advancing toward the CHIPS and Science Act authorizations to support: global leadership in the technologies of the future; advancing the Nation's understanding of climate change; identifying and accelerating novel technologies for clean energy; and positioning the U.S. to meet the demand for isotopes. The Budget also includes $1 billion for fusion, the largest ever investment in the promise of a clean energy power source. Cuts Climate Warming Pollution. The Budget invests in reducing climate warming pollution toward achieving the President's target to cut carbon emissions 50 to 52 percent by 2030. These investments include an additional $64.4 million at the environmental Protection Agency ( ePA) to implement the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 and continue phasing out potent greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons. The Budget supports $1.2 billion in DO e industrial decarbonization activities, including a DO e Industrial Technologies joint strategy team to drive adoption of industrial decarbonization solutions, expanded R&D efforts in the new Industrial e fficiency and Decarbonization Office, and $160 million to support at least two large-scale industrial decarbonization projects directly benefitting disadvantaged communities funded through the Office of Clean energy Demonstrations. Accelerates American Manufacturing and Deployment of Clean Energy Technologies. The Budget also includes $75 million for the Department of energy to carry out the President's recent determinations under the Defense Production Act to enhance domestic supply chain capacity for key climate technologies. To build on the resurgence of American manufacturing, the Budget complements funding provided in the Inflation Reduction Act by providing robust support for Loan Program Office administrative expenses to originate and oversee the ambitious growth in the financing of clean energy and advanced technology vehicle manufacturing projects envisioned in the Inflation Reduction Act. Increases Permitting Capacity. The Budget invests in environmental permitting programs to expedite delivery of new and modernized infrastructure. The Budget also proposes to expand existing transfer authority by enabling Federal agencies to transfer funds provided under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA Fisheries to improve efficiencies and increase capacity for environmental planning and consultation. Together with existing law, this proposal would accelerate and improve environmental reviews in support of responsible development of priority infrastructure projects and energy solutions.32 GROWING TH e eCONOMY FROM TH e B OTTOM U P AND M IDDL e O UT Strengthening Resilience Bolsters Community Resilience to Climate Change. The Budget invests more than $23 billion for climate resilience across DOI, USDA, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Defense (DOD). These investments would help build communities' resilience to floods, wildfires, and storms, improve conservation and ecosystem management, strengthen America's disaster response capabilities, increase the resiliency of rural housing to the impacts of climate change while reducing rent burdens, and ensure the resilience of the Nation's defense to climate change. The Budget includes $500 million for flood hazard mapping, including the development of new data to support future flood conditions, as well as funding to sustain the Civilian Climate Corps.

The Budget includes funds for CBP to hire an additional 350 Border Patrol Agents, $535 million for border security technology at and between ports of entry, $40 million to combat fentanyl trafficking and disrupt transnational criminal organizations, and funds to hire an additional 460 processing assistants at CBP and IC e. Supports a Fair, Orderly, and Humane Immigration System. The Administration is committed to improving the Nation's immigration system and safeguarding its integrity and promise by efficiently and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits. The Budget includes $865 million for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to process an increasing asylum caseload, reduce the historically high immigration benefit request backlog, support the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program, and improve refugee processing to advance the Administration's goal of admitting 125,000 refugees. Addresses the Situation at the Southwest Border. Given elevated Southwest Border encounter levels experienced in a number of years since 2019, the Budget proposes a new $4.7 billion contingency fund to aid the DHS and its components when responding to migration surges along the Southwest Border. each fiscal year, the fund would receive appropriations incrementally, and above the base appropriation, as Southwest Border encounters reach pre-identified levels. DHS would be limited to obligating funds for surge-related functions and would transfer funds to CBP, IC e, and F eMA accounts with valid surge-related obligations. Improves Immigration Courts. The Budget invests more than $1.5 billion, an increase of $595 million above the 2023 enacted level, in the executive Of fice for Immigration Review both to manage and mitigate the backlog of over 1.8 million cases currently pending in the immigration courts that this administration largely inherited from its predecessor. This funding supports 150 new immigration judge teams, which includes the support personnel required to help optimize the operation of the immigration court system. The Budget would also invest new resources in legal access programming, including $150 million in discretionary resources to provide access to representation for adults and families in immigration proceedings. Providing resources to support legal representation in the immigration system would help make the system fairer and more equitable, while allowing for greater efficiencies in case processing. Supports America's Promise to Refugees. The Budget provides $7.3 billion to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to help rebuild the Nation's refugee resettlement infrastructure and support the resettling of up to 125,000 refugees in 2024. The Budget also helps ensure that unaccompanied immigrant children receive appropriate support and services while they are in ORR's care and are unified with relatives and sponsors as safely and quickly as possible. The funding would allow ORR to reinforce and expand on the programmatic improvements the Administration has made, including expanding access to counsel to help children navigate complex immigration court proceedings and enhancing case management and post-release services. In addition, the Budget includes an emergency contingency fund that would provide additional BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 43 resources, beyond the $7.3 billion, when there are unanticipated increases in the number of unaccompanied children or other humanitarian entrants, building on the contingency fund enacted for 2023. Honoring the Nation's Commitments to America's Veterans, Servicemembers, and Their Families, Caregivers, and Survivors Expands Healthcare, Benefits, and Services for Environmental Exposures. The PACT Act represents the most significant expansion of Veterans healthcare and disability compensation benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits and other environmental exposures in more than 30 years. As part of the PACT Act, the Congress authorized the Cost of War Toxic exposures Fund (T eF) to fund increased costs above 2021 funding levels for healthcare and benefits delivery for veterans exposed to a number of environmental hazards\u2014and ensure there is sufficient funding available to cover these costs without shortchanging other elements of veteran medical care and benefit delivery. The Budget provides $20.3 billion for the T eF in 2024, which is $15.3 billion above the 2023 enacted level. Prioritizes Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Care. The Budget provides a total of $121 billion in discretionary medical care funding in 2024, $2.3 billion above the 2023 enacted level, together with $17.1 billion in the T eF. In addition to fully funding inpatient, outpatient, mental health, and long-term care services, the Budget supports programs that enhance VA healthcare quality and delivery. The Budget reiterates that medical care for veterans should be considered separately from other appropriations categories in order to ensure that the needs of veterans are never traded off against other national priorities. Prioritizes Veterans' Mental Health Services and Suicide Prevention. The Budget invests $139 million within VA research programs, together with $16.6 billion within the VA Medical Care program, to increase access to quality mental healthcare and lower the cost of mental health services for veterans, with the goal of helping veterans take charge of their treatment and live full, meaningful lives. This effort includes support for the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019, clinical trials, and epidemiological studies on risk and prevention factors. In addition, the Budget provides $559 million to further advance the Administration's veteran suicide prevention initiatives, including continued expansion of the Veterans Crisis Line's 988 and additional support for VA's National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide. Invests in Caregivers Support Programs. Recognizing the critical role family caregivers play in supporting the health and wellness of veterans, the Budget provides robust funding for the Program of General Caregivers Support Services. The Budget also specifically provides $2.4 billion for the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, which includes stipend payments and support services to help empower family caregivers of eligible veterans. Honors the Memory of All Veterans. The Budget includes $480 million to ensure veterans and their families have access to exceptional memorial benefits. These funds maintain national shrine standards at the 158 VA-managed cemeteries and provide the initial operational investment required to continue or begin activation to open three new cemeteries. Invests in Critical Veteran Medical Facilities. The Budget includes $1.6 billion in discretionary funding and $1.9 billion in mandatory funding for construction and expansion of critical infrastructure and facilities, in addition to a $5 billion investment in discretionary medical care for non-recurring maintenance to improve medical facility infrastructure. The Budget also provides $164 million for grants for construction of State extended care facilities to deliver high- quality healthcare, benefits, and services for veterans.44 GROWING TH e eCONOMY FROM TH e B OTTOM U P AND M IDDL e O UT Fulfills America's Commitment to Military Families. Military families are key to the readiness and well-being of the All-Volunteer Force, and therefore are critical to national security. The Budget continues to support military families by prioritizing programs, including the Secretary of Defense's Taking Care of People initiatives, that directly support military spouses, children, caregivers, survivors, and other dependents, such as expanding access to child care and Pre-K programs. Strengthens Programs to Prevent and Respond to Sexual Assault. Sexual violence in the Armed Forces is a matter of national security and military readiness. Fulfilling the President's promise to transform how the military addresses sexual assault, the Budget fully funds DOD's implementation of the recommendations of the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military, and advances implementation of military justice reform, including the selection and training of specialized, independent trial counsel who will assume jurisdiction over sexual assault, domestic violence, and related crimes. REDUCING THE DEFICIT BY ENSURING THE WEALTHY AND BIG CORPORATIONS PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE The President's Budget builds on the economic and fiscal progress the Nation has made over the past two years: fueling economic growth; creating jobs; lowering costs for working families; and laying a strong foundation for future prosperity\u2014all while reducing deficits and addressing long-term fiscal risks. The Budget reflects the President's long-held belief that the best way to responsibly reduce the deficit is to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out and invest in the foundations of the Nation's economic strength. That is why the Budget invests in smart, fully-offset investments that expand the productive capacity of the economy, give working families more breathing room, and promote broadly shared prosperity. Over the past two years, that approach has worked, with the deficit falling by a historic amount. The President's Budget expands on this progress\u2014proposing investments that are more than fully paid for and reducing deficits by almost $3 trillion over the next decade by asking the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to finally pay their fair share. Under the President's policies, annual deficits would fall from current levels and stabilize throughout the next 10 years, while the economic burden of debt would remain in line with historical levels. Making the Tax System More Fair The President believes that America needs to reward work, not wealth. Since taking office, the President has taken numerous actions and signed significant legislation to make the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share while providing tax cuts for working families and reducing the deficit. Under his plan, no one making under $400,000 per year will pay more in new taxes. Building on the progress the President has already made to promote a fairer tax code, the Budget proposes additional tax reforms that would ensure the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. Proposes a Minimum Tax on Billionaires. The tax code currently offers special treatment for the types of income that wealthy people enjoy. Whereas the wages and salaries that everyday Americans earn are taxed as ordinary income, billionaires make their money in ways that are taxed at lower rates, and sometimes BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 45 not taxed at all. This special treatment, combined with sophisticated tax planning and giant loopholes, allows many of the wealthiest Americans to pay lower rates on their full income than many middle-class households pay. To finally address this glaring problem, the Budget includes a 25 percent minimum tax on the wealthiest 0.01 percent, those with wealth of more than $100 million. Ensures Corporations Pay Their Fair Share. The Budget includes an increase to the rate that corporations pay in taxes on their profits. Corporations received an enormous tax break in 2017, cutting effective U.S. tax rates for U.S. corporations to a low of less than 10 percent. While their profits have soared, their investment in the economy did not. Their shareholders and top executives reaped the benefits, without the promised trickle down to workers, consumers, or communities. The Budget would set the corporate tax rate at 28 percent, still well below the 35 percent rate that prevailed prior to the 2017 tax law. This tax rate change is complemented by other proposals to incentivize job creation and investment in the United States and ensure large corporations pay their fair share. Stops the Race to the Bottom in International Corporate Tax and Ends Tax Breaks for Offshoring. For decades, countries have competed for multinational business by slashing tax rates, at the expense of having adequate revenues to finance core services. Thanks in part to the Administration's leadership, more than 130 nations signed on to a global tax framework to finally address this race to the bottom. Building on that framework, the Budget proposes to reform the international tax system to reduce the incentives to book profits in low-tax jurisdictions, stop corporate inversions to tax havens, and raise the tax rate on U.S. multinationals' foreign earnings from 10.5 percent to 21 percent. These reforms would ensure that profitable multinational corporations pay their fair share. Quadruples the Stock Buybacks Tax. Last year, the President signed into law a surcharge on corporate stock buybacks, which reduces the differential tax treatment between buybacks and dividends and encourages businesses to invest in their growth and productivity as opposed to funneling tax-preferred profits to foreign shareholders. The Budget proposes quadrupling the stock buybacks tax from one percent to four percent to address the continued tax advantage for buybacks and encourage corporations to invest in productivity and the broader economy. Repeals President Trump's Tax Cuts for the Wealthy and Reforms Capital Gains Tax to Ensure the Wealthy Pay Their Fair Share. The 2017 tax law lowered rates for the wealthiest Americans, delivering massive tax cuts to the top one percent. The Budget repeals those cuts, restoring the top tax rate of 39.6 percent for single filers making more than $400,000 a year and married couples making more than $450,000 per year. The Budget also proposes taxing capital gains at the same rate as wage income for those with more than $1 million in income and finally closes the carried interest loophole that allows some wealthy investment fund managers to pay tax at lower rates than their secretaries. Closes Medicare Tax Loopholes and Makes the Medicare Trust Fund Solvent for Another Quarter Century. Current law lets certain wealthy business owners avoid Medicare taxes on some of the profits they get from pass- through businesses. The Budget closes the loophole that allows certain business owners to avoid paying Medicare taxes on these profits, and dedicates revenue raised by the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) to the Medicare HI Trust Fund, as originally intended. In addition, the Budget raises the Medicare tax rate on earned and unearned income and the NIIT rate from 3.8 percent to 5 percent for the wealthiest Americans. As discussed above, these changes, together with savings from the Budget's prescription drug reforms, would extend the solvency of the Medicare HI Trust Fund by at least 25 years. Closes Tax Loopholes. The Budget also saves billions of dollars by closing other tax loopholes that overwhelmingly benefit the rich 46 GROWING TH e eCONOMY FROM TH e B OTTOM U P AND M IDDL e O UT and the largest, most profitable corporations. This includes closing the so-called \"like-kind exchange loophole\" that lets real estate investors defer tax indefinitely, reforms to tax preferred retirement incentives to ensure that the ultra-wealthy cannot use these incentives to amass tax free fortunes, and closing a loophole that benefits wealthy crypto investors. Addresses Expiring Tax Cuts after 2025. President Trump and congressional Republicans deliberately sunset portions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 legislation after 2025 to conceal both the true increase in the deficit\u2014much larger than the already-massive $2 trillion cost estimate\u2014and the true size of their tax breaks for multi-millionaires and large corporations. This was one of the most egregious and fiscally reckless budget decisions in modern history. The President, faced with this fiscally irresponsible legacy, will work with the Congress to address the 2025 expirations, and focus tax policy on rewarding work not wealth, based on the following guiding principles. The President: Opposes increasing taxes on people earn - ing less than $400,000 and supports cutting taxes for working people and families with children to give them more breathing room; Opposes cutting taxes for the wealthy\u2014ei - ther extending tax cuts for the wealthy or bringing back tax breaks that would ben- efit the wealthy; and Supports additional reforms to ensure that wealthy people and big corpora-tions pay their fair share, so that America pays for the continuation of tax cuts for people earning less than $400,000 in a fis - cally responsible manner and address the problematic sunsets created by President Trump and congressional Republicans.Putting America on a Stronger Fiscal Path The Budget's investments and tax reforms will reduce costs for everyday Americans, boost economic growth, create high-quality jobs, and promote shared prosperity while also improving the fiscal outlook of the United States and reducing fiscal risks over the long term. The President has already presided over historic deficit reduction in the first two years of the Administration, while also signing into law hundreds of billions in deficit reduction in the Inflation Reduction Act. Recognizing that the United States faces fiscal challenges over the coming decades\u2014driven by demographic pressures, an inequitable and inefficient tax system, and rising healthcare costs\u2014the Budget not only offsets its investments, but improves the medium-term fiscal outlook. In total, the Budget reduces the deficit over the next 10 years by nearly $3 trillion. The policies proposed in the Budget would reduce the deficit, as a share of the economy, from current levels. Under the Budget policies, the deficit would decline over the next several years, stabilizing around five percent of GDP throughout the remainder of the 10-year window. This compares to deficits increasing to six percent by 2032 in the absence of the President's policies. Moreover, under the President's Budget, the economic burden of debt would remain low and in line with recent historical experience over the next decade. The widespread, persistent and global phenomenon of falling interest rates even as debt levels increased over the past four decades has meant that the burden associated with debt over the near and medium-term has decreased substantially. e ven with the recent rise in interest rates from their historic lows, rates today remain below the levels of the 1990s and 2000s. Real interest\u2014the Federal Government's annual interest payments after adjusting for inflation\u2014directly measures the cost of servicing the debt: the real resources that must go toward BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 47 paying off old debt rather than investing in the future or providing services to Americans now. Real interest has averaged about one percent of the economy since 1980, and rose to as high as two percent in the 1990s. even as the Budget's economic assumptions anticipate an increase in real interest rates over the coming decade\u2014a projection that is in line with private forecasters\u2014the Budget policies nevertheless keep real interest payments in line with the historical average. Overall, the Budget details an economically and fiscally responsible plan to strengthen the U.S. economy, gives families more breathing room, and reduces long-term fiscal risks.49ENSURING AN EQUITABLE, EFFECTIVE, AND ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT THAT DELIVERS RESULTS FOR ALL Under the President's leadership, the United States has made historic progress in the face of significant challenges\u2014powering a strong eco - nomic and jobs recovery, rebuilding the Nation's infrastructure, fueling a resurgence of American manufacturing, tackling the climate crisis, and investing in America's people and communities. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) defines Government-wide management priori- ties for all Federal agencies to improve how the Government operates and performs. The PMA sets forth an approach to ensure that the Federal Government has the capacity and capabilities to continue executing the President's agenda and meeting the needs of all Americans. To help deliver that future, the President's Budget advances the goals of the PMA across three key priority areas: strengthening and empowering the Federal workforce; delivering excellent, equitable, and secure Federal ser - vices and customer experience; and managing the business of Government to deliver for the American people. This work\u2014including the in-vestments the Budget puts forward in support of the PMA\u2014is critical for bolstering the Federal Government's capacity and capabilities to deliv-er for the American people today and for years to come. Values in Action The Administration's work to further devel - op and implement the PMA, including through the Budget, is guided by values, such as equity, dignity, accountability, and results. These val - ues guide the Administration's work to deliver results for the public and strengthen the capac- ity of Federal agencies. The Budget advances these values by: Ensuring the Future is Made in America by America's Workers. The President's eco - nomic agenda is focused on ensuring the fu-ture is made by all of America's workers. The Administration is working to deliver on the President's agenda by advancing a whole-of- Government effort to ensure Federal resources and programs advance domestic jobs and in - dustries\u2014which includes updated guidance and rulemakings as well as through continued trans - parency and consistency in the waiver process. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recently implemented an update to the Buy American Act domestic content requirement, which increased the domestic content standard from 55 percent to a historic 60 percent in the fall of 2022\u2014on its way to 75 percent in calen - dar year 2029. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA) requiring that all federally financed infrastructure projects must use American iron and steel, manufactured products, and construc - tion material. OMB's Made in America Office continues to work with Federal agencies to imple - ment the new domestic content requirements for Federal grants established by BABA. The Made in America Office also proposes to: maximize the use of domestic goods and service in Federal procurement and Federal Financial Assistance; strengthen the U.S. industrial base in critical sectors; and increase the number of good-paying jobs thanks to the domestic production of steel and iron products, manufactured products, and construction materials.50 eNSURING AN e QUITABL e , e FF e CTIV e , AND ACCOUNTABL e GOV e RNM e NT Promoting Accountability and Integrity. The Administration is committed to improving program integrity and ensuring effective stew- ardship of taxpayer dollars, including through implementation of the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. To deliver on those commitments, the Administration has provided Federal agencies with the tools to strengthen program integrity and deliver results. The President has made clear that results, trans-parency, and accountability go hand-in-hand, which is why the Budget includes robust legis - lative and funding proposals that would ensure agencies and their Inspectors General have the resources and authorities they need to for appro - priate oversight of these programs. The Budget: ensures resources and additional time for in - vestigations and prosecution of those engaged in major or systemic pandemic fraud; invests in identity theft and fraud prevention; and provides much-needed help for victims. Managing the Government to Deliver Results that Improve Lives. Grounded in proven, evidence-based management practices of high-performing public and private sector organi - zations, the Federal Government's approach to de - livering a more effective and efficient Government is operationalized through the Federal Performance Framework\u2014a set of management routines that are focused on defining mission suc- cess, engaging senior leaders to review progress using data-driven reviews, and reporting results transparently to the public. Last year, agencies continued making measurable progress on the 90 Agency Priority Goals (APGs) that advance near- term performance improvements in outcomes across key Administration priorities, including improving customer experience, advancing eq - uity, combatting climate change, improving the Nation's infrastructure, and meeting the health, welfare, and economic challenges from COVID-19. An overwhelming majority of APGs are on-track to meet their performance commitments by the end of 2023, while those that are lagging are ac-tively implementing mitigation plans and strate- gies to overcome barriers informed by quarterly data-driven reviews. OMB also held strategic review meetings with each major agency to ana - lyze management challenges and risks based on agencies' assessments of over 400 strategic objec - tives, including the subset of approximately 90 strategic objectives designated as making \"Area Demonstrating Noteworthy Progress\" or a \"Focus Area for Improvement,\" based on the analysis from those reviews. To improve transparency and usefulness of reporting, a new feature was added last year to https:/ /Performance.gov\u2014the Administration's central performance reporting portal\u2014that allows users to explore strategic ob - jectives and priority goals not just by agency but by policy theme. Strengthening and Empowering the Federal Workforce As the Nation's largest employer, more than four million Americans, civilian and military, serve the Federal Government, both at home and overseas, carrying out programs and ser - vices that benefit families across the Nation and around the world. Federal employees are dedi - cated and talented professional public servants, often working demanding jobs. To continue to de - liver for the American people in the 21 st Century, the Federal Government must win the competi - tion for highly-skilled talent. The Budget makes investments that would advance the first PMA priority\u2014strengthening and empowering the Federal workforce\u2014by: expanding Federal stra - tegic agency hiring capacity, prioritizing robust early-career pipelines; implementing strategic di - versity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility plans; and reimagining Federal executive Boards to fos - ter coordination and collaboration amongst senior executives outside of Washington, D.C., to better communicate and execute the Administration's management and workforce priorities across re - gions and communities. Helping Agencies Attract, Retain, and Hire Top Talent. Federal agencies are focused on attracting more people to Federal service over the long term, while also addressing immedi - ate agency hiring needs to rebuild capacity. The Federal Government continues to implement BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 51 strategic hiring practices based on skills rather than educational qualifications alone. The Budget supports the expansion of the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Hiring experience Office to continue making progress on streamlining hir - ing, including through pooled hiring actions, and improving the applicant hiring experience. The Budget also supports a renewed focus on early career pipelines as the Administration promotes the expansion of, and equitable access to Federal paid internships. The Budget also provides re-sources to support new agency requirements for personnel vetting improvements, and its Trusted Workforce 2.0 Implementation Strategy , which is designed to ensure all Americans can trust the Federal workforce to protect people, property, in - formation, and mission. The Budget provides an average pay increase of 5.2 percent for civilian and military personnel\u2014and answers the President's call for agencies to lead by example in support - ing Federal worker organizing and collective bar - gaining. In addition, the Budget also maintains the Administration's unwavering support for the career civil service through its advancement of a legislative proposal to block Schedule F, which would threaten the proper functioning of the Federal Government by unduly subjecting career employees to politization and favoritism. Building the Personnel System and Support Required to Sustain the Federal Government as a Model Employer. As the Government faces increasingly complex challeng-es, the need for Federal leaders, managers, and front-line staff with the right skills in the right jobs has never been greater. To meet this need, the Budget provides $464 million, $78 million over the 2023 enacted level, for OPM's Salaries and expenses account to enhance the Agency's ability to lead Federal human capital management and, in alignment with the Agency's Strategic Plan, to serve as a centralized leader in Federal human resources. This funding would support staffing to improve customer service provided by OPM to Federal agencies, allowing further collabora-tion in support of the Federal Government's stra - tegic workforce planning and talent acquisition functions.Delivering Excellent, Equitable, and Secure Federal Services and Customer Experience Americans rely on Federal services to support them through disasters, advance their businesses, provide opportunities for their families, safeguard their rights, and help rebuild their communities. The Federal Government must deliver a simple, seamless, and secure customer experience, on par with, or more effective than leading consumer experiences. Irrespective of age, location, digital savvy, disability, education, or english proficien - cy, the American people deserve a Government that understands who they are, what they need, and how best to deliver for them. The Budget sup- ports increased mechanisms for providing feed-back and input from the public into the work of Government, hiring for the skills and expertise required to conduct human centered design and digital service delivery, and the formation of in - teragency teams to tackle pain points from the lens of how people experience Government pro-grams at critical moments in their lives. The Budget advances these efforts\u2014delivering excellent, equitable, and secure Federal services and customer experience\u2014by: Standing up or greatly expanding de - partmental customer experience offices at nine Federal agencies, including at the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, the Interior, Labor, the Treasury, Veterans Affairs, the Small Business Administration, and the Social Security Administration (SSA); Hiring more than 120 new full-time equiv-alent individuals with relevant customer experience skills; Investing in new \"Voice of Customer\" pro - grams at seven Federal agencies to collect and report experience performance data on key drivers of customer experience from a broad representation of Americans\u2014which would drive meaningful service improvements; 52 eNSURING AN e QUITABL e , e FF e CTIV e , AND ACCOUNTABL e GOV e RNM e NT embedding the General Service Administration's Technology Trans- formation Services (TTS) with six Federal agencies to work directly on priority ser - vice improvement projects. The highly specialized customer experience and digi - tal delivery talents at TTS provide flexible surge capacity for Federal agencies in their customer experience transformation. TTS will work with the highest-volume and highest-web-traffic Federal service pro - viders to improve their website content, ensuring that information is clear and that services such as text messaging and virtual chat agents are more widely available; and Supporting specific service delivery im - provements, such as: a pilot program at the Transportation Security Agency to deploy customer experience professionals at air - ports to streamline passenger screening, improve wayfinding and communications, and collect customer feedback; support - ing the Department of State's efforts to build online passport renewal, among oth - er modernized services; and supporting the Internal Revenue Service's customer experience focus on improving online ac - count access for taxpayers. Designing, Building, and Managing Government Service Delivery for Key Life Experiences. By better coordinating service de - livery based on actual life experiences instead of bureaucratic silos, the Federal Government can better serve the American public. The Budget advances these efforts by providing funding for interagency teams to simplify the process of ac - cessing Government services. Following the first year of discovery sprints designed to assess the most effective path forward, the Budget supports cross-agency, life experience pilots, including: Funding for the Health Resources and Services Administration to help Americans more easily access essential services fol- lowing the birth of a child, including by prioritizing innovative, family-centered, and culturally competent approaches to helping families obtain critical support and information; Improving the efficiency, program in - tegrity, and accessibility of safety net benefits\u2014especially in moments when families face a financial shock\u2014by fund- ing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Administration for Children and Families to work with cross-agency partners to improve data sources and verification services infrastructure; Providing resources for SSA and CMS to jointly pilot efforts to improve the Medicare enrollment experience for people applying for Medicare benefits, including for those en - rolling in Medicare before enrolling in Social Security, and for exploring options to elimi - nate the need to have to wait for a Medicare card in the mail to connect to coverage; and Building shared products and platforms that enable simple, seamless, and secure services across the Federal Government such as the U.S. Web Design System, Digital Analytics Program, Digital.gov, Search. gov, Touchpoints Feedback Analytics, and exploring the creation of Government-wide web content standards and search engine optimization practices, including the potential of using Search.gov to better structure and connect information across agency websites. Managing the Business of Government The Federal Government influences and re - shapes markets, supports key supply chains, drives technological advances, and supports domestic manufacturing. This scale of impact creates an opportunity to leverage Federal sys - tems\u2014including the goods and services the Government buys and the financial assistance and resources it provides and oversees\u2014to cre-ate good-paying union jobs, address persistent BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 53 wealth and wage gaps, and tackle other chal - lenges. The Administration has taken bold action to leverage Federal acquisition, financial assis - tance, and financial management systems to take on some of the Nation's most pressing challenges. The Budget supports this important work and advances the third PMA priority\u2014managing the business of Government\u2014by: Maximizing the Impact of Federal Procurement. The Administration is using the Federal Government's vast purchasing power to promote clean energy solutions and support American jobs while advancing equity. In pursuit of the President's vision of a clean energy future, the Administration has set ambitious goals to reach 100 percent carbon pollution-free Federal electricity by 2030, 100 percent zero-emission ve - hicle acquisitions by 2035, and net-zero emissions in Federal buildings by 2045. Simultaneously, the Administration is working aggressively to ad- vance equity through procurement by increasing the percent of Federal contract award dollars that go to small disadvantaged businesses\u2014with a his - toric goal of 15 percent by 2025\u2014which would help break down barriers, increase access to opportu- nities and representation in the Federal market-place, and create a more resilient supplier base. The Administration is improving the efficiency of the Federal procurement system through measures such as skills-based hiring, work-based learning, and increased procurement data interoperability. Supporting Ongoing Improvements to Federal Government Capabilities and Systems in Support of the PMA The Budget also supports ongoing improve - ments to Federal Government capabilities that support an equitable, effective, and accountable Government by: Bolstering Federal Cybersecurity. To pro- tect against foreign adversaries and safeguard Federal systems that the American people rely on, the Budget bolsters cybersecurity by ensur - ing every agency is increasing the security of public services and is successfully implementing executive Order 14028, \"Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity\" and the OMB Memorandum M-22-09, Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles. OMB and the Office of the National Cyber Director released the OMB Memorandum M-22-16, Administration Cybersecurity Priorities for the 2024 Budget, which lays out three cyber in - vestment areas for Federal civilian e xecutive Branch agencies: Improving the Defense and Resilience of Government Networks; Deepening Cross-Sector Collaboration in Defense of Critical Infrastructure; and Strengthening the Foundations of our Digitally- enabled Future. To advance the Administration's commitment to making cyberspace more resilient and defensi - ble, the Budget provides an additional $145 mil - lion for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), for a total of $3.1 billion. This includes $98 million to implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2021 and $425 million to improve CISA's inter - nal cybersecurity and analytical capabilities. Advancing Federal Agency Capacity for Evidence-Based Policymaking. The President has made clear that the Administration will make decisions guided by the best available sci - ence and data by: bolstering capacity for evidence building; investing in skilled evaluators and in agencies' capacity for program evaluation ac - tivities in order to execute priority studies, in - cluding those identified in the publicly-posted Learning Agendas and Annual evaluation Plans required by the Foundations for evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018; investing in skilled statisticians and statistical infrastructure, in - cluding those that bolster public trust in statisti - cal agencies, promote a seamless data user expe - rience, equip agency leaders in data quality and confidentiality, and recognize the importance of Federal statistics in strengthening the evidence base. Modernizing Federal Information Technology (IT) Policies and Technology to Deliver a Better Experience for the American People. Technology serves as the foundation of the Federal Government's ability to deliver on 54 eNSURING AN e QUITABL e , e FF e CTIV e , AND ACCOUNTABL e GOV e RNM e NT its mission. The Administration is leading on the technology issues of the day, taking concrete steps to protect the Nation's Federal systems from com - promises, leveraging the benefits of digital identity and artificial intelligence while balancing risk, re - defining security expectations for software and the cloud, and maximizing the impact of taxpayer dol - lars to deliver a better customer experience for the American people. The Administration is focused on understanding where agencies are on their IT modernization journeys and making intentional investments at the right time to enable secure technology and innovation to advance from year to year. To support IT modernization efforts, the Budget also includes an additional $200 million for the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF), an innovative investment program that gives agencies additional ways to deliver services to the American public quickly, which manages nearly $700 million for 38 investments, across 22 Federal agencies, and has received and reviewed more than 220 proposals totaling $3.5 billion in funding demand. TMF is particularly well-positioned to make a large impact in the Federal Government's ability to deliver excellent, equitable, and secure services and customer experience by identifying opportunities to leverage technology across agen - cies and investing in IT modernization, cybersecu - rity, and user-facing services. The TMF improves the likelihood of project success through an incre - mental investment approach, tying project fund- ing to delivery of milestones and strong technical oversight. The TMF has proven to be a catalyst to show what is possible across Government\u2014and to scale lessons learned. Strengthening and Accelerating Federal Environmental Reviews and Permitting. With the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States is making a once-in-a-generation invest - ment in America's infrastructure and competi - tiveness that will create good-paying union jobs, grow the U.S. economy, invest in communities, and combat climate change. To make the most of these historic investments and ensure the timely and sound delivery of critical infrastruc- ture projects, the Administration released The Biden-Harris Permitting Action Plan to Rebuild America's Infrastructure, Accelerate the Clean Energy Transition, Revitalize Communities, and Create Jobs (Biden-Harris Permitting Action Plan) to ensure the Federal environmental re - view and permitting process is: effective; efficient; timely and transparent; guided by the best avail - able science to promote positive environmental and community outcomes; and shaped by early and meaningful public engagement. The Budget provides agencies with resources to execute the Biden-Harris Permitting Action Plan , and strengthen and accelerate Federal environmental reviews and permitting processes. These resourc-es would help deliver infrastructure investments on time, on task, and on budget. 55DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE The President's 2024 Budget: Supports a Strong Nutrition Safety Net. The Budget provides $7.1 billion for critical nutrition programs, including $6.3 billion to fully fund the 6.5 million individuals expected to participate in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program (SNAP) for Women, Infants, and Children, which is critical to the health of pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and young children. This program helps low-income families put nutritious food on the table and addresses racial disparities in maternal and child health outcomes. The Budget also includes $15 billion over 10 years to allow more States and schools to leverage participation in the Community eligibility Provision to provide healthy and free school meals to an additional nine million children. Builds and Protects a Fair and Resilient Food Supply Chain. The Budget supports on - going actions to develop more diverse, robust, and resilient local and regional supply chains by targeting funding to increase the production capacity among smaller producers, including continuing overtime user fee relief as established in the American Rescue Plan. The Budget complements these targeted investments by strengthening market oversight through the Agricultural Marketing Service to support fair markets and competitive meat and poultry product prices for American families and increasing safeguards against invasive pests and diseases through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. These programs build on the pandemic and supply chain assistance funding in the American Rescue Plan to address COVID-19 pandemic-related vulnerabilities in the food system and create new market op - portunities and good-paying jobs that promote a safe and healthy work environment. The Budget also provides an increase of $102 million above the 2023 enacted level for the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) for a total of $1.3 billion. This funding would enable The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for providing nutrition assistance to low-income Americans and a safety net for the farm sector, and for conserving and preserving the Nation's forests and private agricultural lands. The President's 2024 Budget for USDA invests in: creating jobs and opportunity in rural communities; lowering energy costs for Americans; strengthening food supply chains and the nutrition safety net; supporting underserved farmers and producers; restoring America's advantage in agriculture; tackling the climate crisis while mitigating its ongoing impacts; and advancing environmental justice. The Budget requests $30.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $3.8 billion or 14-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level, excluding Food for Peace Title II Grants, which are included in the State and International Programs total. Resources provided through the 2024 Budget complement investments in conservation, forest management, and broadband deployment provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act.56 DePARTM eNT OF AGRICUL TUR e the hiring of more inspectors and public health veterinarians, which would help increase the strength and flexibility of FSIS to respond to market demands and provide safe and healthy food products. Connects More Rural Americans to High-Speed, Affordable, and Reliable Internet. The President is committed to ensuring that every American has access to broadband in - ternet. Installing high-speed internet creates high-paying union jobs and strengthens rural economies, which leads to higher property values, increased job and population growth, lower unemployment rates, and new business formation. Reliable internet is also crucial for ru - ral Americans to access healthcare services through telehealth. Building on the $2 billion for USDA broadband programs provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 2023, the Budget provides $400 million for the ReConnect program, which provides grants and loans to deploy broadband to unserved areas, especially tribal areas. With the funding provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, USDA has provided nearly $548 million to people living and working across 21 States and Territories, which is expected to expand access to 43,189 households. Invests in the Wildland Firefighting Workforce. The Budget ensures that no Federal fire - fighter would make less than $15 an hour and invests in the wildland firefighting workforce at USDA and the Department of the Interior (DOI) through a new comprehensive and equitable compensation structure. The Budget also increases the size of the workforce at USDA and DOI and supports additional mental and physical health services for that workforce. Together, these efforts would help address long-standing recruitment and retention challenges. These investments, totaling $316 million over the 2023 enacted level, would build on the historic reforms in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and ensure that the Forest Service receives the support it needs to continue meeting evolving mission demands, as both the frequency and intensity of catastrophic wildfires are expected to continue to increase due to climate change. Reduces Catastrophic Wildfire Risk. The Budget provides $323 million to complement $1.8 billion provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and $1.6 billion provided in the Inflation Reduction Act for 2023 to support ongoing implementation of the 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy. These resources would increase the scale of hazardous fuel reduction and res - toration treatments within high-risk \"firesheds\" as part of the Administration's comprehensive, nationwide response to the threat of catastrophic wildfire to natural resources, communities, and infrastructure. Increases Climate Resilience. The Budget provides $1.2 billion, $208 million above the 2023 enacted level, to increase conservation adoption and farm income across privately owned land through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The Budget builds upon and supports the generational investments provided through the Inflation Reduction Act to increase the voluntary adoption of conservation practices that sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with agricultural production. Within the amount pro - vided in the Inflation Reduction Act are funds to develop a system to quantify environmental impacts at the field level. This important effort supports a foundation for voluntary envi-ronmental services markets, complementing NRCS's work by leveraging private and other non-Federal investments and providing additional income opportunities for America's farm - ers. To implement these investments, NRCS would draw upon Federal, State, and private conservationists, hiring thousands of employees\u2014creating good paying jobs throughout rural America. The Budget also proposes to make USDA's cover crop pilot program permanent. BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 57 Lowers Energy Costs and Supports Building Clean Energy in Rural Communities. Rural communities are critical to achieving the goal of 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. The Budget builds on the $13 billion provided in the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce energy bills for families, expand clean energy, transform rural power production, and create thou - sands of good-paying jobs for people across rural America. The Budget provides $30 million for grants and $1 billion for loan guarantees for renewable energy systems and energy ef-ficiency improvements for farmers and rural small businesses. The Budget also provides $6.5 billion in authority for rural electric loans to support additional clean energy, energy storage, and transmission projects that would create good-paying jobs. In addition, the Budget includes $15 million to support the creation of the Rural Clean energy Initiative. This funding would provide critical technical assistance to rural electric providers and help to achieve the President's clean energy goals and ensure funding reaches rural areas. Restores American Leadership in Agricultural Innovation and Research. The People's Republic of China has become the largest funder of agricultural research and develop - ment (R&D) in the world, surpassing the United States and the european Union. The Budget restores American innovation in agriculture by providing a total of more than $4 billion, a $299 million increase above the 2023 enacted level, for agricultural research, education, and outreach. This includes $370 million to increase capacity among historically underserved pop - ulations. The Budget provides $7 billion for climate related funding, a $2 billion increase over the 2023 enacted level. This amount includes $612 million for the Department's core climate related R&D activities, which includes the impacts of weather and water cycle variations on soil, air, and water resources needed for agricultural production. In addition, the Budget in - vests in ensuring innovative products can come to market safely and efficiently with improved regulatory review. Promotes Climate Resiliency and Reduces Housing Insecurity in Rural Communities. Affordable housing has been a long-standing problem for low-income resi - dents in rural communities, one that is exacerbated by low energy efficiency of the aging housing stock which means higher costs to families. To help address this, the Budget includes a new proposal to eliminate the existing low-income borrower penalty that requires individu-als to repay subsidy costs for Single-Family Direct loans\u2014a requirement that only exists for rural housing. The Budget also increases funding by $331 million above the 2023 enacted level for USDA's multifamily housing programs. This initiative would allow the Administration to reduce rent burdens for low-income borrowers while also increasing the resiliency of rural housing to the impacts of climate change through a proposal to require energy and water ef - ficiency improvements and green features in USDA's rural housing programs that include construction. Supports the 2023 Farm Bill. The Budget provides USDA with the staffing resources neces-sary to implement the 2023 Farm Bill. The Administration looks forward to working this year with the Congress, partners, stakeholders, and the public to identify shared priorities for the 2023 Farm Bill that positions USDA to seamlessly continue implementation and build on the historic legislative achievements of the first two years of the Administration. The 2023 Farm Bill is a crucial opportunity for American agriculture and rural America to transform the food and agricultural system from one that benefits a few to one that benefits many, while strength - ening USDA's nutrition programs, which are among the most far-reaching tools available to improve the health and well-being of Americans. To advance the vision of agriculture and rural economies building opportunity from the bottom up and middle out, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to create opportunity and new revenue streams for American farmers, ranchers, and producers of all sizes through climate smart agriculture 58 DePARTM eNT OF A GRICULTUR e and forestry, biobased products, renewable energy, local and regional food systems, and other value-added opportunities, while reducing the paperwork burden for Federal programs and achieving best in Government practices. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to: support new and beginning farmers; shore up the Federal Government's commitment to agricultural research; address cli - mate change through voluntary incentives to reduce climate risk and improvements to crop insurance; maintain a commitment to conservation programs and investments in clean energy; continue efforts on food loss and waste; and implement climate-smart agriculture and forestry actions to open new market opportunities and provide a competitive advantage for American producers\u2014including small and historically underserved producers and early adopters. In ad- dition, the Administration seeks to protect rural communities by exploring solutions related to chemical contaminations of crops, livestock, and water, along with strengthening biode - fense and animal health and disease protection, in line with the 2022 National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Security. The 2023 Farm Bill is also a critical opportunity to ensure that the wealth created in rural America stays there and to empower rural commu - nities with the tools necessary to advance their locally-led vision. The 2023 Farm Bill is also an opportunity to make progress toward the goal of ensuring that all Americans have access to healthy, affordable food, as emphasized in the Biden-Harris Administration's National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition and Health. This is an important moment to reconsider strengthening cross enrollment capabilities across Federal assistance programs and eliminating barriers to food assistance for vulnerable groups. These barriers make it difficult for underserved groups to succeed, including low-income college students, individuals reentering society and seeking a second chance, youth who have aged out of foster care, kinship families, low-income individuals in the U.S. Territories, and SNAP recipients facing time limits. Rather than reducing obstacles to employment, research demonstrates that time limits on SNAP eligibility amplify existing inequities in food and economic security. Beyond removing barriers to food access, there is also the opportunity to make healthier choic- es easier by expanding food purchasing options, fruit and vegetable incentives, and local food procurement through Federal nutrition programs, including by building upon efforts already plotted by USDA. The Farm Bill reauthorization process is also an opportunity to strengthen program integrity to address new risks and vulnerabilities while ensuring that USDA can continue to support the needs of all eligible households.59DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE The Department of Commerce (Commerce) is responsible for: promoting job creation; supporting and overseeing international trade; and providing economic, environmental, and scientific information needed by businesses, citizens, and governments .

The President's 2024 Budget for ED: makes critical investments to spur the Nation's future prosperity; addresses learning and funding gaps between more and less advantaged students; bolsters mental health supports for students; expands access to high-quality preschool; meets the needs of students with disabilities; increases affordability and quality in higher education; and invests in programs to improve connections between the K-12 system, higher education, and the workforce. The Budget requests $90 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $10.8 billion or 13.6-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level. The President's 2024 Budget: Pre-K to -12th Grade Education Invests in High-Poverty Schools. To help ensure that every student receives a high-qual - ity education, the Budget provides $20.5 billion for Title I, a $2.2 billion increase above the 2023 enacted level. This funding would continue historic progress over the past two years, as the Congress has provided a total increase of $1.9 billion for Title I since 2021. Title I delivers critical funding to 90 percent of school districts across the Nation, helping them to provide students in low-income communities the academic opportunities and support they need to succeed. This investment addresses chronic funding gaps between high-poverty schools\u2014which disproportionately serve students of color\u2014and their wealthier counterparts and would help schools sustain critical investments in accelerated learning and other areas that were made with American Rescue Plan funds. Expands Access to High-Quality Preschool. The Budget includes a major new manda - tory funding proposal for a Federal-State partnership to provide free, high-quality preschool offered in the setting of a parent's choice\u2014from public schools to child care providers to Head Start. The proposal gives States the flexibility to expand preschool to three-year-old children once they make high-quality preschool fully available to four-year-old children. Over the next 10 years, this proposal would dramatically expand access to effective early childhood education, ensuring students enter kindergarten ready to succeed. This proposal would be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services in collaboration with eD. The Budget also includes $500 million for demonstration grants to create or expand free, high-quality preschool in school or community-based settings for children eligible to attend Title I schools. The demonstration grants, which would require close collaboration among school districts, Head Start, and other community-based providers, would serve as models 68 DePARTM eNT OF eDUCATION that could be adopted across the Nation. This program would expand its reach by encouraging districts to leverage Title I funds, along with other Federal, State, and local funds. Bolsters Mental Health Supports for All Students. Just as physical health and nutrition is critical to learning, so too is mental health. The lingering impacts of COVID-19 pandemic disruptions have taken a heavy toll on the physical and mental health of many students, teach - ers, and school staff. Research shows that students who receive social, emotional, and mental and behavioral supports perform better academically. The Budget provides $578 million to in - crease the number of school-based counselors, psychologists, social workers, and other health professionals in K-12 schools and to support colleges and universities develop campus-wide strategies to address student mental health needs including hiring additional providers on their campuses. This funding is in addition to the $1 billion the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act provided to address mental health staffing shortages in schools. Increases Support for Children with Disabilities. every child with a disability should have access to the high-quality early intervention, special education services, and personnel needed to thrive in school and graduate ready for college or a career. The Budget invests $16.8 billion in Individuals with Disabilities e ducation Act (ID e A) grants to support special education and related services for more than 7 million students with disabilities in grades Pre-K through 12, an increase of $2.1 billion above the 2023 enacted level. The Budget also in- vests $932 million in ID eA Part C grants, an increase of $392 million above the 2023 enacted level, which support early intervention services for infants and families with disabilities that are critical to supporting children's developmental and academic outcomes. The increased funding would support States in implementing important reforms to expand enrollment of un - derserved children, including children of color, children from low-income families, and children living in rural areas. The increase includes $200 million to expand and streamline enrollment of children at risk of developing disabilities, such as children born with very low-birth weight or who have been exposed to environmental toxins, which would help mitigate the need for more extensive services later in childhood and further expand access to the program for un - derserved children. To address persistent special educator shortages States are facing, the Budget also invests $304 million to train and retain special education teachers, related service providers, and early intervention personnel. In addition, the Budget invests $20 million to ensure military-connected children with disabilities and other highly mobile children with disabilities maintain services when they change school districts. Supports Full-Service Community Schools. Community schools play a critical role in providing comprehensive wrap-around services to students and their families, including af - terschool programs, adult education opportunities, and health and nutrition services. The Budget provides $368 million for this program, an increase of $218 million above the 2023 enacted level. The increase would also help school districts implement integrated student sup-ports to meet student and family social, emotional, mental, and physical health needs through partnerships with community-based organizations and other entities. Addresses Critical Educator Shortages.

The Budget includes $100 million for a grant program to support voluntary efforts by communities interested in developing and implementing strategies to promote racial and socioeconomic diversity in their schools. Education Beyond High School Reimagines the High School to Higher Education Transition. Reimagining traditional educational pathways to higher education is critical to improving outcomes for all students. The Budget provides a $200 million investment, focused on the Career-Connected High Schools initiative, to increase the integration and alignment of the last two years of high school and the first two years of higher education by expanding access to dual enrollment, work-based learning, college and career advising, and the opportunity to earn industry-recognized creden - tials while in high school. Improves College Affordability and Provides Free Community College. To help low- and middle-income students overcome financial barriers to postsecondary education, the Budget proposes to increase the discretionary maximum Pell Grant by $500, expanding access to the grant to reach over 6.8 million students. This request builds on successful bipartisan efforts to increase the maximum Pell Grant award by $900 over the past two years, and pro - vides a path to double the maximum award by 2029. The Budget also expands free community college across the Nation through a new Federal-State partnership. To lay the groundwork for this program, the Budget includes $500 million in a new discretionary grant program to provide two-years of free community college for students enrolled in high-quality programs that lead to a four-year degree or a good-paying job. In addition, the Budget provides two years of subsidized tuition for students from families earning less than $125,000 enrolled in a four-year Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Tribally Controlled College and University (TCCU), or Minority-Serving Institution (MSI). Supports Students through Completion. The Budget supports strategies to improve the retention, transfer, and completion rates of students by investing in the Federal TRIO Programs, Gaining early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, and Postsecondary Student Success Grants Program. The Budget also promotes student success through the 70 DePARTM eNT OF eDUCATION creation of new funding for postsecondary mental health supports, and investments to build holistic systems of student supports and academic success by providing critical resources to support students' basic needs, including increased funding to help students access non-stu - dent aid public benefits and to provide affordable child care for low-income student parents. Expands institutional capacity at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs, and Community Colleges. The Budget increases institutional capacity at HBCUs, TCCUs, MSIs, and under-resourced institutions, including community colleges, by providing an increase of $429 million above the 2023 enacted level. This significant funding includes $350 million for four-year HBCUs, TCCUs, and MSIs to expand research and development infrastructure at these institutions. Invests in Services for Student Borrowers. The Budget provides $2.7 billion for the Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), a $620 million increase above the 2023 enacted level. This ad - ditional funding is needed to provide better support to student loan borrowers, especially as they return to repayment. This increase would allow FSA to implement critical improvements to student loan servicing, continue to modernize its digital infrastructure, and ensure the successful administration of its financial aid programs through a simplified and streamlined process for students and borrowers. Office for Civil Rights Strengthens Civil Rights Enforcement. The Budget provides $178 million to the Department of education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), a 27-percent increase above the 2023 enacted level. This robust funding would ensure that OCR has sufficient capacity to protect equal access to education through the enforcement of civil rights laws.71DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for supporting the Nation's prosperity by addressing its climate, energy, environmental, and nuclear security challenges through transformative science and technology solutions. The President's 2024 Budget for DOE: invests in basic research and scientific infrastructure authorized in the CHIPS and Science Act; creates jobs building clean energy infrastructure; targets greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions across sectors; advances energy justice; and modernizes and ensures the safety and security of the nuclear weapons stockpile.

The Budget invests nearly $2 billion to support clean energy workforce and infrastructure projects across the Nation, including: $425 million to weatherize and retro - fit homes of low-income Americans'; $83 million to electrify tribal homes and transition tribal colleges and universities to renewable energy; and $107 million for the Grid Deployment Office to support utilities and State and local governments in building a grid that is more secure, reliable, and resilient and that integrates increasing levels of renewable energy. These invest - ments, which complement and bolster the historic funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, would create good-paying jobs while driving progress toward the Administration's climate goals, including carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. Reduces Industrial Emissions. Meeting the challenge of climate change will require dra - matic technological advances across energy use sectors. The industrial sector in particular represents a major opportunity for significant GHG reductions while modernizing the U.S. industrial base for a more competitive future. Across the $1.2 billion in DO e discretionary funding for industrial decarbonization activities described above, the Budget reflects the importance of strategically supporting U.S. industrial decarbonization through innovation, targeted investment, and technical assistance. The Budget encourages adoption of industrial decarbonization solutions including through the Office of Manufacturing and energy Supply Chains (M eSC) and expanded research and development efforts in the Industrial efficiency and Decarbonization Office. The Budget includes $160 million for the Office of Clean energy Demonstrations to support at least two large-scale industrial decarbonization projects directly benefitting disadvantaged communities. Strengthens Domestic and International Clean Energy Supply Chains. To build on the resurgence of American manufacturing, the Budget complements funding provided in the Inflation Reduction Act by providing robust support for Loan Program Office administrative expenses to originate and oversee the ambitious growth in the financing of clean energy and advanced technology vehicle manufacturing projects envisioned in the Inflation Reduction Act. The Budget proposes a $75 million investment to launch a Global Clean energy Manufacturing effort within the M eSC that would build resilient supply chains for climate and clean energy equipment through engagement with allies, enabling an effective global response to the cli - mate crisis while creating economic opportunities for the United States to increase the global clean technology market. In addition, the Administration supports the use of the Defense Production Act at DO e to support rebuilding domestic uranium production and enrichment capacity to establish a secure supply for the Nation's current and future nuclear fleet and also to reduce reliance on foreign supplies of uranium, as well as other clean energy technologies to ensure robust supply chains for electrical transformers and other critical grid components. The Budget also includes $75 million in M eSC for DO e to carry out the President's recent determinations under the Defense Production Act. BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 73 Supports Energy Communities. The Budget provides $905 million for DO e's Office of Fossil energy and Carbon Management to advance technologies that can provide economic revitalization opportunities in energy communities. The Budget also includes dedicated fund - ing for the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and economic Revitalization to coordinate interagency efforts and stakeholder engagement across Federal agencies. This interagency effort would expand the delivery of Federal resources and advance job-creating investments in communities affected by the energy transition. Advances Environmental Justice and Equity. The Budget includes historic support for underserved communities, including $70 million for Community Capacity Building initiatives in the Office of environmental Management and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to address areas of persistent poverty located around the Department's sites. The Budget also includes $54 million for the Office of economic Impact and Diversity to help imple - ment the Department's Justice40 Initiative efforts and equity action plan, and $13 million for the Office of Legacy Management (LM) to strengthen its environmental justice mission. The Budget supports programs, including Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research and Reaching a New energy Sciences Workforce in the Office of Science, to train and support a diverse and inclusive scientific workforce for the future. In addition, the Budget includes $50 million for the newly established Office of State and Community energy Programs to launch a new energy Burden Reduction Pilot to lower energy costs of at least 3,000 low- income homes while also reducing GHG emissions. These investments would build healthy, sustainable, and resilient communities. Reduces Health and Environmental Hazards for At-Risk Communities. The Budget includes $8.3 billion for the environmental Management program to support the cleanup of communities used during the Manhattan Project and Cold War for nuclear weapons produc - tion. The Budget also provides $196 million for the LM to ensure cleanup remedies at these sites remain protective of human health and the environment. The Administration would ensure investments for the cleanup of legacy pollution and long-term stewardship support the Justice40 Initiative to benefit disadvantaged communities. Strengthens the Cybersecurity and Resilience of the Energy Sector. The Budget pro - vides $245 million to enhance the security of clean energy technologies and the energy supply chain. The Budget also includes increased assistance to States, local governments, Tribes, and Territories for emergency planning and preparation, including for events caused by the impacts of climate change. Strengthens the Nation's Nuclear Security Enterprise. The Budget makes historic in- vestments in the Nation's nuclear security enterprise to implement the President's Nuclear Posture Review. The Budget supports a safe, secure, and effective nuclear stockpile. In ad - dition, the Budget continues robust, executable funding for the recapitalization of NNSA's physical infrastructure, including essential scientific and production facilities to ensure the deterrent remains viable. Restores American Leadership in Arms Control and Nonproliferation. The Budget continues to enhance DO e's expertise, infrastructure, and capabilities needed to reduce nuclear risks and counter the global challenge of nuclear proliferation. As called for in the Administration's National Security Strategy , the Budget supports DO e's efforts to secure nu - clear and radiological materials and prevent terrorists from acquiring them. The Budget also continues to strengthen the Nation's capability to respond to nuclear incidents at home and 74 DePARTM eNT OF eNeRGY abroad. In addition, the Budget funds the development of more demanding verification tech - nologies as part of an integrated approach to the future of arms control. Powers the Nuclear Navy.

The President's 2024 Budget for HHS: expands access to quality, affordable healthcare while lowering costs; dramatically improves access to early care and learning; advances the Cancer Moonshot; transforms behavioral healthcare; prepares for future pandemics; bolsters maternal health; advances health equity; transforms child welfare; combats hunger and improves nutrition and food safety; and supports rural health. The Budget requests $144 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $14.8 billion or 11.5-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level, excluding Contract Support Costs and Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 Section 105(l) lease amounts requested for the Indian Health Service (IHS), which the Budget proposes to shift from discretionary to mandatory funding. The President's 2024 Budget: Expands Access to Quality, Affordable Healthcare. The President believes that health-care should be a right, not a privilege. With enrollment in affordable health coverage at an all-time high, the Budget builds on the incredible success of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), by: making permanent the expanded premium tax credits that the Inflation Reduction Act extended; and providing Medicaid-like coverage to individuals in States that have not adopted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, paired with financial incentives to ensure States maintain their existing expansions. The Budget makes significant investments in strengthening the Nation's long-term care system. The Budget invests $150 billion over 10 years to improve and expand Medicaid home and community-based services, such as personal care services, which allow older Americans and individuals with disabilities to remain in their homes and stay active in their communities. This $150 billion would improve the quality of jobs for home care workers and support family caregivers. This investment is complemented by a robust agenda to: improve the safety and quality of nursing home care, including efforts to improve ownership transparency; address the backlog of complaint surveys and provide adequate funding to conduct nursing home inspections; increase the inspection of low-performing nursing homes via the special focus facilities program; and expand financial penalties for substandard facilities. Reduces Drug and Other Healthcare Costs for All Americans. The Budget builds upon the Inflation Reduction Act to continue lowering the cost of prescription drugs. For Medicare, this includes further strengthening its newly established negotiation power by negotiating more drugs and bringing drugs into negotiation sooner after they launch. The Budget also proposes to limit Medicare Part D cost-sharing for high-value generic drugs, 76 DePARTM eNT OF HeALTH AND H UMAN Se RVIC e S such as those used to treat chronic diseases like hypertension and high cholesterol, to no more than $2. For Medicaid, the Budget includes proposals to ensure Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are prudent purchasers of prescription drugs, such as au - thorizing HHS to negotiate supplemental drug rebates on behalf of interested States in order to pool purchasing power. For the commercial market, the Budget includes proposals to curb inflation in prescription drug prices and cap the prices of insulin products at $35 for a monthly prescription. Protects and Strengthens Medicare. The Budget would extend the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund by at least 25 years, without cutting any benefits or raising costs for people with Medicare. The Budget includes key reforms to the tax code to ensure high-income individuals pay their fair share into the HI trust fund. The Budget also directs the revenue from the Net Investment Income Tax into the HI trust fund as was origi - nally intended. In addition, the Budget credits the savings from the Budget's proposed drug reforms into the HI trust fund. Expands Access to Affordable, High-Quality Early Care and Education. The Budget advances the President's goal of ensuring that all families can access affordable, high-quality child care and free, high-quality preschool, helping children learn, giving families breathing room, and growing the economy. The President's plan enables States to increase child care options for more than 16 million young children and lower costs so that parents can afford to send their children to the high-quality child care program of their choice, allowing them to go to work or pursue training with the peace of mind that their children are being set up for a lifetime of success. The Budget also funds a Federal-State partnership that provides high-quality, universal, free preschool offered in the setting of a parent's choice\u2014from public schools to child care providers to Head Start\u2014to support healthy child development and en - sure children enter kindergarten ready to succeed. The proposal enables States to increase preschool access and quality by providing high-quality preschool to all of the approximately four million four-year-old children in the Nation, and it gives States the flexibility to expand preschool to three-year-olds after preschool is available to all four-year-olds. The estimat - ed cost of these investments is $600 billion over 10 years. In addition, the Budget provides $22.5 billion in discretionary funds for HHS's existing early care and education programs, an increase of $2.1 billion over the 2023 enacted level. This includes $9 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, an increase of nearly $1 billion over the 2023 enacted level, to expand access to quality, affordable child care for families across the Nation. The Budget also helps young children enter kindergarten ready to learn by providing $13.1 billion for Head Start, an increase of $1.1 billion over the 2023 enacted level. In addition, Budget helps States improve their early childhood systems by building on existing Federal, State, and local early care and learning investments by funding the Preschool Development Grants program at $360 million, an increase of $45 million over the 2023 enacted level. Advances Progress toward Cancer Moonshot Goals. The Cancer Moonshot Initiative aims to reduce the cancer death rate by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years and improve the experience of people who are living with or have survived cancer, their families, and care - givers. Reaching these goals will require progress in ways to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and ensure that the tools we have and those we develop along the way reach more Americans. Investments across the Cancer Cabinet agencies would be targeted to priority actions includ - ing: close the screening gap; understand and address environmental exposure; decrease the impact of preventable cancers; bring cutting-edge research through the pipeline to patients and communities; and support patients and caregivers. The Budget includes $1 billion for dedicated Cancer Moonshot activities across the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 77 (CDC), IHS, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as a total investment at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of $7.8 billion to drive progress on ways to prevent, detect, and treat cancer. In addition, the Budget proposes to increase mandatory funding for the 21st Century Cures Act Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot initiative at NCI through 2026. In addition, the Budget provides an increase of $1 billion for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, for a total of $2.5 billion, to drive innovative health research and speed the implementation of breakthroughs that would transform the treatment, prevention, and early detection of cancer and other diseases. As the Administration works to address the single biggest driver of cancer deaths in the Nation\u2014 smoking\u2014the Budget also includes an investment of $258 million in tobacco prevention and control efforts at the CDC, including tobacco cessation activities to help Americans quit. Transforms Behavioral Healthcare. The United States is facing a behavioral health crisis. Recently enacted legislation, such as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, takes significant steps to address this crisis, and the Administration is working on implementing important be - havioral health and school mental health investments. Still, much more can be done. Nearly one in four adults 18 and older, and one in three adults aged 18 to 25, had a mental illness in the past year. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people ages 10 to 24, and teen girls, in particular, are experiencing record high levels of violence, sadness, and suicide risk. More than 46 million people had a substance use disorder, nearly 94 percent of whom did not receive treatment. For people with private health insurance, the Budget expands cover - age of mental health benefits and strengthens the network of behavioral health providers. For people with Medicare, the Budget lowers patients' costs for mental health services, requires parity in coverage between behavioral health and medical benefits, and expands coverage for behavioral health providers. The Budget provides historic investments in the behavioral health workforce, youth mental health treatment, Certified Community Based Behavioral Health Clinics, Community Mental Health Centers, and mental health research. The Budget strengthens access to crisis services by investing in the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline to ad - dress 100 percent of estimated contacts, scaling follow-up crisis services, and expanding CDC's suicide prevention program to all States, the District of Columbia, and 18 tribal and territo - rial jurisdictions. To address the mental health crisis among adolescents, the Budget expands CDC's What Works in Schools program to up to 75 of the largest local education agencies. The Budget also accelerates mental health research for promising new treatments and enhanced precision and implementation of existing treatments. Invests in Community Health Centers and the Nation's Healthcare Workforce. Because community health centers\u2014which provide comprehensive services regardless of abil - ity to pay\u2014serve one in three people living in poverty and one in five rural residents, the Budget puts the Health Center Program on a path to double its size and expand its reach. To bolster the healthcare workforce, the Budget expands the National Health Service Corps, which pro - vides loan repayment and scholarships to healthcare professionals in exchange for practicing in underserved areas, and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical education Program, which trains residents in community-based healthcare clinics in rural and high-need areas. The Budget also addresses healthcare workforce shortages through new investments, includ - ing $32 million to increase the nurse faculty essential to growing the Nation's nurse workforce, and $28 million in innovative approaches to recruit, support, and train new providers. Supports Family Planning Services for More Americans. For more than 50 years, Title X family planning clinics have played a critical role in ensuring access to a broad range of high-quality family planning and preventive health services. Most Title X clients live in pov- erty and the uninsured rate of Title X users is twice the national average, making the Title 78 DePARTM eNT OF HeALTH AND H UMAN Se RVIC e S X family planning program a critical part of the public health safety net. The program has served as a point of entry into care for nearly 195 million people over its more than 50-year his - tory. The Budget includes $512 million, a 79-percent increase above the 2023 enacted level, for the Title X Family Planning program to increase the number of patients served to 4.5 million. Guarantees Adequate and Stable Funding for IHS. The Administration is committed to upholding the United States' trust responsibility to tribal nations by addressing the histori - cal underfunding of IHS. Consistent and predictable funding for IHS is critical to addressing historical underfunding and improving access to care. The enactment of an advance appropria - tion for 2024 for IHS was a historic and welcome step toward the goal of securing adequate and stable funding to improve the overall health status of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Building on the advance appropriation, the Budget requests an additional $3 billion in discre - tionary resources in 2024 for a total of $8.1 billion in discretionary resources. Furthermore, the Budget proposes to reclassify as mandatory IHS contract support costs and leases start - ing in 2024, for a total of $9.4 billion in discretionary and mandatory resources. Beginning in 2025, the Budget proposes all resources as mandatory. In 2024, the Administration will focus on implementing the advance appropriation and continuing consultation with Tribes on man - datory funding for IHS. In 2025, the Administration would shift the IHS budget from mostly discretionary to all mandatory funding. The mandatory proposal would automatically grow funding to keep pace with inflation and population growth, close longstanding service and facility shortfalls over time, and improve access to high-quality healthcare. The Budget also proposes to reauthorize and increase funding for the Special Diabetes Program for Indians to $250 million in 2024. This program has been critical in lowering the prevalence of diabetes in Indian Country. Prepares for Future Pandemics and Other Biological Threats and Strengthens Public Health Systems. The United States must catalyze advances in science, technology, and core capabilities to prevent and prepare for future biological threats, which could emerge with increasing frequency. The Budget includes $20 billion in mandatory funding for HHS public health agencies in support of the Administration's pandemic prevention and preparedness and biodefense priorities as outlined in the 2021 American Pandemic Preparedness: Transforming Our Capabilities plan and 2022 National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Health Security. The Budget also includes $400 million in new discretionary resources within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response to prepare for pandemics and biological threats, as well as key discretionary investments for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the Strategic National Stockpile to support ad - vanced development and procurement of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic capabilities against known and unknown high priority threats. The Budget includes a total of $10.5 billion in discretionary funding to build public health capacity at the CDC and at the State and local levels, including expanding capacity to respond to emerging threats, including surveillance, laboratory, and public health workforce capacities. In addition, the Budget supports efforts to modernize public health data systems and enables the CDC to establish cadres of response-ready staff who can quickly deploy during emergencies. For the first time in decades, the Budget also includes $50 million for the Public Health emergency Fund to ensure HHS is able to respond to emerging public health threats without delay. In addition, the Budget in - cludes mandatory funding to catalyze development of drugs that address the pandemic threat of antimicrobial resistance. The Budget also proposes key new HHS authorities to improve preparedness, incorporating lessons learned from recent public health emergencies, such as to enhance the visibility and the resilience of the medical product supply chain. BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 79 Advances Maternal Health and Health Equity. The United States has the highest mater - nal mortality rate among developed nations, and rates are disproportionately high for Black and American Indian and Alaska Native women. The Budget includes $471 million to: sup - port ongoing implementation of the White House Blueprint for Addressing the Maternal Health Crisis and reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates; expand maternal health initia - tives in rural communities; implement implicit bias training for healthcare providers; create pregnancy medical home demonstration projects; and address the highest rates of perinatal health disparities, including by supporting the perinatal health workforce. In addition, the Budget requires all States to provide continuous Medicaid coverage for 12 months postpartum, eliminating gaps in health insurance at a critical time for women. Recognizing that maternal mental health conditions are the most common complications of pregnancy and childbirth, the Budget continues to support the maternal mental health hotline as well as screening and treatment for maternal depression and related behavioral disorders. To address the lack of data on health disparities and further improve access to care, the Budget strengthens collec - tion and evaluation of sociodemographic data. Supports Rural Health. Rural America faces persistent disparities in access to healthcare, including higher uninsured rates, limited healthcare provider availability, and rural hospital closures. Providing Medicaid-like coverage to individuals in States that have not adopted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, as the Budget proposes, is critical for rural communities. The Budget also includes investments to improve the health of rural communi-ties, including by helping rural hospitals stay open, expanding the pipeline of rural healthcare workers, and facilitating access to quality care. The Budget includes $30 million to provide assistance to rural hospitals at-risk of closure and to support expansion of hospital service lines to meet rural communities' needs. The Budget also supports rural healthcare work - force development and training programs and telehealth. Recognizing that rural communities have higher rates of suicide, and high rates of overdose deaths and mental illness, the Budget provides dedicated funding to rural communities, including rural health clinics, to support behavioral health. Invests in the Treatment and Prevention of Infectious Diseases. The Budget invests in the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, including Hepatitis C, HIV, and vaccine-preventable diseases, by supporting comprehensive programs that would expand access to curative and preventive medications. The Budget includes a new mandatory proposal for a national program to significantly expand screening, testing, treatment, prevention, and mon - itoring of Hepatitis C infections in the United States, with a specific focus on populations with high infection levels. This program would support Federal procurement of life-saving treatments, while bolstering provider capacity and related public health efforts such as test - ing, communication, and surveillance. The Budget invests $850 million in the ending the HIV epidemic Initiative across HHS to aggressively reduce new HIV cases, increase access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (also known as Pr eP), and ensure equitable access to services and support for those living with HIV. The Budget also reduces Medicaid costs by eliminating bar - riers to accessing Pr eP for Medicaid beneficiaries and proposes a new mandatory program to: guarantee Pr eP at no cost for all uninsured and underinsured individuals; provide essential wrap-around services through States, IHS, tribal entities, and localities; and establish a net - work of community providers to reach underserved areas and populations. In addition, the Budget proposes a new Vaccines for Adults program to provide uninsured adults with access to routine and outbreak vaccines at no cost and expands the Vaccines for Children program to include all children under age 19 enrolled in CHIP.80 DePARTM eNT OF HeALTH AND H UMAN Se RVIC e S Reduces Hunger and Diet-Related Chronic Diseases and Improves Food Safety. The Budget proposes investments in nutrition to help end hunger and reduce diet-related chronic diseases by 2030. The Budget requests a total of $137 million in discretionary funding to ad - dress specific commitments made as part of the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health and corresponding National Strategy. This includes funding: to conduct nutrition research; to expand CDC's State Physical Activity and Nutrition Program to all States and Territories; to improve labeling to empower consumers to make good food choices; to enhance dietary and physical activity guidelines for Americans; and to increase support for senior nutri - tion programs. The Budget proposes to expand Medicare access to cover nutrition and obesity counseling services and to pilot coverage of medically-tailored meals in Medicare. The Budget also supports strengthening access to nutrition and obesity counseling in Medicaid. In addi-tion, the Budget strengthens FDA's ability to ensure that food is safe, particularly for infants and children. The Budget provides investments in FDA to protect infants and children from toxic metals in food. The Budget also invests in enhanced inspections of food manufacturing facilities, including infant formula facilities, and requires enhanced testing and reporting for Cronobacter contamination. The Budget also requires more environmental monitoring with reporting to FDA. In addition, the Budget invests in food supply chain continuity and FDA's smarter food safety initiative to strengthen data access and analysis capabilities to better target inspections. Advances Child and Family Well-Being in the Child Welfare System. The Budget pro- poses to expand and incentivize the use of evidence-based foster care prevention services to keep families safely together and reduce the number of children entering foster care. The Budget provides States with support and incentives to place more foster children with rela - tives or other adults who have an existing emotional bond with the children and fewer children in group homes and institutions, while also providing additional funding to support youth who age out of care without a permanent caregiver. The Budget proposes to nearly double flexible funding for States through the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program, and proposes new provisions to expand access to legal representation for children and families in the child welfare system. The Budget provides $50 million in competitive grants for States and locali - ties to advance reforms that would reduce the overrepresentation of children and families of color in the child welfare system, address the disparate experiences and outcomes of these families, and provide more families with the support they need to remain safely together. In addition, the Budget provides $215 million for States and community-based organizations to respond to and prevent child abuse. Supports Survivors of Domestic Violence and Other Forms of Gender-Based Violence. The Budget proposes significant increases to support and protect survivors of gender-based violence, including $519 million for the Family Violence Prevention and Services (FVPSA) program and the National Domestic Violence Hotline to support domestic violence survivors\u2014 double the 2023 enacted level. This amount continues funding availability for FVPSA-funded resource centers, including those that support the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex community. The Budget would provide additional funding for domestic violence hotlines and cash assistance for survivors of domestic violence, as well as funding to support a demonstration project evaluating services for survivors at the intersection of housing insta - bility, substance use coercion, and child welfare. In addition, the Budget would provide over $66 million for victims of human trafficking and survivors of torture, an increase of nearly $17 million from the 2023 enacted level. Supports America's Promise to Refugees. The Budget provides $7.3 billion to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to help rebuild the Nation's refugee resettlement infrastructure BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 81 and support the resettling of up to 125,000 refugees in 2024. The Budget also helps ensure that unaccompanied immigrant children receive appropriate support and services while they are in ORR's care and are unified with relatives and sponsors as safely and quickly as possible. This funding would allow ORR to reinforce and expand on the programmatic improvements the Administration has made, including expanding access to counsel to help children navigate complex immigration court proceedings and enhancing case management and post-release services. In addition, the Budget includes an emergency contingency fund that would provide additional resources, beyond the $7.3 billion, when there are unanticipated increases in the number of unaccompanied children or other humanitarian entrants, building on the contin- gency fund enacted for 2023. Reduces Home Energy and Water Costs. The Budget provides $4.1 billion, a $111 million increase from the 2023 enacted level (excluding emergency appropriations), for the Low Income Home energy Assistance Program (LIH eAP). LIH eAP helps families access home energy and weatherization assistance, vital tools for protecting vulnerable families' health in response to extreme weather and climate change. As part of the Justice40 pilot, HHS plans to increase ef - forts to prevent energy shutoffs and increase support for households with young children and older people and high energy burdens. Since the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP) expires at the end of 2023, the Budget proposes to expand LIH eAP to advance the goals of both LIH eAP and LIHWAP. Specifically, the Budget increases LIH eAP funding and gives States the option to use a portion of their LIH eAP funds to provide water bill assistance to low-income households.83DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for: protecting the United States from threats and hazards, modernizing effective programs to prevent terrorism; countering domestic violent extremism; securing the Nation's borders; enforcing U.S. immigration laws; protecting the President and other key officials; defending and securing Federal cyberspace and critical infrastructure; and ensuring disaster resilience, response, and recovery. The President's 2024 Budget invests in climate resilience, Federal cybersecurity, maritime security, and secure and humane border management. The Budget requests $60.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $0.6 billion or one-percent decrease from the 2023 enacted level. This includes $1.6 billion in additional Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Passenger Security Fee offsetting collections gained from ending mandatory contributions to deficit reduction. When controlling for the Passenger Security Fee proposal, the DHS request is an increase of two-percent above the 2023 enacted level. The Budget also includes a proposed $4.7 billion Southwest Border Contingency Fund to respond to migration surges, which if fully accessed, would yield an increase for the total DHS request of nine-percent above the 2023 enacted level. Resources provided through the Budget build on prior-year investments in cybersecurity, border security, and hazard mitigation. The President's 2024 Budget: Supports a Fair, Orderly, and Humane Immigration System. The Administration is committed to improving the Nation's immigration system and safeguarding its integrity and promise by efficiently and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration benefits. The Budget includes $865 million for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to process an increasing asylum caseload, reduce the historically high immigration benefit request back - log, support the Citizenship and Integration Grant Program, and improve refugee processing to advance the Administration's goal of admitting 125,000 refugees. Enhances Border Security and Immigration Enforcement. Strengthening border security and providing safe, lawful pathways for migration remain top priorities for the Administration. The Budget includes almost $25 billion for United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs enforcement (IC e), an increase of almost $800 million over the 2023 enacted level when controlling for border management amounts. The Budget includes funds for CBP to hire an additional 350 Border Patrol Agents, $535 million for border security technology at and between ports of entry, $40 million to com - bat fentanyl trafficking and disrupt transnational criminal organizations, and funds to hire an additional 460 processing assistants at CBP and IC e.84 DePARTM eNT OF HOMeLAND SeCURITY Addresses the Situation at the Southwest Border. Given elevated Southwest border encounter levels experienced in a number of years since 2019, and uncertainty surrounding border encounter levels in any given fiscal year, the Budget proposes a new $4.7 billion contin- gency fund to aid the Department and its components when responding to migration surges along the Southwest border. Modeled on a contingency fund provided for unaccompanied chil - dren, each fiscal year, the fund would receive appropriations incrementally, and above the base appropriation, as Southwest border encounters reach pre-identified levels. DHS would be limited to obligating funds for surge-related functions and would transfer funds to CBP, ICe, and Federal emergency Management Agency (F eMA) accounts with valid surge-related obligations. Invests in Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Protection. To make U.S. cy - berspace more resilient and defensible, the Budget provides an additional $145 million for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), for a total of $3.1 billion. This includes $98 million to implement the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act and $425 million to improve CISA's internal cybersecurity and analytical capabilities.

The Budget helps State and local communities, Tribes, and Territories build climate resilience through various F eMA grant programs. The Budget also includes more than $500 million for flood hazard mapping, including the development of new data to support future flood conditions. In addition, the Budget includes $236 million to support the Administration's 2022 National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Health Security across a broad range of activi - ties associated with response, critical infrastructure, and domestic surveillance. Modernizes TSA Pay and Workforce Policies. The TSA workforce deserves to be fairly compensated at rates comparable with their peers in the Federal workforce. The Budget in - cludes $1.1 billion above the 2023 enacted level to fully fund the TSA pay equity initiative. enhancements to TSA pay support the President's commitment to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Federal workforce. Invests in Sustainability and Conservation. The Administration remains committed to reestablishing the Federal Government as a leader in sustainability. The Budget includes $123 million for DHS, the third largest department in the Federal Government and the Nation's largest law enforcement agency, to support market-shaping investments into Zero- emission Vehicles. The Budget also provides $264 million for DHS to consolidate its physical footprint across the National Capital Region. This funding builds upon the $500 million investment provided by the Inflation Reduction Act for sustainability and environmental programs. Enhances America's Presence in the Arctic Region. establishing American presence in the Arctic is a critical security priority. The Adversaries of the United States are increasing their presence in the Arctic and may seek to disrupt established norms for their own benefit. The Budget repeats the request from the 2023 Budget to buy a commercially available ice - breaker to enhance the Nation's presence in the Arctic and ensure U.S. national sovereignty is respected in the region. This capability would also ensure that the United States has greater access to support vulnerable communities in a region that is facing significant impacts from climate change.BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 85 Supports 2024 Presidential Campaign Security.

The HCV program currently provides 2.3 million low-income families with rent-al assistance to obtain housing in the private market. The Budget provides $32.7 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion (including emergency funding) over the 2023 enacted level, to maintain services for all currently assisted families and to expand assistance to an addi - tional 50,000 households, particularly those who are experiencing homelessness or fleeing, or attempting to flee, domestic violence or other forms of gender-based violence. The Budget further expands assistance to another 130,000 households with funding from HCV program reserves. To further ensure that more households have access to safe and affordable hous - ing, the Budget includes mandatory funding to support two populations that are particularly vulnerable to homelessness\u2014youth aging out of foster care and extremely low-income ( eLI) veterans. The Budget provides $9 billion to establish a housing voucher program for all 20,000 youth aging out of foster care annually, and provides $13 billion to incrementally expand rental assistance for 450,000 eLI veteran families, paving a path to guaranteed as - sistance for all who have served the Nation and are in need. In all, the Budget proposes to expand assistance to well over 200,000 additional households. Increases Affordable Housing Supply to Reduce Costs. To address the critical shortage of affordable housing in communities throughout the Nation, the Budget provides $1.8 billion for the HOM e Investment Partnerships Program (HOM e), an increase of $300 million over the 2023 enacted level, to construct and rehabilitate affordable rental housing and provide homeownership opportunities. In addition, the Budget provides $258 million to support 2,200 units of new permanently affordable housing specifically for the elderly and persons with disabilities, supporting the Administration's priority to maximize independent living for people with disabilities. To complement these investments, the Budget provides a total The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for creating healthy, safe, sustainable, and inclusive communities and affordable homes for all. The President's 2024 Budget for HUD: expands rental assistance to low-income households and increases affordable housing supply to reduce housing costs; expands homeownership opportunities for underserved borrowers; advances efforts to end homelessness; prevents and redresses housing-related discrimination; modernizes affordable housing by increasing climate resilience and energy efficiency; and strengthens communities facing underinvestment. The Budget requests $73.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $1.1 billion increase or 1.6-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level. The President's 2024 Budget: 88 DePARTM eNT OF HOUSING AND URB AN DeVeLOPM eNT of $51 billion in additional Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, a new Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit, and mandatory funding for new project-based rental assistance contracts to increase the development of affordable rental and owner-occupied housing, including units affordable to extremely low-income families. By expanding the supply of housing, the Budget would help curb cost growth across the broader rental market. Reduces Costs for New Homeowners and Expands Access to Homeownership. To make homeownership more affordable for underserved borrowers, including first-time, low- to moderate-income, and minority homebuyers, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is re-ducing the annual mortgage insurance premiums new borrowers will pay by about one-third. This action, effective in 2023, will save the average FHA borrower approximately $800 in the first year of their mortgage loan and provide continued savings for the duration of the loan. The Budget also includes $100 million for a HOM e down payment assistance pilot to expand homeownership opportunities for first-generation and/or low wealth first-time homebuyers and $15 million to increase the availability of FHA small balance mortgages. In addition, the Budget proposes $10 billion in mandatory funding for a new First-Generation Down Payment Assistance program to help address racial and ethnic homeownership and wealth gaps. Advances Efforts to End Homelessness. To prevent and reduce homelessness, the Budget provides $3.7 billion, an increase of $116 million over the 2023 enacted level, for Homeless Assistance Grants to meet renewal needs and expand assistance to approximately 25,000 additional households, including survivors of domestic violence and homeless youth. These targeted resources would support the Administration's recently released Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness. The Budget also provides $505 million for Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS, serving a population with a disproportionately high rate of homelessness and providing a critical link to services. Prevents Eviction. To assist renters in accessing resources to avoid eviction, make the legal process during eviction proceedings fairer, and mitigate future housing instability, the Budget provides $3 billion in mandatory funding for competitive grants to promote and solidify State and local efforts to reform eviction policies by providing access to legal counsel, emergency rental assistance, and other forms of rent relief. The Budget also includes $10 million for the eviction Protection Grant program, which provides legal assistance to low-income tenants at risk or subject to eviction. Advances Equity by Preventing and Redressing Housing Discrimination. The Budget provides $90 million to support State and local fair housing enforcement organizations and to further education, outreach, and training on rights and responsibilities under Federal fair housing laws. The Budget also invests in HUD staff and technical assistance to affirmatively further fair housing and reduce barriers that restrict housing and neighborhood choice. Improves the Quality of HUD-Assisted Housing. HUD-assisted multifamily properties and Public Housing provide 2.3 million affordable homes to low-income families. The Budget centralizes inspection-related funding for these programs, which would enhance HUD's ability to identify and address financial and physical risks and would complement HUD's modernized National Standards for Physical Inspection of Real estate building standards. The Budget also provides $3.2 billion for Public Housing modernization, and $300 million to improve the energy efficiency, climate resilience, and physical condition of the Public Housing stock. To complement these investments, the Budget provides $7.5 billion in mandatory funding for comprehensive modernization of targeted Public Housing communities.BUDG eT OF TH e U. S.

The Budget also includes $25 million to address lead-based paint in Public Housing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifies the risk for lead exposure as great - est for children from racial and ethnic minority groups and children in families living below the poverty level. The Lead Hazard and Healthy Homes grants, complemented by additional Government-wide lead remediation investments included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, target interventions to these most at-risk communities. In addition, the Budget targets $60 million specifically to prevent and mitigate housing-related health hazards, such as fire safety and mold, in HUD-assisted housing. Supports Economic Development and Removes Barriers to Affordable Housing. The Budget provides $3.4 billion for the Community Development Block Grant program to help communities modernize infrastructure, invest in economic development, create parks and oth - er public amenities, and provide social services. The Budget includes $85 million within this total for a competitive program to reward State, local, and regional jurisdictions that make progress in removing barriers to affordable housing developments, such as restrictive zon - ing, as well as $10 billion in mandatory funding to incentivize the next group of jurisdictions to make similar zoning and land use reforms. States and localities that embrace efforts to increase their supply of housing would ease cost growth for renters and homebuyers in those areas. Invests in Affordable Housing in Tribal Communities. Native Americans are seven times more likely to live in overcrowded conditions and five times more likely to have inad - equate plumbing, kitchen, or heating systems than all U.S. households. The Budget provides over $1 billion to fund tribal efforts to expand affordable housing, improve housing conditions and infrastructure, and increase economic opportunities for low-income families. Of this total, $150 million would prioritize activities that advance resilience and energy efficiency in hous - ing-related projects. The Budget also reflects a reduction in mortgage insurance fees for the Indian Home Loan Guarantee Program, which would save Native American borrowers over $500 on average in their first year and expand access to homeownership.91DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR The Department of the Interior (DOI) conserves and manages the Nation's natural resources and cultural heritage. The President's 2024 Budget for DOI: honors commitments to tribal nations; combats climate change and protects environmental resources by investing in ecosystem restoration, wildfire management, and public land resilience; enhances programs that advance racial and economic justice; supports development in U.S. Territories and freely associated states; and funds reclamation and climate resilience work that ensures healthy lands and waters and creates good-paying jobs. The Budget requests $18.8 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $1.6 billion or 9.3-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level, including amounts requested for Contract Support Costs and Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 Section 105(l) leases, which the Budget proposes to shift from discretionary to mandatory funding. The 2024 Budget complements historic investments in wildfire management, tribal programs, ecosystem restoration, national park operations, western water infrastructure, and abandoned mine land reclamation provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act. The President's 2024 Budget: Invests in Tribal Communities to Honor Trust and Treaty Responsibilities. Building on feedback from extensive tribal consultations, the Budget provides historic increases for a range of key tribal programs. The Budget invests $4.7 billion for DOI's tribal programs, $690 million above the 2023 enacted level, to support public safety and justice, social ser - vices, and educational needs to uphold Federal trust responsibilities and advance equity for Native communities. This includes $717 million in Tribal Public Safety and Justice funding at DOI, an $86 million increase over the 2023 enacted level, to support pressing public safety needs in Indian Country and continue efforts to address the crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons.

To strengthen tribal land management, the Budget includes $12 million for a new Bureau of Indian Affairs program that would support tribal land acqui - sition for conservation and outdoor recreation, and promote tribal sovereignty through tribal co-stewardship. The Budget also proposes to reclassify Contract Support Costs and Indian Self-Determination and education Assistance Act of 1975 Section 105(l) leases as mandatory spending, providing certainty for tribal communities in meeting these ongoing needs through dedicated funding sources. The Budget's investments complement those made through the 92 DePARTM eNT OF TH e I NT e RIOR Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address critical needs in tribal communities for infrastructure and climate adaptation. In recognition of tribal nations' legacy of natural resources stewardship, the Budget supports efforts to advance tribally-led studies of the feasibility of reintroducing salmon populations in the Upper Columbia River. Commits to Tribal Water Rights Settlements Funding. Providing a stable, dedicated funding source for tribal water rights settlements is crucial to ensuring that tribal communi - ties have safe, reliable water supplies to improve public and environmental health and support economic opportunity. To build on investments provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Budget provides $2.8 billion in mandatory funding to the Indian Water Rights Settlement Completion Fund, with $2.5 billion to cover the costs of enacted and future water rights settle - ments and $340 million for operations and maintenance costs associated with enacted water settlements. Strengthens Climate Resilience for Communities and Ecosystems. As steward for 20 percent of the Nation's lands and waters and with a primary responsibility to uphold the Nation's commitments to American Indians and Alaska Natives, DOI plays an integral role in addressing the climate crisis through strengthened conservation partnerships, including the Administration's America the Beautiful Initiative and science-based ecosystem management. The Budget invests $5.7 billion in climate adaptation and resilience, which would mitigate the impacts of climate change\u2014such as drought, wildfire, and severe storms\u2014on America's communities, lands, waters, and wildlife. The Budget also sustains funding for key conserva-tion and ecosystem management initiatives\u2014including youth corps programs\u2014alongside a historic $1.7 billion investment provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for ecosystem restoration across America and more than $5 billion provided by the Inflation Reduction Act to address climate change. Increases Drought Resilience. The Budget helps ensure communities across the West have access to a resilient and reliable water supply by investing in rural water projects, water con - servation, development of desalination technologies, and water recycling and reuse projects. The Budget complements the nearly $1.7 billion provided in 2024 for western water infra - structure through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as well as the nearly $4.6 billion that was provided by the Inflation Reduction Act for drought mitigation and domestic water sup - ply projects through the Bureau of Reclamation. The Budget provides funding to address the ongoing drought in the western United States, including funding for WaterSMART, Central Valley Project drought activities, and implementation funding for the Drought Contingency Plans to conserve water in the Colorado River System, which is at historically low levels. Invests in the Wildland Firefighting Workforce. The Budget ensures that no Federal fire - fighter would make less than $15 an hour and invests in the wildland firefighting workforce at DOI and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) through a new comprehensive and equitable compensation structure. The Budget also increases the size of the wildland firefighting work - force at DOI and USDA and supports additional mental and physical health services for that workforce. Together, these efforts would help address long-standing recruitment and reten - tion challenges. These investments, totaling $139 million over the comparable 2023 enacted level for DOI, would build upon the historic reforms in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and ensure that the workforce receives the enhanced support it needs to continue meeting evolving mission demands, as both the frequency and intensity of catastrophic wildfires are expected to increase due to climate change. BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 93 Mitigates the Risk of Catastrophic Wildfires. The Budget invests $314 million in DOI's Hazardous Fuels Management and Burned Area Rehabilitation programs to help reduce the risk and severity of wildfires and restore lands devastated by catastrophic fire. This funding complements the $878 million for hazardous fuels management and $325 million for burned area rehabilitation projects provided through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Budget also invests $7 million in a new integrated drought and fire science effort at the U.S. Geological Survey, which would help mitigate wildfire risk across the Nation. Increases Access to Nature and Parks. An estimated 100 million Americans do not have an accessible park within a 10-minute walk of their home. Communities of color and low-income communities have disproportionately less access to Nature's benefits, such as clean water, clean air, and open spaces for recreation. The Budget allocates $135 million to the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Program to develop high-quality recreation opportunities in eco - nomically disadvantaged urban communities. The Budget also provides $3.8 billion for the National Park Service, $289 million over the 2023 enacted level. In addition, the Budget includes a new $32 million initiative to build a more equitable National Park System, includ - ing investments to: expand tribal co-stewardship of national parks; address transportation barriers between parks and underserved communities; improve park accessibility for visi - tors and employees with disabilities; and stand up the recently established African American Burial Grounds Preservation Program. The Budget also includes a new $10 million initiative for Increasing Representation in Our Public Lands, which would support recent or potential new designations that preserve important places and tell the stories of those that have been historically underrepresented. Accelerates Clean Energy Development on Public Lands. The Budget includes $181 million, an increase of $70 million from the 2023 enacted level, to accelerate the deploy - ment of clean energy on public lands and waters, spurring economic development and creating thousands of good-paying jobs. Funding would support the leasing, planning, and permitting of solar, wind, and geothermal energy projects, and associated transmission infrastructure that would help mitigate the impacts of climate change and meet the Administration's goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 25 gigawatts of clean energy capacity on public lands by 2025. Creates Jobs Remediating and Reclaiming Abandoned Wells and Mines. The Budget provides $311 million to remediate orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaim abandoned mine lands on Federal and non-Federal lands. The funding complements the $16 billion provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for orphaned well remediation and abandoned coal mine reclamation, and would create good union jobs and restore degraded lands and waters to allow for more productive uses. The Administration is committed to the responsible and sustainable development of America's public resources. Consistent with the need to develop a domestic critical minerals supply chain, the Department led an Interagency Working Group to review hardrock mine permitting and oversight on Federal lands, and will implement its recommen - dations on best practices and actions on public lands to increase transparency and ensure that mining operations adhere to strong social, environmental, and labor standards. Advances Climate Science. The Budget invests $366 million at DOI to better understand the impacts of climate change, identify innovative mitigation and adaptation opportunities, and measure and monitor greenhouse gas emissions and sinks on Federal lands.

The Budget invests $1.5 billion, an increase of $595 million above the 2023 enacted level, in the executive Of fice for Immigration Review to further opti - mize the functioning of immigration courts and help address the backlog of over 1.8 million currently pending cases. This funding supports 150 new immigration judge teams, which in - cludes the support personnel required to create maximum ef ficiencies in the court system. The Budget would also invest new resources in legal access programming, including $150 million in discretionary resources to provide access to representation for adults and families in immigration proceedings. Providing resources to support legal representation in the immi - gration system would help make the system fairer and more equitable, while creating greater efficiencies in case processing. BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 97 Bolsters Antitrust Enforcement. Vigorous marketplace competition through robust en - forcement of antitrust law can help reduce costs and raise wages. The Budget advances this effort by including a historic increase of $100 million over the 2023 enacted level for the DOJ Antitrust Division.99DEPARTMENT OF LABOR The Department of Labor (DOL) is responsible for protecting the health, safety, wages, and economic security of workers and retirees. The President's 2024 Budget for DOL supports: building the skills of America's workers; protecting workers' rights and benefits, health and safety, and wages; strengthening the integrity and accessibility of the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program; and creating good, middle-class jobs that are safe and equitable, provide fair wages and benefits, empower workers, and offer opportunities for advancement. The Budget requests $15.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $1.5 billion or 11-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level. The President's 2024 Budget: Empowers and Protects Workers. Workers power America's economic prosperity, and to ensure workers are treated with dignity and respect in the workplace, the Budget invests $2.3 billion, an increase of $430 million above the 2023 enacted level, in the Department's worker protection agencies. The Budget would enable DOL to protect workers' wages and benefits, combat exploitative child labor, address the misclassification of workers as inde - pendent contractors, and improve workplace health and safety. The Budget also provides resources to support vigorous enforcement of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, espe - cially where employers have retaliated against or otherwise penalized employees for taking federally protected leave from work. The Budget also ensures fair treatment for millions of workers by providing resources to oversee and enforce the equal employment obligations of Federal contractors, including protections against discrimination based on race, sex, disabil - ity, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Expands Penalties when Employers Violate Workers' Rights to Organize, Receive Fair Wages, and Have a Safe and Healthy Workplace Free from Discrimination. employers often receive only a slap on the wrist\u2014at most\u2014when they fire or retaliate against workers for exercising their right to organize and collectively bargain, steal wages from workers, force workers to work in unsafe conditions, exploit children, or otherwise fla - grantly violate the Nation's labor laws. To deter employers from violating workers' rights, ensure those who do violate their rights are held accountable, and level the playing field for responsible employers, the Budget also proposes instituting and meaningfully increasing penalties at DOL, the equal employment Opportunity Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board for employers that violate workplace safety, health, wage and hour, child labor, equal opportunity, and labor organizing rules. Calls for Paid Sick Leave for All Workers. Millions of workers in America have to choose between a needed paycheck\u2014or even a job\u2014and taking care of a family member or 100 DePARTM eNT OF LABOR themselves when they are sick. Workers without paid sick days are more likely to go to work when sick, send their child to school when sick, and do without the healthcare they need to get better. Paid sick days are not only good for workers and families\u2014they are also good for busi - ness, leading to lower employee turnover and increased productivity, and reducing the spread of contagious diseases. The President calls on the Congress to require employers to provide seven job-protected paid sick days each year to all workers, and ensure that employers cannot penalize workers for taking time off to address their health needs, or the health needs of their families, or to seek safety from domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Expands Access to Paid Family and Medical Leave. The vast majority of America's work- ers do not have access to paid family leave, including three out of four private sector workers. Among the lowest-paid workers, who are predominately women and workers of color, 92 percent have no access to paid family leave through their employers. As many as one in five retirees leave the workforce earlier than planned to care for an ill family member, which negatively impacts families as well as the Nation's labor supply and productivity. The Budget proposes to establish a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program administered by the Social Security Administration to ensure that all workers can take the time they need to: bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own serious ill - ness; address circumstances arising from a loved one's military deployment; find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or grieve the death of a loved one. The Budget also includes $10 million for DOL's Women's Bureau to help States expand access to paid leave benefits, including through grants to support States in implementing new paid leave programs and through the creation of a Technical Assistance Hub to share best practices among States. Expands Workforce Training that Provides Pathways to Good Jobs. The President's historic legislative accomplishments are rebuilding U.S. infrastructure, supporting clean en - ergy, and boosting American manufacturing while creating millions of high-quality jobs. The Budget invests in effective, evidence-based training models that would ensure all workers, particularly women, workers of color, those living in rural areas, workers with disabilities, and others underrepresented in growing fields, have the skills they need to compete for and fill these and other jobs. The Budget provides $200 million for a new Sectoral employment through Career Training for Occupational Readiness (S eCTOR) program, which would support the development and expansion of public-private partnerships among employers, education and training providers, and community-based groups to equitably deliver high-quality training focused on growing industries. S eCTOR's approach is based on decades of research showing that when employers take a leading role in the design and implementation of training, work - ers\u2014especially underserved workers\u2014gain access to high-quality programs that lead directly to good, in-demand jobs. Expands Access to Registered Apprenticeships. The Budget increases support for Registered Apprenticeship, an evidence-based earn-and-learn model that is a critical tool for training future workforces in the construction, clean energy, semiconductor, transportation and logistics, education, and other growing and in-demand industries. The Budget invests $335 million, a $50 million increase above the 2023 enacted level, to expand Registered Apprenticeship opportunities in these high-growth fields while increasing the number of workers from historically underrepresented groups, including people of color and women, who participate in Registered Apprenticeships. Supports Community Colleges in Providing High-Quality Training. The Budget recognizes the critical role that community colleges play in providing accessible, affordable, and high-quality training. The Budget invests $100 million, a $35 million increase above the BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 101 2023 enacted level, to build community colleges' capacity to work with the public workforce development system and employers to design and deliver high-quality training programs in communities across the Nation. Expands Employment Protections for Military Spouses. Military families make signifi - cant sacrifices on behalf of the Nation, including overcoming the many challenges that spouses of active-duty service and reserve members experience in finding and retaining good jobs. A Department of Defense survey found that 33 percent of military families had experienced a permanent change in location within the last 12 months. Spouses of military servicemembers often face discrimination from current and prospective employers due to the frequent and un-predictable nature of deployment and relocations. The Budget addresses these challenges by expanding anti-discrimination and reemployment protections to spouses of all active duty and reserve members, which would allow them to more easily find and keep good jobs. Modernizes, Protects, and Strengthens UI. The UI program provides a critical safety net for workers who have lost a job through no fault of their own and helps protect the econ - omy as a whole from further damage during downturns. UI was critical in helping millions of Americans through unexpected job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the pandemic also exposed vulnerabilities in the program. The Budget invests $3.7 billion, an increase of $522 million above the 2023 enacted level, to modernize, protect, and strengthen the UI program. This includes investments aimed at tackling fraud, including funding to support more robust identity verification for UI applicants, help States develop and test fraud-prevention tools and strategies, and allow the DOL Office of Inspector General to increase its investigations into fraud rings targeting the UI program. In addition, the Budget proposes a comprehensive legislative package of program integrity proposals designed to provide States with new tools and resources to combat UI fraud and improper payments while ensuring eq - uity and accessibility for all claimants. The Budget also includes principles to guide future efforts to reform the UI system, including improving benefit levels and access, scaling UI ben - efits automatically during recessions, expanding eligibility to reflect the modern labor force, improving State and Federal solvency through more equitable and progressive financing, ex - panding reemployment services, and further safeguarding the program from fraud. Supports Legacy Energy Communities. To address changes in the energy economy, the Budget continues to invest in strategic planning, partnership development, and training and reemployment activities for displaced workers. The Budget provides $20 million to support DOL's role in the multi-agency Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and economic Revitalization (also known as POW eR+) Initiative, which aims to assist displaced workers and transform local economies and communities transitioning away from fossil fuel production to new, sustainable industries. The Budget also includes $67 million for Workforce Opportunities for Rural Communities. This program\u2014administered in partnership with the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional Authority, and the Northern Border Regional Commission\u2014aims to help Appalachian, Delta, and Northern Border communities develop lo - cal and regional workforce development strategies that promote long-term economic stability and opportunities for workers, especially those connected to the energy industry. In addition, the Budget provides $20 million for DOL to partner with AmeriCorps and other agencies to establish a Civilian Climate Corps program to help communities address the climate crisis by creating service opportunities and job training programs in emerging industries. Strengthens Mental Health Parity Protections. The Budget requires all health plans to cover mental health and substance use disorder benefits, ensures that plans have an adequate network of behavioral health providers, and improves DOL's ability to enforce the law. In 102 DePARTM eNT OF LABOR addition, the Budget includes $275 million over 10 years to increase the Department's capac - ity to ensure that large group market health plans and issuers comply with mental health and substance use disorder requirements, and expand the Agency's capacity to take action against plans and issuers that do not comply.103DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS The Department of State (State), U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other international programs advance a free, secure, and prosperous world by working with allies and partners to solve shared global challenges. The President's 2024 Budget demonstrates this shared commitment through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) to catalyze public and private finance. The President's 2024 Budget requests $70.5 billion in discretionary funding for State, USAID, and other international programs, which is $7 billion or 11 percent above the 2023 enacted level when including $2.1 billion in base funding that was shifted to emergency in 2023, and $9 billion or 15 percent above the 2023 enacted level when excluding those amounts. Within this total, the Budget includes $63.1 billion for State and USAID, $5 billion or 9 percent above the 2023 enacted level when including the shifted funding and $7 billion or 13 percent above the 2023 enacted level when excluding those amounts. The 2024 total also includes $4 billion for international programs at the Department of the Treasury, $1.7 billion or 71 percent above the 2023 enacted level. The President's 2024 Budget: Out-Competes China and Asserts U.S. Global Leadership. During these unprec - edented and extraordinary times, the Budget requests both discretionary and mandatory resources to Out-Compete China and advance American prosperity globally. The out-com - pete mandatory proposal would strengthen the U.S. role in the Indo-Pacific and advance the U.S. economy by investing: $2 billion to support \"hard\" critical international infrastructure; $2 billion to scale the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation's (DFC) equity program; and $2 billion to bolster Indo-Pacific countries through economic competitiveness and secure and resilient supply chains. As part of this mandatory proposal, the Budget also requests $6.5 billion in economic assistance over the next 20 years for the Compacts of Free Association with the freely associated states of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau. Advances PGII. The Budget supports more than $50 billion through PGII in direct foreign assistance, development and export finance, and private sector funding. PGII leverages pub - lic and private finance to advance climate and energy security, health and health security, digital connectivity, gender equity and equality, and related transportation infrastructure\u2014all while creating opportunities for American businesses. Increases Global Energy Security, Infrastructure, and Resilience. The Budget supports the President's pledge to: work with the Congress to more than quadruple U.S. in - ternational climate financing; and request more than $3 billion for the President's Emergency 104 DePARTM eNT OF STATe AND OTH e R I NT e RNATIONAL P ROGRAMS Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE). This includes a $1.6 billion contribution to the Green Climate Fund and a $1.2 billion loan to the Clean Technology Fund. The Budget also advances new tools, such as loan guarantees, to reassert U.S. global leadership in the Indo-Pacific by financing energy security and infrastructure projects and reducing reliance on volatile energy supplies and prices. The Budget also builds resilience to better prepare for and respond to extreme weather events and other disasters. Bolsters American Leadership in Global Health. To reinforce U.S. leadership in ad - dressing global health and health security challenges, the Budget includes $10.9 billion, a $370 million increase above the 2023 enacted level. This includes over $1.2 billion to prepare for, prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks\u2014including by expanding U.S. bilateral partnerships with countries to improve health security capacity. This over $1.2 billion also includes $500 million for the Pandemic Fund to catalyze and accelerate improvements to global health security and pandemic preparedness. The Budget also invests dedicated funds for the Administration's Global Health Worker Initiative to enhance global efforts to better train, equip, and protect the health workforce\u2014which would strengthen countries' abilities to provide core health services and respond to crises. The Budget also increases investments in high-impact and lifesaving voluntary family planning and reproductive health programs to address significant unmet global needs for these services. The Budget sustains U.S. leader - ship in the Global Fund's historic seventh replenishment, providing $2 billion for the second year of a $6 billion, three-year pledge to save lives and accelerate the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Deepens Alliances and Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific.

In addition, the Budget expands funding for U.S. diplomatic presence throughout the region, with particular focus on the Pacific Islands. The Budget also includes an additional $2 billion in mandatory funding to make game-changing investments to Out-Compete China and deepen America's partnerships in the region\u2014work - ing to make Indo-Pacific economies more resilient and connected. The Budget also proposes $6.5 billion in economic assistance over the next 20 years for the Compacts of Free Association with the freely associated states of the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau. Makes Transformative Investments in High-Quality International Infrastructure. Targeted global infrastructure connects workers to good jobs, allows businesses to grow and thrive, and supports global connection among nations. Unfortunately, infrastructure has long been underfunded internationally, with more than $40 trillion in estimated need in low- and middle-income countries through 2035. As part of a broader effort to Out-Compete China, the Budget requests $2 billion in mandatory funding over five years to support investments in \"hard\" critical international infrastructure, combat predatory People's Republic of China (PRC)-financed infrastructure projects, and spur U.S. economic growth. The Budget also includes a $2 billion mandatory proposal to bolster the DFC's equity program at scale as a key financing tool necessary to strengthen the U.S. role in the Indo-Pacific. The new DFC mandatory resources would be structured as a revolving fund on a cash basis to allow DFC to recycle any realized re - turns from its initial investments without further appropriation. The Budget also provides more than $1 billion in discretionary funds for the Millennium Challenge Corporation to build critical infrastructure, reduce poverty, and incentivize democratic governance.BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 105 Strengthens International Digital Connectivity. The Budget requests more than $395 million to advance global cyber and digital development initiatives, including State's Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy, USAID's Digital Strategy, PGII digital connectivity efforts, and regional initiatives such as Digital Transformation with Africa. Across this work, the Budget: bolsters U.S. and allied technology leadership; advances inclusive and responsible technology development, which also supports the ability of women, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex community, and other marginalized groups to safely access digital technologies; strengthens supply chain security; and enhances cooperation on privacy, data sharing, and digital trade. The Budget would support working with a broad range of part - ners to ensure an open, trusted, interoperable, reliable, and secure digital backbone and other advanced communication technologies in low- and middle-income countries. Advances Gender Equity and Equality Around the World. The Administration remains steadfast in its commitment to invest in opportunities for women and girls and support the needs of marginalized communities, including the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex community. Reflective of that commitment, the Budget requests more than $3 billion to advance gender equity and equality across a broad range of sectors. Reinforces Collective Action to Address Global Challenges. The Budget supports con-tinued U.S. multilateral engagement on shared global challenges at the United Nations (UN) and other international organizations. The Budget fully meets U.S. annual contributions to international organizations and pays UN peacekeeping dues on time and in full. The Budget also proposes increases for key opportunities to advance U.S. interests and compete with ad - versaries, including by: strengthening collective security through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; bolstering U.S. leadership at the UN by beginning to synchronize $40 million in annual contributions; providing $150 million to support a U.S. return to the UN educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; and contributing $57 million to support the UN Population Fund. The Budget also requests nearly $2.3 billion for contributions to multilat - eral development banks, maintaining the United States' role as the largest World Bank donor to support poverty reduction and development in low- and middle-income countries. This in - cludes a $1.4 billion investment in the International Development Association (IDA) as part of the United States' pledge of $3.5 billion in support of the most recent IDA replenishment. The Budget also proposes the largest request for the Peace Corps in history in order to sustain operations and partner with host countries to address global challenges and spur U.S. develop - ment leadership. Builds Security and Prosperity in Central America and Haiti. The Budget requests more than $1 billion to advance the President's commitment to work with the Congress to provide $4 billion over four years to address the root causes of migration and improve the lives of people in Central America. This assistance would bolster localization efforts, enhance the rule of law, and support economic growth for all segments of society. In addition, in response to deteriorating conditions and widespread violence in Haiti, the Budget invests $291 million to strengthen Haiti's recovery from political, health, and economic shocks, by strengthening the capacity of the Haitian National Police, combating corruption, strengthening the capacity of civil society, responding to health emergencies and health needs, and supporting services for marginalized populations. Bolsters Hemispheric Economic Investment and Migration Management Efforts. In support of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, the Budget invests $430 million for hemispheric migration management. This assistance would bolster stability for affected communities, enhance legal pathways and protection in the region, and strengthen 106 DePARTM eNT OF STATe AND OTH e R I NT e RNATIONAL P ROGRAMS humane border management throughout the region. The Budget proposes a new regional economic opportunity fund, the Americas Partnership Opportunity Fund, to address migra - tion management challenges faced by high and upper-middle income countries in the region.

The Budget supports enduring Welcome ( eW), the whole-of-Gov - ernment effort to expeditiously process the applications of Afghan allies, such as Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) candidates, and family reunification cases, and welcome them to the United States\u2014while simultaneously safeguarding national security. The Budget fully supports implementation of eW by leveraging State balances estimated to enable more than $2 billion in support in 2024, and by proposing a substantial increase to the number of SIVs available for Afghan allies. Sharpens America's Tools of Statecraft. State and USAID are at the forefront of the response to today's global challenges. The resources requested in the Budget would enable expertise and innovation, while supporting reforms, the establishment of new missions, and deployment of U.S. diplomats and development experts when and where they are needed in the field. The Budget requests more than $8.2 billion to recruit, retain, and develop a diverse and high-caliber national security workforce and modernize U.S. diplomatic and development systems, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. The Budget also expands upon the Administration's significant investments to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility across its peo - ple, policies, processes, programs, and partnerships.109DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATIONUNITEDSTATESOFAMERICA DEPARTMENTOFTRANSPORTATION The Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for ensuring that the United States has a safe, equitable, reliable, and modern transportation system. The President's 2024 Budget for DOT continues to complement and support the President's historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which would strengthen the Nation's transportation system by: tackling large infrastructure projects; improving roadway and pedestrian safety; providing more resilient and sustainable transportation options; expanding the Nation's capacity to move goods quickly; and helping communities address critical transportation challenges. The Budget requests $27.8 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $1.8 billion or 6.7-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level (excluding $2.6 billion in one-time congressionally-directed spending items). The Budget also includes $80.3 billion in contract authority and obligation limitations, and $36.8 billion in emergency-designated advance budget authority, for transportation infrastructure investments in 2024. The President's 2024 Budget: Continues Implementation of the President's Historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Budget provides a total of $76.1 billion for highway, highway safety, and tran - sit formula programs, supporting the amounts authorized for year three of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This includes $60.1 billion for the Federal-Aid Highway program, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to the 2023 enacted level, to continue repairing and upgrad-ing the Nation's highways and bridges, which builds upon the 3,700 bridges and 69,000 miles of roadway improvement projects initiated in 2022. This funding would also support build - ing out a national network of electric vehicle chargers, consistent with the approved plans of 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to achieve the President's climate and Made in America goals. The Budget also includes $14 billion for Transit Formula Grants, a $356 million increase above the 2023 enacted level, to support core capital and planning pro - grams for transit agencies across the Nation, as well as transit research, technical assistance, and data collection. Ensures a Safe and Efficient Passenger and Freight Rail Network. The Budget expands on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's already significant investments toward im - proving the safety and efficiency of the Nation's rail network. When combined, this includes $1.5 billion for the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements program, the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) most flexible, and oversubscribed, competitive grant program, as well as $850 million to fund projects that improve safety at critical railway crossings. The Budget continues the Administration's robust investment in safe and efficient intercity passenger rail through a combined $7.5 billion in grants to Amtrak. In addition, the Safety & Operations account funds critical safety programs, such as the Confidential Close 110 DePARTM eNT OF T RANSPORTATION Call Reporting System, which allows railroads and their employees to report unsafe events and conditions without fear of negative consequences from the FRA or reprisal from their employers. Advances Long-Stalled Significant Transportation Projects. The Administration is committed to advancing the Nation's most urgent and complex transportation infrastructure projects. To compliment the significant resources in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Budget provides $1.2 billion for the National Infrastructure Project Assistance program (also known as the Mega grant program), $560 million for Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Grants, and $2.9 billion for transit Capital Investment Grants. These funds would support transformational projects to increase safety, improve mobility for commuters and freight traffic, address climate change, and spur shared economic growth. This includes the President's commitment to provide significant Federal support for the Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project in the New York City region, which is an essential element of the Northeast Corridor, the busiest and most complex rail corridor in the Nation. Supports the Nation's Transit Systems. The Nation's transit systems play a critical role in ensuring riders can access jobs, school, healthcare, and opportunity, along with spurring sustainable economic development, reducing highway congestion, and lowering climate emis- sions. However, transit systems face an uncertain future as ridership and fare revenue have not fully rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic, given significant shifts in work and com - muting patterns. To ensure transit continues to be a vital and viable transportation option, the Budget includes language to temporarily allow larger transit systems to use existing for - mula funds for operating expenses. The Budget also encourages States to support their transit systems by transferring available Federal-Aid Highway funding for transit operating needs. Addresses the Roadway and Pedestrian Safety Crisis. Despite improvements in ve - hicle safety technologies, 42,915 people died on America's roads in 2021, the highest total in over a decade. The Budget provides over $1.3 billion for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), an increase of $116 million above the 2023 enacted level, which would allow NHTSA to conduct critical research to reduce roadway fatalities and injuries on the Nation's highways. These efforts include: better understanding of the crash impacts on pedestrians by vehicles of different sizes and weight; accelerating the development of a side impact female dummy to address gender equity in crash testing; and researching accessibility and inclusiveness in vehicle design. The Budget also builds on the essential work the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is conducting with its Large Truck Crash Causal Factors Study by providing resources to begin a complementary Medium-Duty Truck Crash Causal Factors Study. The Budget also provides $60 million for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-created Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program, an increase of $15 million from the 2023 enacted level, to build safe walking and bicycling facilities that connect people with public transportation, businesses, workplaces, schools, and other communities, all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Tackles 21st Century Aviation Challenges. The Budget provides $16.5 billion in discre- tionary budget authority for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This funding would continue the hiring and training surge of air traffic controllers started in 2023 to rebuild the pipeline of new controllers needed to meet projected traffic demands. The Budget increases investment in the facilities and systems that comprise the National Airspace System (NAS) by over $500 million to $3.5 billion, to address maintenance and modernization and to ensure the NAS continues to safely accommodate the growth in traditional commercial aviation traf - fic alongside new entrants from the commercial space, unmanned aircraft, and advanced air BUDG eT OF TH e U. S. GOV eRNM eNT FOR FISCAL Y eAR 2024 111 mobility industries. The Budget also includes continued investment in FAA's multiyear effort of reforming aircraft certification, as well as increasing its safety oversight capabilities. The resources provided through the Budget complement the $5 billion already provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 2024 to upgrade the FAA's air traffic control facilities and to improve the safety, capacity, accessibility, and efficiency of the Nation's airports. The Budget also requests a $3 million increase to bolster aviation consumer protection activities by DOT. This includes hiring eight additional staff, building on an increase of eight staff starting in 2023, and information technology system enhancements to reduce the backlog of aviation con - sumer complaints, expedite rulemaking, and increase outreach and enforcement. The FAA's current authorization\u2014FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, Public Law 115-254\u2014expires on September 30, 2023. The FAA's next authorization will need to: improve safety; enable ac - cess to the system by current and emerging users; make long-term investments to improve the safety and efficiency of the NAS, reduce emissions, deliver on climate action, and enhance resiliency; expand consumer protection; and improve the standards of service and access for air travelers and other stakeholders. Moves Goods More Quickly through the Nation's Ports and Waterways. The Budget continues support for modernizing America's port and waterway infrastructure initiated under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Budget includes $230 million for the Port Infrastructure Development Program to strengthen maritime freight capacity on top of the $450 million in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 2024. In addition to keeping the Nation's supply chain moving by improving efficiency, DOT would prioritize projects that also lower emissions\u2014re - ducing environmental impact in and around the Nation's ports. Invests in Merchant Mariner Training. The Budget provides $196 million for the United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) to support an exemplary standard of excellence in education and training opportunities for the next generation of diverse seagoing officers and maritime leaders to serve the Nation. Within this amount is more than $2 million for sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response activities, newly created subject mat - ter expert Advisory Council positions, and expanded measures to support survivors of sexual assault. Also within this amount, the Budget proposes $92 million in priority maintenance and improvement projects at the USMMA campus.113DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is responsible for maintaining a strong economy, promoting economic conditions that enable growth and stability, protecting the integrity of the financial system, combating global financial crime and corruption, and managing the U.S. Government's finances and resources effectively. The President's 2024 Budget for Treasury: supports a fair and robust tax system that ensures compliance by the wealthy and large corporations; improves taxpayer experience and service; expands resources for community development, job-creating investments, and access to credit in disadvantaged communities; and rebuilds institutional capacity to advance equity across all Treasury programs. The Budget requests $16.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $2.1 billion or 15-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level. The President's 2024 Budget: Improves Taxpayer Experience and Supports a Fair and Equitable Tax System. The Inflation Reduction Act addressed long-standing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) funding deficiencies by providing $79.4 billion in stable, long-term funding through 2031 to improve tax compliance by finally cracking down on high-income individuals and corporations who too often avoid paying their lawfully owed taxes and improving service for the millions of Americans that do pay their taxes. The funding will allow the IRS to modernize information technology infrastructure, administer new energy tax credits, and rebuild the administrative capacity of the Agency. To realize these goals and support timely and robust implementa-tion of the important tax provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, annual discretionary appropriations are necessary to maintain current services and allow the IRS to utilize the long-term funding for transformative modernization. To ensure that taxpayers receive the highest quality customer service and that all Americans are treated fairly by the U.S. tax system, the Budget provides a total of $14.1 billion for the IRS, $1.8 billion, or 15 percent, above the 2023 enacted level. This includes an increase of $642 million to improve the tax - payer experience and expand customer service outreach to underserved communities and the entire taxpaying public. The Budget also provides $290 million for IRS Business Systems Modernization, which did not receive annual funding in 2023, to continue and accelerate the development of new digital tools to enable better communication between taxpayers and the IRS. In addition to annual discretionary funding, the Budget proposes to maintain deficit reducing Inflation Reduction Act-funded initiatives in 2032 and beyond. This proposal builds on decades of analysis demonstrating that program integrity investments to enforce exist - ing tax laws increase revenues in a progressive way by closing the tax gap\u2014the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid.114 DePARTM eNT OF TH e T R e ASURY Expands Access to Credit to Underserved Communities. The Budget provides $341 million for the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, an increase of $17 million, or five percent, above the 2023 enacted level, which provides historically un - derserved and often low-income communities access to credit, capital, and financial support to grow businesses, increase affordable housing, and reinforce healthy neighborhood develop - ment. To better address the shortage of long-term affordable credit for development projects in disadvantaged communities and unlock up to $500 million in financing support, the Budget also includes a $10 million subsidy for the CDFI Fund's Bond Guarantee Program. Increases Corporate Transparency and Safeguards the Financial System. Treasury plays a leading role in monitoring and disrupting corruption, money laundering, terrorist financing, and the use of the financial system by malicious actors domestically and abroad, in - cluding as part of the Administration's response to Russian aggression against Ukraine. The Budget provides $244 million to the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, $28 million above the 2023 enacted level, to expand Treasury's capacity to provide financial intelligence and conduct sanctions-related economic analysis while continuing to modernize the sanc- tions process. The Budget also provides $229 million for the Financial Crimes enforcement Network, $39 million above the 2023 enacted level, to support the launch of the Beneficial Ownership Secure System and to invest in the Treasury offices charged with closing financial reporting loopholes that allow illicit actors to evade scrutiny, mask their dealings, and under - mine corporate accountability. Strengthens Enterprise Cybersecurity. The Budget provides $215 million, an increase of $115 million above the 2023 enacted level, to protect and defend sensitive agency systems and information, including those designated as high-value assets. The Budget increases centralized funding to strengthen Treasury's overall cybersecurity efforts and continue the implementation of a Zero Trust Architecture. These investments would protect Treasury sys - tems from future attacks. Restores Critical Agency Capacity. The Budget provides $332 million for Treasury's Departmental Offices, a 21-percent increase over the 2023 enacted level, to restore staffing levels for Treasury's core policy offices to 2016 levels and support Treasury's expanding role in promoting investment security and advancing equitable growth. The increase in funding would also support Treasury's Climate Hub and establish a climate-related technical support center to conduct assessments of climate-related risks across Government programs. The Budget builds institutional capacity to support Treasury-wide coordination of program evalu - ation and expand engagement with historically underrepresented and underserved groups to advance equity across all Treasury programs.115DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for providing military veterans and their survivors with the benefits, care, and support they have earned through sacrifice and service to the Nation.

The President's 2024 Budget for the Corps invests in high return projects, promotes environmental justice, increases climate resilience, and improves the supply chain at the Nation's coastal ports and on the inland waterways. The Budget requests $7.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024. The Budget is complemented by $1 billion for operation and maintenance and $50 million for construction in 2024 from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The President's 2024 Budget: Invests in High Return Projects. The Budget invests in projects and programs within the main mission areas of the Corps, which are commercial navigation, flood and storm damage reduction, and aquatic ecosystem restoration, that provide a high economic or environmental return, increase resilience to climate change, promote environmental justice, or address a significant risk to public safety. For example, the Budget addresses high priority dam safety risks and facilitates safe and efficient navigation on the highest use inland waterways. Improves the Nation's Infrastructure. The Budget: invests in operating and maintain - ing the Corps' existing infrastructure and improving its reliability; and builds on $1 billion provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for 2024 for operating and maintaining Corps' infrastructure. The Budget supports more efficient investment in infrastructure by proposing to transfer ownership from the Corps to parties that are better suited to maintain it, where appropriate. For example, the Budget includes an initial $350 million for replacement of the Cape Cod Canal bridges, toward a commitment of $600 million, and a legislative proposal that would allow the Corps to transfer those funds to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which is better suited to design and construct the replacement bridges. The Budget proposes authorizing the Corps to transfer ownership of these bridges to the Commonwealth, which would be responsible for their future operation and maintenance. Strengthens Supply Chains at Coastal Ports and Inland Waterways. The Budget invests in five projects that facilitate safe, reliable, and environmentally sustainable naviga - tion at the Nation's coastal ports and on the inland waterways. The Budget also includes over $1.7 billion in spending from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to support commerce through U.S. coastal ports and over $1 billion to maintain and improve navigation on the inland waterways.120 CORPS OF eNGIN eeRS\u2014CIVIL WORKS Increases Climate Resilience.

Expands Opportunities for Veterans. In January 2023, SBA began accepting applications for the Veteran Small Business Certification Program to expand small business contracting opportunities for veterans. The Budget provides $20.5 million to continue building on the successful implementation of the program and to ensure that veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses have access to business opportunities across the Federal Government.The Small Business Administration (SBA) is responsible for ensuring that small businesses and entrepreneurs have access to the information and resources they need to start, grow , or recover their business. The President's 2024 Budget for SBA supports historic investments in counseling and training programs, expands access to capital, supports innovation, and promotes access to Government contracting opportunities. The Budget requests $987 million in discretionary budget authority for 2024. The President's 2024 Budget: 131SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION The Social Security Administration (SSA) is responsible for providing essential benefits to retirees, survivors, individuals with disabilities, and older Americans with limited income and resources. The President's 2024 Budget for SSA supports investments in improving service delivery and advancing equity. The Budget also proposes to establish a nationwide paid family and medical leave program that would give workers the time they need to care for themselves or a loved one or to bond with a new child. The Budget requests $15.5 billion in discretionary budget authority for 2024, a $1.4 billion or 10-percent increase from the 2023 enacted level, including allocation adjustment funding. The President's 2024 Budget: Protects the Benefits that Americans Have Earned. The Administration is committed to protecting and strengthening Social Security, and opposes any attempt to cut Social Security benefits. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to strengthen Social Security by ensuring high-income individuals pay their fair share. In addition, the Administration looks forward to improving the Supplemental Security Income program to help low-income older Americans and people with disabilities afford their basic needs. Improves Service Delivery. eac h year, SSA processes more than six million retirement, survivors, and Medicare claims, as well as more than two million disability and Supplemental Security Income claims. The Budget provides an increase of $1.4 billion, 10 percent over the 2023 enacted level, to improve customer service at SSA's field offices, State disability deter - mination services, and teleservice centers for retirees, individuals with disabilities, and their families. The Budget also improves access to SSA's services by adding staff to process more disability claims and reduce wait times. Provides National, Comprehensive Paid Family and Medical Leave. The vast major - ity of America's workers do not have access to paid family leave, including three out of four private sector workers. Among the lowest-paid workers, who are predominantly women and workers of color, 92 percent have no access to paid family leave through their employers. As many as one in five retirees leave the workforce earlier than planned to care for an ill family member, which negatively impacts families as well as the Nation's labor supply and produc-tivity. The Budget proposes to establish a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program administered by SSA. The program would: provide workers with progressive, partial wage replacement to take time off for family and medical reasons; include robust administrative funding; and use an inclusive family definition. The Budget would provide up to 12 weeks of leave to allow eligible workers to take time off to: care for and bond with a new child; care for a seriously ill loved one; heal from their own serious illness; address 132 SOCIAL SeCURITY ADMINISTRATION circumstances arising from a loved one's military deployment; or find safety from domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The Budget would also provide up to three days to grieve the death of a loved one. The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to make this critical investment and strengthen America's economy. Advances Equity and Accessibility. The Administration is committed to making it easier for people to access the services they rely on, including individuals experiencing homelessness, children with disabilities, and people with mental and intellectual disabilities. The Budget makes investments to decrease customer wait times, simplify the Supplemental Security Income application processes, and increase outreach to people who are difficult to reach. SSA will also continue to modernize its information technology systems to make more services available online and improve 800 Number access for those who call.133 Summary TablesBUDG eT OF TH e U. S.

Funding Levels for Appropriated (\"Discretionary\") Programs by Category\u2014Continued (Budget authority in billions of dollars) * Less than $500 million. 1 The 2022 actual and 2023 enacted levels include changes that occur after appropriations are enacted that are part of budget execution such as transfers, reestimates, and the rebasing as mandatory any changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs) enacted in appropriations bills. The 2022 and 2023 levels are adjusted to add back OMB's scoring of CHIMPs enacted in 2022 and 2023 appropriations Acts for a better illustrative comparison with the 2024 request levels. 2 The 2023 enacted levels for base funding include the $12.5 billion primarily for base activities that was designated as emergency funding in Public Law 117-328. 3 The 2024 Budget proposes to shift contract support costs and 105(l) leases within the Indian Health Service (IHS) in HHS and the Bureau of Indian Programs (BIA) in the Department of the Interior to the mandatory side of the Budget starting in 2024. The Budget further proposes to shift all of IHS to mandatory starting in 2025 as well. See the \"Budget Process\" chapter of the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget for more information on these proposals. 4 The 2024 Budget presents funding for anomalous or above-base activities such as emergency requirements, program integrity, disaster relief, wildfire suppression, and 21st Century Cures appropriations outside of base allocations, which is largely consistent with allocation adjustments in the FY 2022 Congressional Budget Resolution (H.Con.Res. 14) and the FY 2023 deeming resolution in the House of Representatives (H.Res. 1151). 5 The section presents base discretionary funding by both defense and non-defense and by security and nonsecurity allocations. The definition of security and nonsecurity is the same as the definition specified in the Budget Control Act of 2011 with security including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, the National Nuclear Security Administration, the International Budget Function (150), and the Intelligence Community Management Account and with all other discretionary programs in the nonsecurity category. This presentation of discretionary excludes the proposed shifts to mandatory. 6 The amounts in the 2024 Budget are based on the National Security and National Defense strategies and the Department of Defense Future Years Defense Program, which includes a five-year appropriations plan and estimated expenditures necessary to support the programs, projects, and activities of the Department of Defense. After 2028, the Budget reflects outyear growth rates consistent with the FY 2023 President's Budget. 7 Section 905(c) of division J of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58; IIJA) specified that amounts provided in division J and certain rescissions in section 90007 of IIJA should be considered as emergency discretionary appropriations.

The 2022 and 2023 levels are adjusted to add back OMB's scoring of CHIMPs enacted in 2022 and 2023 appropriations Acts for a better illustrative comparison with the 2024 request levels. 2 The 2023 enacted levels for base funding include the $12.5 billion primarily for base activities that was designated as emergency funding in Public Law 117-328. 3 Funding for Food for Peace Title II Grants is included in the State and International Programs total. Although the funds are appropriated to the Department of Agriculture, the funds are administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). 4 Funding from the Hospital Insurance and Supplementary Medical Insurance trust funds for administrative expenses incurred by the Social Security Administration that support the Medicare program are included in the Health and Human Services total and not in the Social Security Administration total. 5 The 2024 Budget proposes to shift contract support costs and 105(l) leases within the Indian Health Service (IHS) in HHS and the Bureau of Indian Programs (BIA) in the Department of the Interior to the mandatory side of the Budget starting in 2024. The Budget further proposes to shift all of IHS to mandatory starting in 2025 as well. See the \"Budget Process\" chapter of the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget for more information on these proposals. 6 The State and International Programs total includes funding for the Department of State, USAID, Treasury International, and 11 international agencies while the Treasury total excludes Treasury's International Programs. 7 In addition to discretionary funding, the 2024 Budget includes mandatory funding for veterans medical care, research, and benefits delivery through the Cost of War Toxic exposures Fund, in accordance with the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022. 8 The ePA base total does not include additional resources for the Superfund program from tax revenue in 2023 and 2024 provided through provisions in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act as these amounts are reflected as emergency funding in the allocation adjustment section. Total budget resources for the Superfund program would be approximately $2.9 billion in 2024, compared to the $1.7 billion available in 2023. 9 The limitation enacted and proposed in the Justice Department's Crime Victims Fund program and preclusions in the Children's Health Insurance Program in HHS make up the bulk of these offsets. 10 The 2024 Budget presents funding for anomalous or above-base activities such as emergency requirements, program integrity, disaster relief, wildfire suppression, and 21st Century Cures appropriations outside of base allocations, which is largely consistent with allocation adjustments in the FY 2022 Congressional Budget Resolution (H.Con.Res. 14) and the FY 2023 deeming resolution in the House of Representatives (H.Res. 1151). 11 The definition of security and nonsecurity is the same as the definition specified in the Budget Control Act of 2011 with security including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, the National Nuclear Security Administration, the International Budget Function (150), and the Intelligence Community Management Account and with all other discretionary programs in the nonsecurity category.

An increase in checks outstanding (which is a liability) is also a means of financing a deficit and therefore also has a negative sign. More information on the levels and changes to the operating cash balance is available in Chapter 20, \"Federal Borrowing and Debt\" in the Analytical Perspectives volume of the Budget. 2 Includes checks outstanding, accrued interest payable on Treasury debt, uninvested deposit fund balances, allocations of special drawing rights, and other liability accounts; and, as an offset, cash and monetary assets (other than the Treasury operating cash balance), other asset accounts, and profit on sale of gold. 3 Consists mainly of debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank (which is not subject to limit), the unamortized discount (less premium) on public issues of Treasury notes and bonds (other than zero-coupon bonds), and the unrealized discount on Government account series securities. 4 The statutory debt limit is $31,381 billion, as enacted on December 16, 2021. 5 Treasury securities held by the public and zero-coupon bonds held by Government accounts are almost all measured at sales price plus amortized discount or less amortized premium. Agency debt securities are almost all measured at face value. Treasury securities in the Government account series are otherwise measured at face value less unrealized discount (if any). 6 At the end of 2022, the Federal Reserve Banks held $5,634.9 billion of Federal securities and the rest of the public held $18,617.4 billion. Debt held by the Federal Reserve Banks is not estimated for future years. 7 Treasury's warrants to purchase 79.9 percent of the common stock of the enterprises expire after September 7, 2028. The warrants were valued at $4 billion at the end of 2022. 8 Portions of the notes and warrants issued under the Air carrier worker support program (Payroll support program) are scheduled to expire in 2025, 2026, 2030, and 2031.171The following personnel contributed to the preparation of this publication.
