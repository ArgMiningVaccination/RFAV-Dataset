Dr. Cohn recommends having better inclusion and exclusion criteria which is knowing the likely cause of a patient's pain to help inform the type of treatment needed to cure them, rather than grouping patients' cases under Osteopathic Manipulation and non-Osteopathic Manipulation. Difference of Osteopathic Manipulation from Chiropractic Adjustments Chiropractors are also physicians but are taught to focus on the spine while Osteopaths, being full-fledged physicians, look at biomechanical and peripheral problems while incorporating medicinal or injection therapy.
