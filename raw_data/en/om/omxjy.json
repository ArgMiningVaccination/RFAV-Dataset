Though they are less known than the seven bodily chakras, these powerful energy centers are the links between your Earth-bound personality and your eternal soul, as well as your connection to the vastness of the greater universe. When activated, the higher chakras increase your spiritual awareness, unleash and improve psychic gifts, and give you access to higher beings and your higher self for valuable knowledge and guidance that can keep you on your true soul path. With clear, charged, and expanded higher chakras, you'll experience a profound spiritual awakening that will reverberate to your core and change your life forever. You Are Bigger Than Your Body When I began teaching [energy healing courses](http://www.hayhouse.com/authorbio/deborah-king) years ago, chakras were a hard sell\u2014no one knew what they were! But now, chakras are relatively mainstream due to the popularity of other practices rooted in eastern cultures like yoga and [meditation](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deborah-king/why-do-these-celebs-medit_b_6593894.html), and I'm getting more and more questions about what are now the lesser-known chakras, 8 through 12. Higher chakras can be difficult to explain, as they are more experiential than intellectual, but I have found through my years as an energy healer and spiritual teacher that the first step in beginning to open your higher chakras is simply to be aware of them. The first thing to understand is that you are so much bigger than your body! Your energy field surrounds you, both above and around your physical form, and your higher chakras are lined up above your crown chakra at the top of your head, roughly following the path of your spine down which your seven bodily chakras are located. There are many spiritual chakras above the seventh, and as you rise to those levels, it begins to be a little disorienting to be so far beyond your body. A skilled spiritual teacher can safely carry you into these higher realms. Prepare for Your Soul Awakening For now, you can begin your journey to the higher chakras by activating your eighth chakra, which sits about two feet above your crown [chakra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iAYNn5z4g4). The eighth chakra, sometimes also called the \"soul star,\" is the first of these chakras, and the doorway through which your soul must pass in order to move into the rest of the higher chakras. Clearing and activating the eighth chakra opens up your world, and carries your spirit higher than you've ever been before. You need to do the personal work required to clear, charge, and balance the seven bodily chakras through meditation, [journaling](http://www.amazon.com/Truth-Heals-What-Hide-Hurt/dp/140192302X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425537171&sr=8-1&keywords=truth+heals), and other [energy medicine](http://www.amazon.com/Be-Your-Own-Shaman-21st-Century/dp/1401930794/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) techniques before you are ready to tackle the higher chakras. But once you are ready, here is what you can expect from your soul awakening: - Connect directly to your higher self. When your eighth and higher chakras are open, you will be able to interact with your higher self. Your higher self is you\u2014the perfect version of you that you came here to become\u2014and it has answers to all your questions. Your higher self has access to your Akashic records, which contain all knowledge in existence, past, present, and future, so the guidance you receive from this chakra is equal to no other. Meeting with your higher self will also allow you to see your soul's contract, which is stored in the eighth chakra. Your soul contract is what your spirit came to this earth to accomplish, your life purpose. So once you've opened your eighth chakra, you may feel a tugging at your psyche, a nagging resolution that it's time to follow your true path and complete whatever task your soul set up for your life. Listen to that voice that tells you what your higher calling is; trust that higher plane understanding that you've received by activating your eighth chakra and awakening your spirit. - Unlock your spiritual gifts. With the magnified awareness of an open eighth chakra, you may discover new abilities developing within you. As you internalize and fully accept the truth that you are not only part of the greater universe, but that you are tapped into its power, psychic talents are likely to unlock. For example, with access to more information through the Akashic records, you will probably find your intuitive powers growing. There is also the potential for an activated eighth chakra to sprout the seeds of any dormant spiritual gifts and you might uncover such capabilities as astral travel, clairvoyance, telepathy, and energy healing! After all, these skills are in your collective unconscious; you need this soul awakening through your higher chakras to help bring them to light again. - Rid yourself of karmic residue. The eighth chakra acts as the bridge to the expanded universe, so it's the last chakra that carries human information and physical plane baggage that must be discarded before you can move on. This means this chakra is where all your karmic residue gets stuck\u2014the lingering karmic energy leftover from lifetimes of adhering to habitual patterns of behavior. These old and worn out patterns of energy are keeping you attached to the planet, unable to evolve until you learn the lessons you're supposed to learn. When you open the eighth chakra, it allows you to start shedding the familiar-but-no-longer-needed patterns of behavior that keep you rooted to the physical plane. Activating the eight chakra frees you from those sticky karmic leftovers, so you can advance on your spiritual path into higher realms. Traveling through the veil that separates your physical self from your immortal soul will open your eyes to the vast space and knowledge beyond our physical plane boundaries. As your higher chakras expand, you can integrate the understanding that you are a soul in a body temporarily here on Earth, which allows you to see the vast and interconnected community of souls on this planet, each doing their best to get back to the divine, just like you. This sense of oneness opens you up to the experience of unconditional love, and in turn, divine love, which is truly a soul awakening experience.
