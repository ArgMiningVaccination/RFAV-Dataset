It is fundedfrom a private endowment, which is managedwith long-term stability and growth in mind. Its mission is to foster and promote research with the aim of improving human and animalhealth.

Resources - providing exceptional researchers with the infrastructural and careersupport they need to full their potential. Translation - ensuring maximum health benets are gained from biomedical research. Public engagement - raising awareness of the medical, ethical and social implications of biomedical science.Annual Review 2002 The Wellcome Trust Annual Review 1 October 2001 - 30 September 2002When I became Director of the Wellcome Trust in 1998, I wantedto make sure that the Trust retainedits reputation for leadership,independence and distinctiveness.Y et I also wanted to enhance two key aspects of its activities:innovation and collaboration. Having stepped down as Director in March 2003, it is perhaps an apt time to reflect on the last veyears.We have seen many excitingand remarkable advances duringthis time - the highlight, for me,being the sequencing of the humangenome. As a nation, we shouldtake great pride in the fact thatthe UK - through its scientists atthe Wellcome Trust Sanger Institutein Cambridgeshire - should havecontributed one-third of the datato this huge internationalundertaking. While the independence and scale of the Trust enables it tosupport enterprises such as thedevelopment of the WellcomeTrust Genome Campus, much of the work we fund requires a collaborative approach - oftenthe most fruitful method ofachieving one's aims. By workingtogether with other organizations,we can take greater steps towardsour common goals - an excellentexample being the HumanGenome Project involving severalnations, multiple funders andvarious institutions.With the UK Government, for example, we have worked onprojects to address the decayingstate of research infrastructure in the UK. In 1998, the Trustcontributed \u00a3300 million to the\u00a3750 million Joint InfrastructureFund, and million tothe billion Science Fund.These funds areinvesting in new buildings,laboratories and equipment atuniversities throughout the UK. I must emphasize, however, that we see it as the Government's roleto support the university researchinfrastructure. I was particularlypleased with the outcome of the2002 Spending Review in whichthe Government committed \u00a3500 million per annum foruniversity infrastructure from2004/2005.The Government hasput this funding into the baseline,indicating that it intends this to be a permanent measure. The Trust is also working closely with the Medical Research Counciland Department of Health on the UK Biobank project. Usinggenetic information from DNAsamples and the medical recordsof a cohort of 500 000 adultsaged between 45-69, the Biobankproject will explore the interactionsbetween genes, environment andlifestyle - and how that impactson health - knowledge that will be essential to our understandingof common conditions of later lifesuch as cancer and heart disease.Such partnerships are not conned to the UK, and the Trust has along history of working with othercountries.The great strides intropical medicine being made byour overseas research programmesin South-East Asia (Thailand andVietnam), Kenya and Malawiwould not be possible without theenthusiastic support of localgovernments and close workingrelationships with local organizations. Our public engagement programmes have also been developing rapidlyover the last few years. Frompublic consultations to innovativeapproaches that explore sciencethrough drama and art, ourapproach is very much one ofdiscussion, debate and listening.One of our latest initiatives is anational network of sciencelearning centres, a partnershipbetween the Trust and theDepartment for Education andSkills.The Trust is allocating up to\u00a325 million over ve years to theinitiative that will enable scienceteachers to learn more aboutcontemporary scientic ideas,train in new teaching approaches,and gain experience of newscientic techniques.These are just a few examples of the Wellcome Trust's activitiesover the past ve years, a periodthat has seen massive - and muchneeded - investment into UKbiomedical research, both by the Trust and by Government.Such investment by the Trust isintended to enhance UK research:it does not, and will not replaceinvestment by the Government.In all that it does, the Trust is acatalyst, not a solution. Finally, I would like to say how much I have enjoyed leading theTrust through such a productiveperiod and give my thanks, notonly to the staff of the Trust,but also to the many individualsworking within government, theresearch and funding councils andother charitable foundations whohave shared the vision and madeit possible.

KNOWLEDGE9 8 Cancer gene identied Foot and mouth disease Professor Mike Stratton, Richard Wooster, Andy Futreal and theirteam of researchers working on the Cancer Genome Project at the Wellcome Trust SangerInstitute have identied a majorgenetic change that is involved in 70per cent of cases of malignant melanoma, a potentially lethalform of skin cancer. The Cancer Genome Project is a Wellcome Trust-fundedprogramme to identify geneticchanges that cause cells tobecome cancerous. Researchers at the Sanger Institute are usingthe human genome sequence as a reference to examinesystematically all genes in about 50human cancers. The BRAF gene was found to be mutated in about 70per cent of malignant melanomas, 10per cent of colon cancers and a smallerproportion of other cancer types.Remarkably, most of the mutationsin the BRAF gene involve the same single letter of DNA . Collaborators Professor Chris Marshall and Dr Richard Maraiswho work at the Institute ofCancer Research, in the CancerResearch UKCentre for Cell and Molecular Biology, showed thatthe mutation renders the BRAF protein active all the time so it is no longer responsive to thesignals that should control it, andthe affected cells can multiplyunchecked, leading to cancer.As the UKfarming industry struggles to recover from the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease ( FMD), in which six million animals were culled, researchersare using computer simulations todesign control strategies that wouldminimize the cost to farmers inany future outbreaks. Professor Mark Woolhouse, Dr Bryan Grenfell, Dr StephenBrooks and Dr Matthew Keeling -a team of Wellcome Trust-fundedepidemiologists and statisticians at the Universities of Edinburgh,Cambridge and Warwick - areinvestigating the effectiveness ofvarious vaccination strategies asan alternative to culling. T o start with, the team is modelling the spread of FMD and assessing its dependence on a range ofvariables. Farm size, species oflivestock (whether cattle, sheep orpigs) on farms, proximity to roadsand nearby farms, regional climate,and seasonal changes in numbersand locations of livestock - allthese factors impact on diseasetransmission. Detailed datacollected by the Department forthe Environment, Food and RuralAffairs ( DEFRA ) during the 2001 outbreak is enabling the team to develop a realistic and flexiblebackground against which tosimulate different control strategies. One option would be preventative vaccination of entireherds. However, although thiswould prevent a major epidemicof FMD in the UK, the economic effect would be disastrous: currentEUregulations do not permit the export of vaccinated animals.Moreover, although people caneat infected meat without getting FMD, consumer condence in meat from vaccinated animalswould be severely affected. The team is therefore assessing various reactive vaccinationstrategies. Moving swiftly tovaccinate herds as soon as therst cases of FMD have been reported could limit the spread of the disease without affectingthe export market too adversely.However, there is a six- to ten-daydelay before vaccinated animalsare protected, in which time theycould catch and transmit FMD - reducing the ability of the vaccineto get ahead of the epidemic. This problem could be overcome by a novel predictive strategy,which involves predicting the most at-risk farms over the nextseven to 14days of an epidemic and protecting these farms by vaccination. Models indicate thatthis potentially powerful 'smart' strategy cuts off the tail of theepidemic by many months, andcould be of major economicsignicance. The outcomes of these computer simulations - passed to the Ofceof Science and Technology and DEFRA , with whom the team is working closely - will help theGovernment develop guidelines for cost-effective vaccination in the UK.They may also inform the development of internationalguidelines - not only for thecontrol of FMD, but for other major livestock diseases, such asAfrican swine fever.The mutation is so clear-cut that drugs are already being designedto block the action of the defectiveprotein.The ndings werepublished in Nature in June 2002.

Cleft lip and palate are among the most common birth defects inhumans, affecting up to one in 500 infants.The condition causes eitheran opening between the mouthand the nose (which can look asthough there is a split in the lip),or a small gap in parts of themouth. In some cases the baby isborn with both.Van der Woudesyndrome accounts for about twoper cent of all cleft lip and palatecases; importantly, it is a conditionthat shares similarities with manyother types. A vital clue to the identity of the faulty gene underlying Van derWoude syndrome came from apair of Brazilian identical twins.One twin was born with thesyndrome, the other without,and the Manchester researchers,in collaboration with a team ledby Professor Jeffrey Murray at theUniversity of Iowa, tracked downthe difference to a mutation in agene called interferon regulatoryfactor 6(IRF6), on chromosome 1.Cleft lip and palate gene identiedT esting vaccination success A new study has found that a novel vaccine introduced throughoutthe UK in November 1999 againstgroup C meningococcal disease,was working well a year later. Commonly referred to as meningitis, this disease is caused bythe meningococcus, a bacteriumthat normally lives in the humanthroat without causing symptoms.Occasionally, for reasons that are still not understood, themeningococcus invades thebloodstream, causing a severedisease that is usually fatal in theabsence of treatment.There areabout 2500 cases per year in the UK, with children and adolescents particularly at risk. Only ve of the many forms of the meningococcus cause mostdisease: these are called groups A,B,C,Yand W. Group Band C meningococcal disease ispredominant in the UK, whilemost disease in Africa has beengroup A.Vaccines against groups A,C,Yand Whave been available for some years, although they areineffective in infants and provide only short-ter m protection in adults. There is no effective vaccineagainst group B meningococci. Record numbers of cases of meningococcal disease, anincrease in outbreaks caused bygroup C, and the availability of a new vaccine led to the launch of a nationwide immunizationcampaign. From November 1999, everyone in the UK under the ageof 18(about 14million people)was offered immunization with the new 'meningococcal C conjugate( MCC) vaccine', which is much more effective than the oldervaccines, providing long-lastingprotection, even to small babies.By November 2000, more than 70 per cent of the UK's children andteenagers had been immunized. T o nd out how well the vaccine was working, Martin Maiden,James Stuart and colleagues (the UK Meningococcal CarriageGroup) surveyed thousands ofteenagers while they were beingvaccinated, and then again a yearlater. Across the UK, they found that the proportion of peoplecarrying group Cmeningococci in their throats had fallen by 66per cent - indicating that the vaccinewas preventing carriage of thesebacteria. During the year, the ratesof disease caused by group C meningococci also fell rapidly inthe vaccinated age groups, butremained unchanged in the olderunvaccinated age groups. As the meningococcus is naturally present in the throats of manypeople, and especially teenagersand young adults, it is importantto know the effect of this large-scale vaccine intervention on themeningococcal population.The genetic makeup of the morethan 9000 meningococci which were obtained in this study isbeing determined at the PeterMedawar Building in Oxford.The results will indicate theevolutionary pressures imposedby the vaccination campaign onthe bacterium.

Indeed, the National DNA Database ( NDNAD ), used to provide scientic support to thepolice in the investigation of crime,is by far the largest collection of DNA in the UK. Set up in 1995, the NDNAD currently holds more than 1.5million DNA proles and is on target to contain the DNA proles of all of the known activecriminal population. With a Wellcome Trust Biomedical Ethics project grant, RobinWilliams and Dr Paul Johnson at the University of Durham and Dr Paul Martin, University ofNottingham, are investigating thesocial, ethical and public policycontexts and consequences of theestablishment and rapid expansionof the NDNAD. The use of DNA typing systems in criminal investigations wasmade possible by the discovery ofpolymorphic sequences of DNA capable of uniquely identifyingindividual samples. First used in a criminal investigation in 1986, the UKwas the rst jurisdiction to establish a national database of DNA proles to be used to determine whether individualsuspects could be included orexcluded from involvement inparticular crimes. The DNA proles are obtained from crime scenes and fromindividuals suspected, reported,charged or convicted of anyrecordable offence. Since theestablishment of the NDNAD , genetic data held on this databasehave become increasingly centralto the practice of criminalinvestigation in the UK. Through interviews and documentary evidence, the projectteam aims to investigate a widerange of issues raised by the NDNAD , such as the inclusiveness of the database, the managementof issues of condentiality andprivacy, and the accountability ofthe custodians and users of thisform of genetic information.The study will engage with variousstakeholders, and will aim to offerpolicy recommendations for thegovernance of the NDNAD .

All of these materials began to be usedin the 1920s and 30s, although itwas not until World War II that demands for reliable and regularsupplies led to tissue banksbecoming established. The development of the tissue banks occurred without publicdebate in the UK, perhaps because, at the time, the NHS was relatively new and did notwant adverse publicity. In 1961, the Human Tissue Act gavehospitals the right to remove anduse tissues for therapeutic use,medical research and education.But it failed to provide a properregulatory framework, especially in seeking consent from patients.By the time of the Alder Hey andBristol scandals, NHSTrusts were holding 54 000 tissue samples. Governments all over the world - including the UK- are now recognizing the urgent need toreview and revise a complicatedsystem that has arisen around thecollection of material from deadpeople. For example, in the UK, the Retained Organs Commissionwas set up in 2001 to monitor the return of organs, oversee newlegislature and address issues ofaccountability and consent, and in 2002 the Department of Health published a consultation document,'Human bodies, human choices'.High blood pressure affects at least 5million people in the UK, increasing the risk of heart attacks,stroke, and heart and kidneyfailure. It is also responsible formore than half of all deaths ofpeople over 65years old.

Indeed, the National DNA Database ( NDNAD ), used to provide scientic support to thepolice in the investigation of crime,is by far the largest collection of DNA in the UK. Set up in 1995, the NDNAD currently holds more than 1.5million DNA proles and is on target to contain the DNA proles of all of the known activecriminal population. With a Wellcome Trust Biomedical Ethics project grant, RobinWilliams and Dr Paul Johnson at the University of Durham and Dr Paul Martin, University ofNottingham, are investigating thesocial, ethical and public policycontexts and consequences of theestablishment and rapid expansionof the NDNAD. The use of DNA typing systems in criminal investigations wasmade possible by the discovery ofpolymorphic sequences of DNA capable of uniquely identifyingindividual samples. First used in a criminal investigation in 1986, the UKwas the rst jurisdiction to establish a national database of DNA proles to be used to determine whether individualsuspects could be included orexcluded from involvement inparticular crimes. The DNA proles are obtained from crime scenes and fromindividuals suspected, reported,charged or convicted of anyrecordable offence.

Suchpain can last for months or years,reducing the physical quality of lifeand often leading to secondarysymptoms such as anxiety anddepression. Pain is not only an adultcondition and premature infants in intensive care may experienceup to several hundred painfulprocedures within the rst fewweeks of life. Although we still have few ways of combating pain other than withpainkillers, the past two decadeshave seen rapid progress in painresearch. A number of genesinvolved in the control of painhave identied, ndings thathave already stimulated the searchfor new painkillers.Y et the functionof these genes remains poorlyunderstood, and we understandlittle of how the function of thenervous system relates to thecontrol of pain. With \u00a35.4 million funding from the Wellcome Trust's IntegrativeAnimal and Human PhysiologyInitiative, a new collaboration -the London Pain Consortium - is investigating how pain arises,is transmitted by the nerves, andis regulated by the spinal cord and brainstem.The consortium,led by Professor Steve McMahon(King's College, London) and including colleagues fromUniversity College London andImperial College, brings togethereight research groups ofneuroscientists and clinicians. The ve-year project is bringing a variety of complementaryapproaches and expertise to bear on the problem of pain.For example, the consortiummembers plan to use functionalgenomics techniques such asDNA microarrays to search forgenes whose expression isregulated in models of inflammatoryand neuropathic pain and bypainkillers. Using animal models,they will study mutations thataffect the transmission andregulation of pain. And they willscreen human volunteers forvariations in pain sensitivity andtest whether such variations arerelated to polymorphisms in pain-related genes. An equally important goal of the project is the training of youngscientists - students, post-docsand junior doctors - in integrativephysiology.The training programmeinvolves each young scientistworking in several consortiumlaboratories so as to learn integrativephysiology techniques and how to combine them with modernmolecular and genetic approaches.Funding for the UK Biobank project - a study of genes, environ-ment and health - was announced on 29April 2002.The Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Counciland the Department of Healthare providing an initial \u00a345million for the project, a study of the roleof nature and nurture in healthand disease. Up to half a million participants aged between 45and 69years will be involved in the study.They willbe asked to contribute a bloodsample, lifestyle details and theirmedical histories to create a nationaldatabase of unprecedented size.

South Africa - The Africa Centre The new building housing theAfrica Centre for Health andPopulation Studies is situated in Somkhele, KwaZulu-Natal,some 150miles north of Durban. Research at the Centre - a collaboration between theSouth African Medical ResearchCouncil, the Universities of Nataland Durban-Westville and theWellcome Trust - reflects localpopulation and reproductivehealth priorities, particularly HIV/AIDS .The prevalence of HIV infection in the community is veryhigh (at least 30per cent). The site for the Africa Centre's new building was donated by theInkosi (Zulu tribal chief) for thearea.The Centre aims to integratefully into the local community,which was consulted at every stageof development.When the buildingwas in the planning stages, everymember of the local communitywas contacted and asked if theywere decorators, plasterers orbricklayers. As a result, out of 186 jobs created by the project, 117 went to local people.Overseas buildings A major new initiative focusing onthe health problems of developingcountries in South and South-EastAsia and the Pacic was launchedin May 2002 in partnership withthe research councils of Australiaand New Zealand. The Wellcome Trust Partnership for Developing-country Healthinitiative will promotecollaborative research and trainingbetween developing countries inthe region - which include theIndian subcontinent, China, South-East Asia, Indonesia, the Philippinesand the Pacic Islands - andcentres of excellence in Australiaand New Zealand. The \u00a312 million initiative will be funded in part by the Trust and in part by the governments ofAustralia and New Zealand: theNational Health and MedicalResearch Council of Australia andthe Ministry of Research, Scienceand Technology, and HealthResearch Council of NewZealand.The Trust will contribute \u00a36 million towards this majorinternational governmentpartnership, which will bematched by the governments ofAustralia and New Zealand. The initiative will fund major ve- year programmes to encouragenew and innovative collaborationsin infectious and non-infectiousdiseases as well as health serviceresearch.The centre of gravity of the research will be in thedeveloping country, focusing onthe health of these countries.Two-way training will also beencouraged: researchers indeveloping countries will receivetraining in state-of-the-art researchtechniques, while developed- country researchers gain rst-handexperience of the health problemsof the developing country. A new Australasian partnership Senior Fellows in Central EuropeThe rst round of the CentralEuropean Senior Fellowships wasawarded during the year, followinginterviews held in Berlin in June2002. Eleven awards were madetotalling \u00a35 million: four to Hungary,four to Estonia, two to Poland andone to the Czech Republic. The new fellows include Dr Laszlo Acsady (Hungarian Academy ofSciences, Budapest, Hungary) andDr Gabor Tamas (University ofSzeged, Hungary) who are studyingthalamocortical circuits andinformation processing in corticalnetworks, respectively. In Brno in the Czech Republic, Dr JiriSponer is carrying out advancedcomputational studies of DNA and RNA.And in Estonia, Dr PriitKogerman is studying the hedgehogsignalling pathway, and Dr T onisTimmusk the regulation ofneurotrophin gene expression in the nervous system. By the provision of substantial funding for the individuals and theirresearch programmes these awardswill enable outstanding younginvestigators to return to, or beretained in, their country of origin.

South Africa - The Africa Centre The new building housing theAfrica Centre for Health andPopulation Studies is situated in Somkhele, KwaZulu-Natal,some 150miles north of Durban. Research at the Centre - a collaboration between theSouth African Medical ResearchCouncil, the Universities of Nataland Durban-Westville and theWellcome Trust - reflects localpopulation and reproductivehealth priorities, particularly HIV/AIDS .The prevalence of HIV infection in the community is veryhigh (at least 30per cent). The site for the Africa Centre's new building was donated by theInkosi (Zulu tribal chief) for thearea.The Centre aims to integratefully into the local community,which was consulted at every stageof development.When the buildingwas in the planning stages, everymember of the local communitywas contacted and asked if theywere decorators, plasterers orbricklayers. As a result, out of 186 jobs created by the project, 117 went to local people.Overseas buildings A major new initiative focusing onthe health problems of developingcountries in South and South-EastAsia and the Pacic was launchedin May 2002 in partnership withthe research councils of Australiaand New Zealand. The Wellcome Trust Partnership for Developing-country Healthinitiative will promotecollaborative research and trainingbetween developing countries inthe region - which include theIndian subcontinent, China, South-East Asia, Indonesia, the Philippinesand the Pacic Islands - andcentres of excellence in Australiaand New Zealand. The \u00a312 million initiative will be funded in part by the Trust and in part by the governments ofAustralia and New Zealand: theNational Health and MedicalResearch Council of Australia andthe Ministry of Research, Scienceand Technology, and HealthResearch Council of NewZealand.The Trust will contribute \u00a36 million towards this majorinternational governmentpartnership, which will bematched by the governments ofAustralia and New Zealand. The initiative will fund major ve- year programmes to encouragenew and innovative collaborationsin infectious and non-infectiousdiseases as well as health serviceresearch.The centre of gravity of the research will be in thedeveloping country, focusing onthe health of these countries.Two-way training will also beencouraged: researchers indeveloping countries will receivetraining in state-of-the-art researchtechniques, while developed- country researchers gain rst-handexperience of the health problemsof the developing country. A new Australasian partnership Senior Fellows in Central EuropeThe rst round of the CentralEuropean Senior Fellowships wasawarded during the year, followinginterviews held in Berlin in June2002. Eleven awards were madetotalling \u00a35 million: four to Hungary,four to Estonia, two to Poland andone to the Czech Republic. The new fellows include Dr Laszlo Acsady (Hungarian Academy ofSciences, Budapest, Hungary) andDr Gabor Tamas (University ofSzeged, Hungary) who are studyingthalamocortical circuits andinformation processing in corticalnetworks, respectively. In Brno in the Czech Republic, Dr JiriSponer is carrying out advancedcomputational studies of DNA and RNA.And in Estonia, Dr PriitKogerman is studying the hedgehogsignalling pathway, and Dr T onisTimmusk the regulation ofneurotrophin gene expression in the nervous system. By the provision of substantial funding for the individuals and theirresearch programmes these awardswill enable outstanding younginvestigators to return to, or beretained in, their country of origin.

PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT31 30 National Festival of Drama Engaging Science On 9May 2002, the audience in the Linbury Studio Theatre atthe Royal Opera House, London,was treated to a series of dazzlingexplorations of the value of life,the mystery of love, theuncertainties of science and thetight spaces in which life-and-deathdecisions are made - all throughthe eyes of 11-16 year-olds. The occasion was the Wellcome Trust's National Festival of Drama -the culmination of the ScienceCentrestage initiative, launched inOctober 2001 as part of Science Y ear. Some 100schools took part in the initiative, which encouragedsecondary school students toexplore the wider implications of science through drama. The resulting works - rst performed at ten regional festivalsin March 2002 - showed the challenge had been taken up withgusto: students experimented witha multitude of dramatic forms andtackled a host of critical issues.The depth of thought that hadgone into the plays - the sensitiveand balanced handling of complexissues, the skilful use of comedy tolighten scenes dealing withsickness and death, and the highstandards of artistic excellence andscientic accuracy - won praisefrom audiences across the country.

The People Awards, of up to \u00a330 000 , support small-scale activities, such as workshops inschools and science centres, talksand discussions in public spaces,or drama and art projects,covering any area of biomedicine.The aim is to encourage peoplewho are not experienced sciencecommunicators - and might bedeterred from applying for largerawards - to communicate scienceand its related issues. Fundingdecisions will be made throughoutthe year, allowing the WellcomeTrust to respond quickly in orderto support activities communicatingtopical issues.The schemeparticularly encourages novel and imaginative projects whichexperiment with new ways ofengaging the public. The Society Awards, in excess of \u00a350 000 , fund much larger public engagement activities or researchprogrammes which aim to have a signicant impact, ideally ofnationwide importance.Theseawards, assessed by an externalpanel of experts, focus on specicthemes and run for a xed periodof time.The rst calls for proposalsare for young people's education,broadening access to thebiosciences, Sciart and performingarts for young people (Pulse). www.wellcome.ac.uk/engagingscienceraised by biomedicine.

Professor Walport waspreviously a Governor of the Trust .Good research practice The Wellcome Trust has published its 'Guidelines on Good ResearchPractice'.The guidelines are designedto apply to all the research that the Wellcome Trust funds, includingbiomedical, biomedical ethics, socialsciences and history of medicine. Institutions are expected to have in place their own published standardsof good research practice. In addition,with effect from 1 October 2002,it will be a condition of WellcomeTrust grants that host institutions inthe UK and the Republic of Irelandhave in place formal writtenprocedures for the investigation ofallegations of research misconduct.The guidelines are supplemented by a Statement on the Handling ofAllegations of Research Misconduct.New Head of Policy Dr Lee Elliot-Major took up theposition of Head of Policy andCommunications in June 2002.Prior to this new role, Dr Elliot-Majorcompleted a PhD in theoreticalphysics - publishing three academicpapers on quantum mechanics -before setting up Research Fortnight,a newspaper providing informationabout funding opportunities for theresearch community and news onresearch policy and politics. He thenmoved on to become editor ofEducation Guardian before joiningthe Trust.Cornerstone project Good progress was made on the newWellcome Trust headquarters underconstruction at 215 Euston Road.During 2001/02, Unity House wasdemolished and the substructure and steel frame of the new building were erected on the site.The old substation was demolished and anew substation built in the southwestcorner of the 215 site. The project, known as the Cornerstone pr oject, is on track for completion in spring 2004.Time capsule buried The Trust launched a competition for local schools in Camden to come up with ideas for the contents of a time capsule to be buried in the foundations of the new building.As a result, the capsule contains a range of items, including the three winning submissions from theschools, the Human Genome CD-ROM, photos of all the WellcomeTrust staff and commemorative itemsfrom the Queen's Golden Jubilee. Sir Roger Gibbs, the former chairman of the Trust, buried the capsule andlaid the foundation stone on 25 June2002.The ceremony was attended by the Governors, including the presentchairman Sir Dominic Cadbury,a representative staff group, thewinners of the schools competitionand Local Authority representatives.Open House On 21 September 2002, the Trusttook part in London Open Houseday, an annual event allowingmembers of the public access tobuildings of architectural and culturalinterest which are otherwise closed.Members of staff showed over 450visitors from a variety of countries,including Hungary, New Zealand and Canada, around the WellcomeBuilding at 183 Euston Road. Visitors took in the sparkling glass model of the new building on theupper ground floor and Aya BenRon's striking banner,'Hanging',which descends through the stairwellfrom the top floor ceiling to theupper ground floor.The WellcomeLibrary's magnicently preservedreading room and Henry Wellcome'sportrait gallery also drew admiringcomments. Opening 183 to thepublic in this way pregures plans forthe Wellcome Building to become apublic space once the new buildingat 215 Euston Road is complete.Roy Porter (1946-2002 ) People throughout the Wellcome Trust, like people around the world, wereshocked and saddened by the suddendeath of Roy Porter on 3 March2002. He had only recently retired. Roy Porter moved to the Academic Unit of the Wellcome Institute for theHistory of Medicine at the WellcomeTrust in 1979, became Professor of the Social History of Medicine in1993, and was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy in 1994.His prodigious written output of morethan 100 books included works on madness, quacks, gout, London,and the Enlightenment; his Greatest Benet to Mankind: A medical history of humanity (1997)is a synthesis of medical history of all periods.Monte Carlo grave The Trust entered intocorrespondence with the cemeteryauthorities in Monte Carlo - whereHenry Wellcome's business partner,Silas Mainville Burroughs, died ofpneumonia in 1895 and is buried -to prevent his grave being replaced.In parts of Europe, if a grave is over 100 years old and consideredabandoned, it is standard practice for it to be replaced.The Trustnanced the necessary repairs to the grave in order to assure itspreservation, and to preserve thememory of a remarkable man:although much more has beenwritten about Henry Wellcome,without his charismatic and energeticpartner, the Wellcome Trust wouldnever have existed.39 38 A YEAR AT THE TRUST New Director Dr Mike Dexter announced his decision to retire in March 2003,following a ve-year term as Director.Mark Walport - Professor ofMedicine and Head of the Division of Medicine at Imperial College,London - was appointed to succeedhim, taking up his new position on 1 June 2003.

He thenmoved on to become editor ofEducation Guardian before joiningthe Trust.Cornerstone project Good progress was made on the newWellcome Trust headquarters underconstruction at 215 Euston Road.During 2001/02, Unity House wasdemolished and the substructure and steel frame of the new building were erected on the site.The old substation was demolished and anew substation built in the southwestcorner of the 215 site. The project, known as the Cornerstone pr oject, is on track for completion in spring 2004.Time capsule buried The Trust launched a competition for local schools in Camden to come up with ideas for the contents of a time capsule to be buried in the foundations of the new building.As a result, the capsule contains a range of items, including the three winning submissions from theschools, the Human Genome CD-ROM, photos of all the WellcomeTrust staff and commemorative itemsfrom the Queen's Golden Jubilee. Sir Roger Gibbs, the former chairman of the Trust, buried the capsule andlaid the foundation stone on 25 June2002.The ceremony was attended by the Governors, including the presentchairman Sir Dominic Cadbury,a representative staff group, thewinners of the schools competitionand Local Authority representatives.Open House On 21 September 2002, the Trusttook part in London Open Houseday, an annual event allowingmembers of the public access tobuildings of architectural and culturalinterest which are otherwise closed.Members of staff showed over 450visitors from a variety of countries,including Hungary, New Zealand and Canada, around the WellcomeBuilding at 183 Euston Road. Visitors took in the sparkling glass model of the new building on theupper ground floor and Aya BenRon's striking banner,'Hanging',which descends through the stairwellfrom the top floor ceiling to theupper ground floor.The WellcomeLibrary's magnicently preservedreading room and Henry Wellcome'sportrait gallery also drew admiringcomments. Opening 183 to thepublic in this way pregures plans forthe Wellcome Building to become apublic space once the new buildingat 215 Euston Road is complete.Roy Porter (1946-2002 ) People throughout the Wellcome Trust, like people around the world, wereshocked and saddened by the suddendeath of Roy Porter on 3 March2002. He had only recently retired. Roy Porter moved to the Academic Unit of the Wellcome Institute for theHistory of Medicine at the WellcomeTrust in 1979, became Professor of the Social History of Medicine in1993, and was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy in 1994.His prodigious written output of morethan 100 books included works on madness, quacks, gout, London,and the Enlightenment; his Greatest Benet to Mankind: A medical history of humanity (1997)is a synthesis of medical history of all periods.Monte Carlo grave The Trust entered intocorrespondence with the cemeteryauthorities in Monte Carlo - whereHenry Wellcome's business partner,Silas Mainville Burroughs, died ofpneumonia in 1895 and is buried -to prevent his grave being replaced.In parts of Europe, if a grave is over 100 years old and consideredabandoned, it is standard practice for it to be replaced.The Trustnanced the necessary repairs to the grave in order to assure itspreservation, and to preserve thememory of a remarkable man:although much more has beenwritten about Henry Wellcome,without his charismatic and energeticpartner, the Wellcome Trust wouldnever have existed.Advisory committee Infection and Immunity Panel Molecular and Cell Panel Neurosciences Panel Physiology and Pharmacology Panel Remit Funds fundamental and applied Considers applications Considers applications Supports physiology and research relating to infectious that fall into the general area investigating the function of the pharmacology in its broadest diseases and immunology. of molecular and cell biology, nervous system in health and context, ranging from basicThis ranges from epidemiology including biochemistry, disease.

Review During 2002, the Wellcome Trust and Catalyst worked together with external consultants to reviewand reorganize Catalyst.The aimwas to develop an effective strategyfor managing intellectual propertyand business development arisingout of Trust-funded research. As aresult of the review, it was decidedto integrate Catalyst within themain body of the Trust. A newTechnology Transf er initiative will handle all translation projects.The T echnology Transfer initiative This new initiative will build on the strengths of previous workundertaken by Catalyst BioMedicaLtd and the Development Fund.However, its activity will berefocused. Recognizing the important roleplayed by the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries intranslating research innovations intonew medicines, the new divisionaims to support promising early-stage projects to a point wherethey can be taken up by investorsand industry. The new initiative will provide a high-quality technology transferservice for the Wellcome Trust andwill seek to enhance the level ofbiomedical translation of Trust-funded research. A new funding programme ofTranslation Awards will replace the Development Fund.The outputswill be platform technologies andproducts aimed at the biotechnologyand pharmaceutical industries.Innovations developed under theseawards will offer opportunities forlicensing deals and the establishmentof start-up companies.They willspan all areas of biomedical science.They will be of interest to venturecapitalists, the life science industriesand local commerce, includingbusiness angels and RegionalDevelopment Agencies.Theprogramme has two schemes.University Translation Awardsprovide 'hands-off' support - of up to \u00a3300 000 - for projects managed by university projects,as oftechnology development inbiomedical science will be funded,provided they address an unmet need in healthcare. Strategic Translation Awards provide 'hands-on' support - of upto \u00a3500 000 - to projects focusedon areas of strategic scienticimportance to the Trust, such as the various xed-term initiatives the Trust supports.The themes maychange, according to the strategicfocus of the Trust. Unlike UniversityTranslation Awards, projects will bemanaged by Technology Transfer atthe Wellcome Trust.Since its rst fully operational trading year in 1999/2000 , Catalyst BioMedica, the Wellcome Trust'sbusiness subsidiary, has concludedmore than 60licence agreements, and supported 30Development Fund projects leading to more thana dozen new start-up companies. The Development Fund of \u00a320million has nearly completed its funding cycle.The wide range of newtechnologies supported includes: Catalyst awarded \u00a3427 000 to the Trust-funded Cancer GenomeProject for a drug discoveryprogramme to screen for moleculesthat interact with BRAF - a protein associated with malignant melanomas.These compounds will form thebasis of a future collaboration todevelop new cancer-ghting drugs. CellTran Limited, a spin-off from Shefeld University EnterprisesLimited, was set up to develop andmarket the pioneering research of two University of Shefeldacademics.With a \u00a3600 000 award from Catalyst, and other funding,the company is currentlyinvestigating the use of patient'sown cells on plasma-coatedpolymers for burn and woundrepairs in the form of biologicalbandages. Ongoing patient trials are demonstrating signicant health benets.Catalyst BioMedica Ltd, the business subsidiary of the Wellcome Trust, was set up to take forward promisingresearch that is at too early a stage or too high-risk to attractventure capital or be taken up by industry. Ultimately, the aimis to make research available to the commercial sector, whichhas the knowledge and resources necessary to develop it intonew therapies that will benet patients.51 50 History of Medicine Units The Trust continued to support two History of Medicine Units at the Universities of Manchesterand Oxford.The Unit at theUniversity of East Anglia closed and staff transferred to UniversityCollege London. Professor Michael Worboys took up his post as the new Director of the Wellcome Trust's History of Medicine Unit at the Universityof Manchester on 1August 2002. Professor Worboys, formerly ofShefeld wasawarded a WellcomeTrust University Award, which willlead to a permanent academicposition at Manchester. Strategic and Enhancement Awards In recognition of the need for a more open competition in thehistory of medicine eld, a newscheme was launched.The Strategicand Enhancement Awards willprovide core support for groupingsof historians of medicine at any UKinstitution. Strategic Awards will be made toestablished groupings of researchersenabling them to pursue researcharound a theme or related themes.This continues the theme conceptof the units, which formed around a focus that was sufciently loose to allow for the interests ofdifferent scholars to be pursuedwithin an overall framework. The smaller Enhancement Awardswill be made to provide some core funding for small groups ofresearchers, or individuals, enablingthem to develop collaborative linksand build their research strengths.If desired, the awards can help tomake them competitive forStrategic Awards.Public engagement programme The History of Medicine Grants Panel has set aside \u00a3250 000 to fund public engagement projectsthat aim to help the history ofmedicine to reach wider audiencesand ensure the history of medicineis included in general historycoverage.The key aim of the fund isto give perspective and context tocurrent health and research issuesand stimulate dialogue betweenresearchers, policy makers and thewider public.
