This cancer information summary provides an overview of the use of curcumin as a treatment for people with cancer. This summary contains the following key information: Curcumin is a member of the diarylheptanoid class of natural products (curcuminoids) derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L., an East Indian plant, commonly called turmeric. The other major curcuminoids present in turmeric are demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and cyclocurcumin; together, they are termed the curcuminoid complex. The turmeric plant and preparations derived from it have a long history of therapeutic application in traditional Asian medicine. The crude and often dried plant material is widely consumed as a food additive, as part of curry spices, which typically contain numerous other ingredients. Turmeric and its preparations also have a long history of use as herbal medicines and dietary supplements, primarily to treat various inflammatory disorders. Significant confusion exists in the scientific biomedical literature, as well as the popular literature, about the meaning of curcumin. Consequently, one group has developed a classification scheme that is described below.[ Several companies distribute curcumin as a dietary supplement. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated as foods, not drugs. Therefore, premarket evaluation and approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are not required unless specific disease prevention or treatment claims are made. The FDA can remove dietary supplements from the market that are deemed unsafe. Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot. In addition, there is no guarantee that ingredients claimed on product labels are present at all or are present in the specified amounts. The FDA has not approved the use of curcumin as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition. Categories of Curcumin-type Products The materials that have received the moniker curcumin may be divided into five categories: It is important to note that materials often referred to as curcumin are not identical to the pure, single-chemical entity. Because of the deficiency in the adequate chemical characterization of the immense diversity of crude turmeric (T), extracts (CE), enriched materials (CTE, CEM), and even materials considered pure, augmented by the fact that the materials often share the same name (curcumin), the usefulness of the biological data acquired from the plethora of these preparations is questionable.[ This summary refers to all turmeric-derived intervention materials by using the collective term, curcumin-containing products. Tables at the end of each section specify the exact intervention material used in each cited study. References: Extensive research over the past two decades suggests that curcuminoids belonging to the diferuloylmethane class of natural products, the major constituents in turmeric (Curcuma longa), interfere with multiple cell signaling pathways, which provides support for the potential role of curcumin in modulating carcinogenesis. These pathways include the following:[ While these reports can possibly provide support for the potential role of curcumin-containing products in modulating carcinogenesis, definitive conclusions cannot be made, especially in light of the widespread confusion and/or misconception regarding the chemical nature of curcumin-containing products outlined above. Because of the abundance of in vitro and preclinical studies in the past two decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of clinical trials investigating the therapeutic potential of curcumin-containing products. These clinical trials have used varying formulations and doses of curcuminoids for the prevention and treatment of cancer and to ameliorate symptoms of cancer treatment. This summary will focus on the bioavailability, safety, and effectiveness of curcumin-containing products reported in clinical trials that targeted individuals at high risk of cancer and cancer patients for the prevention and treatment of cancer and ameliorating the symptoms of cancer treatment. References: Bioavailability of Curcumin-Containing Products (Phase I Clinical Trials) At least six phase I clinical trials of curcumin -containing products have investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pure curcumin (CUR) alone in humans. These studies have shown that systemic exposure to curcumin-containing products at doses of up to 8,000 mg /day was safe and tolerable and did not cause serious adverse events. In these studies, the peak serum concentrations ranged from 47 ng/mL (at a dose of 200 mg of oral curcumin daily) to 1,380 ng/mL (at a dose of 8,000 mg of oral curcumin daily).[ These concentrations refer to total curcumin, meaning that studies do not differentiate between free (unconjugated) curcumin and curcumin conjugated with glucuronic acid or sulfate. Conjugated curcumin is the more abundant metabolite in circulation. While studies indicate that conjugated curcumin is less bioactive than free curcumin, there are also indications for the enzymatic release of free curcumin from the conjugated forms at sites of inflammation.[ The assessment of curcuminoid bioavailability, including that of CUR, is confounded by the pronounced metabolic and (photo)chemical instability of these compounds. Because of the varying preparations, formulations, and doses of intervention materials tested in the phase I clinical trials, it is unclear which curcumin-containing products and doses of CUR and/or other constituents of Curcuma longa are required to produce a clinically significant modulation of biomarkers or even clinical outcomes. The general consensus that the plasma levels of CUR required to achieve any biological effects in patients are much higher than what has been observed clinically to date. Studies have directly compared the bioavailability of unformulated curcumin-containing preparations with CUR that is formulated for enhanced bioavailability. These studies have consistently shown an increase in plasma levels using formulated CUR; however, these levels are still relatively low and do not exceed therapeutically insufficient concentrations.[ |Source||Description of single-chemical entity; TE =turmeric extract.| |a For a more detailed definition of these terms, see the General Information and Historysection.| |[ ||Standardized turmeric extract formulated incapsules(curcumin C3 complex); each contained 450 mg of curcumin, 30 mg of demethoxycurcumin, and 20 mg of bisdemethoxycurcumin||Sabinsa Corp.

(Taiwan)||CUR| Cancer Prevention and Treatment of Precancerous Lesions Investigations into products that may aid in the prevention of cancer and the treatment of precancerous lesions are important for the development of early intervention strategies and treatments. A few studies have investigated the potential clinical benefit of curcumin -containing products, and other studies are under way. See ClinicalTrials.gov. Colorectal Cancer Researchers have explored curcumin's potential in curcumin-containing products for the prevention of colon cancer through its effects on precancerous lesions. Published results (curcumin-containing product for prevention of colon cancer): Head and Neck Cancer Treatment of patients with oral leukoplakia using a curcumin-containing product was investigated in a randomized trial.[ Published results (curcumin-containing product to treat oral leukoplakia): Multiple Myeloma The effect of a curcumin-containing product was investigated in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering multiple myeloma ( SMM). Published results (effectiveness of curcumin-containing product on MGUS and SMM): Hepatoma (Liver Cancer) The efficacy and safety of curcumin-containing products have been studied in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Published results (effectiveness of curcumin-containing product on NAFLD): Based on these findings, the authors suggested that curcumin-containing products, at higher dosages, might have a favorable effect on patients with NAFLD.[ |Source||Description of Curcuminoid-Containing Product||Supplier||Type of liquidchromatography; TE = turmericextract.| |a For a more detailed definition of these terms, see the General Information and Historysection.| |[ ||Curcumin-containing product (480 mg) and quercetin (20 |[ ||Curcumin-containing product, reconstituted with turmeric oil and mg of curcuminoids (3,600 mg of curcumin [CUR], 320 mg of demethoxycurcumin, and 80 mg of bisdemethoxycurcumin)||Sabinsa Corp.

In cancer research, there are different types of cancer biomarkers. Prognostic biomarkers determine the likely outcome of the disease and if further treatment is warranted and predictive biomarkers ascertain the likelihood the disease will respond to treatment.[ Five clinical studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of supplementation with curcumin -containing products on predictive biomarkers in patients with different types of cancer. Various biomarkers from these studies were evaluated as potential efficacy measures to ascertain the usefulness of curcumin-containing products alone and as an adjunctive therapy. Different curcumin-containing products were used. Curcuminoid doses used in these studies ranged from 20 mg/day to 3,000 mg/day. One of the studies did not identify the amount of curcuminoids administered, but used 5 g of turmeric powder dissolved in 150 mL of milk 3 times/day.[ The main biomarkers used in these studies were serum levels of the following: Results from four of the studies indicated an association between a positive change in a biomarker and patient outcome as follows: However, another study found no statistically significant difference between comparison groups when accounting for the observed biomarker, PGE2.[ Another study conducted using a proprietary lecithin delivery system of a curcumin-containing product (500 mg tablet) given 3 times/day found that curcumin-containing product supplementation consistently improved oxidative status in patients who received chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[ Curcumin-Containing Products Alone A few case reports have been published that suggest a possible antitumor effect of curcumin-containing products. Published results (possible antitumor effect of curcumin-containing product): Given that this disease is known to frequently undergo spontaneous involution, the therapeutic activity of the curcumin-containing product in this case should be questioned; however, the authors of the report indicated that this patient's tumor had some signs that suggested an adverse prognosis. Imatinib and Curcumin-Containing Products Imatinib and curcumin-containing products have been studied in patients with metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). Published results (treatment of metastatic ACC with imatinib and a curcumin-containing product): Given the known activity of imatinib against c-kit-positive tumors, the contribution of curcumin-containing products to the efficacy of this patient's treatment regimen is unclear. Docetaxel and Curcumin-Containing Products Two studies have explored the efficacy, tolerability, and feasibility of docetaxel plus curcumin-containing products in the treatment of cancer.[ Published results (efficacy of docetaxel and a curcumin-containing product): A multicenter, phase II, randomized, double-blind study was initiated at the same institution in France and compared docetaxel plus a curcumin-containing product with docetaxel plus placebo in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The study was terminated for futility in view of results from the interim analysis (NCT02095717). Gemcitabine and Curcumin-Containing Products Three studies investigated the efficacy and safety of variable formulations and doses of curcumin-containing products in combination with gemcitabine. All studies administered gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 IV weekly for 3 of 4 weeks, but differed in rate of gemcitabine administration. Two research studies of first-line treatment in patients with advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer (PC) showed differing results in tolerability and toxicity profiles. Published results (gemcitabine and a curcumin-containing product): The authors concluded that this combination of curcumin-containing products and gemcitabine is not feasible in this population of patients. FOLFOX and Curcumin-Containing Products A group from the United Kingdom conducted a combined phase I dose-escalation study and a phase IIA study of oral daily curcumin-containing products with folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) (CUFOX) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to assess safety, tolerability, and a suitable dose of curcumin.[ Published results (FOLFOX antigen.| |a For information aboutlevels of evidenceanalysis and scores, see Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.| |[ 24 were toxicity and 21 were evaluable for response||No treatment-related toxicities were observed; one patient remained stable for >18 months and another patient had a dramatic but brief tumor response||2Dii| |[ ||Phase dose-limiting toxicities were observed and 2 of 3 patients at these dose levels refused to continue treatment||2C| |[ ||Randomized, phase II||Castration-resistant prostate cancer||Docetaxel||N = 50; 24 patients received placebo and docetaxel and 26 patients received docetaxel and curcumin||No difference locally advanced and 11 metastatic||Median time to tumor progression was 2.5 mo||2Diii| |[ trial||Locally advanced and metastatic 13 locally advanced and 34 metastatic||Partial response in 27.3% of patients and stable 2 patients received gemcitabinemonotherapy||Phase I study outcome showed safety of oral curcumin-containing product.

However, because of the higher baseline QOL values in the placebo group when compared with the curcuminoid group, it is difficult to interpret these results. |Source||Description of Curcuminoid-Containing Product||Supplier||Type of Producta| |CEM = further processed curcuminoid-enriched materials.| |a For a more detailed definition of these terms, see the General Information and Historysection.| |[ ||Phytosomal preparation of curcuminoids||Meriva; Indena S.p.A, (Milan, Side Effects effects of curcumin -containing products on radiation-induced dermatitis were investigated in three studies.[ Published results (curcumin-containing products in the treatment of radiation-induced dermatitis): Mucositis Several studies evaluated the tolerability and efficacy of a curcuminoid-containing product by oral application (mouthwash) in the treatment of oral mucositis.[ Published results (curcuminoid-containing products in the treatment of oral mucositis): Multiple Effects A proprietary lecithin delivery system of a curcuminoid-containing product given 3 times/day (500 mg tablet) was evaluated in a controlled study to assess its efficacy in alleviating the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in patients undergoing these treatments 1 month after surgery for their cancer (N = 160; 80 patients each in the chemotherapy group and the radiation therapy group). These groups were further divided into experimental and control groups, with 40 patients in each subgroup receiving Meriva or a comparable placebo tablet. In both the chemotherapy and radiation therapy groups, frequency and severity of reported symptoms were significantly lower in the Meriva group and no significant changes were reported in the control group.[ |Reference||Trial Design||Conditionor Cancer Type||Treatment Groups |RCT = randomized controlled trial.| |a For information about levels of evidence analysis and scores, see Levels of Evidence for Human Studies of Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies.| |[ ||RCT||Radiation dermatitis = turmericextract; w/w = weight per weight.| |a For a more detailed definition of these terms, see the General Information and Historysection.| |[ complex), turmeric, andgingerdissolved (Maharashtra, India)||TE| |[ ||Turmeric powder, 400 mg suspended in 80 mL water (use of 10 mL for mouthwash)||Himalaya Drug Company (Bangalore, India)||T| |[ ||SinaCurcumin (nanocurcumin)||Nanotechnology Research Mashhad Science (Iran)||Undefined| |[ ||Turmeric extract capsules containing essential oils of Natural, Aluva (India)||TE| References: Most clinical studies of curcuma-containing products have demonstrated few, if any, associated adverse effects.
