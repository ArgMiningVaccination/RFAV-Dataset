When removing distractions we become more familiar with the working of our minds and of the particular negative habits that create needless stress for us (worry, annoyance, dissatisfaction, unhappiness, jealousy, the inner critic, etc.) When shining the light of awareness on these habits, they naturally recede and weaken and in their place the positive habits of mind grow (love, kindness, compassion, gratitude, happiness, self-respect and appreciation). On this 6-night retreat you will be guided in mindfulness of the mind and body and encouraged to practice being aware of all you do throughout the day. \"The whole path of mindfulness is this: whatever you are doing, be aware of it.\" -Dipa Ma Schedule: Arrival and Checkin 2-4pm Ends 11am (please be checked out of your cabin by 12pm) COVID Requirements ( [read more]): -Proof of full vaccination + boost -Proof of negative covid PCR test within 3 days prior to arrival -Masks Optional To offer or join a ride share, click Sign-Up to the left.
