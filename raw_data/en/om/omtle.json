Click here to learn more about IV therapy and how it can help boost your overall health. IV Nutrient Therapy delivers vitamins, nutrients, and other treatments directly into the bloodstream. The IV route of administration provides 100 percent bioavailability, unlike oral-based therapies that only absorb about 50% in your system. With 100 percent bioavailability, you experience the full effects of the treatment. IV Nutrient Therapy has been used to treat any number of physical conditions where some degree of chemical imbalance exists. Cutler Integrative Medicine's naturopathic approach works seamlessly with IV Nutrient Therapy, so you can expect to experience noticeable results in your health. IV Nutrient Therapy, also called intravenous therapy, delivers medications, nutrition, and fluids directly into your veins via a hypodermic needle or external tubing. In cases of dehydration, malnutrition, or even a vitamin/nutrient boost, IV therapy offers the most direct route of administration. With oral and topical methods, bioavailability may be compromised compared to IV therapy. Bioavailability has to do with how much of the administered agent gets absorbed and distributed throughout the body. Intravenous therapy goes directly into your blood circulation, which guarantees 100 percent bioavailability. Chemical imbalances in the body tend to have a ripple effect when left untreated. One vitamin or nutrient deficiency can jeopardize any number of bodily functions, depending on how essential it is.
