Treat the Person Instead of the Disease One of Winston's top herbal recommendations is to treat the person instead of the disease. What does this mean? Looking at the diet, lifestyle, sleep, community, and spirituality of a person to figure out what is out of balance. From there, it's much more effective to target and treat the imbalance. Each of us is made differently, so our treatment should be specialized. So the more you can match the energetics of the herb to the energetics of the person, the more successful you'll find treatment. Here are a few herbs that Winston recommends to help relieve occasional anxiety and low mood, plus a few brain boosting herbs.

It is more well-known for its use in nerve relief and is best used for GI-based SAD and Hepatic depressions. Melatonin [Melatonin](https://store.lifespa.com/product/liquid-melatonin-3mg-2/) from sunlight helps fuel our bodies with energy for the day, helping us access rest at night. Most Americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors, not getting enough melatonin. If you're not getting enough melatonin during the day it can lead to poor sleep, which then directly effects your body, mind, and mood negatively.

(It is contraindicated for bipolar disorder.) Mimosa bark combined with hawthorn berries and flowers, and organic rose petals is the best combination for occasional anxiety and low mood, specifically stagnant depression. Nootropic Herbs Nootropic herbs are known to boost cognitive function, specifically attention, memory, and mood. These herbs can ultimately aid in balancing occasional anxiety and low mood as well.
