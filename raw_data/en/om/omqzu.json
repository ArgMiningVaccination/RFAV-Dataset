However, honey bee colonies have been experiencing heavy overwinter mortality in almost all parts of the world. In the present study we have investigatd, for the first time, the effects from the application of the herbal supplements NOZEMAT HERB\u00ae (NH) and NOZEMAT HERB PLUS\u00ae (NHP) on overwintering honey bee colony survival and on total protein and lysozyme content. To achieve this, in early autumn 2019, 45 colonies were selected and treated with these herbal supplements. The total protein and lysozyme content were evaluated after administration of NH and NHP twice the following year (June and September 2020). The obtained results have shown that both supplements have a positive effect on overwintering colony survival. Considerable enhancement in longevity of \"winter bees\" has been observed after the application of NHP, possibly due to the increased functionality of the immune system and antioxidant detoxification capacity. Although the mechanisms of action of NH and NHP are yet to be completely elucidated, our results suggest a new holistic approach on overwintering honey bee colony survival and welfare.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-05-23", "cleaned_text": "Application of the Natural Products NOZEMAT HERB and NOZEMAT HERB PLUS Can Decrease Honey Bee Colonies Losses during the Winter [https://doi.org/10.3390/d13060228](https://doi.org/10.3390/d13060228) [Genetic Diversity and Conservation in Pollinators]( /journal/diversity/special_issues/Genetic_Pollinators )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-diversity-13-00228)]. Moreover, many honey bee products have nutraceutical significance, which makes them invaluable to human health and wealth [ [2](#B2-diversity-13-00228), [3](#B3-diversity-13-00228)]. [4](#B4-diversity-13-00228)]. The highest winter losses (32.0%) were detected in Slovenia, while Bulgaria revealed the lowest loss rate (5.8%). In Serbia the loss rate for winter 2018/19 was 25.4%, followed by Spain, Croatia, Iran, Greece, and Portugal, where winter colony losses were between 20% and 25%. In addition, moderate winter losses were recorded in Scotland and Italy (18.9% and 16.5%, respectively) within this survey [ [4](#B4-diversity-13-00228)]. 1.1. Queen Bee Management [5](#B5-diversity-13-00228), [6](#B6-diversity-13-00228)]. The age of the queen bees going into winter is important for winter colony survival [ [7](#B7-diversity-13-00228), [8](#B8-diversity-13-00228)]. It has been observed that honey bee colony mortality during the winter decreases with an increase in the percentage of young queens [ [4](#B4-diversity-13-00228), [9](#B9-diversity-13-00228), [10](#B10-diversity-13-00228)]. Additionally, queen problems, mainly during the summer, such as young queens failing, superseded queens, queens \"disappearing\", queen introduction, etc., increase the probability of overwinter colony loss [ [9](#B9-diversity-13-00228), [10](#B10-diversity-13-00228), [11](#B11-diversity-13-00228)]. 1.2. Beekeeping Management Practices [6](#B6-diversity-13-00228), [12](#B12-diversity-13-00228), [13](#B13-diversity-13-00228)]. has been found that migratory beekeeping, compared to non-migrating operations, reduced winter colony losses [ [10](#B10-diversity-13-00228), [14](#B14-diversity-13-00228)]. The main reasons for this are that migratory beekeepers have more experience and migrated colonies have access to better foraging sources. Another, very important factor for honey bee health turns out to be the origin of the beeswax used in the beekeeping operation. It has been observed that beekeepers who have purchased wax outside from their apiary registered a higher winter loss rate compared to beekeepers using only their own beeswax [ [10](#B10-diversity-13-00228)]. It has been found that beeswax, as a natural honey bee product, can accumulate various pesticides, honey bee-associated viruses, American foulbrood spores, veterinary drug residues, etc. [ [15](#B15-diversity-13-00228), [16](#B16-diversity-13-00228), [17](#B17-diversity-13-00228)]. The presence of pesticides in beeswax poses a serious threat to bee colonies survival during the winter; therefore beeswax is usually heat-treated, which eliminates the various pathogens contained in it. A trend for lower winter losses has been observed when about 30% of old brood frames were replaced with new ones [ [10](#B10-diversity-13-00228)]. [18](#B18-diversity-13-00228), [19](#B19-diversity-13-00228)], greater losses of bee colonies should be expected. On the other hand, certificated organic apiaries are usually located in isolated places, which reduces the possibility of various pathogens affecting bee colonies, compared to conventional beekeeping. The results of the conducted studies so far have not reflected a significant difference regarding winter bee losses in organic and nonorganic beekeeping, which requires further research in this direction. 1.3. Forage Sources as a Risk Factor for Honey Bee Winter Losses [20](#B20-diversity-13-00228), [21](#B21-diversity-13-00228)]. It has been found that certain forage sources can have a significant effect on honey bee winter survival. For example, there is direct evidence that maize is not a suitable forage source for honey bees [ [22](#B22-diversity-13-00228), [23](#B23-diversity-13-00228)]. The main reason for this is, presumably, the accumulation of pesticides in the collected pollen or guttation water during treatment of maize fields, which may lead to chronic pesticide exposure, higher loss rate, and hence, reduced winter bee survival [ [22](#B22-diversity-13-00228), [24](#B24-diversity-13-00228)]. As maize is one of the main crops in the world, this problem can persist for many years [ [25](#B25-diversity-13-00228)]. [23](#B23-diversity-13-00228), [26](#B26-diversity-13-00228), [27](#B27-diversity-13-00228)], while in others such have not been reported, even in case of treatment of sunflower seeds with insecticides [ [28](#B28-diversity-13-00228)]. Therefore, the question of the impact of sunflowers on winter colony losses remains unresolved. The oilseed rape is a suitable food source for bees not only because of the large amount of nectar and pollen, but because it blooms in spring and is the first major food source. Unfortunately, this crop, like maize, poses a danger to bees, as it is usually treated with various insecticides [ [29](#B29-diversity-13-00228), [30](#B30-diversity-13-00228)]. [23](#B23-diversity-13-00228)]. There is also an increased risk of weakening the colonies and higher winter losses. [31](#B31-diversity-13-00228), [32](#B32-diversity-13-00228)]. The problem of using melezitose as a food source is related, on the one hand, to the difficult removing of melezitose honey from the comb cells, and on the other hand, to the fact that bees are able to absorb a very small part of it in comparison with sucrose [ [33](#B33-diversity-13-00228)]. This can lead to significant nutritional stress when overwintering. 1.4. Role of Pathogens on Honey Bee Winter Losses [34](#B34-diversity-13-00228), [35](#B35-diversity-13-00228), [36](#B36-diversity-13-00228)]. A number of different techniques of treating bee colonies have been developed to prevent the devastating losses caused by V. destructor. These include the use of natural compounds such as formic acid [ [37](#B37-diversity-13-00228)], oxalic acid [ [38](#B38-diversity-13-00228)], beta acids from hops (Humulus lupulus) [ [39](#B39-diversity-13-00228)], and essential oils (thymol) [ [40](#B40-diversity-13-00228)]. Other approaches are associated with physical methods\u2014drone brood removal, screened bottom board and powdered sugar [ [41](#B41-diversity-13-00228)], or reducing pest reproduction-mite-resistant colonies selection, small-hexagon cell comb and brood break [ [42](#B42-diversity-13-00228)]. Finally, for chemical control of Varroa mites, various synthetic acaricides/miticides (amitraz, flumethrin and coumaphos) are used [ [43](#B43-diversity-13-00228), [44](#B44-diversity-13-00228)]. The disadvantages of the administration of these compounds include the risk of residue accumulation in the beeswax [ [45](#B45-diversity-13-00228), [46](#B46-diversity-13-00228)] and Varroa mite cross-resistance to acaricides [ [35](#B35-diversity-13-00228), [47](#B47-diversity-13-00228)]. In order to control V. destructor infestation and reduce bee losses in winter, it is important to consider during which period the bee colonies will be treated and which of the above methods will be chosen. In this regard, it has been found that summer treatments with formic acid in August or with Thymovar in July and in warm Augusts, or with Apilife (thymol) in July and Apivar (amitraz) between July and September can lead to low honey bee colony losses [ [35](#B35-diversity-13-00228)]. Additionally, oxalic acid application in December is also recommended. Removal of the drone brood in April has been associated with reduced colony losses as well [ [35](#B35-diversity-13-00228)]. [48](#B48-diversity-13-00228), [49](#B49-diversity-13-00228), [50](#B50-diversity-13-00228), [51](#B51-diversity-13-00228)]. For example, two long-term studies carried out in Germany and USA have shown that IAPV (Israeli acute paralysis virus) and ABPV (Acute bee paralysis virus) are involved in winter colony losses [ [52](#B52-diversity-13-00228), [53](#B53-diversity-13-00228)]. In Switzerland, it has been observed that ABPV and DWV (Deformed wing virus), vectored by V. destructor, are related to winter mortality [ [54](#B54-diversity-13-00228)]. In Southern England, a 1-year-long survey of colonies treated against Varroa mites has reported multiple virus infections\u2014DWV, ABPV and BQCV (Black queen cell virus), with a significant correlation observed between DWV infestation and overwinter colony losses [ [55](#B55-diversity-13-00228)]. Another survey in Poland has revealed severe to moderate winter colony losses related to co-infection with DWV, ABPV, BQCV, CBPV (Chronic bee paralysis SBV virus), V. destructor and N. ceranae infestation [ [56](#B56-diversity-13-00228)]. Increased overwinter mortality has been observed in Belgium, the main reason for this being the co-infection with ABPV and CBPV, transmitted by V. destructor and SBV, taking into account that ABPV had a significant and profound effect [ [34](#B34-diversity-13-00228)]. [57](#B57-diversity-13-00228), [58](#B58-diversity-13-00228)], individual pathogens and pesticides, V. destructor and associated viruses and neonicotinoids [ [63](#B63-diversity-13-00228), [64](#B64-diversity-13-00228)], or combinations of pesticides, e.g., insecticides and fungicides [ [65](#B65-diversity-13-00228), [66](#B66-diversity-13-00228)]. 1.5. Effects from the Application of Herbal Supplements on Biochemical and Immunological Parameters in Honey Bee Haemolymph [67](#B67-diversity-13-00228)]. Another study has shown that the application of piperine [(E,E)-5-(3,4-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-2,4-pentadienoylpiperidide, 1-Piperoylpiperidine] (3 g/mL) dissolved in sugar syrup at a ratio of 1:1 can increase the antioxidative activity of enzymes such as (GST) [ [68](#B68-diversity-13-00228)]. The authors have concluded that the natural supplement pepirine improved the health status of honey bees and increased their resistance against various stress factors. Similar results have been obtained after administration of an artificial diet including a pollen substitute, applied as a cake, supplemented with vitamin C [ [69](#B69-diversity-13-00228)]. The authors observed higher activities of SOD and catalase CAT as well as higher levels of glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in bee colonies fed with this supplemental diet. On the basis of the obtained results, they have suggested that the supplemental winter feeding can significantly improve colony development and health during overwintering. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental Design 2.2. Evaluation of Food Consumption and Bee Mortality - (1) - The amount of food consumption from the bee colony during the winter\u2014this parameter was evaluated based on the difference between the amount of honey during wintering and the amount of honey in the first clinical examination of honey bee colonies, following standard norms (Conditions and procedure for performance of selection and reproduction activities in beekeeping ORDINANCE No. 35, 2004, issued by The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, [https://www.mzh.government.bg/en/](https://www.mzh.government.bg/en/), accessed on 15 May 2021) ( [Table 1](#diversity-13-00228-t001)). The amount of the consumed food was added to the amount of the honey-sugar paste which bees used in the winter. Food consumption per unit of bees was evaluated according to the following formula:M = C/0.5 \u00d7 (A + B) [70](#B70-diversity-13-00228)]. [71](#B71-diversity-13-00228)]. - (2) - Bee mortality (winter colony losses %)\u2014the difference between the strength of the bee colony in the autumn and in the spring (Conditions and procedure for performance of selection and reproduction activities in beekeeping ORDINANCE No. 35, 2004, issued by The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry ( [https://www.mzh.government.bg/en/](https://www.mzh.government.bg/en/), accessed on 15 May 2021) ( [Table 2](#diversity-13-00228-t002)). This parameter was evaluated according to the following formula:P = (A B)/A \u00d7 100 2.3. Evaluation of Total Protein and Lysozyme Content in the Bee Haemolymph [71](#B71-diversity-13-00228)]. [72](#B72-diversity-13-00228)]. [73](#B73-diversity-13-00228)]. 2.4. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. Effect of the Herbal Supplements NH and NHP on Overwitering Food Consumption and Bee Mortality 3.1.1. Overwintering Food Consumption [Table 3](#diversity-13-00228-t003). The values of this parameter were assessed according to the Conditions and procedure for performance of selection and reproduction activities in beekeeping ORDINANCE No. 35, 2004, issued by The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry ( [https://www.mzh.government.bg/en/](https://www.mzh.government.bg/en/), accessed on 15 May 2021) ( [Table 1](#diversity-13-00228-t001)). The quantity of honey in the first clinical examination of honey bee colonies in NH (3.42 \u00b1 0.27 kg) and NHP (3.24 \u00b1 0.14 kg) groups was significantly higher, compared to the control C group (0.48 \u00b1 0.27 kg) (F = 37.153, df = 18, = 0.001, p < 0.01; F = 33.841, df = 18, p = 0.001, p < 0.01, respectively). These results indicate that the application of both herbal supplements significantly reduces the amount of food consumed in winter. Bee colonies fed with NH consumed significantly less food overwintering than those fed with NHP (F = 5.469, df = 28, p = 0.026, p < 0.05). The indicator of total amount of consumed food shows a similar dependence between the control and the NH and NHP groups. The bee colonies from the control C group (9.67 \u00b1 0.19 kg) consumed significantly more food, approximately 30% and 20% more, compared to the NH (6.76 \u00b1 0.30 kg) and the NHP group (7.07 \u00b1 0.14 kg) (F = 36.339, df = 23, p = 0.001, p < 0.01; F = 38.615, df = 23, p = 0.001, p < 0.01, respectively). In addition, there was a significant difference in the total amount of food consumed in bee colonies treated with NH compared to those treated with NHP (F = 13.382, df = 18, p = 0.001, p < 0.01). Finally, the calculated consumed food per one frame of bees in the NH (1.29 \u00b1 0.01 kg) and the NHP group (1.38 \u00b1 0.09 kg) was significantly less than that in the control C group (2.08 \u00b1 0.19 kg) (F = 23.396, df = 18, p = 0.001, p < 0.01; F = 17.688, df = 18, p = 0.001, p < 0.01, respectively). The bee colonies treated with NH consumed about 7% less food than those treated with NHP (F = 13.741, df = 18, p = 0.009, p < 0.01). The obtained results regarding the parameter of consumed food per one frame of bees in the NH and NHP groups indicate good wintering in these bee colonies, according to the classification proposed by the Conditions and procedure for performance of selection and reproduction activities in beekeeping ORDINANCE No. 35, 2004, issued by The Bulgarianm Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry ( [https://www.mzh.government.bg/en/](https://www.mzh.government.bg/en/), accessed on 15 May 2021) ( [Table 1](#diversity-13-00228-t001)). The value of this parameter in the control C group (2.08 \u00b1 0.19 kg) indicates bad wintering in these bee colonies. Our results show that the use of either herbal supplement is associated with much lower food consumption in overwintering bee colonies, and the use of NH is more appropriate than the application of NHP. 3.1.2. Overwintering Colony Losses [Figure 1](#diversity-13-00228-f001). The honey bee colony losses were evaluated according to the Conditions and procedure for performance of selection and reproduction activities in beekeeping ORDINANCE No. 35, 2004, issued by The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry ( [https://www.mzh.government.bg/en/](https://www.mzh.government.bg/en/), accessed on 15 May 2021) ( [Table 2](#diversity-13-00228-t002)). The control C group showed very significant differences when compared to the NH and NHP groups. The percent of very bad wintering of honey bee colonies (40%) was rather high and observed only in the control group. The percent of good wintering of honey bee colonies was the highest in the NHP group (53%), compared to the control C (20%) and the NH (44%) group. The highest percentage of very good wintering bee colonies was observed in the NH group (56%). Surprisingly, the bad wintering colonies in the NHP group (27%) were slightly higher than those in the control group (20%). There were no bad wintering colonies in the NH group ( [Figure 1](#diversity-13-00228-f001)). The obtained results give us a reason to conclude that NH has a positive effect on the successful overwintering of bee colonies. Unlike NH, the other herbal supplement, NHP, has shown a lower effect on the overwintering honey bee colonies, as the obtained results in terms of bad and very good wintering bee colonies in this group are similar to those in the control C group ( [Figure 1](#diversity-13-00228-f001)). 3.2. Effect of Herbal Supplements on Total Protein and Lysozyme Content in the Bee Haemolymph 3.2.1. Influence of the Herbal Supplements NH and NHP on the Total Protein Content in the Bee Haemolymph [Figure 2](#diversity-13-00228-f002)). The obtained results of the values of this parameter in June 2020 showed higher protein content in the NH group (77.25 \u00b1 8.79 g/L) and the NHP group (73.10 6.28 g/L) (F = 6.285, = 0.054; F = 1.274, df = 6, p = 0.310, respectively), but the differences were not statistically significant. During the second investigation (September 2020), a decrease in the values of this indicator was observed more than twice in all three experimental groups. Then, the protein content remaind the highest in the NH group (35.34 g/L) group (F = 0.097, df = 6, p = 0.785; F = 0.073, df = 6, p = 0.803, respectively). Similar to the study in June 2020, in September 2020 no significant differences were found between the three experimental groups with regard to protein content in the bee haemolymph. Notable differences in relation to this indicator were established when comparing the results from June with those obtained in September. In the autumn the protein content in the NH group decreased significantly more, by over 50% (from 77.25 \u00b1 = 26.502, df = 6, p = 0.006, p < 0.01). Compared to July 2020 (73.10 \u00b1 10.55 g/L), the protein content of NHP group decreased significantly more, by 58% in \u00b1 13.01 g/L) = 9.373, df = 6, p = 0.037, p < 0.05), while in the control C group the decrease was about 50% (ANOVA with Tukey's HSD post hoc test F = 7.968, df = 6, p = 0.048, p < 0.05). [Figure 2](#diversity-13-00228-f002)). 3.2.2. Influence of the Herbal Supplements NH and NHP on Lysozyme Content in the Bee Haemolymph [Figure 3](#diversity-13-00228-f003)). In June 2020, the NHP group (0.56 \u00b1 0.23 mg/L) showed significantly higher values of this parameter compared to the control C group (0.20 \u00b1 0.7 mg/L) and the NH group (0.09 \u00b1 0.3 mg/L) (F = 6.415, df = 6, = 0.044, p < 0.05; F = 15.938, df = 6, p = 0.005, p < 0.01, respectively). The obtained results from the first application of the herbal supplements show a significant effect of NHP on the lysozyme content in the bee haemolymph compared to NH. It is interesting to note that during the second investigation (September 2020) the value of the lysozyme content in the NH group (0.18 \u00b1 0.8 mg/L) increased twofold compared to the previous measurement (F = 4.401, df = 6, p = 0.090); however, the differences were not statistically significant. A slight increase was also observed in the control C group (0.25 \u00b1 0.5 mg/L) (F = 0.924, df = 6, p = 0.390), while the lysozyme decreased in the \u00b1 0.11 (F = 0.243, df = 6, p = 0.642). Despite an observed decrease in the lysozyme content in September 2020 compared to its first administration in June 2020, the lysozyme values in the NHP group in the autumn maintained higher levels compared to the NH and the control C groups (F = 11.172, df = 6, p = 0.044, p < 0.05; F = 9.902, df = 6, p = 0.051, respectively). [Figure 3](#diversity-13-00228-f003)). 4. Discussion [74](#B74-diversity-13-00228)]. The obtained results in the present study have clearly demonstrated the positive effect from the application of NH and NHP on overwintering honey bee colony survival, and in this respect NH appears to be more efficient ( [Figure 1](#diversity-13-00228-f001)). We have found that after the application of the two herbal supplements the percentage of good wintering bee colonies was 53% in the NHP and 43% in the NH group, while in the control C group it was only 20%. Moreover, we have observed an extremely high percentage of very good wintering bee colonies in the NH group (56%), as after the application of the two herbal supplements no bee losses were found. [75](#B75-diversity-13-00228)]. Another study has revealed that the application of chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla), added to sugar feeding, enhances the survival of honey bee colonies [ [76](#B76-diversity-13-00228)]. The application of 75% ethanol Eleutherococcus senticosus root extract in a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL in sucrose solution in late summer significantly increases honey bee winter survival [ [77](#B77-diversity-13-00228)]. It has been shown that the major antioxidant in green tea (Camellia sinensis)\u2014epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG, natural antioxidant) has a positive effect on honey bee survival [ [78](#B78-diversity-13-00228)]. A three-year field experiment has demonstrated the beneficial effect of the application of the medicinal mushroom Agaricus brasiliensis extract, which helps to maintain strong colonies when overwintering [ [79](#B79-diversity-13-00228)]. Many more examples can be given about the positive effect of plant extracts on overwintering honey bee colony health and survival, but the main question that arises is: what are the active substances in these plants that mediate a positive effect on bee colonies? [80](#B80-diversity-13-00228), [81](#B81-diversity-13-00228), [82](#B82-diversity-13-00228)]. Phenolics and flavonoids are commonly known as the largest phytochemical molecules with antioxidant properties from plants, which may prevent the degenerative effect (oxidative stress) from unbalanced concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [ [83](#B83-diversity-13-00228), [84](#B84-diversity-13-00228), [85](#B85-diversity-13-00228)]. Different researchers have confirmed the antibacterial activity of plant-derived compounds such as flavonoids, hydroxycinnamic, acids and their esters [ [86](#B86-diversity-13-00228), [87](#B87-diversity-13-00228), [88](#B88-diversity-13-00228)]. Finally, there is strong evidence that some phenolic compounds (p-coumaric acid) upregulate both detoxification genes and immunity genes. Bees consuming p-coumaric acid within their diet were capable of 60% higher rates of metabolism of the organophosphate acaricide [ [89](#B89-diversity-13-00228)]. Moreover, it has been observed that multiple flavonoids and phenolic acids upregulate the P450 genes encoding key detoxification enzymes in adults honey bees, including CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, and CYP9Q3, of lysozyme in the bee haemolymph was most strongly affected after the application of NHP ( [Figure 3](#diversity-13-00228-f003)). [93](#B93-diversity-13-00228)]. Hygienic behavior is a very important physiological mechanism of honeybee workers to prevent the spreading of various pathogens over the honeybee brood [ [94](#B94-diversity-13-00228)]. [95](#B95-diversity-13-00228), [96](#B96-diversity-13-00228)]. The longevity of \"winter bees\" is very important for honey bee winter survival, because these bees regulate colony temperature and initiate brood rearing at the winter's end, when this generation is replaced by a new summer generation [ [97](#B97-diversity-13-00228)]. One of the biochemical markers associated with longevity in \"winter bees\" is the content of proteins in the haemolymph, i.e., these bees have higher protein content compared to \"summer bees\" [ [96](#B96-diversity-13-00228)]. As the functions of the cellular part of the immune system in long-living bees are limited, honey bees have to rely on the humoral part of the immune system during the winter period. This is associated with higher expression of antimicrobial genes, such as apidaecin, hymenoptaecin, and abaecin, or antibacterial such as lysozyme content in haemolymph [ [98](#B98-diversity-13-00228), [99](#B99-diversity-13-00228)]. Moreover, this increase in antibacterial activity correlates with higher protein levels in honey bee haemolymph in the winter. Regarding cellular immunity, it has been suggested that haemocyte (involved in the phagocytosis and encapsulation of parasites) concentration is associated with diet diversity [ [100](#B100-diversity-13-00228)]. According to these authors, considering that the nitrogen content was equal in mono- and polyfloral diets, additional minor components such as vitamins, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids, as well as essential amino acids in mixed pollen might be the main reason for enhanced cellular immunity. [101](#B101-diversity-13-00228)]. Vitamin C acts as a reducing agent, capable of rapidly scavenging a number of ROS and RSN species and providing an important antioxidant protection [ [102](#B102-diversity-13-00228)]. Therefore, the effect of supplementing honey bee diet with vitamin C (ascorbic acid) during overwintering has been studied as well [ [103](#B103-diversity-13-00228)]. It has been observed that feeding of honey bee colonies with water syrup (3:1) supplemented with vitamin C in the beginning of September is associated with lower winter mortality of bees, higher contents of protein, total antioxidant status (TAS), glutathione, and antioxidative enzyme (peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione transferase) activity in worker bees emerging in spring. These results suggest that vitamin C can be recommended as a natural, safe, and relatively cheap diet supplement, elevating the resistance to stress factors (including diseases in which oxidative stress plays a key role) affecting wintering bees and spring generations of worker bees [ [103](#B103-diversity-13-00228)]. [Figure 3](#diversity-13-00228-f003)), as well as their increased antioxidant defense capacity due to the additional inclusion of vitamin C. These assumptions are further supported by the established high percentage of good wintering honey bee colonies ( [Figure 1](#diversity-13-00228-f001)). Moreover, we suggest that the levels of total protein and lysozyme content in honey bee haemolymph in the late autumn may be used as markers of long-living honey bee populations. 5.
