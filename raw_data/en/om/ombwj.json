Even without the threat of pandemic, during cold and flu season it becomes especially important to nourish our bodies with plenty of vitamins and minerals so as to decrease our chances of becoming sick. Fortunately, there are a number of simple ways to boost your immune system that can be found in your very own kitchen. Clean up Your Diet One of the simplest ways that you can boost your immune system is to eliminate foods that cause chronic inflammation. Foods to avoid include sugar, vegetable oil, refined carbohydrates, and anything that is processed or deep-fried. Take Vitamin C Vitamin C is essential for the prevention of colds and disease. Start incorporating foods rich in vitamin C such as parsley, kale, kiwi, lemons, and oranges into your diet. Eat Chicken Noodle Soup Homemade chicken noodle soup is a trusted age-old antidote for anything that your body might be fighting. Filled with nourishing produce like parsley, garlic, celery, carrots, and chicken, it's a meal that your whole family can enjoy. Take Vitamin D This sunshine vitamin does a great job shielding the body from catching the cold and flu. Foods that contain vitamin D include cheese, egg yolk, beef liver, and fatty fish. [Health Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/vitamins-minerals/vitamin-calcium-updated-dietary-reference-intakes-nutrition.html) recommends a daily dose of 600 IU for adults. Incorporate Teas and Health Tonics Teas are a great comfort during flu season. Chamomile and green tea are filled with antioxidants that boost the immune system. You can also try making your own medicinal remedy of lemon, honey, a few pieces of peeled ginger, and hot water. Boost Gut Flora With Probiotics Another key to building a healthy immune system is to eat gut-friendly foods with probiotics. When your digestive system has good bacteria then your body is likely to produce more antibodies and immune cells. Pickles, sauerkraut, and yogurt are great probiotic-rich staples to keep in your fridge and can also be [made from scratch at home](https://www.feastingathome.com/immunity-boosting-foods/). Incorporate Beets Into Your Recipes Incorporating more beets into your diet will boost your immune function. Beets are packed with a number of essential vitamins such as folate, manganese, iron, and vitamin C. Incorporate this popular vegetable into salads and juice blends or use it as the main ingredient in a hummus dip. Make Raw Apple Cider a Kitchen Staple Raw apple cider vinegar is a fermented, immune-boosting powerhouse that can kill off harmful bacteria in your body. Purchase a brand that still contains \"the mother\" for full probiotic benefits and use it as a salad dressing.
