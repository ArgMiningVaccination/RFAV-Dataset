Dogs can be infected if their mucus membranes or an open wound on the skin comes in contact with infected urine, urine contaminated soil, water, food or bedding. Signs of disease are very non-specific and can be mild to life threatening. This disease is zoonotic meaning it can be passed to humans. Vaccination is the key for prevention. Dhpp: Dhpp stands for distemper, hepatitis, parvo and parafluenza. This vaccine is given to protect dogs from these four very dangerous and often deadly diseases. They are all caused by viruses that target multiple organ systems including the intestines, lungs, liver and nervous system. Bordetella: The bordetella or kennel cough vaccine is given to protect dogs against a disease called infectious tracheobronchitis (aka: kennel cough). This is caused by contact with the bacteria which has contaminated the air or surfaces from a coughing/sneezing dog. It is highly contagious and very easily transmitted especially in situations where a dog will have close (nose to nose) contact such as parks, boarding facilities, grooming salons, etc. Rabies: Rabies is a viral disease that causes damage to the nervous system of its host which is almost always fatal. Georgia law currently requires that all owned dogs and cats be vaccinated against rabies by licensed veterinarian. Reducing the risk of rabies in domestic animals and limiting contact with wild animals is central to prevention of human rabies. Rabies (Purvax): Purevax Rabies is specifically used in cats because there is less risk of reaction because it is not adjvvated (an adjvvant is the substance in a vaccine that enhances the body's immune response to an antigen). Using adjvvanted vaccines in cats have been linked to serious vaccine reaction. It is just as important to vaccinate cats for rabies as it is for dogs. Cats are nearly five times more likely to be diagnosed with rabies compared to dogs. Felv: Feline leukemia is one of the most important causes of illness and death among cats. It is a viral disease that suppresses the immune system and has been associated with lymphoma in cats. The virus is shed in the saliva and nasal secretions of infected cats, so transfer may occur due to a bite wound, during mutual grooming and even through the sharing of food bowls. FVRCP: This vaccine protects cats from three viral diseases called rhinotracheitis, calicivirus and panleukopenia. Rhinotracheitis is caused by the herpes virus and causes upper respiratory symptoms like sneezing, runny nose and crusty eyes. Calicivirus causes similar respiratory symptoms. Panleukopenia is commonly referred to as feline distemper and is highly contagious life-threatening viral disease. "}
