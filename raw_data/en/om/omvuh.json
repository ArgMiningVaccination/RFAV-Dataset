Allan Bradley Is strongly focused on using genetics to discover genes involved in various biological systems. Elisabeth Busch Nentwich Explores molecular phenotypes through the transcript sequencing of whole vertebrate embryos and tissues. Sarah Caddy Studies how rotavirus is targeted by antibodies, focusing on vaccination and maternal immunity. Menna Clatworthy Is interested in the humoral immunity in humans, how this goes wrong in disease and how this can be manipulated therapeutically using experimental medicine studies. Gordon Dougan Undertakes research focused on the genetic analysis of host/pathogen interactions during infection, particularly those involving enteric bacteria. Ravindra Gupta Focuses on drugpathogen and hostpathogen interactions to inform successful global HIV control/cure strategies. Christoph Hess Studies the molecular basis of how cellular metabolism is regulated, and itself regulates, immunefunction in healthy and disease states. David Jayne Conducts clinical trials and associated biomarker work in primary systemic vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Nicole Kaneider Investigates GPR35's function, and in particular the communication of immune cells expressing this receptor, and their environment. Arthur Kaser Investigates the mechanisms that underlie inflammation at mucosal surfaces. James Lee Studies the genetic associations in immunemediated disease by combining genetics, genomics, molecular biology and immunology based approaches. Paul Lehner Works on functional genetic and proteomic technologies to identify novel genes and therapeutic approaches in virus:host interaction. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 OUR SCIENTISTS 22 6 Florian Marks Operates a network of field sites capable of conducting multicenter epidemiological field studies for basic research and clinical trials Nick Matheson Studies hostvirus interactions to provide insights into viral pathogenesis, cell biology, and novel therapeutic approaches. Eoin McKinney Studies aberrant immune response to indicate novel tests and/or interventions that can help clinicians treating immune pathology. Yorgo Modis Our overarching goal is to gain a mechanistic understanding at the molecular level of how the cell detects cytosolic viral RNA and how it silences viral gene expression. Ankur Mutreja Uses advanced bacterial genomics and metagenomics to better understand the evolution and spread of pathogens. James Nathan Gains novel insights into oxygen and metabolite sensing pathways, providing potential new therapeutic targets for inflammatory disease and cancers. Virginia Pedicord Seeks mechanistic insights into the influence of commensal microbes on local and systemic immune responses. Lalita Ramakrishnan Researches the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, and tries to understand both host and pathogen strategies that can interact to result in clearance or disease. John Sinclair Studies the molecular basis of viral latency and reactivation and how the host immune response combats viral disease. Ken Smith Combines genomics, immunology and clinical medicine to analyse the regulatory mechanisms underpinning immunemediated disease and develop diagnostic tools. Alex Taylor Is evolving and engineering synthetic genetic polymers, xeno nucleic acids (XNA), as novel tools for reprogramming biology and precision medicine. Chris Wallace Develops statistical methods and uses integrative statistical analysis of genomic data to improve diagnosis and treatment of immune mediated diseases. Mark Wills Is interested in the immunobiology of HCMV in lytic and during latent infection, and how the pathogen persists for the lifetime of its human host. 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 7 Much of the research undertaken in CITIID has a focus on reallife challenges. As such, it has a significant positive impact on the people's lives. The stories below describe some examples of the impact that our research has on a daily basis. From genetic analysis to personalised medicine in inflammatory bowel disease. Our research found a transcriptional signature that is detectable within peripheral blood and correlates with long term clinical outcome in IBD. New treatments for Tuberculosis. Our researchers revealed that the activelygrowing bacteria induce bacterial efflux pumps that could be therapeutic targets using existing drugs. The immunity of inflammatory bowel disease is exposed. Our researchers developed experimental methods for examining the environmental stresses and microbes that could be responsible for triggering IBD. Improving sanitation in rural Africa. Our researchers are providing evidence that simple behavioural changes can improve the health of rural communities in the third world. Cholera: a global challenge. Our researchers are using information locked within the genomes of historic cholera samples to predict the spread of past cholera pandemics throughout Africa. 36 38 40 42 8OUR IMPACT 44 CITIID offers a range of core facilties to it's researchers and the wider scientific community.

The variety of instruments and image analysis options in the facility ensure that we are able to meet many imaging requirements inhouse. We are able to provide invaluable tools for investigating cellular processes in both fixed and living cells in 2D and 4D. This is achieved by means of conventional imaging, HCS, confocal microscopy, timelapse, widefield & FRAP, FRET, FCS and FLIM. We also offer postprocessing and image analysis tools for image volumes (deconvolution, 3D reconstruction, quantification) and assist users by developing custom analysis protocols.

There are 200TB of networked data storage availa ble, which is supported by a team of four people, led by Stuart Williams. CONTACT US: sw328@cam.ac.uk Core Facilities Imaging Computing 47 The CITTID immunometabolism facility offers cuttingedge high resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) to solve small molecule (less than 2000 Da) analytical needs. Whether you are interested in highly bespoke hypothesis driven work, absolute quantitation, tracking stable labelled substrates through core metabolic pathways or untargeted global metabolomic profiling with fragmentation based metabolite ID, the immunometabolism facility can tailor the analysis to your needs. We also have a suite of data processing packages to deliver fast turnaround and get the most information out of your data from large scale pattern recognition studies to small scale quantitative work. We currently use Thermo Scientific orbitrap (FTMS) based highresolution MS coupled to a bestinclass chromatography system for conventional analytes such as lipids and less polar aqueous compounds, and a Dionex Ion Chromatography system for highly polar difficult to measure species. With over 15 years' experience in the field of small molecule MS we can meet any analytical challenge.
