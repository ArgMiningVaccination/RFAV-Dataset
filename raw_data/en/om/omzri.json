The Energy Detox is our most powerful tool and most effective one for stimulating Chi (Qi), unblocking stuck energetic pathways and increasing vibrational healing energy. The Energy Detox process is especially useful for those people who are stuck, cannot find the root cause of their issue or challenge, or have deep and serious illness. Additionally, for anyone who is at some type of crossroad in life, is feeling stress about it and is undecided about the right pathway, an Energy Detox will often open energy pathways and free up space for processing and decision making. Anyone who is muddled, overwhelmed, or out of balance and senses a need for a change but does not know where or how to start, the Energy Detox is one of the best ways to get started. It is simple and easy for the patient and can have far-reaching positive benefits. Dr. Scott Muzinski How Does Energy Detox Work? The process works at a deep level in the body, activating the pathways that form and utilize Chi. Before your blood is blood, it is made from new cells within the body and then enters the blood stream. In a similar fashion, the Chi energy used in the body exists and is formed from part of the internal energy systems. Its formation occurs as part of normal development and repair. However, blockages to the development and flow of Chi may occur and decrease its functionality. Molecules that are associated with illness, physical injury or emotions can overload the system and block the normal formation of Chi. This process gets to the root or foundation of the blocks of Chi flow and creates pathways of drainage, allowing these excesses to be removed in large amounts and restoring a balance to the formation and movement of Chi energy. Instead of battling back and forth with recurring issues and finding and removing one or two at a time, this process addresses many more of them through a much larger deeper and intensive process. What can I expect? The Energy Detox is a combination therapy process utilizing acupuncture, neuro-linguistic programming, guided visualization and energy work. While not a traditional acupuncture therapy, it uses similar pathways of treatment of Chi movement and vibration raising. It is a therapeutic process consisting of a one-day intensive followed by a series of six follow-up visits over a period of up to six months. One of the best parts is that this is done without having to revisit or consciously be aware of the cause of the blockage. For example, if there was an emotional upset at the root of the problem, it would NOT have to be revisited or remembered \u2014 and, in fact, remembering it is discouraged. It completely circumvents the need for any emotional reliving of any of these stressors. This is especially helpful for any emotionally-driven challenge including PTSD, depression, event trauma and other cases of such distress. The Energy Detox process is used especially for particularly difficult or complex cases where we want to or need to see a large amount of change. Often combining this procedure with nutritional support or Neuro Emotional Technique (NET) for emotional clearing, this can be one of the most effective ways to support the physical, mental and spiritual health pathways. We determine the type of need with the patient during the consultation, patient visit and evaluation, and often combine therapies for maximum effectiveness. "}
