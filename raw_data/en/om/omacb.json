In fact, just 1-2 acupuncture treatments a week can help: - balance hormones - regulate ovulation and menstrual cycles - induce ovulation in women with PCOS - increase follicle growth and improve egg quality - increase cervical mucus - stimulate blood flow to the uterus, thickening the lining - carry to term - decrease inflammation and pain in women with endometriosis - address depression and anxiety, either pre-existing or arising with the fertility process - miscarriage recovery Acupuncture as an adjunct therapy before or during IUI, IVF If you've chosen the IUI or IVF route, acupuncture is the most commonly used adjunct therapy, improving success rates. It is ideal to begin treatments 1 to 3 months before beginning your ART cycle, but you can get started at any point in the process. There are protocols specific to various stages like using electrical stimulation on specific points to stimulate follicle growth or a day-of-embryo transfer protocol to support successful implantation. It's also a sanity-saving tool for minimizing the harsh side-effects of hormone therapy, which can induce mood swings, digestive disturbances, bloating and swelling, headaches and allergic reactions. Men stand to gain from it And let's not forget about men. In the US and UK, 30 per cent of infertility cases can be attributed to a male factor. Sperm quality, PH, volume, motility and morphology and sexual dysfunction all affect conception rates and embryo viability. Men will need 1-2 treatments a week for 5 weeks to see positive changes. It helps with emotional upheavals Other than physical considerations, your emotional state also plays a big role in fertility. Studies show that women who have difficulty conceiving experience as much stress as someone dealing with cancer. Acupuncture is a safe, drug-free way to manage the very real fears, anxieties and stress that can arise from the process, or deal with a pre-existing state of depression or anxiety. It boosts physical health, induces mental peace and fosters a loving heart needed to create the new life that you're bringing into the world.
