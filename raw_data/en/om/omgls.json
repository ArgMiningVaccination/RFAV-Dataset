It is true that many papers convey discouraging results concerning the risks of AIDS after a decade of follow-up of HIV-infected persons, the involvement of the central nervous system, the difficulties to produce an efficient vaccine, the side effects of new antiviral agents and the continued rapid spread of HIV over the world. Still, the overall impression is a feeling of optimism due to the strength of human ability to cope with both the intellectual and emotional difficulties. It is impressive to learn the wide spectrum of scientific and social efforts from countries in all parts of the world. It is now justified to say that there is a global mobilization of biomedical and social sciences to fight HIV infections. To emphasize the united efforts to combat AIDS, the sessions range from basic sciences to socio-cultural and ethical factors. All accepted scientific papers are presented as posters. Another novel approach is the 1st AIDS Computer Conference, 1ACC, the electronic extension of the main conference. 1ACC is arranged to Lars Olc permit individuals who are unable to attend, to participate electronically. It will also enhance communication among the face-to-face participants in Stockholm. Once the networking has started, the computer conference will be a continuing event. Via interactive satellite conferences the presentations in Stockholm will be shared with a global audience of AIDS researchers. Proceedings will be videotaped and broadcast via satellite and communication networks. HIV is spreading fast over the globe but our knowledge is spreading faster. The appearance of AIDS is changing the world and we must continuously find new approaches to,control the pandemic and its consequences. It is striking how similar the problems are in different countries and cultures and how much we can learn from each other. We hope that the joint efforts across all borders manifested by your contributions will create a spirit-a genius of the Conference-that will help catalyze the processes necessary to solve the difficult and growing problems ahead.

As an integral part of the conference, the consequences of HIV/AIDS on the personal and social level will therefore be treated in addition to the purely scientific sessions. For this purpose the Conference initiated THE FACE OF AIDS section of the program to promote information and international communication on the various ongoing activities that have the ultimate goal of preventing the transmission of HIV and to support HIV infected and persons with AIDS. The Education and Service Committee invited individuals and non-commercial organizations to contribute to THE FACE OF AIDS. The result is a program with sessions, video films and exhibitions. A program outline is found in a separate booklet with details about the various sessions and video films to be presented during the Conference. For the layout of the exhibitions by noncommercial organizations, please refer to the catalogue of exhibitors.

Together with Vironostika anti-HTLV-lll and Vironostika anti-HIV from the UNI-FORM range (for the simultaneous detection of anti-HIV, HBsAg and anti-HBc), it constitutes a natural corollary of Organon Teknika's declaration of intent to satisfy the most stringent demands of clinical laboratories, blood banks and AIDS specialists in general. For its test ranges in virology, haemostasis, endocrinology, bacteriology and clinical chemistry, Organon Teknika makes appropriate use of all available test principles. From RIA and immunofluorescence to the patented Microelisa, Bio-EnzaBead and SPIATEK, using monoclonal antibody technology. From medium-volume and low-volume test needs. The Organon Teknika world of diagnosis is very nearby. On Saturday June 11, we organised a successful Interface Symposium on The Challenges in the Identification of HIV-infection in a Worldwide Perspective. Abstracts of this Satellite Symposium, together with our information on AIDS diagnosis, can be obtained at the ORGANON TEKNIKA booth. j8iicf0noTE~ntR! 9- fit )l SPECIALISTS Teknika Veedijk Fax 32/14/42.16.00 12 [Page 13](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/15) GENERAL INFORMATION Transport The quickest and most convenient way to reach Missan, the Conference, and the Exhibition is by commuter train (9 minutes) from the Stockholm Central Railway Station (usually tracks 13 and 14).

MOBILIZING A NATION: A PROTOCOL FOR STRUCTURING COALITION NETWORKS FOR NA9597 Session THE BIOLOGY OF HIV-1 AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER HUMAN VIRUSES Robert C. Gallo, M.D., Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,USA 1) Each of the human retroviruses, not just HIV-1, appear to be spreading by the same mode of transmission as HIV-1. HIV-2 appears to be spreading with far less efficiency and probably less pathogenicity than HIV-1. HTLV-I, which can cause T-cell leukemia and central nervous system disease, is far more prevalent than HIV-2. Testing of blood for HTLV-I prior to transfusion will soon be routine in the U.S. A new retrovirus (HTLV-V) may be linked to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. 2) The pathogenesis of HIV-1 is clearly related to T4 and macrophage infection. There are exciting new indications that some small animals with CD4 negative cells may also be susceptible to infection. Antibody dependent cell killing of uninfected T4 cells may contribute to T4 depletion due to complex formation of CD4 and the gpl20 envelope. Also, HBLV and HTLV-I can transactivate the HIV-1 LTR and infect the same T4 cell as HIV-1. 3) Use of the CD4 molecule in soluble form and dextran sulfate to block virus binding and systems for the study of inhibitors of viral reverse transcriptase, protease, and tat function have rapidly developed. 4) An international collaborative program (called HIVAC) to develop a vaccine against AIDS was initiated in 1984. Studies from members of this group have defined a neutralizing epitope (Putney et al.), and T cell epitopes (Berzofsky et al.). Other studies (Zagury et al.) have made the first attempts to define the immune response in man. Notes: Sunday, EVOLUTION OF HIVs AND THEIR ROLE IN THE June 12 PATHOGENESIS OF AIDS L. Montagnier, Viral Oncology Unit, Institut Pasteur, Paris HIV is the primary cause of AIDS and others related diseases. Two types have been so far characterized, each having a wide range of genetic variability and pathogenicity. HIV-1 which is associated with the main epidemic has no close relative in Primate retroviruses. HIV-2 is closely related by molecular and biochemical properties to the simian AIDS virus of Macaque, the latter being probably derived from a monkey retrovirus different from that of African Green monkey. Our recent studies indicate that besides the chronic life-long infection of man characterized by constant antibodies against structural virus proteins and likely evolution towards disease, there might be more complex situations, in which the virus can stay latent and eventually disappear. Latent virus infection can be only detected by antibody against a regulatory viral protein (F, 3'orf or rif) or by enzymatic amplification of DNA. Cellular immunity may eventually be involved in the control of latent infection and eventually its eradication. In the chronic active infection, which may lead to AIDS, a central problem remains to be solved: how a relatively low number of cells infected with the virus can induce a general disease of the immune system, concerning mainly the T4 cell subset? Recent findings (G. Piedimonte et al., this Conference) indicate that soon after cell interaction with the virus, there is a state of high protelytic activity, altering the general protein synthesis of the cell. The induction or activation of diffusible cellular proteases may well be a major factor contributin to the progressive impairment observed in AIDS of cells involved in the control of immunity. Sunday, THE GLOBAL PICTURE OF AIDS June 12 J.M. Mann, Global Programme on AIDS, World Health Programme, Geneva A coherent worldview of the pandemic of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS is beginning to emerge. AIDS is a worldwide epidemic in 3 ways: (a) HIV infection is already or threatens to be worldwide; (b) to an unprecedented extent, the people of the world know of AIDS; and (c) AIDS is consciously perceived as a global problem. While the origin of HIV remains obscure, the virus was circulating in several continents during the 1970s. As of 1 January 1988, 73,747 AIDS cases were officially reported to WHO from 129 countries; the actual number of AIDS cases during the past decade is estimated to be 150,000. Three broad epidemiological patterns of AIDS and HIV infection can be described. In Pattern I (North America, Western Europe, Australia/New Zealand), most infections have thus far occurred among homosexual and bisexual men and intravenous drug users. Heterosexual transmission is also occurring; transmission through blood, blood products, organs and semen donation has essentially ceased. In Pattern II (parts of Africa and the Caribbean), sexual transmission is predominantly heterosexual. Parenteral transmission through unscreened blood and non-sterile skin-piercing and other invasive practices continues to occur. Perinatal transmission from infected mothers is also important. In Pattern III (Asia, Middle East) HIV seems to have entered more recently and infection is still rare, although increasing in high risk behaviour groups such as male and female prostitutes. WHO's Global Programme on AIDS is responsible for directing and coordinating the global fight against AIDS and has designed the Global AIDS Strategy, endorsed by all nations. The objectives of the Global Strategy are: (1) to prevent HIV infection; (2) to reduce the personal and social impact of HIV infection; and (3) to unify national and international efforts against AIDS. HIV prevention relies upon informed individual behaviour (with a supportive social environment and relevant health and social support services) and ensuring the safety of specific practices in the health system. Throughout the world, national AIDS programmes are being rapidly developed; evaluation of these efforts will soon become possible. All sectors of the health system should contribute to the programme \"Against AIDS - For Health\". 105 [Page 106](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/104) Monday, June 13 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUSES: NEUTRALIZATION AND RECEPTORS Robin A Weiss Chester Beatty Labs, Inst of Cancer Research, London, UK The envelope glycoproteins of HIV are important as targets for neutralizing antibodies and for the recognition of cell surface receptors. Serological studies of infected subjects and analysis of monoclonal antibodies to gpl20 and gp41 indicate that both common and variable neutralization antigens exist in the HIV envelope. Some of these antigenic sites are becoming precisely defined and may be important in designing effective vaccines. The receptor for all strains of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV studied is the CD4 cell surface antigen. CD4 acts as the HIV receptor on cells in culture of T-cell, B-cell, monocytic, epithelial and neural origin. HIV gpl20 and CD4 bind to each other with high affinity and the HIV recognition site on CD4 is close to that for the monoclonal antibody leu3a. The conservation of receptor recognition between diverse strains of HIV and SIV, and on different cell types can be exploited to develop reagents that block HIV-receptor interactions and hence infection. Examples are the generation of anti-CD4 anti-idiotypic antibodies that weakly neutralize HIV, and reconbinant soluble CD4 that strongly blocks HIV infection. Our current understanding of the HIV envelope and receptor will be reviewed in relation to pathogenesis, treatment and protection. Monday, EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV INFECTION IN AFRICA June 13 Bosenge N'Galy*, *Department of Public Health, AIDS Prevention and Control Program, Kinshasa, Zaire The epidemiology of human retroviruses as etiologic agents for AIDS in Africa is complicated and has been found to vary widely from country to country. High risk behaviors which have been identified in one African country may be very different in another adjacent country. Whereas HIV-1 infection is most common in central and east Africa, HIV-2 appears to be more common in west Africa. The different natural history of infection with these two viruses also explains in part the regional differences in the epidemiology of AIDS which have been observed. HIV-1 infection appears to induce ARC or AIDS in the majority of individuals after an incubation period of between 3 to 5 years. In contrast HIV-2 infection does not appear to induce ARC/AIDS with the same regularity. Even within one region, central Africa, marked differences have been documented in the epidemiology of HIV-1 infection. In the generally conservative society characterizing life in Rwanda a high HIV-1 seroprevalence has been documented in pregnant women. In contrast in neighboring Zaire, a country with a less conservative life style, a much lower HIV-1 seroprevalence has been found in pregnant women coming from a similar social strata as the Rwandese women. Despite these marked regional differences in Africa, heterosexual transmission remains the dominant mode. Therefore, with local modifications, similar prevention and control strategies for limiting the spread of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 can be adopted in all African countries. Notes: Monday, June 13 THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV INFECTION AND AIDS IN THE UNITED STATES James W. Curran*, Harold W. Jaffe*, Ann M. Hardy*, W. Meade Morgan*, Richard M. Selik*, Timothy J. Dondero* *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, USA By the end of 1987, nearly 50,000 cases of AIDS had been reported since 1981, 20,745 in the past year alone. Black and Hispanic adults and children have reported rates three to twelve times higher than whites. This can be largely. attributed to higher reported rates in Black and Hispanic IV drug abusers, their sex partners and infants. In 1986, reported AIDS deaths increased adult male and female mortality in the United States by an estimated 0.7 and 0.07% respectively with much greater increases in selected age groups or areas of the country. The greatest variation in HIV seroprevalence (0 to 70%) has been found in surveys of IV drug abusers, while surveys of homosexual men reveal seroprevalence rates of 20 to 50%. HIV seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 2.6% in limited STD clinic surveys of heterosexual men and women without a history of IV drug abuse or known sexual contact with persons at increased risk. The modes of HIV transmission are now well understood, but a large amount of biologic variability in efficiency of transmission remains to be explained. The period between initial infection with HIV and the development of AIDS is variable, but the risk for disease progression increases with duration of infection. Monday, June 13 AIDS AND HIV INFECTION IN EUROPE J.B. BRUNET WHO Collaborating Centre on AIDS, Paris, France According to national estimates, the total population of HIV-infected persons in the 32 countries belonging to the WHO European region ranges between 280,000 and 800,000 individuals. Seroepidemiological surveys reveal wide variations in the rates of seropositivity in risk groups and in the general population as a whole both between and within countries. By December 1987, 10,215 AIDS cases had been reported in the region which represents a 124% increase in one year (5,666 newly reported cases). The highest rates of AIDS cases per million population were noted in France (55.3), Switzerland (53.8) and Denmark (44.7). By analysing AIDS surveillance data from the twelve countries of the European Communities (EC) (which account for 92% of the total number of cases in the European region) a cumulated number of 50,000 AIDS cases has been predicted to appear by December 1989 in the EC. Analysis of trends since 1984 reveals an increase in the percentage of cases under 30 years of age, and of female cases. These increases are related to a high increase in cases among iv drug users (1 to 20%), predominant in the southern countries (Italy, Spain and the south of France). Within the framework of international organizations (WHO, Council of Europe, EC) intensive cooperation has been achieved to provide a rapid and regular exchange of information, to help in the harmonisation of public health strategies, and to develop international research cooperation. 106 [Page 107](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/105) Tuesday, Replication and Pathogenesis of the AIDS virus June 14 William A. Haseltine, Dana-Farber Cancer Inst. Harvard Medical School, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02115 USA HIV induces a slow progressive degenerative disease of the immune and central nervous systems. Initial viremia is followed by a long latent period that in turn is followed by re-emergence of the virus. A wide variety of cell types, all bearing CD4 surface protein can be infected by HIV but only CD4+ T cell lymphocytes are efficiently killed. A vigorous anti-viral humoral and detectable cell mediated immune responses are present in most infected people. The molecular biology of HIV helps to understand the observed pathology. Persistent infection is understood in terms of the life cycle of the infectious agent, a retrovirus. Progressive disease is understood in terms of the selective cytotoxicity of the virus, permitting reservoirs of virus producing cells to accumulate and also in terms of the ability of the virus to evade the immune response. Evasion of the immune response is understood as a function of the structure of the virus envelope protein as well as the ability of the virus to establish fully latent states and partially latent infections. The slow progression of disease is a consequence of the highly regulated life cycle of the virus. Implications of the molecular biology of HIV for improved liagnosis treatment and prophylaxis will be discussed. Tuesday, June 14 IMMUNOPATHOLOGY OF HIV INFECTION Hans Wigzell Department of Immunology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. Infection by HIV and immune reactions against HIV derived molecules can induce damage and death to the infected cells and also to other cells and tissues within the body. The immune reactions may have dual effects allowing inhibition or enhancement of HIV replication = \"good\" and \"bad\" immune reactions may exist. The gradual failure to maintain adequate CD4~ T cell numbers most likely involves regulatory mechanisms besides direct HIV-mediated effects. Some of these may be linked to age and sex of the individual. The fact that HIV is using CD4, an essential molecule in many cellmediated immune reactions as its receptor puts extra strain on the immune system. The consequences as to cellular functions and specificity of anti-HIV antibodies being made seem manifold. Some may lead to molecular mimicry situations and could involve the immune system in both positive and negative ways. Products from HIV infected cells of non-specific nature are probably involved in causing damage to innocent bystander cells. Notes: Tuesday, THE ROLE OF MATHEMATICAL MODELS IN THE STUDY June 14 OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF AIDS Roy M. Anderson, F.R.S., Department of Pure and Applied Biology, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, UK The paper examines the use of mathematical models in the study of HIV transmission and the epidemiology of AIDS. Attention is given to short and long term predictions, the estimation of epidemiological parameters such as the incubation period of the disease, the potential demographic impact of AIDS in the developing world and the dynamics of viral replication within an infected person. The lecture will focus on concepts as opposed to technical detail. Tuesday, June 14 HEALTH EDUCATION OUTREACH ON CONTROL OF HIV INFECTION IN KENYA ELIZABETH NGUGI The paper highlights the responsibility of individual and groups in prevention of HIV transmission. It traces the educational strategy employed to reach the general population and selected groups at risk in Kenya. The general awareness started in late 1985 and was intensified in 1986-1987. Reduction of sexually transmitted disease is demonstrated. Also stressed is the importance of pre-testing educational material as well as monitoring and evaluation so as to lay the ground for richer health education to combat HIV transmission. The paper concludes by emphasizing developing HIV infection control programme with the people and for the people. 107 [Page 108](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/106) Tuesday, June 14 of London SEX AND DEATH: THE AIDS CRISIS IN SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXT Sandra Wallman, University College, University In historical time the AIDS virus is very new. We are only beginning to realise the range of its social impact, and the extent to which the effectiveness of any strategy for controlling it will vary from one cultural setting to another. We now know that the crisis of AIDS is experienced in very different ways in different countries, and by different kinds of people in the same country. In the perspectives of social science these variations are neither random nor accidental. The dimensions of social context which govern the meaning of the disease for individuals and its non-medical effects on communities can be systematically researched and documented. Access to knowledge of these social and cultural dimensions cannot fail to strengthen the hands of epidemiological and medical experts. This short presentation gives an overview of the contributions that are being or could be made by social scientists. Four perspectives are schematised, each arising out of the expertise of one or more social scientific discipline: (i) the spread of the AIDS virus and manifestations of the disease worldwide; (ii) its effect on social practices and institutions in different social settings; (iii) conversely, the effect of cultural perceptions and culture specific behaviour on the meaning and (so) the social fact of AIDS in different social settings; (iv) implications for the design of media and educational campaigns to make ordinary people aware of the risks and/or to persuade them to change their ways of life. Wednesday, CELL INFECTION BY RETROVIRUSES June 15 A. Burny (1,2), R. Brasseur (1), D. Portetelle (2), J.M. Ruysschaert (1). (1) University of Brussels, Brussels. (2) Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium. As a rule, retroviruses enter the cell in a pH-independent fashion via fusion of the virus and cell lipid phases after virus adherence to cell due to virus-receptor interaction. The membrane fusion phenomenon can be studied and quantified in the syncytia induction process. Molecular modelling and physico-chemical assays with the Newcastle Disease Virus strongly suggest that fusion involves insertion of the fusogenic peptide obliquely into the lipid bilayer of the membrane, a process that destabilizes the membrane structure. In the HIV system, it is presumed that the CD4-gpl20 complex formation induces a structural change that brings the highly hydrophobic NH,-end of gp41 to enter lipid phase of the cell membrane. Important segments of gpl20 include the second constant region, a sequence with high homology to neuroleukin-phosphohexose isomerase. Absence of gpl20 abrogates the fusion capacity of the remaining particle. High fusion capacity parallels high infection rate and probably high pathogenicity at the animal level. Notes: Wednesday, Wednesday, ANTIVIRAL THERAPY June 15 Bo Oberg Astra Alab AB, Antiviral Therapy, Sbdertalje, Sweden An ongoing multiplication of HIV in an infected person seems to be the cause of the development of AIDS. Fortunately, HIV is both a complicated and an increasingly well understood virus and thus offers several good targets for therapy. Targets which have been identified today include the interaction between HIV and T4 receptors, the viral enzymes reverse transcriptase, RNase H, endonuclease, protease, the regulatory proteins tat, sor, art, 3'orf as well as the structural HIV proteins. Other targets are glycosylation of viral proteins, translation frameshift and antisense mRNA. The clinical efficacy of AZT shows that inhibitors of the reverse transcriptase can be used for AIDS therapy. The detailed knowledge of HIV reverse transcriptase and its function makes it the main target in the near future and several inhibitors have been found and will be evaluated clinically. It is likely that useful drugs interacting with the other HIV enzymes, especially the protease, can be developed based on present knowledge of their function. The development of drugs acting on HIV regulatory proteins, structural proteins or directly on the viral genome will have to rely on serendipity and more basic knowledge. Blocking HIV multiplication will probably not eliminate the virus because of integration into cellular genes. Thus, lifelong treatment will be necessary and requires drugs with low toxicity. Combinations of drugs with antiviral activity as well as immunomodulators are likely future developments. A permanent cure remains a remote possibility. Wednesday, June1s5 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AIDS PATIENTS. Anthony J Pinching. Department of Immunology, St Mary's Hospital Medical School, LONDON W2 1PG. Improved management flows from greater understanding of the biology of HIV, better use of existing therapy and new agents for opportunist disease and notably zidovudine. Nutrition and health maintenance together with a positive ethos are crucial. Developments in therapy, maintenance and prophylaxis include: second-line treatment for Pneumocystis and the role of steroids in acute management; inhaled pentamidine and other prophylaxis; improved antifungal therapy; mycobacterial infection and Kaposi's sarcoma. In some patients IL-2 has led to resolution of cryptosporidiosis. In AIDS and ARC, zidovudine reduces the frequency/severity of opportunist infections, delaying the onset of more severe immunodeficiency and improving survival; HIV encephalopathy may show improvement. Early onset of profound anaemia is common, serious neutropenia and thrombocytopenia generally developing later. Drug interactions include increased marrow suppression with ganciclovir and daily dapsone. A polymyositis has been seen after prolonged use. An acute meningoencephalitis may be seen after dose reduction. While zidovudine offers substantial benefits, serious problems of toxicity are compounded by those of dose reduction, indicating a need for careful monitoring and drugs with a better therapeutic ratio. 108 [Page 109](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/107) Wednesday, June 15 HIV Infection among persons who Inject illicit drugs: Problems and progress Don C. Des Jarlais, New York State Division of Substance Abuse Services, New York, N Y, USA We are now into the second decade of HIV infection among persons who inject illicit drugs. This presentation will summarize recent research on the epidemilogy of HIV infection among drug injectors and on efforts to control the spread of the virus within and from the group. The sharing of drug injection equipment with large numbers of other drug injectors has been established as an important factor in HIV spread in both the U.S. and Europe. Membership in an ethnic minority group has also been associated with HIV exposure in a number of American and in one European study, although the mechanism for higher seroprevalence rates among minority groups has not been determined. There is continuing evidence for substantial differences in the outcomes of HIV infection among drug injectors compared to outcomes among homosexual/bisexual men. Co-factor mechanisms for these different outcomes have not yet been determined. Many studies show widespread self-reported risk reduction among drug injectors, although the effectiveness of the behavior change on viral transmission has not been established. Several cities in show an apparent plateauing of HIV seroprevalence rates among drug injectors. The dynamics of transmission of HIV from drug injectors through sexual activity are not well understood, and behavior change with respect to sexual tranmission appears difficult. As more prevention programs become operational, evaluation and rapid dissemination of findings will become essential. Wednesday, AIDS CARE: MEETING THE HEALTH CARE June 15 NEEDS OF THE HIV INFECTED Constance B. Wofsy; Department of Medicine, San Francisco General Hospital, University of California, San Francisco To meet the needs of HIV infected individuals, innovative approaches to health care delivery have been developed that will soon affect the entire worldwide medical care system. Innovations include: dedicated inpatient and outpatient AIDS treatment and research units, extensive community service organizations, active volunteers, hospices, visiting nurses, AIDS information hot lines, confidential testing sites, outpatient infusion centers, integration of research and clinical care, and new roles for health professionals. For some, AIDS has become an unofficial medical subspecialty. Coping with HIV infection poses extraordinary challenges. HIV Health care providers must provide the nurturing of a bygone era coupled with the technologic expertise of the 1990's. Physicians who have come to expect some measure of choice in the patients they care for must learn to accept HIV; staggering health care costs, a sorely-taxed public care system, fear of infection or medical inadequacy, declining nursing school enrollment, decreased interest in primary care medical specialties, a dwindling supply of community volunteers and sparse extended care facilities hamper our efforts to provide for AIDS patients. However, the abundance of vacant hospital beds, the social and scientific challenge of AIDS care and research, employment opportunities and a new generation of health care professionals accepting AIDS as part of the challenge of medicine all offer hope for change. In AIDS we have the opportunity to reintroduce the art of healing back into the increasingly technologic practice of medicine. In doing so, we will all face our own mortality. Notes: Thursday, June 16 Thursday, June 16 PROSPECTS FOR HIV VACCINES ANIMAL MODELS AND RETROVIRUS VACCINES R. Kurth, P. Centner, A. Werner, S. Hartung, G. Kraus Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, Frankfurt a.M., FRG Like HIV in man, animal retroviruses cause a wide variety of diseases, notably cancers and immunodeficiencies in a wide variety of species. With most oncogenic retrovirus strains, however, it is difficult to induce disease in immunocompetent animals, indicating that immune surveillance is effective in limiting virus replication and pathogenesis. The recognition of the type and nature of viral and virus-induced cellular antigens triggering anti-viral immunity may help to define those HIV antigens required for successful vaccine development. The strategies in HIV vaccine development will have to take into account, however, the variability of the lentivirus envelopes. Practical animal models for AIDS are still lacking but would help significantly to evaluate experimental vaccines and new drugs for their efficacy against HIV. Attempts to develop such animal models for AIDS will be summarized. G.L. Ada Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore. Four stages in the control of an infectious agent by immunological mechanisms may be postulated. 1. Prevention of infection - by specific antibody; 2. Limitation of infection - by less specific mechanisms, such as NK cells; 3. Recovery from infection - by a variety of factors, but particularly some effector T cells and their products; 4. Rapid recruitment and activation of memory (specific) T and B lymphocytes. There is little information about the relative importance of each stage in the control of an infection by individuals immunized with any traditional vaccines, but considerable data from experimental systems. This presentation discusses the possibility of developing a vaccine to HIV which will be effective at one or more of these stages, in view of 1. Factors important in generating different immune responses; 2. the known properties of HIVs; 3. known or suspected modes of viral transmission; 4. the target cells infected by the viruses; 5. factors affecting the tropism of the virus; 6. the immunopathology resulting from HIV infection. Other proposed approaches (non traditional) will also be discussed. The known situation of responses to other viruses will be used to illustrate particular points. 109 [Page 110](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/108) Thursday, A VIROLOGIST'S VIEW-OF HIV'S SUCCESSES AND June Kim, Patrick Baeuerle, Mark Muesing, Mark Feinberg, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, USA HIV is a different retrovirus from most others but being an enveloped RNA virus, it has many properties in common with other related viruses. Comparing its traits to those of other viruses we see that many are not so special. For instance, a variety of RNA viruses vary in sequence extensively from isolate to isolate. Also, viruses generally have a stable mode of transmission -- HIV being sexually parenterally and perinatally transmitted is likely to remain so. The special characteristics of the virus are its lethality, its complex genome structure, its internal regulatory cycles and its regulation by the host cell. These may all be related phenomena and thus are the focus of much attention. By studying the life cycle of HIV, we are trying to define its special properties. We have found a single, critical cellular transcriptional regulatory protein, NF-o<B, that appears important for allowing HIV transcription. We have determined conditions that allow for synchronous, high multiplicity infection of sensitive cells and are characterizing the earliest DNA and RNA species made in the cells. Thursday, June 16 \"SEXUAL CONDUCT AND SEX RESEARCH.\" John H. Gagnon. Department of Sociology, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, USA, 08540. The onset of the AIDS epidemic has made evident how scanty our knowledge base is about sexuality, not only in the developing world where behavioral science resources are limited, but in the developed world as well. That the findings of the Kinsey group of nearly half a century ago remain relevant to current scientific discussion is an important measure of the lack of a well-developed and active research tradition in the area of sexuality. From the beginning of the AIDS epidemic there have been some attempts to support sex research relevant to both the transmission of the disease and behavior change. While some of this research has had its uses in the early stages of the epidemic, much of it has been ad hoc and methodologically flawed. In part this is because of a lack of baseline data, trained personnel and easily accessible and tested research techniques. But another contributing factor has been because the majority of this research has been driven soley by a concern for the disease and has not taken into account the larger role of sexuality in the life of individuals in specific cultures and societies. Most of the research up to this point has been on sexuality in the perspective of AIDS and not AIDS in the perspective of sexuality. A number of major sex research intiatives are now being undertaken both nationally and internationally which may give us a more fundamental understanding of sexual development. That these initiatives have been so long in coming suggests the peculiar status of sexuality as a social practice and as the object to scientific research in the modern world. Perhaps it is well to understand that long after the AIDS epidemic is history, sexuality will remain with us as a source of both pleasure and difficulties. Notes: Thursday, COOPERATION ACROSS BORDERS June 16 Halfdan Mahler, Director General, World Health Organization AIDS is a truly global epidemic, for three reasons. First. infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is worldwide. Second, to an unprecedented extent, people around the world have heard about AIDS. Finally, the world is aware that AIDS is global and is a growing global threat. The concept of cooperation across borders is as ancient as the concept of common interest - yet only problems which deeply affect the self-interest of each and all are eligible to become genuine global concerns. AIDS, with all the uncertainties surrounding it, is a problem of this magnitude. This was the message from the 40th World Health Assembly and the 42nd United Nations General Assembly, and it was implicit in the Declaration of AlmaAta ten years ago. The Alma-Ata Declaration stated: \"all countries should cooperate... since the attainment of health by people in any one country directly concerns and benefits every other country.\" The World Health Organization is a symbol of that global perspective and WHO is directing and coordinating the global fight against AIDS. In AIDS, cooperation across borders is our destiny. Thursday, THE NEW AIDS VIRUS - INEFFECTIVE AND UNJUST June 16 LAWS The Honourable Justice Michael Kirby CMG, Supreme Court of N.S.W., Australia Public alarm about the spread of AIDS leads to public demand for drastic laws to contain the epidemic and to punish those who spread it. In this paper, attention is drawn to the limitations of the law in achieving the modification of human behavior. Successes and failures in public health education campaigns, directed to the same end, are mentioned. The author cautions against putting too much trust in the law to achieve containment of the AIDS virus. However, he cites three reasons for optimism about the developing laws on AIDS. These are the necessity of a rare degree of international cooperation; the encouragement of attention to fresh approaches to laws on human sexuality and drug taking; and the vital importance of attention to the neglected issues of efficiency and cost effectiveness in the design of new laws. This last point leads to a suggestion that AIDS has produced three new viruses called \"HIL\" (highly inefficient laws). HIL-I is the mandatory testing of the entire population for HIV antibodies. HIL-II is the mandatory testing of specially vulnerable groups, especially foreigners. HIL-III is the mandatory requirement of HIVfree certificates at the frontier. The ineffectiveness and potential for injustice of such laws are exposed. The lesson derived is that there is no \"quick fix\" either for the AIDS virus itself or for the social and legal problems presented by it. 110 [Page 111](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/109) Poster Session 1000 Virology, abstracts 1001-1202.

Tung* *Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos Objective. To elucidate structural features of the HIV LTR that are responsible for regulation of viral expression. Homologous and heterologous transactivation of HIV are effected through both highly specific and less specific cis-regulatory sequences in the LTR. We define the tertiary structures of those LTR DNA sequences which are believed to be responsive to regulatory effectors, i.e. proteins, and correlate this molecular information with results of mutational and biochemical studies. Methods. DNA curvature and local helical twist are quantitatively measured, employing computer algorithms, across the various HIV LTR sequences and compared to those of all known retroviral and retrotransposon LTR sequences. Results. Two DNA curvature patterns are uniquely found in all HIV-1 LTR sequences: one is immediately 5' to the positive enhancer region and the other is immediately 5' to the primer binding site. One or the other of these can be found in HIV-2 and lentiviral sequences, but neither curvature is characteristic of other retroviral LTRs analyzed to date. Furthermore, unique DNA helical patterns are discernible in the control region denoted TAR, which is essential for homologous transactivation. HIV sequence comparisons reveal that only base substitutions that conserve these structures appear to be permitted. Conclusion. At least two of the several critical three-dimensional nucleic acid structures for HIV LTR-directed transactivation can be defined. 1002 UTILITY OF A HIV 1 RETROVIRAL VECTOR SYSTEM FOR GENE TRANSFER INTO HUMAN CELLS V. Heisig, G. Jahn, M. Ebeling, R. Laufs Inst. und Immunologie Universitat Hamburg, Hamburg, W.-Germany Retroviral vectors have been constructed for gene transfer in mammalian and avian cells. owever, they are restricted in host range. We describe a retroviral vector system based entirely on an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1) containing the ability to carry out efficient gene transfer into human cells. By establishing a helper cell line that produces the trans-acting viral gene products we propagate the cis-acting components in them and harvest defective viral particles that contain only the cis-acting components. In HIV 1 the packaging signal has not been identified. We postulate that the sequence for the packaging signal is located between the primer binding site (PBS) and the gag genes. Therefore we constructed deletion mutants in this region and transfected this mutants into H9 cells. The plasmid pVH3H containing the complete proviral genome of HIV 1 and a hygromycin B gene for selection was used for constructions. An additional deletion in the 3'LTR (-138 to -48) has been introduced into all plasmids. We have established cell lines with the mutants and studied the reverse transcriptase activity, RNA and protein synthesis. The cis-acting component, a retroviral self inactivating vector containing two HIV 1 LTR's was transfected into the packaging defective helper cell lines. This plasmid contains the hygromycin B gene between both LTR's. Preliminary analysis of the supernatants of some cell lines indicate that defective particles are produced and transferred to human cell lines. Such a human retrovirus gene transfer system could be useful for the transfer of HIV 1 genes into human cells. Notes: 1003 THE NINTH CODING SEQUENCE OF HIV-1 Redfield**, Max Essex*, and Tun-Hou Lee*. Cancer Biology, Harvard School of Public Hlth. **Dept. of Virus Diseases, Walter Reed Army Inst. of Research Objective. To determine if an open reading frame uniquely present in HIV-1 is a coding sequence. Methods. The potential coding sequence was cloned into an expression vectors. Recombinant proteins derived were studied for their reactivity with sera from HIV-1, HIV-2 infected individuals, and uninfected controls. Results: Seroreactivity was detected in HIV-1 infected individuals. Prevelance rate of this antibody has a bimodal distribution with peaks present at early and late clinical stages. No HIV-2 infected individuals have detectable reactivity to this product. Conclusion: Our results indicate that in addition to gag, pol, env, sor, tat, art/trs, 3'-orf, and R, HIV-1 contains another coding sequence in its genome. Reactivity to this gene product is indicative of HIV-1, but not HIV-2, infection. 1004 FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF AN OPEN READING FRAME SPECIFIC TO HIV2/SIV M Guyader, K Peden, A Cordonnier, L Chakrabarti, L Montagnier and M Emerman, Institut Pasteur Paris. Objective. Sequence analysis of HIV2 and SIV-MAC revealed the presence of an open reading frame in the central region of the genome. This open reading frame, which we called X, has the potential to code for a protein of 112 amino acids that is highly conserved between HIV2 and SIV-MAC but is not present in HIV1. This study was undertaken to determine whether or not the putative X product is expressed and to define its role in the viral life cycle. Methods and Results.In order to block specifically the expression of X, we have used oligonucleotide sitedirected mutagenesis to mutate the open reading frame in the HIV2 and SIV genomes. Results will be presented on the expression of full-length clones containing mutations in the X open reading frame. The expression of this open reading frame will also be investigated usina anti-sera raised to the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the putative protein. In the course of establishing a system for the introduction of mutations into infectious HIV2 proviral clones, we isolated two types of proviral clones that differ by the presence of an insertion of approximately 500 bp near the 3' end of the genome. The effect of the insertion on viral replication will also be presented. Conclusion.Mutational analysis of an open reading frame specific to HIV2/SIV family may contribute to an understanding of the differences and similarities between this group of viruses and HIV1. A-8 113 [Page 114](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/112) 1005 4N OPEN READING FRAME UNIQUELY PRESENT IN HIV-2 AND SIV IS A FUNCTIONAL GENE Xiao-Fang Yu, Max Essex, and Tun-Hou Lee Dept. of Cancer Biology, Harvard School of Public Health Objective. To determine if an open reading frame uniquely present in HIV-2 and SIV is a coding gene and to study its role in viral replication cycle. Methods. Heterologous sera directed to recombinant proteins expressed by expression vectors are used to study the product encoded by this open reading frame. The replication cycle of mutants with premature stop codons introduced into this coding region is studied. Results. The product encoded by this open reading frame, previously designated X, is identified. This product is recognized by HIV-2 infected individuals but not by those infected by HIV-1. With a few exceptions, viral mutants with truncated X gene products behave like wild type viruses. Conclusion. The open reading frame which is present only in HIV-2 and SIV but not HIV-1 is proven to be a functional gene. 1006 LOCALIZATION OF P17 EPITOPES BY IMMUNOELECTRON MICROSCOPY Federal Administration, D-1000 Berlin, AAGeorg Washington University, Washington DC, ~cx National Cancer Institute, NHI, Bethesda Monospecific polyclonal rabbit and mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against p17 reacted with epitopes located under the lipid bilayer of virions or budding particles. This immunological finding is substantiated by the direct EM observation of a matrix protein layer underneath the viral membrane. Antibodies produced against a distinct, synthetic fragment of p17 (HPG-30), which shows homology to thymosin, however, labelled in pre-embedding and cryoultramicrotomy IEM determinants on the surface of the virion or budding HRV. This observation is discussed in connection with neutralization data which indicate, that anti HPG-30 antibodies prevent the infection of susceptable cells by HIV. Notes: 1007 SYNTHESIS OF EXCRETED 26KDa PROTEINS BY HIV-1 INFECTED CELLS APPARENTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CORE PROTEIN OF HIV AG Laurent, L Montaqnier, AG Hovanessian Unite d'Oncoloqie Virale, Institut Pasteur Paris, France. Synthesis of HIV-1 proteins was studied in infected CEM cells metabolicaly labeled with (35S) methionine. Low levels of newly-synthesized, viral proteins are detectable 24 hr after the infection with a maximal synthesis on days 4 and 5. During this period, there is a dramatic inhibition of cellular protein synthesis which is concomitant with a significant increase of a series of proteins of 25-26KDa. The amount of these proteins might reach as much as 25% of total proteins synthesized in HIV-infected cells. Analysis of these 25-26KDa proteins by twodimensional qel electrophoresis revealed that they are composed of at least four species with different isoelectric points (pI): two 25KDa species with pi values more basic than two 26KDa species. Only the 25KDa species are recognized by immunoblottinq usinq monoclonal antibodies specific for three different epitopes in the n25 of HIV-1. Subcellular localization studies have indicated that the 25KDa species and as well as their precursors (p40 and p55) are associated with the rough microsomal pellet whereas the 26KDa species remain in the nost-ribosomal supernatant fraction. The 26KDa species are not incorporated into virus particles but they are excreted by virus producing cells. These observations provide evidence for the first time for the synthesis and excretion of 26KDa Droteins by HIV-1 infected cells. The function of these 26KDa proteins, their origin (viral or cellular) and their relation to the HIV-1 p25 remain to be elucidated. 1008 ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV-1) GLYCOPROTEINS Bharat Parekh and Roger Walker Bio-Rad Laboratories, Clinical Division, 1000 Alfred Nobel Drive, Hercules, CA 94547, USA Objective. To isolate and characterize HIV-1 glycoproteins. Methods. HIV-1 glycoproteins were separated from nonglycosylated components from detergent-disrupted virus using a lentil lectin column. Pools were analyzed on a Western Blot. Non-reducing gels were run to examine inter- and intramolecular disulfide linkages in these glycoproteins. Results. On a lentil lectin column, non-glycosylated proteins eluted in the void volume peak. Bound glycoproteins were eluted with a buffer containing a-methyl mannoside and a-methyl glucoside. Analysis of these two peaks by Western Blot, using a polyclonal human serum, revealed that Peak 1 contained all of the non-glycosylated components, while Peak 2 had most of the viral glycoproteins. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE revealed that gpl20 and gp41-43 are not disulfide-linked. However, an additional immunoreactive band was seen at about 90Kd which may indicate that a proportion of gp41-43 may exist as a dimer in the virion. Non-reduced gp41-43 was more immunoreactive than the reduced molecule, suggesting the importance of intramolecular disulfide bonds in maintaining the folding and conformation of antigenic sites on this glycoprotein. Conclusion. Although gpl20 and gp41-43 are not disulfide-linked, a small proportion of gp41-43 may exist as a dimer. The non-reduced form of gp41-43 was found to be more immunoreactive than the reduced molecule. 114 [Page 115](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/113) 1009 PHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF HIV-1 ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEINS: ENVELOPE PRECURSOR CLEAVAGE OCCURS IN THE RER-GOLGI COMPLEX Barry S. Stein*, K Steimer**, EG Engleman* *Stanford University Medical School, Stanford, CA, USA **Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, CA, USA Objective. To evaluate processing of HIV-1 envelope proteins in an infected human CD4+ T cell line (VB). Methods. HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins were immunoprecipitated from [ S] amino acid labeled HIV-1 infected VB cells and analyzed by 2D SDS-PAGE. Results. gpl60 and gp41 both focus over a pH range of 7.0 to 7.5, whereas gpl20 focuses across a broad pH range of 5.0 to 7.5. gpl60 and gpl20 are Endo H sensi tive, however, the mannose trimmed digest continues to focus broadly from pH 5.0 to 7.5, indicating gpl20 has both N-asparagine linked high mannose and complex oligosaccharides. gpl60 is neuraminidase-resistant with unchanged migration, but gpl20 is exquisitely neuraminidase-sensitive migrating at 100 Kd and focusing above pH 7.5. gpl60 and gpl20 are therefore differentially perturbs interfering with gpl20 processing such that it migrates at 100 Kd and focuses at pH 7.5, but exerts little effect on gpl60. These data suggest gpl20 is extensively sialylated in the trans Golgi. Conclusions. If mature glycosylated gpl60 is the precursor to gpl20 and gp41, cleavage must occur in the Golgi as gpl20 independently undergoes extensive sialylation which is unlikely to be facilitated at the plasma membrane. Alternatively, cleavage of immature gpl60 could occur as it traverses the RER. These data reveal gpl20 is a hybrid N-linked glycoprotein. 1010 EXPRESSION AND SELECTION OF GAG GENE RECOMBINANTS FROM THE HIV1,, CLONE IN ESCHERICHIA COLI USING A A EXPRESSION SYSTEM. Sylvia Crush-Stanton, Bonnie Swerdlow and Michael L. Berman, Bionetics Research, Inc., Rockville, Maryland, U.S.A. Sonicated HIVl1,, gag and pol DNA was used to create a subgenomic library in a previously described A phage expression vector2. Recombinant clones were screened for expression of antigenic determinants with a pool of several patients' serum. Individual clones were subsequently characterized with anti-p24 mouse monoclonal antibodies. The recombinant proteins express different epitopes as defined by monoclonal antibodies allowing mapping of the antigenic determinants. Data will be presented showing differing monoclonal reactivity on clones that produce stable recombinant proteins in E. coli. The recombinant antigens may prove useful for in vitro diagnostics. The approach used to produce these clones is generally applicable to the expression of any stable recombinant antigen and its subfragments for diagnostic, vaccine and pharmaceutical purposes. 1Kindly provided by Beatrice Wong-Staal and R.

Berman USA Vol 84, pp Notes: 1011 CHARACTERIZATION OF HIV-2 GLYCOPROTEINS: IDENTIFICATION OF AN UNUSUAL HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT PRECURSOR OF THE ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN MA Rey, B Krust, L Montagnier, AG Virale, Institut Pasteur Paris, France. Four glycoproteins of apparent molecular weights 300,000, 140,000, 125,000 and 36,000 (gp300, ql140, qp125 and gp36) are detectable in HIV-2 infected T4-antigen positive cells. The gp125 and gp36 are the external and transmembrane components of the envelope qlvcooroteins of HIV-2 mature virions. The qp300 and apl40 are only detectable in virus-infected cells. They have identical isoelectric points in the DH ranqe of 7.0 to 7.5, thus suggesting that gp300 might be a doublet form of the immature precursor, qpl40. This doublet is probably formed by covalent associations since it is stable in the presence of ionic and non-ionic detergents, reducing agents, high salt and 4M urea. Pulse chase experiments indicate that gp300 is formed immediately after synthesis of gpl40 and that this step is necessary for further processing towards the mature qlycooroteins (see the schema below). These results were confirmed using various inhibitors which act at different staqes in the qlycosylation cycle of proteins. gpl40 --.. gp300 --- 2 (gp1l5 + gD36) A 300 KDa glycoprotein is also detectable in SIV-infected cells in addition to a 140 KDa qlycoprotein precursor. In contrast, such a high molecular weight QlvcoProtein is not found in HIV-1 infected cells. Therefore, doubletformation of the envelope qlycoprotein precursor seems to be a specific property of HIV-2 and SIV gene expression. The 1q300 formation might be required for oligosaccharide trimming of HIV-2 glycoprotein precursor through the golgi apparatus. du Brabant rue du Remorqueur 28 1040 Brussels, Belgium Yeast shuttle vectors harboring the nucleotide sequences coding for the p17 mature HIV protein or for a fusion p17-p24 protein were constructed and used to transform yeast strains. The yeast cells transformed with those plasmids express p17 related proteins that immunoreact with specific antibodies and with HIV positive human sera. Moreover the yeast product is a post- translationally modified protein that carries a myristoyl fatty acid residue attached to N-terminal glycine as has been found to be the case for the viral p17. The behaviour and subcellular localization of the r-p17 related protein in yeast has been studied. The recombinant constructs were derived from the BH10 clone of HIV, kindly provided by Dr Wong-Staal. 115 [Page 116](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/114) 1013 CLONING AND EXPRESSION OF Physiology of Microorganisms, USSR Academy of Sciences, Pushchino 142292, USSR Pol gene of mammalian retroviruses codes for a large polypeptide precursor of reverse transcriptase (RT) containing domains of protease, RNase H, reverse transcriptase itself and endonuclease activities. The protease of avian retroviruses, like Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), is encoded by the gag gene. Detailed characterization of these activities and screening for efficient inhibitors may open new prospects in repression of viral growth and antiviral therapy. In this work we have cloned and expressed the entire pol gene of RSV and human HIV-1 in bacterial cells of E.coli, Induction of pol gene expression in some cases causes the sharp reduction of growth of transformed E.coli cells. The lethal effect arises upon synthesis of recombinanto(- and0 -subunits of RSV and HIV-1 protease domain. Purified recombinantRT's are susceptible to proteolitic processing similar to that observed during the maturation of viriousin animal and human cells. Recombinant RT's have been purified to essential homogeneity and characterized in terms of enzymatic properties. 1014 ANALYSIS OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE HIV-1 R AND 3'ORF GENE PRODUCTS Lee Ratner and Thomas Niederman, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA. HIV-1 is an unusual retrovirus with 8 genes, only 3 of which are known to encode virion proteins. The functions of 2 of its gene products, designated R and 3'orf have remained obscure. These proteins are predicted to be conserved among different HIV-1 isolates as well as with those of simian immunodeficiency virus and HIV-2. To define the role of the potential 78 amino acid R protein, a frameshift HIV-1 mutant was constructed which would encode a truncated protein of only 43 amino acids. The R- HIV-1 proviral clone yielded virus which showed similar infectivityr replication rate, and cytopathicity to that of the R+ HIV-1 parental virus in several different lymphoid and monocytoid cell lines. No differences were seen in viral DNAs, RNAs, and proteins in cells infected with the R- HIV-1 mutant compared to the R+ HIV-1 virus. 3'Orf frameshift and deletion mutants of HIV-1 were constructed, and viruses derived from these clones were found in every case to replicate at significantly higher levels than the 3'orf+ HIV-1 virus. In T4- cells, this regulatory effect was localized to a step in the latter half of the virus life cycler involving transcription, translation, or virus assembly or release. However, no effects were seen on transcription or trans-activation using HIV-1 LTR CAT assays. In experiments in which 3'orf- and 3'orf+ clones were transfected into the same culture, the phenotype of the 3'orf- virus was dominant. These data suggest that 1) R encodes a protein which is not required for HIV-1 replication and cytopathicity, and 2) 3'orf acts as a negative regulator affecting a late step in the virus life cycle. Notes: 1015 FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE HIV-1 \"A\" (SOR) GENE PRODUCT Klaus Strehel and Malcolm A. Martin NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA Objective. Functional analysis of the HIV-1 \"A\" (sor) gene product. Methods. We recently demonstrated that the elimination of the HIV-1 \"A\" gene from an infectious molecular clone markedly reduces the infectivity of virions produced in a transient expression system (Strebel et al., Nature 328), 728-730 [1987]). We subsequently stuTfed the role of the \"A\" gene product by analyzing individual steps in the viral replication cycle using standard biochemical, immunological and molecular biological techniques. Results. Our experiments show that the elimination of \"A\" does not affect the env/CD4 interaction. We provide evidence that \"A\" has no influence on the efficiency of cDNA synthesis in vitro and that initiation occurs correctly at the tRNA primer binding site. We further demonstrate that viral particles with a morphology similar to wildtype particles are being released from transfected cells containing similar amounts of reverse transcriptase as well as unspliced RNA. We will present data concerning the localization of \"A\" and speculate about the function of \"A\" in the post-translational modification of viral proteins. Conclusions. \"A\" has an important role in the production of infectious virions. Unlike the HIV-1 tat or art gene products, however, the \"A\" (sor) protein-does not seem to have a function in the regulation of gene expression. Several lines of evidence suggest that \"A\" acts at the post-translational level and is possibly involved in the modification of some viral proteins. 1016 SPECIFIC CELL LINES CONTAIN REGULATORY FACTORS WITH HIV TRANSACTIVATOR ACTIVITY. Howard E. Gendelman, Ronald Willey, Arnold Rabson and Malcolm A. Martin Lab. of Mol. Microbiol., Nat. Inst. of Health, Bethesda, MD Objective. Examine whether cellular factors have HIVtaulike activity. Methods. A tat negative provirus (ptatO) was constructed by site directed mutagenesis. Viral specific RNA, reverse transcriptase activity (RT) and proteins were measured after transfection of ptatO and a replication-competent HIV proviral DNA (pNL4-3). Results. Following transfection ofptat0 into 10 different cell lines, HIV-specific RNA, RT activity, and proteins were easily detected in 2. HeLa and SW480 cells supported tat negative viral replication; lymphoblastoid and most adherent cell lines did not. The pNL4-3 transfected cells produced infectious progeny virus. A recombinant HIV DNA that expresses tat, restored replication in all 10 ptatO -transfected cell lines. Herpes simplex virus and phorbol myristate acetate which stimulate HIV LTR-directed gene synthesis did not substitute for tat. Conclusion. Cellular regultory factors present in certain cells may substitute for tat. This suggests an indirect action for tat in modifying synthesis of cellular regulatory factors. 116 [Page 117](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/115) 1017 HTLV-II transactivation is of Medicine, Los Angeles, California **Hernatology-Oncology, UCSD School of Medicine, San Diego, California Transcription from the viral promotor (LTR) of the human T-cell leukemia viruses type I (HTLV-I) and type II (HTLV-II) is regulated by nonstructural transacting viral genes located at the 3' end of their genomes. One gene encodes a protein (p40xI in HTLV-I and p37xII in HTLV II) which increases transcription from the homologous viral LTR (transactivation). An overlapping gene of unknown function (here designated as \"rex\" for \"regulator of expression\") has been identified in both HTLV-I and HTLV-II, We made recombinant constructs which express the rex gene product(s) of HTLV-II (p26X6/p24x6) in vitro and have verified synthesis of the rex protein (s) by radioimmunoprecipitation. We assayed for effects of rex on transactivation of the HTLV-II LTR, using a transient DNA transfection system in COS cells, and human lymphoid cell lines. Low levels of rex are necessary for optimal LTR linked expression in vitro. At low levels of expression rex acts to specifically augment transactivation. When rex mutations are introduced into infectious HTLV-II clones the resultant mutants transcribe very low levels of viral mRNA. However, as much higher rex expression levels are achieved in vitro an unexpected decrease in transactivation is observed, suggesting a possible role in establishing latent infection. These observations have implications for the regulation of other human retroviruses by transacting genes, specifically HIV. 1018 ANALYSIS OF THE REGULATION OF HIV GENE EXPRESSION USING SV40 BASED EXPRESSION VECTORS, Marie-Louise Hammarskjild, Jessica Heimer, David Rekosh Departments of Microbiology and Biochemistry, SUNY at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14214, USA An eukaryotic vector, pSVSX1, expressing large amounts of the HIV envelope proteins gpl60/120/41 was obtained by inserting the SalI-XhoI fragment, containing the env, tat and art/trs genes, from the BH10 isolate of the HIV genome into a late SV40 replacement vector. Cotransfection experiments using this vector and a LTR construct shows that pSVSX1 expresses a functional tat protein in addition to the envelope proteins. Western blot analysis of transfected monkey cells show that sera from some HIV seropositive individuals detect 4 distinct low molecular weight HIV specific proteins with apparent molecular weights of 15-25 kD. Northern blot analysis of RNA from transfected monkey cells show 3 HIV-specific mRNAs of 4000, 1150 and 700 bp. An env gene specific probe detects only the 4000 bp mRNA. In contrast to this, analysis of cells transfected with a deletion mutant of pSVSX1, lacking the second coding exon of the art/trs gene, shows only two small RNAs in increased amounts. The env gene specific probe fails to detect any mRNA in these cells. The deletion mutant expresses a functional tat protein, but does not express detectable amounts of envelope protein unless cotransfected with an art/trs containing vector. Our results indicate that art/trs is important for efficient envelope expression in this heterologous vector system and support the notion that art/trs is involved in the regulation of differential splicing of HIV mRNAs. Notes: 1019 art/trs PROTEIN OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) IS ESSENTIAL FOR SPLICING AND/OR TRANSPORT OF HIV TRANSCRIPTS CONTAINING envSEQUENCES. N. Ahmad, R. J. Mervis, E. P. Lillehoj and Venkatesan Lab. Mol. Inf. Dis., Bethesda, Md., 20892, USA. Obiective. To investigate the mechanism of HIV art/trs induced trans-activation. Methods. A replication defective HIV proviral DNA with a single nonsense codon in the art/trs ORF was complemented with expressible cDNA encoding art protein in DNA transfections using SW480 cells. art/trs effect on the transient expression of HIV env and gag ORFs fused to HIV LTR or an heterologous promoter was also analyzed. The complexity of the virus specific transcripts from proviral or subgenomic plasmid transfectants were examined by RNA filter blotting and nuclease S1 analysis of potential splice junctions. Results. art mediated activation of the art mutant provirus was accompanied by 1) vigorous expression of env gp160 and gag proteins, 2) increased levels of all species of viral RNAs, 3) marked increase in the relative levels of spliced 4.3 kb env mRNA, 4) complete shutdown of the HIV B ORF expression, and 5) altered splicing of the 1.8/2.0 kb RNA species leading to relative enrichment of tat and art transcripts. Using subgenomic plasmids containing HIV env ORF (in spliced or prespliced configuration) fused to either HIV LTR or an heterologous promoter,art/trs protein was shown to be absolutely required for the expression of env gp160, although env mRNA was transcribed efficiently in these systems in the absence of art/trs. However, art/trs was not essential for HIV gag expression from DNAs containing only the gag or gag and pol ORFs. Conclusion. The above results support the notion that art/trs overcomes the effects of a cis regulatory element inherent in the HIV env sequences that prevents the efficient splicing and/or transport from the nucleus of the transcripts containing these sequences. 1020 THE SAME INDUCIBLE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR REGULATES MITOGEN ACTIVATION OF HIV-1 AND THE IL-2 RECEPTOR (TAC). E Bohnlein, JW Lowenthal M Siekevitz, BR Franza* and WC Greene, Hughes Med. Inst., Duke Univ., Durham, NC 27710;* CSH Lab., Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724. A variety of mitogens activate both the HIV-1 LTR and the interleukin-2 receptor (Tac) promoter. Sequences required for mitogen induced IL-2 receptor promoter activation in different T cells have been defined by deletion mutagenesis. The specific interaction of inducible trans-- acting factors with these functionally defined sequences has been demonstrated. Using mutated oligonucleotides we have mapped the binding site of one of the factors to a 12 bp segment (-267 to -256). This IL-2 receptor promoter sequence was found to share striking sequence homology with the transcriptional enhancer df the HIV-1 virus. Competition experiments revealed cross-inhibitory effects of these two regulatory sequences for the binding of inducible nuclear proteins. The binding of a 86 kD inducible protein to both transcriptional elements was directly demonstrated using biotinylated oligonucleotides and 35S-methionine labeled nuclear extracts in a newly developed microscale DNA-affinity precipitation assay. Thus, while activation of the IL-2 receptor and HIV-1 LTR leads to opposing effects on T cell growth, these diverse responses are initially regulated by the same inducible transcription factor. 117 [Page 118](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/116) 1021 SEQUENCE SIMILARITIES BEIWEEN HIV-1 AND A IPTATIVE HUMAN LYMPHOCYTE GO/G1 SWITCH GENE Donald R. Forsdvke Department of Biochemistry, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, K7L 3N6 Objective. Entry of host T-cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle is necessary for productive infection with HIV. We wished to examine whether latent HIV and the genes regulating the entry of GO \"latent\" lymphocytes into G1 share common elements (e.g. sites for binding NFk B which increases in Results. Recombinant no.7 (c-fos) and recombinants (unidentified) contained, in a small AT-rich 3' non-coding region, the TTATITAT element characteristic of certain lymphokine genes and proto-oncogenes (Shaw & Kamen, 1986). There were also similarities with the TIRNNNlTITIT element (Renan,1986). The region containing this element in recombinant no.19 (TAGTITITGTAATITATITTC) differed by only a purine transition from the HIV-1 pol gene(3' coding region). Nearby is the sequence GGGACTCITC which shows similarity to the HIV-1 enhancer, a site of NFk B-binding. Conclusion. These results suggest that expression of latent HIV-1 might be regulated by factors which recognize sequences common to \"latent\" host GO/G1 regulatory genes and to HIV. The HIV pol. similarity implies that the 3' coding region of the latter gene serves both a coding and a signal-recognition function. This might confer the codon usage bias recently reported by Kypr & Mrazek (1987; Nature 327,20).

Gillon, J*, and Peutherer, J.F Routine screening of blood donors for antibodies to HIV was introduced in October 1985 using the Wellcome assay. Between March and December 1986, 10 donors (7 female, 3 male mean age 31.3 years, range 22-43) had repeatably positive or equivocal results on Wellcome EIA with negative confirmatory tests (different EIA + Western Blot). These donors have been assessed clinically and followed up for mean of 9.6 months (range 7-12 months). There were no relevant clinical abnormalities. None of the donors admitted to membership of high risk groups for HIV. One donor had tuberculosis 1 year previously, fully treated. Another had returned from Kenya 10 months previously, but had no sexual contact. 2 females were taking the contraceptive pill. 3 donors reported that the donation had been slow. The donors were re-tested 4-6 times (mean 5.2). 7 became repeatably negative on Wellcome EIA, 3 remained reactive. Confirmatory tests were negative at each attendance in all cases. All 10 donors remained completely well. Where tested, HLA antibodies were not found and hepatitis B markers were negative. T4/T8 ratio was measured in 8 donors and was abnormal in one (ratio 0.73, T4 0.3 x 109/L). This donor had become pregnant at the time. In 6 donors T4 was less than 1.0 x 109/L in spite of a normal ratio (range 0.35-0.95 x I09/L). Further follow-up will be reported, including sequential tests for HIV antigen and anti-HIV 2. *Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service South-East Regional Centre & Department of Transfusion Medicine, Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh EH3 9HB.

Notes: 1023 HIV INFECTION OF T-CELLS PROCEEDS VIA RECEPTOR MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS David Pauza+, Jose Galindo+, Todd Price++; +The Salk Institute, San Diego, CA and ++Department of Biology, University of California, San Diego Objective. Discern the infectious route of HIV particle entry into susceptible cells. Methods. 32P-labelled HIV was added to growing cultures of the lymphoid line CEM; the radioactive label was contained primarily in viral RNA. We observed the entry of these particles by determining the rate at which the label first became resistant to trypsin treatment, indicative of particle internalization, and then susceptible to RNase digestion in cell extracts; the latter characteristic reflects virus uncoating. Electron microscopy provided a visual parallel to the biochemical data. Results and Conclusions. At short times subsequent to adding radiolabelled virus to CEM cells, a fraction of the counts were observed to be trypsin resistant and RNase resistant, thus indicating that intact viral particles had been internalized. At longer intervals, this fraction of the virus particles became trypsin resistant and RNase sensitive, revealing that viral uncoating occurred at an internal cellular location. Electron microscopy confirmed the conclusion that intact HIV particles penetrated the T-cells and micrographs of viral:endosomal membrane fusion events were obtained. Accordingly, evidence is presented that infectious entry of HIV into susceptible T-cells proceeds via receptormediated endocytosis. In addition, more than 5,000 cellsurface bound virus particles were examined; no evidence was obtained to support the notion that HIV penetration occurs by direct fusion with the plasma membrane. 1024 ENDOCYTOSIS OF THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY Objective. This ultrastructural study analyses the entry of HIV-1 into lymphocytes. Methods. H9 cells of infected cultures were routinely prepared for transmission electron microscopy and systematically investigated. Results. HIV-1 could be observed adsorbed to the cell surface, near or inside coated pits, in coated vesicles, in vacuoles and multivesicular bodies. Neither fusion of the virus membrane with a vacuolar membrane nor the fusion of virus with the cell surface could be detected. Conclusion. We suggest that HIV-1, beside direct fusion at the cell surface (Stein et al., Cell 49, 659-668, 1987), can enter cells by endocytosis, comparable to other enveloped viruses. HIV is taken up by clathrin-coated pits into coated vesicles. These vesicles transport the virus to endosomal vacuoles and multivesicular endosomes (and lysosomes?), where the hardly detectable fusion of the membranes may occur, probably in a pH-independent way (lit.cit.op.) and mediated by proteins(s) like gp41, with 118 [Page 119](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/117) 1025 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) ENTERS CELLS BY FUSION WITH CELL MEMBRANE. J. L Ribas* **, T. Hase*, E. Hunter*, D. Fritz*, N. Khan* and D. Burke*. *Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the **Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, D.C. Objective. To compare by electron microscopy entry and exit of HIV in CD4+ human cell lines of lymphocytic origin -- H9 and DA1. Methods. Entry of HIV was examined at 4~C (2, 5, 10 or 30 minutes p.i.), at 37~C (2, 5, 10 or 30 minutes p.i.) or both. HIVinfected H9 cells or supernatant were added to 1X107 H9 or DA1 cells. To study release of [C14]-Phosphatidyl Choline (PC) during entry, HIV was added to [C14]-PC labelled H9 and DA1 (1x106) cells and the supernatant was counted at 0, 10, 30, 60 and 120 minutes p.i. Results. Only viral adsorption occurred at 4~C and was evident mainly on cell processes. At 37~C, adsorption and entry of HIV was seen as early as 2 min and the latter occurred by fusion of the viral envelope to the plasma membrane. Endocytosis of viral particles was not observed. Fusion of viral envelope resulted in focal disruption of the host's cell membrane and was accompanied by a small--5% of total cell radioactivity--but reproducible release of [C14]-PC in the supernatant. Virus morphogenesis (exit) was studied at 7-25 days p.i. As the nascent virion emerged from the cell surface the nucleocapsid changed from plate to crescent to ring-shaped electron-dense structures. In mature virions, however, it was condensed into tubular or round structures. Conclusion. HIV enters CD4+ lymphocytes in a temperature dependent manner by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane in which it causes multifocal alterations. Both entry and exit of HIV occur at the plasma membrane, but involve different mechanisms that can be distinguished morphologically. 1026 Kinetics of HIV gene expression David Baltimore*. *Whitehead Department of Biology, MIT, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA; +New England Deaconess Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA. HIV is different from other retroviruses in that it contains several small open reading frames (tat, R, sor, 3'orf. trs/art) in addition to gag, pol, and env. The protein products of these genes have been identified serologically and/or genetically. The presence of such genes indicates that HIV may have a complex way of regulating its own genes upon entry to host cells. Studies on kinetics of such viral gene expression will be crucial to understanding latency and pathogenic properties of virus. Investigating a possible differential gene expression of HIV requires an establishment of an one-step multiplication curve in which a large number of host cells are infected before the second round of infection. In our preliminary experiments, growth parameters such as the number of infected cells (by immunofluorescence), reverse transcriptase activity, and HIV-specific RNA were measured. By using altered virus preparation protocols, we were able to prepare high concentrations of infectious viruses and obtain a large number of initially infected cells. We found that HIV-sDecific RNA could be detected as early as 20 hours after infection ahd at least 6 % of host cells (human T cell line H9) were infected. Te are currently attempting to increase the number of initially infected cells and will perform RNA analyses during the course of one-step infection. Notes: 1027 STABILITY OF HIV IN VITRO AND INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON REPLICATION KINETICS Thomas Klimkait and Malcolm A. Martin National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 2089?, USA Objective. To investigate temperature effects on viral replication and to evaluate factors that influence infectivity and stability of HIV in vitro. Methods. Infections of a lymphocytecell line, A3.01, with LAV-1 were carried out at different temperatures to study influences of culture temperature on the kinetics of viral replication and cytopathic effects (CPE). Cell free infectious supernatants were exposed to various storage temperatures or subjected to repeated freeze/thaw cycles tn investigate virion stability, as measured by Reverse Transcriptase (RT) tests and immunoblotting. Results. Incubation of HIV-infected cells at 40.5~C results in an accelerated CPE and RT release as compared with 370C. In contrast, incubation at 340C leads to a delayed but sustained release of HIV particles. Storage of cell free supernatants at 40C preserves viral infectivity and RT stability over two weeks. At 370C, RT activity declines with a half life of two days; however, infectivity is completely lost after four days. Ten freeze/thaw cycles result in no difference in protein composition of the particles and no significant infectivity loss. Conclusions. Infection of cell cultures at reduced temperatures may be helpful for kinetic studies of HIV in vitro. Slowing infection may allow dissection of early events in the viral life cycle. The physiological temperature of 370C causes a rapid loss of HIV infectivity. RT activity in the medium is not a reliable indicator of the integrity and infectivity of virions. 1028 REOOMBINATIONAL RESCUE OF DFELTIVE HIV DNA PRESENT IN THE CHROMOSOMAL SEQUENCES OF for Control, Atlanta, GA **University of Texas at Dallas, ***University of California, Davis, USA Objective. To analyze the interaction of integrated and unintegrated HIV DNA. Methods. We have constructed a series of truncated HIV DNA retaining either 5' or 3' end of the viral DNA. In addition, we have also generated proviral DNAs with internal deletions leaving 5' and 3' ends intact. All of these DNAs were transfected into rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells by transfection method. Recombinational rescue of defective HIV DNA was monitored by assaying HIV particles released from the cells. Results. Truncated HIV DNAs and pSV2Neo DNA were mixed at a ratio of 10:0.1 ug and transfected into RD cells. Cells, resistant to G418, were selected and used as a target for a second round of transfection with different deletion mutants of HIV. Recombination resulting from single and double crossover (gene conversion) has been noted using appropriate HIV mutant DNA. Conclusions. These experiments provide evidence for genetic exchange by homologous recombination between extrachromosomal and *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, **University of California, Davis, USA Objective. To analyze genetic recombination between HIV DNAs. Methods. We have generated nonviable deletion nutants of three different HIV-1 strains (HIVzr6, HIVSF2 and HIVHTLV III) using the infectious proviral molecular clones. HIV proviral DNA containing deletions were introduced into the cells by DNA transfection. Successful recombination between DNA was assayed by the recovery of infectious virus particles after transfection. HIV antigen assay was used to quantitate the anount of viral particles. Results. RD cells, transfected with truncated HIV proviral DNA, released HIV particles indicating that homologous recombination had occurred between DNAs. The frequency of recombination depended on the amount of DNA transfected and the region of homology between the DNAs. Conclusions. We have demonstrated that homologous recombination is possible between HIV DNAs. This methodology enables construction of hybrid HIV to identify the viral determinants responsible for tropism, replication, and cytopathic features. 1030 HOLOOUS R MBINATION IN HIV: DNA SEQUENCE OF CROSSOVER SITES R. Jannoun-Nasr, S, Kalyanaraman, A. Srinivasan, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA USA Objective. Analysis of the crossover sites between HIV DNA fragments with overlap to understand more about the processes associated with recombination. Methods. HIV proviral clones designated pZ6Neo and pXba (generated from cells infected with HIVZr and HIVtLV III, respectively) were used to generate truncated HIV clones with only either 5' or 3' end of the genocme. Both 5' and 3' viral DNA fragments were transfected into rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells by DNA transfection method, and the viruses released from the cells were quantitated by antigen assay. Results. The extent of overlap between the 5' and 3' fragments is less than 100 bp. Recombinant viruses generated from transfection of these fragments into cells were passaged in PHA-stinulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. High molecular weight DNA, extracted from cells 7 days after virus infection, was used as a source of integrated viral DNA sequences. DNA sequence analysis of the junction fragnent derived from recombinant HIV revealed that crossover site is found in the region of high DNA homology. Conclusion. These results are useful for understanding the requirements for homologous recombination in HIV. Notes: 1031 iOMOLOGIES BETWEEN SMALL NUCLEAR RNAs \\ND REGIONS OF THE HIV-2 GENOME AND THEIR POSSIBLE ROLE IN THE CYTOPATHIC EFFECT VIRUS Janos Minarovits, Judit Segesdi and Istvin Fbldes Microbiological Research Group of the National Institute of Hygiene, Budapest, Hungary Objective: Based on homologies and complementarities of HIV-1 and small nuclear RNA sequences we have suggested that the cytopathic effect of the virus is due -at least partly- to the inhibition of processing of cellular hnRNAs (1). We studied whether this relationship is also valid in case of HIV-2. Methods: Computer-aided comparison of nucleic acid sequences (nucleotides 2-27) A 56% sequence complementarity extending over bases was also noted between nucleotides 412-490 of HIV-2 and 180-100 of human U2 RNA. Conclusion: Interference with hnRNA processing could contribute to the cytopathic FROM 1 ^032 ENVELOPE CAPABLE OF ELICITING TYPE SPECIFIC NEUTRALIZING AND FUSION BLOCKING ANTIBODIES IN du Pont de Nemours & Co., Medical Products Dept., Wilmington, DE, *Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. The presence of neutralizing antibodies is of great importance in the course of a viral infection. Objective. To determine the epitopes in the envelope of HIV-1 capable of raising neutralizing antibodies. Method. Since previous studies have shown that PB-1 region of HIV-1 envelope can elicit neutralizing antibodies in animals, we have synthesized overlapping peptides, fifteen amino acids in length, covering the entire PB-1 region of HIV-IIIB. Guinea pig antisera raised against the peptides were tested for their biological activities. Selected human sera were fractionated on affinity columns made of reactive peptides and the activity of eluted antibodies assessed. Results. All but five peptides elicited antipeptide antisera but only one peptide, 1-69 (aa 308 - 322), raised antibodies that had both neutralizing and cell fusion blocking activities and these activities were type specific. The same peptide also reacted with 20 of the 49 human HIV-1 positive sera tested. Conclusion. Using synthetic peptides, we were able to establish a sequence of fifteen amino acids in the PB-1 region of HIV-IIIB capable of eliciting both neutralizing and fusion blocking antibodies in animals. 120 [Page 121](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/119) 10 3 Structure-Function Analysis of HIV Envelope/ CD4 Receptor Regions Relevant to Virus Replication and Kowalski, Sodroski Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA Mutations introduced into the HIV envelope gene previously characterized for ability to interfere with the formation of syncytia have been studied for interference with the processes of virus entry and cell killing. Mutations in the CD4 receptor that interfere with binding to the HIV gpl20 envelope protein were defined. Implications of results of these studies for understanding the interaction of HIV envelope and receptor will be discussed. 1034 SITE SPECIFIC MUTANTS IN DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF THE HIV ENVELOPE CAN IMPAIR INFECTIVITY IN VITRO T. of Viral Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 ***Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, USA Objective. To identify functionally important domains in HIV gp120 and gp41 envelope proteins. Methods. Site specific mutagenesis has been used to introduce mutations into both gpl20 and gp41. Mutagenized env fragments were introduced into: 1) an infectious moTecular clone of HIV or 2) vectors capable of expressing envelope. Phenotypes of different env mutants were evaluated following transfection by monitoring protein synthesis, virus production and infectivity. Results. Mutants containing alterations in a CD4 binding domain of gp120 were evaluated in particle production and virus infectivity assays. gpl?O mutations that did not affect binding to CD4 in an in vitro assay, resulted in non-infectious virus particles. Mutations in another portion of gpl20 had no detectable effect on the interaction of particles with the CD4 receptor yet generated virions blocked at an early step in infection. HIV mutants containing alterations affecting the hydrophobic N-terminal region of gp41 failed to induce syncytia and did not initiate a productive viral infection. In several instances, replication-competent revertants which contained compensatory amino acid substitutions were identified. Conclusion. The HIV envelope proteins contain functionally discrete domains which are critical for viral infectivity. Notes: 1035 gYNCYTIA WITHOUT DETECTABLE INFICTIOUS K.Dahl, G.Miller, T.Burrage. Yale Univ. School of bepts. Pediatrics and Epidem. and Public Health.N.Haven,CT. USA Objective:To explore mechanisms of decreased HIV expression in an EBV-transformed B cell line (X50-7) originally productively infected with initially contained HIV titratable to 10-4 and produced virus for about 9 months. Then because immunoblots(IB) of cell extracts showed decreased HIV expression, other assays were used to probe for HIV. These included electron microscopy(EM) and reverse transcriptase(RT), core(p24) using antisera. In addition, LL58 cells were cocultivated with X50-7.8 cells. Results:Cell-free virus was undetectable by RT, AC, and INF. FA revealed extremely rare positive cells and IB had only a weak band of MW 27kd. EM of LL58 cells showed no extracellular virus; very rare cells showed an occasional virion which appeared intravesicular. However, cocultivation yielded numerous syncytia within only 24-48 hours which expressed HIV by FA and were specifically inhibited by HIV polyvalent antisera. Repeated experiments suggest 1:5000 LL58 cells is capable of initiating fusion. With fusion, EM showed limited numbers of extracellular virions; longer cocultivations (10-14 days) caused release of enough HIV to be passed from supernatants to fresh X50-7.8 Conclusions:Syncytial formation induced by cells not producing detectable HIV provides a unique and presumably less hazardous model for study of non-productive HIV infection as well as for study of viral and cellular membrane interactions. The syncytium-inhibition assay may have clinical utility (see abstract: Brenner et al.). 1036 THE ROLE OF THE CARBOXY-TERMINAL PORTION OF THE HIV-1 TRANSMEMRANE PROTIN IN VIRAL TRANSMISSION AND CYTOPATHOGENICITY Shu-Jan Lee*, A. Fisher, W. Hu, H. Mitsuya, D. Looney, M. Manek, L. Ratner** and F. Wong-Staal. *LTCB, National Institute of Cancer, Bethesda, MD. **Washington University, St. Louis, MO. Objective: To determine the role of the carboxyterminus of gp41 in virus replication and propagation, a panel of mutants containing env, 3'orf, and 3'LTR deletions were studied for their capacity to produce virus in Cos-1 cells and to propagate in H9 and Molt3 cell lines. Cytopathic effects upon ATH8 cells were also examined. Results: Clones up to -76 were capable of RT production as long as deletions did not affect the tat or trs genes. Mutants up to -37 were capable of transmission in H9 lymphoblastoid cells after coculture with transfected 00S-1 cells. Mutants of -17 or greater were incapable of transmission in Molt-3 cells, while mutants of less than -14 could propagate in both H9 and Molt3. Radioimmunoprecipitation of LR329 (-0), LR372 (-15), and X9-3 (-5) in Molt3 cells demonstrated production of expected envelope proteins. Deletions of greater than -5 resulted in remarkedly reduced cytopathicity of cell-free virus (Fisher 1986). Conclusion: Previous studies with sor mutants indicate that the predominant mode of virus transmission in Molt3 cells involves cell-tocell spread. The results observed with the LR clones suggest that the C-terminal region area of gp41 is critical in cell-to-cell but not cell-free virus transmission. dicine and Dept. of Pathology, College of Physicians & Surgeons, Colubia Lhiv. New York City, NY, fEA and ** pt. of Biological Chanistry, The Hebew LUiversity of Jerusalem, Israel Cbjective: To study the rechanism of fusicn between HIV and various cells, the kinetics of fusion, terperature and pH dpennce of fusion process, the effect of neutralizing antibodies and rrcnoclonal antibodies (T4, T4A, T8) on fusion, the role of different drugs (AZT, AL 721, etc.) in the inhibition of virus-cell fusion. Mtthods: In this study, an assay system based upon incorporation of the fatty acid prcbe octadscylrhoamine (R18) into gradient purified virions is used. The probe is queniced in the labelled virion and upon fusion with cells, it becOres dequenched, which reflects viruscell fusion and makes it possible to quantitate the extent of fusion between HIV and various cells. Results: Gradient purified and fluorescently labelled HIV was fusion was reasured by using spectrofluorimeter. The extent of fusion differed frcm 0-30% depening or, the cell type. The optinun anmunt of labelled viricns required for fusion (2.5ug/l x 10C cells) the cell ccncentraticr (1 x 106/10Cul), pH of rrediun (pH = 8), tire and terperature (15 min at 37~C) kinetics were determined.

The experiments to study the role of different drugs (AZT, AL 721) in the inhibition of virus-cell fusion are in progress. Conclusion: The use of the present system allows, for the first time, study of questions relatecd to the quantitative aspects of HIV-oell fusion, host cell range of the virus, the factors affecting the fusion process and the role of certain drugs in the inhibition of virus-cell fusion. 1038 A QUANTITATIVE SYNCYTIA ASSAY FOR HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIVI ENVELOPE PROTEIN AND ITS USE TN STUDYING MUTATIONS J.M. Felser, K. Strebel, T. Klimkait, R.L. Willey, M.A. Martin, J. Silver Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA Objective. A quantitative syncytia assay for env protein that does not utilize infectious material is used to study the effect on cytopathicity of mutations in envelope and regulatory genes. Methods. Mutations were made in the env and R sequences of HIV-1 and incorporated into a plasmid, pNCAl, which contains a 4.2 kb deletion of gag and pol sequences. This plasmid contains coding sequences for and appears to express the tat and art/trs regulatory genes as well as the env, A, and B ORFs. Transfection of this plasmid into monolayers of HeLa-CD4 cells leads to expression of env protein and formation of syncytia that are easily enumerated after staining. Results. Syncytia formation did not occur when various mutations in the carboxy-terminus of gpl20 and the amino terminus of gp41 were incorporated into pNLA1. No effect on syncytia induction was observed with a mutation in the second conserved domain of gpl20. A mutation in the B ORF of pNLA1 led to approx. 10-fold more syncytia than pNLA1, strongly suggesting that pNLA1 expresses the B gene product and that its env expression is negativeTy regulated by it. Conclusion. We describe a syncytia assay for HIV env protein that involves a single plasmid, is easily quantitated, does not involve infectious material, and allows for study of the effects of mutations in env and regulatory genes. Notes: 1039 HIV-INDUCED *Department Microbiology and Immunology, Tulane University School of Medicine, **Imreg, Inc, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA Obiective. To determine whether alterations in intracellular concentrations of Na+ and K+ are associated with HIV-induced Methods. Intracellular of 22Na+ and 86Rb+ a K+ tracer, were quantitated during the acute phase of HIV-induced cytopathology in H9 cells. Intracellular levels of 86Rb+ were also quantitated after exposure of H9 cells to monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against CD4, a lymphocyte cell surface protein which serves as a receptor for HIV. Results. HIV-induced a significant increase in the intracellular levels of 22Na+ and 86Rb+. Activities of the Na+/K+ ATPase and a K+ channel were reduced. Leu3a, a MAb to CD4 which blocks HIV attachment, increased 86Rb+ levels in mock-infected cells. However, OKT4 MAb, which binds to CD4 but does not block HIV attachment, failed to increase intracellular 86Rb+ levels. Conclusions. HIV-mediated increases in intracellular Na+ or K+ could induce osmotic cell swelling which may be involved in two mechanisms of HIV-induced cell killing, cell-cell fusion and lysis of single cells. In addition to serving as a virion receptor, CD4 may also be involved in the HIV-induced increase in intracellular K+. 1040 DETECTION OF HIV IN CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) USING IMMUNE SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY(ISEM) Anders Sbnnerborg*, Nybom**, S \"The Central Microbiological Laboratory of Stockholm County Council, **University of Stockholm, ***Karolinska Hospital, ****Roslagstull Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Objective. To study the occurrence of HIV in CSF obtained from patients in different stages of HIV infection. Methods. Latex microspheres labelled with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) directed against the p24, gp41 and gp110 antigens of HIV were incubated with 0.1 ml of CSF from 50 HIV infected patients and from 31 HIV negative controls. The beads were collected on the surface of a polycarbonate filter, coated with ionized gold and analyzed in a scanning electron microscope. HIV isolations were performed on 29 CSF samples. Results. Particles binding to the MAb-labelled microspheres were found in 37 of 50 CSF samples obtained from HIV infected patients but in none of the control samples.The positivity rates were equally high in patients with PGL, ARC or AIDS (70%,81%,75%, respectively) but lower in patients without clinical signs of immune dysfynction(40%). CSF from all of three tested patients with primary HIV infection were positive. HIV isolation was positive in 19 of 29 CSF samples of which 23 were positive by ISEM. Three samples were negative by ISEM and positive by HIV isolation. Conclusion. ISEM is at least as sensitive as virus isolation for the demonstration of HIV infection in CNS, which occurs in high frequency during all stages of the disease. 122 [Page 123](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/121) 1041 101 THE MORPHOLOGY OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) BY NEGATIVE STAINING IL CHRYSTIE, June D ALMEIDA. Dept Virology, St Thomas's Campus, UMDS, LONDON. OBJECTIVES. To study the morphology of HIV by negative staining, and to investigate, by IEM, the ability of the virus, or virus components, to react with antibody. METHODS. HIV-1 (H9/RF) and HIV-2 (CB20/C8166) were the source of material for EM examination. Virus was used for negative staining after simple differential centrifugation. Various monoclonal and clinical sera were used to study Ag/Ab interaction. Negative staining and IEM used standard techniques. RESULTS. Although it was possible to visualise both HIV-1 and HIV-2 the higher particle count of HIV-2 made this a more suitable source of virus. Virus could be visualised as a fringed lipoprotein envelope containing a core that could be shown by model simulation to be cone shaped. IEM has revealed the virus to be unusual as it does not form the immune aggregates associated with most virus systems. However it is hoped that further study will show that if conditions and reagents are correct then Ag/Ab interaction can be visualised. CONCLUSIONS. HIV has a morphology not associated with other human viruses but is similar to that of maedi-visna virus. HIV does not react in a standard manner in IEM tests. 1042 COMPUTER ENHANCEMENT IMAGES OF THE HIV Ichiro Takahashi*, M Takama* and A-M Ladhoff** *Central Laboratory for Electron Microscopy, Teikyo Japan. **Institut fur Pathologishe Anatomie. Humboldt Universitat zu Berlin. Objective. It is well known that the HIV, the etiological agent of the AIDS, infect and destroy the helper/inducer T-cell, i.e., CD4(T4,Leu3) positive T-cell. Though many reports have been described on the structures or the genes of HIV, the three-dimensional(3-D) morphological structures have not yet been indicated. In this report we show some computer image processing results on the HIV particles observed in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Methods. Produced HIV by infected H9 human T-cell line were fixed. The morphologically well preserved particles were furthermore in-put into a computer image processor for the rotate avelaging procedures. Results. According to the results of rotated symmetry on the envelope, we could get many image enhancements at n= 5,6 or 7(3600/n) indicating icosahedral structures. Moreover further analysis of the rotated symmetry on the morphologically well preserved spikes(gpl20) revealed good image enhancements at n=18 or 20(3600/n) corresponding to an icosahedron with T=7 surface net. Conclusion. During the rotate avelaging procedures on the HIV TEM images in a computer image processor, the followings could be suggested. 1)From the analysis on the envelope, icosahedral structures were indicated. 2)According to the results from spike enhancements, we concluded that the HIV particles might have 72 spikes on the T=7 icosahedral surface net. We also intend to show a 3-D model. Notes: 1043 THE ARRANGEMENT OF ENVELOPE PROJECTIONS ON THE SURFACE OF HIV M. Ozel, G. Pauli, Hans Gelderblom Robert Koch-Institut und Bundesgesundheitsamt, Berlin, FRG The envelope of morphologically immature HIV is densely studded with surface projections (knobs) lO imin length, which are shed spontaneously during maturation. The number and spatial organization of the envelope knobs of four different isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2 was studied using thin section and surface replica electron microscopy. All HIV strains show an identical pattern of knobs: The surface of a well-preserved HIV particle is studded with 72 knobs arranged in a T = 7 leavo symmetry. The role of the p17 protein, which is covering the inner leaflet of the viral envelope, is discussed as a matrix protein layer scaffolding the envelope and its projections during morphogenesis as well as the mature virion, giving rise to an isometric particle with a high order of symmetry. 1044 REQUIREENTS FOR CLEAVAGE OF HIV-1 GP160 FOR INFECTIVITY H G Guo, F diMarzo-Veronese, R C Gallo, M S Reitz Jr Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, NCI, NIH, Bethesda MD 20892 The envelope proteins of retroviruses are synthesized as a polypeptide precursor which is specifically cleaved to large exterior glycoprotein and a smaller transmembrane protein during virus maturation. The cleavage recognition signal involves basic amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the large exterior glycoprotein and in the case of HIV-1 is thought to occur after a lys-arg pair at positions 510-511. A mutation of the penultimate lys residue to leu was introduced and its effect studied by transfection in the form of a biologically active clone into cos-1 cells. The transfected cells produced an extracellular particle as judged by media reverse transcriptase activity and electron microscopy, but these particles lacked infectivity for H9 cells. Radioimmunoassays showed that the gpl60 envelope polypeptide precursor was expressed but was not processed to the gpl20 and gp41. The level at which virus infectivity is abrogated by this mutation will be discussed. Further work is underway to define the cleavage recognition site for the HIV-1 gpl60. 123 [Page 124](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/122) 1045 IMPORTANCE OF CYSTEINE RESIDUES 4 TO HIV ENVELOPE FUNCTION Erwin Tschachler, R C Gallo, B Beaver, H Buchow, G Lisby, M S Reitz Jr Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Md, USA. Objective. Cysteines within the envelope are highly conserved among all strains of HIV-1, suggesting that disulfide bonds are important for the tertiary structure. To help understand structure-function relationships of the HIV-1 envelope and identify functionally important domains, we analysed the consequences of elimination of cysteines from the gpl20 of HIV-1. Methods. Single cysteines within the gpl20 were replaced by other amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis. Viruses containing the respective mutations were analysed at different levels. Results. Mutants of HIV-1 with single cysteine residues replaced at positions 131 (cys 131) and 196 (cys 196) of the gpl20 express viral proteins from transfected cos-1 cells, and reverse transcriptase is readily detectable in the cell free supernatants. However, neither mutant particle was able to infect H9 target cells. Electron micrographs of the viral particles indicated that the cys 131 mutation resulted in morphologically normal virus particles, whereas with the cys 196, only immature viral particles were present. The exact step where infectivity is blocked is currently under investigation. Conclusion. Substitution of certain single cysteines within the gpl20 of HIV-1 profoundly affects the infectivity of mutant viral particles. 1046 ORIENTATION OF ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN, gpl60, 1046 OF HIV-1 IN VIRAL AND CELLULAR MEMBRANES Omar Kamal Haffar*, W Nunes*, P Berman* Genentech, Inc., So. San Francisco, CA, USA Objective. To determine the orientation of gpl60 of HIV-1 in biological membranes. Methods. The env gene of HIV-1 was mutagenized in the M13 using mismatched synthetic DNA primers to generate variants with mutations in gp41. The biosynthesis and export of the variants was studied in vivo in transfected cell lines and in vitro in a translation-coupled translocation system using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate and canine pancreas microsomal membranes. Antibodies to various regions of gp41 were used to locate the corresponding determinants in envelope proteins translocated into biological membranes. Results. Transfection of the env gene of HIV-1 into CHO cells allowed for the isolation of stable cell lines that constituitively produced g0160. Variants of gpl60 that encoded proteins that terminated upstream of amino acid 683 were secreted from transfected CHO cell lines. These studies demonstrated that the first hydrophobic domain in gp41 was unable to serve as a stop transfer sequence and suggested that the transmembrane domain was located downstream of residue 683. Proteolytic digestions studies of gpl60 translocated into evidence that gpl60 possesses a single transmembrane domain, and that residues downstream of amino acid 706 extend into the cytoplasm. Conclusion. gpl60 is a simple bitopic membrane glycoprotein that possesses a single transmembrane domain.

Conclusion: The computer-assisted 3-D analysis of thin-sectioned cells at a depth resolution in the range of 20-40 nm represent a new tool for the documentation and analysis of cellular ultrastructure and proved particularly powerful in the study of HIV-infected cells. 1048 REAPPEARANCE OF HIV CORE ANTIBODIES AND CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT IN THREE PATIENTS WITH I Clinic Inf.Dis. University Genova, **** Chemical Labor. Bolzano - Italy Introduction. We report an unusual serological profile in drug addicts with AIDS. Methods. Our drug addicts with HIV infection and AIDS undergo periodically clinical examinations, bioumoral and sero-immunological tests (HIV-Ab, core recombinant: EIA). Results: In each above mentioned Center it was found only one case with an unexpected course of HIV core antibodies. At the first examination all three, one women and two men, were symptomless. The Western-Blot showed the presence of all detectable antibodies. In the follow up the p-24 antibodies disappeared and consequently opportunistic infections occurred: one pneumocystis-pneumonia and two cryptococcal-meningitis. The opportunistic infections healed after antimicrobial therapy; it followed a general clinical improvement concomitantly with the reappearance of anticore antibodies, 5,7 and 11 mounths respectively after the diagnosis of AIDS. Conclusions. It is known that the loss of HIV core antibodies, like in our patients, has an unfavorable prognostic significance. The onset of opportunistic infections might be associated with an enhancet depression of the'immune system. In our rare cases such depression was followed by some restore of the immune function accompanied by HIV core antibodies reappearance and clinical improvement. 124 [Page 125](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/123) 1049 Optimization of conditions to assure the reliability of RIPA as a confirmatory test. M. Fauvel, R. Laboratoire de sante publique du Qu6bec, Sainte-Anne-deBellevue, Quebec, Canada. Objective. To optimize conditions affecting the reliability of RIPA as a confirmatory test for the detection of HIV antibody. Methods. HIV-1 (LAV) was grown in CEM cells. Titre of recovered virus was measured in relation to each inoculum. Metabolic labellings with 35S-cysteine of HIVinfected CEM cells (MOI <.001) were carried out at different times post-infection. Incorporation was measured by precipitation of labelled proteins with TCA and by immunoprecipitation of labelled antigen with a positive control serum. Square box titrations of the reference serum with different antigen concentrations were carried out by RIPA. Results. Repeated passages of undiluted HIV supernatants decreased virus recovery. Peak radiolabelled antigen production was best observed when 35S-cysteine was added to cultures showing 30% infected cells, as revealed by immunofluorescence, even though antigen was produced at broad-ranging times after infection. The ratio of radioisotope incorporated in viral and cellular polypeptides varied with each batch. A broad-range in concentrations of antigen did not significantly affect the serum endpoint titre. However, square box titrations allowed selection of the antigen concentration at which visualization of viral polypeptides was optimal. Conclusion. Reliability of RIPA was best achieved through control of virus stocks and standardization of antigen as measured by the amount of radioactivity immunoprecipitated with a reference HIV serum. 1050 ENVACOR II: AN IMPROVED COMPETITIVE ENZYME IMMUNOASSAY (CIA) FOR DIAGNOSIS OF EXPOSURE TO HIV, J. Shih, R. Allen, S. Webber, S. Donoghue, J. Pawlowski, R. Fico, G. Dawson. Abbott Laboratories, Abbot Park, IL 60064. Objective. Development and clinical testing of an improved Competitive Enzyme Immunoassay for the diagnosis of exposure to HIV. Methods. Envacor II is a specific and sensitive competitive immunoassay (CIA) which allows separate detection of antibodies to p24 and gp41 proteins of HIV. Enhanced sensitivity has been achieved with a new competitive format and the use of purified recombinant antigens and HRPO conjugated anti-p24 and anti-gp41 monoclonal antibodies. Results. 100% sensitivity has been shown by positive results from 252 blot positive samples. AIDS ARC ASYMPT RANDOM percentage of COR positive samples decrease with progressive disease state. Serial dilutions of 8 positive samples show an enhanced detectability of positive samples over current licensed tests by a minimum of 3 to 5 serial dilutions. Three seroconversion panels show enhanced detectability of samples 2 to 4 bleeds (2 to 6 weeks) sooner than current tests. Conclusion. These studies demonstrate the utility of this test for diagnosis of exposure to HIV and separate detection of antibodies to either p24 or gp41. Notes: 1051 USE OF CHROMIUM DIOXIDE PARTICLES FOR HIV ANTIBODY TESTING. R. Diaco. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours and Co., Wilmington, DE U.S.A. Objective. The use of chromium dioxide particles as the solid support offers many advantages. We have adapted this support to assays using either HIV viral-lysate or recombinant derived proteins to detect HIV antibodies. Methods. The assays are performed by incubating sample, diluent, and chromium dioxide particles for 30 minutes at 37 C. The particles are washed to remove nonspecific antibodies and incubated with an alkaline phosphatase conjugate for 30 min at 37 C. After washing, the particles are incubated with a 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate for 5 minutes at 37 C followed by measurement of the fluorescent product. Results. Preliminary evaluations of the viral-lysate assay with 2148 normal donors and 179 Western blot confirmed positives suggest that that specficity and sensitivity of the assay are 99.8% and 100%, respectively. Additionally, we collected and tested 110 Du Pont HTLV-III ELISA repeat reactives and 61 Abbott HTLV-III EIA repeat reactives which test as negatives or indeterminate samples in Western Blot assays. Our particle assay detected only 6 of 110 (5.5%) and 1 of 61 (1.6%) of the Du Pont and Abbott false positives, respectively. Chromium dioxide particle assays using the recombinant ENV9 or the recombinant pair P-121 and PG2 had equivalent sensitivity (ability to detect Western Blot confirmed positives) and detectability (ability to detect serially diluted positive samples) as the viral lysate assay. Conclusion. Chromium dioxide particles offer advantages in assay speed and performance, and the potential for many levels of automation. 1052 RELIABLE DETECTION OF LOW TITRE ANTI HIV 1 WITH A NEW ULTRASENSITIVE ELISA PROCEDURE U. Krupka*, D. Weifhaar** * Kreuz, D-3500 Kassel Objective. A modification of the competitive principle was developed for detection of extremely low Anti HIV 1 titres. Methods. The incubation of undiluted specimens over 60 min (37 OC) is directly followed by addition of peroxidase labelled human Anti HIV. After 30 min (37 oC) and 5 washings the chromogen tetramethylbenzidin and H 0 is added. The enzymatic reaction is stopped after23d min (RT) with H SO and readings are made at 450 nm. The cut off value is defined as 50 % of the negative control mean. Results. By testing serial dilutions of 14 Anti HIV positive specimens the detection limit of the new assay was consistently found to be 16 to 64 fold better than that of 3 commercial tests. Depending on the evaluation criteria of Western blot we found the new test 10 to 20 fold more sensitive than this confirmatory test. A total number of 251 confirmed Anti HIV positive sera were all found clear cut positive (sensitivity 100 %) and among of total number of 2800 normal blood donations there were only 2 repeatable weak positive reacting specimens (specificity 99,9 %) without staining virus specific proteins in Western blot analysis. Conclusions. If the efficacy of this ultrasensitive assay will hold true with respect to very early stages of HIV infection, a new dimension in the field of HIV diagnostics will be disclosed. 125 [Page 126](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/124) 1053 DEVELOPMENT OF A QUANTITATIVE METHOD WITH A WIDE LINEAR RANGE FOR EVALUATION OF ANTI-HIV ANTIBODIES USING RADIOACTIVE SECONDARY IgG BINDING REAGENTS. Tsehaynesh Messele, Jonas Blomberg, Per Johan Klasse, Section of Virology, Dpt of Medical Microbiology, University of Lund, Solvegatan 23, S-223 62 Lund, Sweden. Objective: Serodiagnosis has been the most vital method for screening of HIV infected persons. Serology can be standardized and made more accurate by a quantitative approach. Methods: Evaluation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) bound to electrophoretic immunoblot (EIB) strips was performed by means of 125-I labelled monoclonal anti-human IgG and protein G, and densitometric transmission measurements of autoradiograms.of the EIB strips. Results: Densitometry of autoradiograms was found to be more sensitive and linear up to a higher concentration of bound IgG as compared to the reflectance measurements of the coloured bands on immunoenzymatically stained strips. A weak band contained around 0.1 ng and a strong band around 50 ng of IgG. The portion of total patient IgG which bound to HIV proteins was 0.1-0.010%. To evaluate the clinical applicability of our method antibodies to different HIV proteins were monitored in sequentially sampled sera from 20 HIV seropositive persons (5 diseased, 15 healthy) were analyzed. ng of IgG bound were correlated with state of health. Conclusions: IgG bound to EIB strips can be sensitively, reproducibly and accurately measured using radiolabelled reagents. Quantification of bound IgG is a prerequisite for calculation of average antibody affinities and antigen/antibody equilibria which could be of importance for the understanding of the IgG mediated defence against HIV and be prognostically useful. 1054 IMPROVED ELISA TECHNIQUES FOR THE STUDY OF ANTI-HIV ANTIBODY RESPONSES AT THE CELLULAR LEVEL * J.P. Vendrell, **J. Reynes, Chauliac Montpellier Objective: to provide tools for studies on the T and accessory cell regulation of anti-HIV antibody responses in human and animal models. Methods: BALB/C mice were immunized with heat killed HIV. Their spleen cells were incubated for 18 hrs (37~C 5% C02) in wells from the Pasteur HIV-ELISA biotinylated anti mouse Ig reagent, a streptavidinperoxydase amplifying complex and two different peroxydase substrates were used for the enumeration of anti HIV secreting cells and for an estimation of their output. Results: 1 - a \"spot-test\" using aminoethylcarbazole as an insoluble substrate evidenced 10 to 12 spots for 2.106 cells/well. This anti HIV secreting cells in an immune spleen. 2 - an \"in situ\" test using OPD as a soluble substrate showed that as few as 2.106 cells/well gave positive responses with at least 0,8 OD while a classical ELISA technique with serum and no cells evidenced 0,8 to 1 unit OD for 10 1 of a 1/100 dilution of the corresponding sera. Notes: 1055 A HIGHLY SPECIFIC SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE EIA FOR THE DETECTION OF ANTIBODY TO HIV. Andrew Watson, Raymond Houghton, Jim Klaniecki, John Montana, Mike Wandell and Lynn Goldstein. Genetic Systems Corporation, Seattle, WA. Objective. Current commercial tests to detect antibodies to HIV are based on disrupted virus. They require an alternative technology for confirmation due to false positive reactions which are known to arise from cellular impurities, membrane-associated HLA antigens, or crossreactivity to HIV core proteins not correlated with exposure to HIV. The latter are known as atypical or indeterminate samples. Improvements in virus preparations and assay modifications have reduced false positive rates, however, these improvements are unable to reduce significantly the false positives associated with atypical samples. To improve the accuracy of assays for detection of HIV antibody, Genetic Systems has developed a new, highly specific and sensitive synthetic peptide based EIA. Results. The GSC Peptide EIA is essentially non-reactive with virion EIA positive western blot atypical samples. In prospective and population studies this assay did not react with 235/242 atypical samples tested. The 7 reactive samples were subsequently characterized as early in seroconversion. The GSC Peptide EIA has also been tested with 642 confirmed seropositive samples collected from globally diverse locations between 1983-1987. This EIA has shown 100% specificity when tested with 1233 normal donor sera. Conclusions. While atypical and early seroconversion samples are usually indistinguishable using current licensed techniques the specificity and sensitivity of the GSC Peptide EIA enables discrimination between these sample groups. Synthetic peptides offer the opportunity to develop second generation immunoassays devoid of specificity problems associated with virion or recombinant antigens. 126 1056 DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPETITIVE ELISA (CEIA) TO ANALYSE THE SEROTYPE SPECIFICITY OF ANTIBODIES TO HIV RELATED VIRUSES. A. BAILLOU*, B. JANVIER*, D. LETURCQ*, F. DENIS**, G. LEONARD**, A. GOUDEAU*, F. BARIN*. * Virology lab. TOURS France, ** Microbiology lab. LIMOGES France Objective: To develope a simple, cost-saving, sensitive, specific assay, that allows to distinguish sera positive for antibody to HIV1 from sera positive for antibody to HIV2. Methods: Microtiter plates are coated with either purified human IgG to HIV1 envelope glycoproteins for half of wells or purified human IgG to HIV2 for the other half. Viral antigens from lysates of either HIV1 or HIV2 infected cells are bound to the corresponding antibodies, and then antibodies eventually present in serum samples compete with biotinyled human IgG to either HIV1 or HIV2. The reaction is revealed by addition of peroxydase labelled streptavidin and substrate. 277 sera of known reactivity assessed by western-blot (109 HIV1 +, 75 HIV2 +, 11 with double exposure, and 82 negative) were used to standardize the CEIA. Results: 75 out of 75 HIV2 + sera were HIV2 + by CEIA without cross-reactivity to HIV1 wells. 82 out of 82 negative sera were negative by CEIA. 107 out of 109 HIV1 + sera were HIV1 by CEIA without cross reactivity to HIV2 wells. However 2 HIV1 + sera were negative on both antigens, indicating a lack of sensitivity for the HIV1 assay. 11 out of 11 sera with double reactivity by Western-blot were also double reactive by CEIA. Conclusion: Our CEIA allows the serotyping of antibodies to HIV1 or HIV2 with the same specificity than the Western-blot. However the sensitivity for the HIV 1 assay needs to be improved. Such assay that is simple and cost-saving would be very usefull for seroepidemiological studies in areas were both types of HIV are prevalent.

Development of an anti-p24 specific test, based on viral-p24, for application in the clinical lab. Methods. The so-called sandwich inhibition assay (SIA), consists of antibody bound to a solid-phase in combination with a capture antigen and an antibody-enzyme conjugate. Reactive antibodies will inhibit the sandwich. As capture antigen a partially purified viral lysate preparation is used. Specificity is obtained by application of anti-p24 monoclonal antibodies (McAb's) for coating and/or for conjugation. Results. Anti-p24 McAb's were obtained after immunization with viral lysate. The antibodies were characterized by western blotting and by binding to viral lysate and recombinant p24 protein, as well as by blocking experiments using McAb-HRP conjugates. Two groups of McAb's with distinct specificities were identified. This indicates the presence of at least two immunoreactive epitopes on p24, which was confirmed by experiments using synthetic peptides. Various combinations of McAb's, and polyclonal antisera (human and sheep), were evaluated. Best results were obtained using a combination of McAb's. The resulting assay can be performed in one step of 90 minutes, and has a detection limit better than anti-p24 assays using recombinant antigen. Conclusions. Using viral-p24 antigen an anti-p24 specific test is developed by application of McAb's in a sandwich inhibition EIA. The assay-procedure is simple and the detection limit of this clinical test is superior to the tests based on recombinant proteins. 1058 HIV-1 INFECTION IN SOME SUDJECTS DISPLAYING ANTIBODIES AGAINST ONLY THE GAG PROTEINS M.SPANAKISM.THEODOROPOULOU,K.MAKRIS.A.KARVE LAS.P,FOUNTOULI.A,K;ATRAKAZOU O.AXENIDOU. E.MALLIARAKI.J.PAPAMATHEAKIS.V.GEORGOULIAS. School of Medicine of University of Crete; AIDS Reference Center of Crete, Venizelion Hospital; Blood Transfusion Center of Apostolos Pavlos Hospital. Athens, Greece 55 out of 25463 (0,22%) blood donors from Crete and Athens tested for HIV-1 infection showed a bordeline reaction with the ELISA test. 29 of them displayed antibodiues against only the gag proteins of HIV-. In several cases studied, this pattern of reactivity could not be modified for up 12 months. Immunofluorescence studies using antl-gp 20 and anti-p25 moAbs releaved 7-13% and 8-13% positive cells, respectively, in 6 out of 13 cases.Mitogenic stimulation of PBL indused the membrane expression of these proteins in 3 additional cases, PHA stimulated PBL from some of these subjects were co-cultured with HIV-permissive cells and ultracentrifugated pellets of supernants were hybridized with cDNA probes encoding for HIV-1 and HIV-2 specific genes. Dot blot analysis releaved a positive reaction with the tat (HIV-1) cDNA probe in 3 out of 5 cases whereas env (HIV-2) cDNA probe gave a positive reaction in 2 out of 8 cases. An inversed CD4/CD6 ratio was detected in 5 out of 10 studied subjects. These findings strongly suggest that: (1) some of these subjects are infected with HIV or a closely related virus; (2) this infection seems to be abortive allowing to an incomplete antibody response; and (3) the evaluation of the screening results should be very cautious as it concerns the blood transfusion and the prevalence of HIV infection. Notes: 1059 WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS OF HIV-I IgG IN SERA OF ASYMPTOHATIC CARRIERS FOR THE EVALUATION OF SIX COMMERCIAL ELISA KITS G. Achilli, E. Cattaneo, M. Danesino, E.G. Rondanelli Department of Infectious Diseases, IRCCS S. Matteo, Pavia, Italy Objective. To evaluate the specificity of Elisa results in the screening of sera from drug abusers. Methods. Serum specimens from 846 drug abusers were tested for HIV antibodies using the following ELISA kits: Berhing Enzygnost anti HIV micro, Dupont HTLV-III ELISA, Diagnostic Roche anti >:IV EIA, Pasteur Elavia Ac-Ab-Ak, Organon Vironostika anti HIV, following the instructions of the manufacturers. The specimens choosen for western blot included any positive test on different ELISA, and specimens with a quanti tative value near to the cut-off. The western blot tecnique was performed on strips prepared in our lab. Results. Positive ELISA results obtained with the different kits and confirmed by western blot technicue ranged between 92.62% to 95.83% for p24 ts ranged from 0% to 2.30%. Conclusion. Although the sensitivity ano sp'cificity of each kit appear similar, western blot analysis showec, in few sera, reactivity only for a single protein (p24 or gp 41). Therefore these results should be confirmed by other techniques as RIPA, IFA/IPA. 1060 Performance of commercial elisa kits for HIV antibody in testing problem sera. D. COOK, C.H. SHERLOCK, University of British Columbia and Provincial Laboratory, British Columbia, Canada. Commercial HIV antibody (ab) elisas perform with high sensitivity and specificity but false positives may result in low positive predictive Values in low-prevalence populations and false negatives remain a problem. Most performance studies have included low percentages of such problem sera. We have evaluated 4 \"2nd generation\" HIV ab elisas (Abbott (Abb-2), Ortho (Or), Genetic Systems (GS), DuPont (DP)) with sera (a) that were false positive with \"1st generation\" kits (Abbott (Abb-l) and Electronucleonics (ENI)) and (b) from early seroconvertors, which are likely to be false negative. False positive (FP) sera were positive by ENI (21) or Abb-l (4) or both (1) and negative by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Early seroconvertor (ES) sera were all p24 ab positive but gp41 ab negative by Western blot (all patients later developed gp41 ab). Of 25 FP sera, 2 (8%) were positive by GS and 1 (4%) each by DP, Or and Abb-2. Of 11 ES sera, 10 (91%) were positive by all 4 kits. When these results are combined, positive and negative predictive values (PPV ab elisas perform with acceptable control programme, Task F6rce for Child Survival, *x- Uganda Virus Research Institute, Entebbe. Objective To determine the most appropriate HIV-1 screening test for Uganda. Methods Sera collected from representative hospitals as part of the evaluation of the WHO Clinical Case Definition were tested with the following:Wellcozyme, Wellcozyme Monoclonal, Virgo, Organon, Dupont, Serodia, Elavia II, Dot EIA, Red Cell Adherence test. Confirmatory/supplementary tests were carried out using immunoblots from Biorad, Dupont and Pasteur. Results Sensitivities, specificities and predictive values positive for 4 of the tests are shown below. Others will be presented. 1062 COMPARISON OF TWO ELISA a-HIV TESTS. Organon (H9 celline) and the Abbott (recombinant) elisa anti-HIV tests. Methods: The serum samples which were repeatedly positive with the Organon (Abbott) test were also tested with the Abbott (Organon) test and confirmed by the Immunoblot assay (I.B.), performed in the Central Lab. of the Bloodtransfusion Service, Amsterdam. Results: Test N Initially + Repeatedly + Organon 22.904 519 (2.3%) 57 (0.3%) Abbott 10.939 pos. 1x positive both Organon and pos. (all Ix both Organon and Abbott pos. Conclusion: 13 samples were positive with the Organon elisa test, using a statistical cut-off and a 1:34 dilution, while the Abbott test was negative. Those 13 samples showed dubious results using the Immunoblot assay: P18/P24/P51/P55/P64/GP41/GP45/GP160 in different combinations. After 4 months 4 tests became negative, while a sero-conversion was not shown (yet). At the presentation of this study we plan to report the other results. Further studies have to be done to show whether the gain of sensitivity is preferable to the loss of specificity.

To compare the results of two confirmatory tests for antibodies to HIV, Novapathtm Immunoblot and radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA), using specimens that were discrepant by initial ELISA and Immunoblot. Methods. Of 5371 serial specimens from 2460 homosexual men, there were 209 whose initial ELISA and Immunoblot results were discrepant. These 209 specimens were tested by RIPA and retested by ELISA and Immunoblot. Reactivities to each of 8 major viral proteins were compared. Results. Of 170 specimens negative by repeat ELISA, Immunoblot and RIPA detected at least one reactive band for 80 and 53 specimens, respectively. Among ELISA negative specimens, 2.1% of the band locations were reactive and 81.8% were nonreactive by both RIPA and Immunoblot. In 16.1%, there was disagreement regarding reactivity; this disagreement was evenly divided between the two techniques. In the 39 ELISA positive specimens, there was agreement on the presence of reactivity in 62.2% of the band locations and in the absence of reactivity in 15.4%. There were disagreements in 22.4% of the band locations. In 72.8% of these discordants, a band was detected by Immunoblot but not by RIPA. Conclusion. These data suggest that Novapath Immunoblot strips are more sensitive than RIPA in the evaluation of these selected specimens, and that the use of RIPA as an exclusive confirmatory technique may not be appropriate. 1064 A PASSIVE HAEMAGGLUTINATION TEST FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF HIV-1 ANTIBODIES R Sher*, S Antunes*, S Allam**, H Troonen**, G Scheffel***. *Department of Immunology, School of Pathology, University of the Witwatersrand and South African Institute for Medical Research, Johannesburg, South Africa. **ABBOTT Diagnostics, Wiesbaden, West Germany. ***ABBOTT Laboratories, North Chicago, U.S.A. Objective. Evaluation of a passive haemagglutination test for HIV-1 antibodies. Methods. 314 Sera were tested with a passive haemagglutination test, (ABBOTT HIV-PHA). All Sera were previously tested using 1) Abbott recombinant EIA, 2) Biochrome synthetic peptides EIA and 3) Wellcozyme EIA. Sera were obtained from homosexual men, haemophiliacs, Malawians, Zambians, Mozambicans, Swazis, West Africans and people with auto immune diseases. Sensitivity was assessed by end point titration. Results. 240 Sera were found to be positive by at least 2 EIA's and 245 with HIV-PHA representing 5 initially reactive Sera which were negative on repeat testing. Cross reactions with auto-immune Sera were not found. Dilutions of 1/6400 were still found to be positive and compared favourably with other EIA's. Conclusions. 1) The HIV-PHA was found to be both sensitive and specific. 2) Requires minimal skill and equipment, 3) would be very useful in 3rd world countries, 4) a modified test kit using a loop for measuring Sera and other improvements is currently being evaluated and should further simplify the measurement of HIV-1 antibodies. 128 [Page 129](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/127) 1065 EVALUATION OF TWO ENZYME IMMUNOASSAYS FOR THE DETECTION OF HIV ANTIGEN IN AFRICAN AND EUROPEAN SERA Guido van der Groent, P. Nyst, B. Willemsl, 6. Vercauterent, J.S. Huismantl, P. Piott. t Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belqium tt Central Laboratory Bloodtransfusion, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Objective: African HIV isolates have been documented to be antiqenicaiiy more heterogenous and HIV p24 antigen levels in African sera were reported to be lower in European sera. To systematically evaluate which HIV-Ag tests are most affected by these conditions, we are evaluating the Orqanon Vironostika HIV (developed by Innogenetics, Belgium) and the Abbott HTLV-III antigen EIA. Methods & Results: Eighteen supernatants of HIV infected peripheral blood lymphocyte cell cultures and continuous HIV producing cell lines, as well as 11 African and 8 European sera of HIV infected patients were screened with both methods. An overall correlation of 100 7 was obtained between the two tests when eighteen supernatants of virus cultures were tested of which 15 were HIVI, two were HIV2 and one ANT 70 type (human retrovirus different from HIVI and HIV2). The Organon test gave consistently higher OD specimen / OD cut off values (OD ratio), particularly for the two HIV2, strains as well as for ANT 70. Comparative titration of two HIVI supernatants with both methods resulted in equally high HIVI-Ag titers. Eight European sera scored positive in both tests except one serum which was positive in the Abbott test (OD serum / OD cut off = 1.88) and just under the cut off value in Organon. Of 11 African sera tested there was agreement on 3 positive and 6 negative sera by both tests (82 7 correlation). However, 2 sera were Organon positive and Abbott negative. Organon positive HIV-Ag results were confirmed by a specific confirmatory test using monoclonal p24 HIVI antibody coated beads resulting in a ] 50 X reduction in OD of the serum when retested in the Vironostika HIV test. One African serum was not confirmed, which was positive in both tests. Conclusions: The Organon Vironostika HIV and the Abbott HIV-Ag tests gave comparable results for HIV1 although the Organon test gave higher OD ratios. The Organon Vironostika HIV test appears to have a better ability to capture other HIV types and African HIV1 p24 genetic variants. 1066 HIV-testing of 429.029 sera: COMPARISON IMMUNFLUORESCENCE AND WESTERN BLOT FOR DETECTION OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ANTIBODIES B.L.Schmidt, Vienna-Lainz, Austria from general hospital inpatients, blood donors and 19.927 sera from subjects at risk for AIDS were tested by an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 3.276 positive samples were further analysed by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and Western Blot (WB). False nonreactive IF or WB results were not found. IF yielded non specific fluorescence in 0,73 % (24/3276) (both infected and uninfected test-cells reactive), WB was non interpretable in 2,23 % (73/3276). Non specific IF results are possibly due to the presence of HLA DR antibodies; not interpretable WB specimens in most instances show p 17 or p 24 bands in combination with p55, p 68 or p 75. Specificity of IF (98,92 %) has been shown to be at least as high as that of WB (96,70 %). With WB testing antibody reactivity against individual HIV-antigens can be analysed and this technique thus seems essential not only for confirmation of screening test but also for the control of disease progression or treatment. IF, however, is easy to perform, cheap and thus useful wherefacilities for WB testing are not available. Notes: 1067 oF 1067 OBSERVER AGREMENT STUDY OF IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE (IF) and Imnunology Progranne, Department of Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Objective: Western Blot (WB) and irnunofluorescence (IF) are recognized confirmatory tests for the enzymeimrunoassay (EIA) screening test for HIV antibody. We conducted an interobserver agreement study between two laboratories to evaluate the IF test. Methods: IF employed acetone fixed HIV-1 infected H9 and uninfected HUT-78 cells mixed at a 1:3 ratio in one circle on a glass slide and HLT-78 cells alone in a secoid spot. Sera diluted 1:10 in PBS pH 7.4 and FITC-anti hunan IgG diluted 1:20 containing 0.1% anido black to quench non-specific fluorescence were incubated for 30 minutes each. This procedure easily distinguished between sera containing anti HIV antibody and sera with anti lymphocyte antibody. Sera from blood donors (76), AIDS/ARC (11), multiply tranfused patients (6), and others (9) were tested and observed blind by trained technologists in two laboratories. Results: 80 sera were repeat EIA positive and 27 of these were WB (anti p24 and anti gp41) positive. 118 out of 122 IF results including 20 repeats were identical between laboratories for a Kappa agreement of 0.93. All discordants were EIA positive, WB negative and read as IF positive by one laboratory. Of 4 WB indeterminant sera (having only anti p24 or gp 41) 3 were EIA negative and 1 positive and all 4 were negative by IF. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that IF is a good alternative to WB as a confirmatory test for HIV screening, providing rapid (2 hr) and reproducible results. 1068 PROBLEMS WITH HTLV-I ANTIBODY DETECTION BY ELISA, p24-RIA AND WESTERN BLOT TESTS Agius*, MD,**Biotech Research Laboratories, Rockville, MD,***New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ. Objective. We have studied the patterns of antibody response to human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) on 368 sera from the Caribbean basin, USA, Japan and Africa. Subjects represented a variety of clinical features: adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, other leukemias and lymphomas, other diseases, drug abusers (IVDA). Methods. Three serological assays were used: ELISA, RIA for the p24 (p24-RIA), and Western Blot (WB). Results. ELISA and p24-RIA used as screening tests agreed in 86.4%, The results from 247 selected sera were compared with WB as reference test (positive: p19 and p24; negative: blank; any other profile was indeterminate). WB was reactive in sera 5 to 25 times more dilute than the last dilution positive by ELISA or p24-RIA, but sensitivity varied in different WB lots. Compared to WB, ELISA was more sensitive (90.9%) than p24-RIA (82.8%). However,the p24-RIA specificity (100%) was higher than those of ELISA (96.5%). Indeterminate WB interpretations occurred in 25.5% (63 sera). The WB profile among seropositive IVDA was different from other positive subjects; this may indicate infection with cross-reactive viruses. Among healthy people, positive WB reactivity increased with age whereas indeterminate WB declined (p =.034). Conclusion. These data illustrate the low levels of antibody to HTLV-I and emphasize the need for more sensitive and specific tests for HTLV-I infection. A-9 129 [Page Central of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, \"Academical Medical Centre of Amsterdam Objective. 1) To compare the sensitivity of different first- and second-generation anti-HIV assays with respect to early detection of HIV-infection. 2) To examine the frequency of exclusive early detection of HIV antigen (without detection of anti-HIV) when firstand second-generation anti-HIV Wellcome), PHA assays (Abbott, Fujirebio), Western blot (Dupont), RIPA for detection of anti-HIV and a HIV antigen assay (Abbott) were evaluated. Sequential serum samples from 20 male homosexuals, taken at 1-3 months intervals during early HIV-infection, were used to define the times of seroconversion with these assays. Results. Second-generation assays detected anti-HIV earlier first-generation assays and in some seroconverters newly developed assays were even more sensitive than Western blot. In 7 men (out of 20) HIV antigen was detectable during early HIV-infection. The number of men in whom HIV antigen was exclusively detectable diminished considerably from 5 to only one when second-generation assays instead of first-generation assays were used. Conclusion. Application of highly sensitive secondgeneration anti-HIV assays in bloodbanks and HIV testing services is the most important step to reduce the risk of unrecognized HIV-infection. 1070 COMPARISON OF THE SENSITIVITY OF FIRST- AND SECOND-GENERATION ANTI-HIV 1 ASSAYS FOR THE *Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service **Red Cross Blood Bank Amsterdam Objective. Evaluation of several anti-HIV 1 assays with respect to their capacity to detect early anti-HIV 1 seroconversion samples and anti-HIV 2 positive sera. Methods. Two sets of early anti-HIV 1 positive serum samples (n=15, n=10) and one set of anti-HIV 2 positive serum samples (n=13) were diluted two-fold in normal human serum. The endpoint titres of these serum samples were determined with several assays i.e. Western blot 125J-RIPA (Abbott, Fujirebio). Results and conclusions. Newly developed assays of several manufacturers detected significantly higher endpoint titres in anti-HIV 1 seroconversion samples than the first-generation ELISAs and some assays were significantly more sensitive than the commonly applied confirmatory Western blot. Differences were also observed between assays in their capacity to detect anti-HIV 2 positive serum samples. Notes: *Fibiger Instituttet, **Hvidovre Hospital, Co1enhaqen, Denmark Objective. To compare the sensitivity for detecting HIV p24 antibodies (p24-Ab) of a newly developed indirect EjISA (iEF-ISA) with that of the iLmunoblotting test (IBT) and commercial competition E-ISA (cEbISA). ETISA used immunoaffinity native whole virus vlsate an-i the cELISA recombinant HIn core protein as antigen sources. 60 serum samples from 35 HIV infected persons were analysed: 27 healthy persons (43 samples, 2 persons followed from acute infection), 3 persons with clinical progression (11 samples, 1 person followed from acute infection) and 5 AIDS/APC patients (6 samples). results. The overall agreement of the iE.IPA. and the IBT was 93.3%. 52 samples were positive for p24 in both ioEISA and I3T, of which 24 (46.2%) were positive in the cEJISA. _All the 24 cELISA positive samples were derived from healthy individuals, whereas the 20 cE)ISA. neoative samples were 1 from a natient with acute '-IV7 infection, 18 from healthy individuals and 9 from APC/AIDS natients. The cEGIS-A was able to distinguish amona healthy persons with normal or low T-helner cell count (r=9.043), as was the iEKISA by titration (p=0.027). Conclusion. The iELISA with its specificity and sensitivity eoual to that of the IBT and its convenient LF7ISA format is thus very suitable for titration of p24-Ab. 1072 ELISA CONFIRMATORY TEST FOR HIV ANTIBODY MORE SENSITIVE & SPECIFIC THAN WESIERN BLOT Carl Saxinger*, G. L-Wantzin**, R.C. Gallo*, National Cancer Institute, U.S., **Bispebjerg Hospital, Copenhagen OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the western blot (WB) procedure and the current definition of antibody positivity by WB banding pattern. METHOD. Asymptomatic homosexual males (n-1121) were screened by ELISA antibody competition involving competitive blocking of ELISA reactivity by heterologous HIV antiserum. The confirmatory ELISA data were further validated by testing of follow-up sera, and in separate prospective studies in risk groups and experimentally infected chimps. Confirmed blocking of HIV monoclonal antibodies verified potency of the system. Comparative sensitivities in reconstitutions were 100 times greater than standard ELISA and 10 times greater than WB. RESULTS. HIV1 ANTIBODY NEUTRALIZATION RESULTS.BAND PRESENT OR (ABSENT) Standard ELISA Cut Low ELISA Cutoff gp41) 272 57 All 372 samples with evident p24 and gp41 WB bands were confirmed positive and therefore should represent true positives. The additional 20 confirmed sera (WB indeterminate) represent seroconverters, blood contact and atypical responses. CONCLUSION. We estimate that between 5 to 10% of high risk antibody positive sera could be missed by current ELISA screening and WB tests. 130 [Page 131](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/129) 1073 COMPARISON OF THREE SEROLOGIC TESTS( ELISA, KARPAS CELL TEST AND WESTERN BLOT) FOR ANTIHIV-1 AND SEROLOGIC EVALUATION OF ANTI-HIV-2 WITH THE University Clinical School, England Objective: Two hundred sixty four individuals were evaluated for HIV infection at the Immunodeficiency Clinic (Feb 86-July 87). Methods: All sera were tested for anti-HIV by ELISA( repeated when positive or doubtful=80-99% of cut-off values). The positive sera were confirmed by Western Blot( and also checked with Karpas test). Karpas cell test for HIV-2 were performed in all individuals. Results: ELISA:74 positive, 3 doubtful and 187 negative WB: all 77 were positive Karpas: HIV-1: 75 positive and 2 doubtful HIV-2: none of the 264 sera were positive. Conclusion: In this population( mostly male homosexual or bisexual) the three tests gave similar results. The Karpas cell test is a cytoimmunoenzymatic assay, employing HIV infected T cells; these cells are fixed in acetone in glass slides and the reaction may be visualized by naked eye. It is a simple test, does not require special equipment and should be further studied as a possible confirmatory test. HIV-2 infection does not seem to be a problem yet among our patients. ***supported in part by a grant from FINEP(Brazil) 1074 EVALUATION OF 13 KITS FOR HIV ANTIBODIES WITH A REFERENCE PANEL OF AFRICAN SERA CC Mathiot*, MC Georges-Courbot*, AJ Georges* * Pasteur Institute, Bangui, Central African Republic Objective. A panel of 43 selected sera samples has been established so that african laboratories can perform a comparative evaluation of their own technology for HIV antibodies detection. Method. The panel included 13 positive sera, selected for giving a reaction range from weak to strong, 14 negative sera, including 8 sera susceptible to false positive, and 4 successive dilutions, to 1:10, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200 of 4 positive sera. The reagents tested included 3 Western blot kits (BIORAD, DU PONT, PASTEUR), 6 direct Enzymo-Immuno Assays (EIA) (ABBOTT, DU PONT, ELECTRO NUCLEONICS, ORGANON, ORTHO, PASTEUR), 2 competitive EIA (BEHRING, WELLCOME) and 2 agglutination tests (ABBOTT, ALMEIDA). Results. Concerning detection kits, the best results were obtained by 3 direct EIA (DU PONT, ORTHO, PASTEUR), followed by one agglutination kit uncorrect results for each test. As to convenience of test procedure, the simplicity of the agglutination method makes it well adapted to laboratories where complex technologies are not yet available. Interpretation of difficult to interpret African sera using Western blot technic is given. Notes: 1075 ENZYMATIC AMPLIFICATION OF HIV DNA FOR THE DETECTION OF RARE VIRAL INTEGRATIONS INTO THE HUMAN GENOME Lobbiani A.*, M. di SanitA, Roma, Italy. Conventional serological tests for AIDS diagnosis are biased by serum cross-reactivities and by anomalous patterns of viral proteins occasionally revealed. The more informative detection of viral sequences in the human DNA is virtually impossible by standard hybridization techniques, due to the low number of viral copies integrated into the human DNA of peripheral blood cells. We have successfully applied the polymerase chain reaction technique to the detection of HIV sequences present at frequencies as low as one viral genome over six million human genomes. A fragment (about 170 bp long) of the gag gene is in vitro amplified for 30 cycles by the thermostable DNA polymerase and the amplified DNA can be easily detected as a sharp UV-fluorescent band on agarose gels; therefore the presence of viral sequences could be monitored even without specific hybridization probes. We have found viral sequences also in serologically negative blood samples. This will provide a better evaluation of HIV diffusion in the population. 1076 NEW PLAQUE FORMING ASSAY FOR HIV-1 PROVIDES A SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC ASSAY FOR HUMAN NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES. Dano Biologics Res., FDA, **Div. of Toxicology, FDA, ***Dept. of Trans. Med., NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA Objective To develope a sensitive plaque forming method for measuring the number of infectious HIV-1 in a given sample. Method The monolayer cell is the T4+ HeLa cell line constructed by Maddon et al (Cell 40:93). Cell-free intact HIV-1 or infected H9 cells can be used to infect the monolayer, giving discrete macroscopic plaques. Results The number of plaques i.s linarly proportional to the input, of virus, whi h i mp1: >: > s.ing (iitr;.l: Ii-ing anti be measured as the reduction in the number of plaques. Two thirds of the antisera from seropositive individuals give greater than 50% plaque reduction at a dilution of 1:200, while 9 normals and 5 HTLV I infected patients have no effect. The antibodies neutralize cell-associated virus as well as cell-free virus. The same sera neutralize both IIIB and RFII isolates at the same titer, suggesting group specific neutralization. Conclusions These results suggest that a vaccine which could elicit similar antibodies might protect against multiple variants of HIV---1 and could also be active against cell--associated virus. 131 [Page 132](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/130) 1077 ESTABLISHING QUALITY ASSESSMENT IN AIDS TREATMIENT EVALUATION UNITS (ATEU) IN THE USA: VIRUS ISOLATION FROM PERIPHERAL BLOOD. JWM Gold, FB Hollinoer, C van der Horst, L Myers, R rlakuch, W Parks and the NIH-NIAID AIDS Treatment Branch Objective. To compare isolation rates and time to isolation of HIV from blood specimens Letween virology laboratories performing virus isolation in ATEU clinical trials and to develop optimal techniques and standards of performance for virus isolation. c'lethods. Over a 6 month period, 12 units of blood from HIV infected or uninfected individuals were shipped overnirht by air express to 21 centers serviced by 19 laboratories. PBlCs were separated, cultured for 28 days and sampled twice weekly for virus growth using commercial EIA P24 antigen kits. No attempt was made to standardize culture methodology. Ability to isolate virus and time to first detection of virus growth were determined for each laboratory. Results. Laboratories differed in the ability to isolate virus and in time to isolation. Seven laboratories isolated virus from all completed specimens and showed little variation in the time to positivity for each culture. Two laboratories failed to isolate virus from more than half of the specimens. The remaining laboratories had intermediate isolation rates. Conclusions. A program to assure uniform performance standards for HIV isolation by laboratories in multicenter trials is being implemented. An ongoing quality assurance program is essential for evaluation of virologic endpoints. 1078 USE OF HIV REFERENCE SERA IN MAILED PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SURVEYS IN THE UNITED STATES Thomas L. Hearn, R Taylor, C Griffin, M Robinson, R Wood, H Muir, G Elwell Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, USA Objective. To provide human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing laboratories with HIV reference sera for assessing their HIV testing procedures; to evaluate, from the composite data, the HIV testing capacity of laboratories in the United States; and to compare the HIV testing results for the samples used in this study with results from previous analyses. Methods. One vial each of a positive and a negative reference serum was mailed on November 16, 1987, to each laboratory enrolled in a voluntary performance evaluation program conducted by CDC. Information was requested about the enzyme immunoassays (EIA), indirect immunoflourescence assays (IIF), and Western blot (WB) tests used by the participants. Participants were also asked to report the highest titer of the positive serum that yielded a positive result. Results. EIA results were reported by 665 laboratories; IIF, by 52; and WB, by 175. Eleven different kits or methods were used by participants reporting EIA results. The highest titer yielding a positive result for the positive reference serum was 1:8,000,000 for EIA, 1:10,240 for IIF, and 1:2,560,000 for WB. Conclusion. HIV antibody-positive and antibodynegative reference sera are valuable tools for standardizing tests and for evaluating the capacity of laboratories to perform testing. Notes: 1079 TESTING FOR HIV INFECTION IN THE UNITED STATES: EVALUATING LABORATORY PERFORMANCE Roger N. Taylor, C Griffin, T Hearn, M Robinson, R Wood, H Muir, G Elwell Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, USA Objective. To develop a Model Performance Evaluation Program for emerging technologies, using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing as a specific application. Methods. CDC awarded three contracts and one cooperative agreement in September 1987. The contractors will identify laboratories in the United States that conduct HIV testing, collect information on laboratory characteristics and testing practices, collect sera and prepare samples for performance evaluations, and develop and implement a plan for alternative approaches to mailed proficiency testing. A school of public health, under a cooperative agreement, will assess the quality of HIV testing and the impact of such testing on public health. Results. Some expected outcomes of the program are (1) a database of information that describes the testing practices and the physical and technical characteristics of laboratories, (2) strategies for effective HIV testing problem identification and problem resolution, (3) an informational exchange system for analyzing of laboratory testing data, and (4) an effective system for evaluating new and emerging technologies. Currently, 809 laboratories are enrolled in the voluntary program. Conclusion. A national, ongoing laboratory surveillance system is needed to monitor the quality of rapidly changing technologies. 1080 A CONSENSUS: SERODIAGNOSIS OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS INFECTION BY WESTERN BIOT JR Carlson*, J Yee*, P Watson-Martin**, E Carrow*** and the members of the Consortium for Retrovirus Serology Standardization *University of California, Davis, **Immunological Associates, Beaverton, OR, ***University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA Objective. To develop a consensus on: 1) the effectiveness of Western blot (WB) for the serodiagnosis of HIV infection, 2) the best procedures for WB, and 3) the current needs and future directions for the serodiagnosis of HIV infection. Method. The Consortium for Retrovirus Serology Standardization was organized by representatives from more than 30 blood donor center, public health, reference, clinical and research laboratories in the USA. Three, two day consensus development conferences were held in which three sets each of 20 \"problem\" specimens were used to evaluate WB performance and to develop reccamendations. Results. The consensus is: 1) The Western blot is the most sensitive and specific assay for HIV serodiagnosis, 2) WB proficiency is dependent on optimal reagents and procedures, 3) WB should only be performed by those with adequate proficiency, 4) The major gene products of diagnostic significance by WB are p24 (GAG), p31 (POL), and gp41 (transmembrane) and gp120/160 (ENV), 4) There is now a great need for more adequate quality control and training programs. Conclusion. The WB is a sensitive and specific method for HIV serodiagnosis, but WB is highly dependent on the use of optimal reagents and procedures. 132 [Page 133](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/131) 1081 THE EFFECT OF WHOLE BLOOD ON THE PERFORMANCE OF HIV ANTIBODY ELISA TEST SYSTEMS J. Kay*, G Ford**, T Flowers* *Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC, **Bionetics Research Inc., Kensington, MD Objective. To demonstrate the effect of whole blood specimens on the performance of sensitive ELISA systems for detection of antibody to HIV. Methods. High performance ELISA systems for detection of HIV antibody were developed on both bead and stripplate formats and subjected to normal and high concentrations of whole blood erythrocytes. Borderline sensitivity and specificity specimens were subjected to this stress(Table below). Whole blood was spiked with sensitivity dilution panels and tested. Clinical specimens from high risk centers were tested. The effects were evaluated. Table. Effect of RBC on detection of HIV antibody.

The development of high sensitivity/specificity ELISA systems for detection of antibody in serum and plasma has been essential to the protection of blood supplies. It is essential to have tests of comparable performance for whole blood. These studies indicate that some high performance ELISA systems are functional with blood. 1082 PROGRAM STANDARDIZATION AMONG STATE LABORATORIES IN THE U.S.A. PERFORMING HIV TESTS W.J. Hausler, Jr.*, J.Mehsen Joseph**, Arthur F. DiSalvo*** *State Hygienic Laboratory (Iowa), **Health Laboratories Administration (Maryland), ***Bureau of Laboratories (South Carolina) Objective. Processes used to promote HIV procedural standardization among U.S. public health laboratories are described. Methods. Surveys of the laboratory practices of the fifty-four members of the Association of State and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors were conducted by mail. Conferences were held to achieve laboratory program standardization by conferee consensus. Results. Annual surveys conducted since 1985 show the growth of programs and increased effectiveness of support to overall public health control measures. Surveys have contributed to the exchange of information and identified extent of laboratory support capabilities. Data are presented on the utilization of various test methods, costs and patterns of change. Three consensus conferences have been held with the first conducted in May 1986. Procedural unification and standardization are demonstrated. Conclusion. In countries where there are a number of different jurisdictions operating public health laboratories, the process conducted by the ASTPHLD (U.S.A.) of survey, identification of problems, issues and needs followed by conferences yielding standardization through consensus has been extremely effective. Coordination of public health laboratory programs is a major contribution to an effective epidemic control program. Notes: 1083 COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF AN EXTERNAL QUALITY CONTROL TEST FOR PROFICIENCY IN TESTING FOR ANTI-HIV-1. - A STUDY IN WEST-GERMANY W. Klietmann, G. Jung, F. Strik, Institute for Laboratory Medicine, 4130 Moers, Zum SchUrmannsgraben 30, West-Germany Objective. Seventyseven major clinical laboratories in West-Germany participated in an external quality controltest to demonstrate proficiency in the diagnosis of antibodies against HIV-1. These laboratories represented those in universities, hospitals and bloodbanks. Each participant received ten aliquots of sera. Five specimens were negative controls. Three sera showed strong positive reactions for the presence of HIV-1 antibodies, and two showed weak reactions. Methods. The sera were diagnosed in the various labs by use of seven different commercial ELISA-tests. In addition, as confirmatory tests immunofluorescence, a combined envelope/core-recombinant-EIA, and the Western-Blot were applied. The participating labs tested the aliquots by use of up to 7 different methods in comparison. Results. The results obtained using the Elisa-test-kits depend both on the quality of the individual product and the level of standards in the various labs. Among the confirmatory test-systems, the accuracy of the immunofluorescence does not meet the standards of the EIA to demonstrate antibodies against p 24 and gp 41 antigens,or the standard provided by the WB. The WB, as the goldstandard in the test-systems to demonstrate antibodies against HIV-1-antibodies, proved most suitable in the demonstration of antibodies against p 24-antigen. Conclusion. The test-results demonstrate both the high quality of reagents for HIV-1 diagnostics and state of the art clinical laboratory performance in West-Germany. 1084 EFFECT OF DIETHYLCARBAMAZINE ON TESTING SERUM SAMPLES FOR ANTIBODY TO HIV-1 Lynn W. Kitchen*, S. Sandroni** *Tulane Univ. Med. Ctr., New Orleans, Division of Nephrology, University Hospital, Jacksonville, FL. Objective: To determine the effect of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in vitro on testing serum samples for HIV-1 antibodies. Previous in vivo and in vitro studies have suggested that DEC may increase antigen-antibody interactions. Methods: Serum samples from 140 persons were analyzed for antibody to HIV by the ABBOTT EIA with and without addition of DEC (5 mg/ml; pH 7.3-7.4) to the serum diluent. Results: The addition of DEC increased the absorbance values of serum samples of 18 of 25 persons who lacked antibody to gag but not env HIV-1 proteins as determined by RIP-SDS/PAGE (p( 0.03); of 11 of 14 seropos tive persons with helper lymphocyte counts < 500/mm blood (p<0.03); and of 16 of 18 seropositive persons with AIDS-related disease (p<0.0007), but not of samples from HIV seronegative persons, samples that tested positive for antibody to gag and env proteins of HIV-1, samples from patients with helper lymphocyte counts S 500/mm blood, or asymptomatic HIV seropositive patients. Conclusions: The use of DEC in vitro to optimize detection of antibodies to HIV-1 may be important in the differential diagnosis of patients with AIDS-related disease, or inmunocompromised HIV-1 seropositive persons. 133 [Page 134](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/132) 1085 FALSE NEGATIVE REACTION ON POST-MORTEM HEART BLOOD A COMPETITIVE virology, National Inst. of Public Health, Oslo Objective. The objective was to present the possibility of false negative reaction on post-mortem blood specimens using Wellcomes competitive anti-HIV assay. Methods. Different dilutions of a pre-mortem serum (A) ard post-mortem heart blood sample (B) from the same anti-HIV positive person, were analyzed by the Wellcozyme anti-HIV test. Anti-HIV negative sera were used as diluents, Serum A and B were also tested after they had been mixed. To further evaluate possible interactions, high and low antiHIV positive sera were examined using the following antiHIV negative diluents: Serum, post-mortem blood sample, haemolyzed whole blood and haemolyzed blood cells. The blood cells were haemolyzed by freeze-thawing. Results. Both serum A and B showed a prozone phenomenon when diluted in negative serum. This prozone was so pronounced in serum B that it gave a false negative result in the original test. The dilution experiments showed that strongly haemolyzed samples contained a factor that reacted with the conjugate, binding it to the solid phase. This effect could not be decreased by pre-heating, -freezing or -incubation with 10% HIV-negative serum. The factor seemed to be liberated from blood cells by heamolysis. The phenomenon was not observed when an indirect anti-HIV assay was used. Preliminary data show that other competitive anti-HIV assays are susceptible to the same factor, Conclusion. Competitive anti-HIV tests can give false negative results due to interfering factors in haemolyzed samples. Therefore, competitive assays should not be recommended for use on post-mortem specimens. 1086 HIV EIA NEGATIVE AIDS PATIENTS IN CENTRAL AFRICA: FURTHER SEROLOGICAL STUDIES, P, Van de Perre, 0, Nzarambat, D, Rouvroy0:, From the AIDS Project, Kigali, Rwanda (1), and the Centre Hospitaller de Kigali, Kigali, Rwanda (4), INTRODUCTiON AND OBJECTIVE; From January 1986 to December 1987, 20 adult AIDS patients (17 with Opportunistic Infection (01) and 3 with multifocal Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) were found seronegative for HIV by a commercial EIA (Vironostika, Organon Teknika) at the laboratory of the AIDS Project in Kigali, Rwanda, These patients represented about 3% of the adult AIDS cases whose sera were tested for HIV antibodies during this period, and were further investigated for retrovirus antibodies, METHODS: All 20 sera were tested by HIV Western Blot (WB), HIV2 WB, IgM HIV WB after precipitation of Rheumatoid Factor (Absorbant RF, Behring), HTLV-I WB and a HIV p24 antigen capture EIA test (all these assays from Biotech Ou Pont de Nemours), Except for the IgM HIV WB (reaction limited to the core proteins), a WB+ was defined by a reaction to a core protein plus a reaction to an envelope protein, RESULTS: None of the patients was HTLV-I WB+, Thirteen of them (11 01 and 2 KS) were HIV WB+ of whom 7 had also detectable levels of p24 antigen, One patient was IgM HIV WB+ (p24 and p55), his Ig6 HIV WB reacted only with core proteins (pl7, p24 and p55), In 2 cases was p24 antigen the only marker detected, In a 54 year old man with oesophageal candidiasis, the only marker was a weak reaction with HIV2 p24, p33 and gpl40, Only 3 patients were negative by all assays, one of whow was also hypogammaglobulinemic (IgG=802g/l radial immunodiffusion, Norpartigen, Behring), CONCLUSIONS 1:, In Rwanda, most of the EIA negative AIDS case are explainable by a false negative HIV EIA, 2, In our experience, only less than 0,5% of the total number of adult AIDS subjects seem to represent false positive clinically defined AIDS cases (CDC definition), 3, One of the patients described here is the first probable HIV2-associated AIDS case diagnosed in Rwanda, However, recent seroepidemiological studies suggest that HIV2 infection is virtually non existent in Rwanda (P, Van de Perre et al, unpublished), Notes: 1087 HIV ANTIBODY TESTING IN HEALTHY BLOOD DONORS: WESTERN BLOT PATTERN IN NON-REPEATABLE ELISA REACTIVE SERA PC Das, AH de Vries, RL Red Cross Blood Bank Groningen-Drenthe, Groningen, NL HIV antibody screening by Wellcome ELISA of over 50,000 donations during 1987 resulted in 7 reactive sera. None were positive in Western blot (WB) or Abbott competitive ELISA. In contrast during 1985-86 over 90,000 donations showed 18 reactive sera repeatable by Organon first generation test but negative in the Wellcome ELISA. Of these 18 donations, WB was performed on 8 donor sera including 7 females; this bias in selection is presumed to favour HLA antibody to cause false repeatable ELISA reactions. All 8 sera showed the presence of P55 banding, 2 with P24 and 1 with an additional aspecific band. Since antibody to core protein heralds early signs of AIDS and fall of anti-P24 titre correlates with the severity of the disease we have done a further follow-up study on 5/8 donors. All 5 donors remained healthy over 4-18 months observation period: 3/5 were completely negative but in 2 donors P55 bands persist, 1 with weak reaction where an additional non-specific band has appeared. Cross-reactivi-- ty with other virus antibody and/or HLA cellular contaminants of the reagents in the WB and ELISA might be the possible cause, although improved reagents would reduce such incidence. Because of the potential implication of the presence of core antibody, a long term follow-up is recommended in this apparently healthy group of blood donors. 1088 Dual reactivity for anti-HIVl and 2 in Western blot does not necessarily indicate dual infection. Tedder RS, O'Connor T, Duncan J* University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London Wl and *Wellcome Foundation Ltd, Beckenham, Kent. Objective. Determine if dual reactivity in Western blot (WB) of European and W.African individuals represents serological cross reaction or dual infection. Methods. 34 sera from HIV-infected people (17 Europe, 17 W.Africa) were tested in competitive ELISA's (antiHIVl and anti-HIV2) and 2/17 European sera (anti-HIIV1l1 0/17 in anti-HIVl in competitive ELISA. Many W.African sera gave extensive reactions on HIV1 WB, 6/17 being WBpositive. Many European sera gave reactions on HIV2 WB, 2/17 being WB-positive. Conclusion. WB reactivity is inadequate for confirming dual infections. Greatest precision is by analysis in competitive ELISA: an OD n-derived formula clearly 450nm indicated absence of dual infection among 34 patients studied here inspite of major WB dual reactivity. 134 [Page 135](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/133) 1089 E. COLI Eszter Ujhelyi~ R Holldn XNational Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, National Institute of Rheumatology and Physiotherapy, Budapest, Hungary Objective. In most second generation anti-HIV ELISA tests recombinant env and/or core antigens are applied for coating plates or beads. Since recombinant antigens are produced mostly in E.coli bacteria, it is possible that some antigens of bacterial origin can be present even in the purified antigen preparations and cause false-positive HIV reactions in sera with high titre E.coli antibodies. In order to study this possibility, we have tested sera with known titres against 2 E.coli strains in the recombinant Abbott anti-HTLV III screening assay. Methods. Sera were from 77 patients with different rheumatic diseases, mostly with juvenile and adult rheumatoid arthritis. Antibodies against E.coli 02f and 055 strains were measured by passive haemagglutinstion. Normal values for these antibodies were determined in sera of 22 blood donors. Results. No O.D. value above cut-off 0.D. was found in the Abbott test in either of sera tested. No significant difference in the O.D. values was found between sera with high ( mean+2 S.D. of normal values) and low ( mean- 2 S.D. of normal values) titres against E.coli 025 or 055. Conclusion. Our present results suggest that antibodies against E.coli present in sera tested do not interfere with the recombinant anti-HIV ELISA assays. 1090 INVESTIGATION OF FALSE POSITIVE REACTIONS OF HUMAN SERA WITH HIV p2A IN AIDS SEROLOGY. Eric Saman*, L Heyndrickx*, C Wauters*, Raymaekers*, Van Heuverswyn*,P N Lelie**, J Huisman**, * Innogenetics N.V., Antwerp, Belgium, **CLB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Objective: Evaluation of a recombinant-made p24 HIV-1 antigen for screening of sera known to exhibit false positive reactions with the major core protein of HIV in AIDS serology. Methods: Recombinant highly purified HIV-1 p24 protein produced in E.coli was applied as a line onto a protein binding membrane. Various concentrations of different antigens are applied in parallel lines. Strips were cut perpendicular to the direction of application and processed for antibody detection. Positive signals are revealed as lines on the strips (line immuno assay, LIA). Results: 59 sera exhibiting positive reactions with HIV-1 p24 on different Western Blots were tested in the LIA system. All sera were obtained from individuals who did not develop any sign of HIV infection during subsequent years (no seroconversion, no antigen present at any time, no clinical symptoms).We therefore consider the p24 signal obtained on Western Blots to be false positive (a phenomenon frequently observed for this antigen).However, in the LIA system using our recombinant p24, all sera except one were clearly anti-p24 negative. The only positive serum exhibited positive reactions to other HIV antigens in the same test but none to HIV-1 env proteins. Conclusion: We have shown that the LIA system using recombinant made HIV antigens allows the elimination of false positive reactions towards p24. This development will facilitate the interpretation of results in AIDS serology. Notes: 1091 WESTERN BLOT (WB) P-24 Hickey*, Michael Stek, Kenneth K. Wagner** *Naval Medical Command, Washington, D.C., **Naval Hospital, Bethesda, MD Objective. Conduct follow-up analysis of individuals with WB P-24 or P-24/55 banding patterns. Methods. Individuals identified with indeterminate banding patterns (72 with P-24 and 50 with P-24/55) were reevaluated 6 to 12 months following the initial WB determination. The reevaluation included a complete medical examination, ELISA (Electronucleonics and Dupont), WB (Dupont), Anti-recombinant Antigen (GP-120) antibody assay (Cambridge Bioscience Corp.). When possible, viral cultures (2 assays, 1 week apart) and antigen capture assays (Abbott) were done. Results. One individual in the P-24 alone category developed a GP-41 band, 3 others did not manifest high molecular weight bands on WB analysis but were positive by the anti-GP-120 antibody assay. Similarly, one individual in the P-24/55 category developed a GP-41 band and 5 manifested anti-GP-120 antibody. Additionally, however, one developed positive cultures although none of the other supplemental tests were positive. The follow up clinical evaluations were normal for all individuals. Conclusion. Supplemental testing in 6-12 months follow-up revealed 5.4% of the P-24 alone and 14.0% of the P-24/55 WB indeterminate results to be positive. The positive cultures in one individual with no other findings except the indeterminate banding pattern demonstrates the elusiveness of absolute serodiagnosis with current technology. 1092 FALSE-POSITIVE REACTION WITH HIV-1 ENVELOPE PROTEIN (GP41) IN THE WESTERN BLOT Helge Myrmel & Gunnar Haukenes Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Gade Institute, University of Bergen, Norway. Objective. To report the finding of a falsepositive result in HIV-1 ELISA and an unspecific band in the GP41 region of HIV-i Western blot (WB). Methods. Two serum samples drawn from a pregnant woman at a three-week interval, were tested with several anti-HIV ELISA tests (VironostikaOrganon, Elavia-Pasteur, Enzygnost-Behringwerke, Abbott HTLV-III Recombinant EIA), immunofluorescence Pasteur) and an immunoglobulins, and rheumatoid factor were also quantified. Results. Organon ELISA was repeatedly positive (200% of cut-off value) in both serum samples. The other ELISA tests and IF were negative. A single and sharp band was seen in the GP41 recion of the WB. The immunological parameters were normal. Conclusion. Unspecific bands may appear also in the GP41 region in WB, obviating the need for reliable confirmation tests. 135 [Page 136](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/134) 1093 HIV-1 BUT NOT HIV-2 INFECTION IN AMERICANS SEROREACTIVE TO BOTH HIV-1 AND -2 Gerald Schochetman*, J. Sninsky**, S. Kwok**, C. -Y. Ou*, P. Clapham***, and L. Goldstein**** *AIDS Program, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA; **Cetus Corp., Emeryville, CA; ***Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK: ****Genectic Systems Corp. Seattle, WA. Objective. To determine the HIV-status of persons seroreactive by ELISA and Western blot (gag, pol and env) to both HIV-1 and HIV-2. Methods. Sera and lymphocytes were collected from 3 persons in the USA who were reactive to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 by ELISA and Western blot. Sera were tested for antibodies specific for HIV-1 or HIV-2 using type specific peptide ELISAs for the viral transmembrane protein and neutralizing antibody assays. Lymphocytes were tested for the presence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 proviral sequences using the polymerase chain reaction DNA amplication technique (PCR). Results. Peptide ELISA analysis showed that all three reacted strongly to the HIV-1 specific peptide but not to the HIV-2 specific peptide. All three sera could neutralize three strains of HIV-1 (SF2, RF, and IIIB) but could not neutralize three strains of HIV-2 (LAV2, E1-6669, and CBL-20). PCR analysis performed on two of three persons showed the presence of HIV-1 proviral sequences (LTR and gag) but not the presence of HIV-2 proviral sequences (LTR). Conclusion. These results demonstrate that some persons infected with HIV-1 only, can develop broadly reactive antibodies to shared epitopes on diverse strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2. 1094 BLOOD DONORS WIYH ISOLATED ANTI-pl5 or p24 10 WESTERN BLOT (WB) REACTIONS: CLINICAL AND LABORATORY FOLLOW-UP F. Mozzi, A. Zanella, A. Sforza, 25, Milano, Italy Objective: to evaluate the clinical significance of persistent WB reactions against HIV1 and p-15 or p24. Subjects: 73 asymptomatic blood donors, 41 with isolated anti-pl5 and 32 with anti-p24 positive WB reactions, all but 2 denying risk factors, underwent a clinical and laboratory follow-up at 3 months intervals for 6-27 months (median 14) including skin tests, CD4/CD8 and WB replay. WB by H9 strips, anti-HIV ELISA on recombinant or synthetic peptides, HIV antigen (p24 or total) and anti-HIV2 were performed in most subjects. Results: 1 of the 2 subjects at risk showed overt seroconversion for both HIV1 and HIV2 and CD4/CD8 inversion after 3 months,shortly after developing an ARC. The 71 subjects who denied risk factors remained asymptomatic and did not show WB pattern variations, CD4/CD8 inversion or delayed sensitivity impairment during follow-up. Retrospective examination of a sample of these subjects by H9 strips and anti-HIV2 gave negative results: ELISA by recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides were positive in 6/56 and 11/ 56 cases respectively. HIV antigen ELISA, performed in parallel using 2 different methods was overall positive in 6/28 cases. Conclusions: the clinical relevance of anti-pl5 or p24 antibodies seems to be generally low at least in subjects without risk factors. However, the finding of HIV antigen in a few subjects and the positive results from 2nd or 3rd generation ELISA stress the need for the careful monitoring of subjects displaying p15 or p24 WB bands. Notes: 1095 FALSE POSITIVE REACTIONS WITH HIV-INFECTED BUT NOT WJITH UNINFECTED LYMPHOCYTES IN PATIENTS ON HAEMODIALYSIS PH) AFTER RENAL TRANSPLANTATION George F xstx, E Ujhelyi, G Illeix E Gy6dix, of PH false-positive (FP) HIV reactions frequently occur. Little is known, however, on the mechanism of these reactions. In the present work ie have studied cellular targets and cause of development of ab's responsible for the FP reactions. Methods. Sera of PH were screened for HIV antibodies by the ENI (series 1) or Sorin (series 2) ELISA kits. Each sera found to be repeatedly positive were tested by the Organon ELIST,, Uelcome competitive EIA (UEL), IFA and U(I. Results. A special type of FP (SFP) reaction uas found in 5/24. (series 1) and in 7/410 (series 2) sera. These sera strongly reacted with the plates coated with supernatants of the HIV-infected but not with those of the uninfected H9 cells. 3, and 2 sera of series i gave positive IFA with the HIV-infected but not with the uninfected H9 and CEM cells, resp. In 5 sera of series 2 FP U3 reaction was found. By contrast, no true-pos. UB pattern or positive UEL EIA was obtained in these sera. In series 2, SFP reactions were found only in patients (7/65) who had rejected a kidney graft. Conclusion. FP observed was most probably due to ab's reacting with cellular antigens present in HIV-infected but not in uninfected lymphocytes. Their appearance seems to be associated w:ith the immunological activation occurring at graft rejection. 1096 TRANSITORY ANTIBODY RESPONSE TO HIV INFECTION IN TEN PATIENTS WITH VARIOUS RISK FACTORS. F. Montella*, 0. Recchia*, F. Di Sorax,P.A. Preite*, A. Pescexx e G. Terzanix. dell' AIDS e delle sindromi correlate. Ospedale S. Giovanni. Roma. ** S.A.T. USI. RM IV. Roma. In a follow-up period ranging from 8 to 30 months we observed a total (in 4 cases) or partial (in 6 cases) seroreversion in 10 HIV seropositive patients (6 IVDA, 1 Homosexual, 3 Heterosexuals). No patient had history of prior gamma globulin administration. At the start of the study the patients showed the following features: All were positive for ELISA test (Sorin, Abbott, Wellcome, Roche,, for IF test (JLC scientific. and for WB assay 'Sorin). 7/9 had anti Core and anti Envelope antibodies. At the end of the follow up all patients were negative for ELISA test; 7/10 were completely negative for WB assay; 6/7 lost anti Core and anti Envelope antibodies. The IF test was performed in only 2 cases and it was negative. Viral antigen (Pasteur, Abbott) was found in 4/10 patients and it did not show any modification. All the patients were in good clinical conditions and they belonged to WR I or WR II stages. At the end of the follow up the clinical status remained good and 7/10 can be reclassified in WR 0. Our data show the possibility of transient antibody formation to HIV. That was already suggested in 1985 by other investigators (Burger et al, Ann. Int. Med. 1985, 103, 55. Clinical imp li ca tions are unk:nown and careful observation is required in the future. 136 [Page 137](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/135) 1097 TRANSIENT ANTI-HIV SEROPOSITIVITY Transfusion Safety Study Group represented by Eva A Operskalski* *University of Southern California and other participating institutions, Los Angeles and other cities Objective. To monitor for, and evaluate, laboratory results that may indicate an atypical serologic course of HIV infection. Methods. A population of 1,479 persons observed on 3+ visits includes routine blood donors, recipients of blood components and clotting factor concentrates, and sexual and non-sexual household contacts. Anti-HIV status is determined by EIA on at least 2 separate days, and a positive or questionable result is evaluated by immunoblot (IB). If a subject's results differ at consecutive visits, the probable identity of specimens is established by allotyping of several proteins. Results. Four subjects have been identified whose EIA and IB positivity was followed by subsequent specimen(s) that were EIA and IB negative. All 4 had potential exposure to HIV. 1098 DETECTION OF ENVELOPE ANTIBODY CLOSES THE 1 SEROCONVERSION WINDOW IN HIV INFECTION Donna L. Reed, Jeanne E. Neumann, Stephen R. Petteway, Medical Products Department, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc., Wilmington, Delaware, USA 19898 Objective. To analyze the length of time between the detection of HIV antigen (p24) and the detection of HIV antibody (HIV, GAG, or ENV) during seroconversion. Methods. Sequential serum samples were collected from individual seroconverters with collection intervals ranging from 2 days to 6 months. These samples were evaluated using a p24 antigen test and antibody tests specific for HIV, gpl20/gp41 (ENV9), or p55/24/17(GAG55). Western blots and/or RIPA using HIV lysate were used to confirm seroconversion. Results. The earliest indication of HIV infection is the detection of HIV p24 core antigen; however, the level of antigen decreased rapidly after the initial positive result. Antibody specific for HIV envelope was detectable by ELISA earlier than antibodies specific for core or whole virus. RIPA and ENV9 antibody results were the first immunological marker of seroconversion, while Western Blot results were typically \"Indeterminant\". One seroconversion panel, with sera drawn every 2-5 days, demonstrated that antigen could be detected 11 to 42 days before antibody, depending upon which specific antibody test was used. Conclusion. Assays specifically detecting gpl20 and and/or gp41 result in an earlier indication of seroconversion than assays based on core antigen or whole virus.

Notes: 1099 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Detection of HIV Provirus Before HIV Seroconversion S Wolinsky*, Rinaldo*, J *For the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, Chicago, IL, **Cetus Corp., Emeryville, CA, USA Objective. To determine the presence of HIV provirus in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from HIV seroconverters at defined time points prior to seroconversion, a blinded prospective study was done. Methods. Sixteen seroconverters (SC), 4 positive controls (PC), and 7 negative controls (NC) have been initially studied. Each participant was evaluated by ELISA (whole virus and gp120-41 env fragment), Western blot (WB), p24 antigen capture (AG), culture on freshly stimulated PBLs, and PCR. 6HIV DNA amplification was performed directly on 2 x 10 lysed PBLs using gag and env primer pairs. Sera and PBLs were studied 18, 12 and 6 mo. prior to a positive WB, and at the time of seroconversion. Results. PCR amplification data showed that: 1) The 7 NC were PCR negative; 2) the 4 PC were PCR positive; 3) 16/16 SC were PCR positive at the time of seroconversion; 4) 14/16 were PCR positive at least 6 mo. before the positive WB; 5) The PCR signal intensity increased prior to the positive WB and was greatest at the time of positive WB. Additional seroconverters are being evaluated. Correlation among ELISA, WB, AG, and PCR will be presented. Conclusion. These data indicate that the HIV provirus may be detected at least 6 mo. prior to WB determined seroconversion. 1100 DETECTION OF HIV PROVIRAL DNA AND p24 ANTIGEN IN PLASMA PRIOR TO SEROCONVERSION. Indira K Hewlett*, RA Gregg*, RE Administration, Bethesda, MD; **Boston Biomedica, Inc., Mansfield, MA. Objective. To better characterize virologic events prior to seroconversion we looked for HIV antigen and proviral DNA in serial plasmas of known seroconverters. Methods. Banked plasmas from bleedings at intervals of 2 days to 2 months were obtained from five known HIV seroconverters. DNA was extracted from plasma and analyzed by the slot blot technique at moderate and high stringencies. HIV-specific proviral DNA.was detected by hybridization with the 9 Kb fragment isolated from the BH10 clone. Soluble p24 antigen was analyzed by capture EIA using rabbit antiserum to purified viral p24 for detection. Antibodies were studied by HIV Western blot. Results. HIV DNA and p24 antigen were detected prior to seroconversion in 5/5 and 4/5 series, respectively. Seroconversion to all major HIV proteins was preceded for 1-2 weeks by a single peak of detectable p24 antigen. Levels of up to 3600 pg/ml were obtained. Detectable antigen significantly decreased as antibody rose. HIV DNA was detected up to two months prior to seroconversion. Detection of HIV DNA could not be correlated temporally with the appearance of antigen. Conclusions. HIV proviral DNA in plasma may be a useful marker of virus activity in HIV infection both before and after seroconversion. It appears to be a parameter independent of detectable antigen. A possible association with clinical progression is under investigation. 137 [Page 138](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/136) 1101 THE TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIV P24 ANTIGENEMIA HIV SEROCONVERSION Lawrence A. Kingsley*, BF Polk', The AIDS Cohort Study of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, **Northwestern Angeles, CA; +NIAID, Bethesda, MD; ++Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD Objective. 154 Western blot confirmed HIV seroconverters were studied up to 2 years prior to HIV seroconversion to estimate the prevalence of HIV p24 antigenemia.

Results. 1st Visit of HIV Ab Conversion 1102 DATED SEROCONVERSIONS TO HIV COUROUCE A.M., LEFRERE J.J., RICHARD D., DOINEL C., LAMBIN P., FINE J.M., Fondation Nationale de Transfusion Sanguine, Paris - France. Objective: To follow-up subjects who seroconverted to HIV at a known time. Methods: Out of 34 subjects with a W.B pattern corresponding to a recent seroconversion i.e Ab to p 25 and to gp 110/160 only (25 regular blood donors with a seronegative donation 1 to 9 months earlier, mean = 4.4),22with a follow-up of 7 to 26 months in Jan.1988 were analyzed (7 to 10 for 7 = Group.I, 12 to 17 for 9 = Group.II and 18 to 26 for 6 = Group.III). Physical examination and biological parameters were performed rapidly after the discovery of seropositivity and every 6 months. Results: Between the 1st and 2nd visits, a rise of CD4 counts was observed in 7 subjects, as well as a rise of the titre of Ab to HIV proteins in all the subjects. At the last visit, the main results were as follows CD4/mm3 IgG IgA Ab to p25 Group mean No with titre >400 <200 N~ N~ High Med Low I 275 0 1 0 0 4 2 1 II 512 5 1 1 2 4 1 4 III 248 1 2 2 0 4 1 1 No subject had HIV Ag in their sera at the last visit. Other biological parameters (CD8, ESR, B2M, neopterin,Ab to p18) and the evolution of the complete W.B pattern during the follow-up will also be analyzed. Conclusion: Such a study should allow to precise the events following the seroconversion and preceding AIDS. Before HIV-Ab 8/153(5%) *1 of 2 also + at 6 months. Conclusion. These data suggest a low prevalence of HIV p24 antigenemia within 1 year prior to Western blot seroconversion and that p24 antigenemia may be absent before 18 months of seroconversion. However, ELISA HIV p24 antigen testing increases the detection of HIV infection during the HIV antibody-negative period, albeit with low additional yield. These data should be carefully evaluated in the context of both blood donor and high-risk group settings. Notes: 1103 ESTIMATION OF THE TIME SINCE SEROCONVERSION IN HIV-1 INFECTED GAY MEN. Alvaro Munoz, V Carey, A Saah, J Chmiel, P English, L Kingsley, M VanRaden, BF Polk, for the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), Bethesda, MD, USA. Objective. Given a set of hematologic measurements on an HIV-1 seropositive (HIV+) individual, we present an algorithm to estimate time since seroconversion. Methods. Of MACS participants who were HIV- at entry, 227 converted to HIV+ prior to 12/31/87. We used parametric life-table regression methods to find the subset of hematological variables assessed over time that had significant information for the estimation of median times since HIV-1 seroconversion. Bootstrap methods were used for assessment of the precision of the median estimators. Results. We found that % of CD4+ lymphocytes and platelet counts provide significant information for estimation of the median time since HIV-1 seroconversion. Estimated median number of months from seroconversion (with 95% C.I.) for given levels of CD4% and platelets are given below... 1104 IgG SUBCLASS RESPONSE TO THE HIV gp of Virology and ***Dept of Neurosurgery, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. Objective: to delineate the IgG subclass response to two synthetic oligopeptides from a selected region of theHIV-1 transmembrane protein gp 41 (E32/E34). Methods: serum samples were obtained from 94 HIV infected patients with different stages of the disease. The IgG subclasses reactive with E32/E34 were determined by ELISA. The acid sequencies are 606-620 (IWGCSGKLICTTAVPWNAS) for the LKDQQLLGIWGCSGKLI) for the E34 peptide. For comparison, 12 patients from each clinical stage were tested for reactivity to a peptide derived from the HIV core protein p24. Results: for the E32/E34 peptides, all the In AIDS patients only was found to E32/E34. With the p24 peptide, reactivity found for IgG3 in and for IgG4 in 10% of the patients. IgG1,2 and sometimes 4 were significantly more common for the E32/E34 peptides than for the p24 peptide. The p24 peptide response was dominated by IgG1 and 3. Conclusion: the IgG 1,2 and 4 response to the gp 41 peptides is unique compared to the IgG1 and 3 response seen in other viral diseases. Determining the IgG subclass responses to a single highly immunogenic and platelet count in HIV+ gay men have significant information for the estimation of the time since HIV-1 seroconversion. The estimates above are based on data from gay men who have seroconverted within the past 3,5 years and will be most useful in situations where infection is likely to have occurred within that span of time. 138 [Page 139](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/137) 1105 DETECTION OF p24 ANTIGEN AND CLASS AND SUBCLASS-SPECIFIC Ig TO HIV IN SEROCONVERTERS. Robert A Gregg*, RE Mayner*, R Biomedica, Inc, Mansfield, MA;***MicroGeneSys, Inc, West Haven, CT Objective. We analyzed the appearance of p24 antigen and class and subclass-specific antibodies (Ig) to HIV in plasmas from closely monitored seroconverters in order to better characterize these events. Methods. Banked serial plasma was obtained from five seroconverting donors bled at intervals of 2 days to 2 months. Potency-controlled murine monoclonal antibodies were used in whole virus-based (Dupont) and prototype recombinant envelope-based IgM, and IgAl. Antigen was detected by capture EIA using rabbit antiserum to purified viral p24. Results. Soluble p24 antigen was detected in 4 series as a single peak lasting about 2 weeks. This peak was followed within 2 weeks by seroconversion to all major HIV structural proteins. IgG to gag proteins appeared the earliest, followed by anti-env and then anti-pol. IgG was principally IgG1 and IgG3. IgG3 developed only to gag proteins while IgG1 developed to other proteins as well. IgM and IgAl were not detected proximate to seroconversion but appeared later. Conclusions. The appearance in plasma of soluble HIV p24 antigen 1-2 weeks prior to seroconversion in 4/5 individuals suggests that this is a common event in early infection. Failure to detect an early IgM response in these cases is unexplained. The restricted pattern of anti-HIV IgG3 merits further investigation. 1106 THE IgG SUBCLASS IMMUNE RESPONSE TO HIV G.E. Rodriguez and M.R. Escobar, Med. Col. of Virginia, VCU, Richmond, VA 23298 USA Objective. To determine the IgG subclass distribution in the sera of HIV-infected individuals. Methods. Sera of 67 HIV-seropositive (by Abbott ELISA) individuals were diluted 1:20 in diluent with bovine and goat serum and human T cell lysate. After incubation with HIV antigen-coated beads for 1 hr/40 C and PBS-Tween 20 (PBST), in FCS+PBST were added to each well each bead for 2 hr/400C. Beads were washed again and 2 mg/ml nitrophenylphosphate in diethanolamine buffer was added to each bead complex for 1 hr/RT. The reaction was stopped with 1N NaOH then read at 405 nm with an automated EIA reader. Results. Positive (+) and negative (-) serum controls were included with each plate. An O.D. > 3.5 S.D. above the mean was considered a (+) IgG Ab; and 9 had IgG1 + IgG3 Ab. Conclusions. Based on the above results, the anti-HIV IgG immune response is predominantly of the IgGl subclass, with a few individuals also producing IgG4 and in a rare case IgG2 or IgG3 Ab.

In the natural IgG response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), subclasses 1 and 3 appear to be the most prominent. In other viral diseases IgG3 is important due to its high neutralizing activity. The specificity of HIV-specific IgG3 in HIV infection was therefore investigated. Methods. Twenty HIV-infected homosexual patients with CDC stage III were monitored during a mean time of 21 months. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to human IgG1 and 3 were used in HIV enzyme immunoassays (ELISA), Western blot and ELISA with short 15 aminoacid (aa) synthetic HIV peptides representing the gag region (p17 and p24). Results. Anti-HIV IgG3 was found in all 20 patients by the subclass Western blot and peptide ELISA, but only with 6/20 patients in total HIV ELISA. The HIV-specific IgG3 was almost entirely directed to gag proteins p17 and p24. In particular, IgG3 was directed to p17, where it occurred more frequently than IgG1. Eight of the patients progressed to AIDS. Their IgG3 response remained after IgG1 against gag proteins had disappeared. In peptide ELISAs IgG1 reactivity decreased to 40-50% of the original level, while IgG3 reactivity to gag proteins did not decrease. Conclusion. Anti HIV-specific IgG3 occurs more frequently than earlier expected in all stages of HIVinfection, indicating frequent reactivation. The main reactivities are to core proteins p17 and p24. pt 1 pt 2 C (n= pt 3 pt 4 pt 5 C 0.26 0.21 0.03+0.03 Conclusion.Our data indicate that IgG 2 do not participate in hypergammaglobulinemia associated to HIV infection suggesting that the virus induces a failure of Ig response restricted to this subclass. 139 [Page 140](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/138) 1109 HIV SPECIFIC IgM and IG FOLLOWED WEEKLY DURING THE PRIMARY HIV INFECTION Edgar Lauritzen*, BO Lindhardt**, C Petersen***, Hospital, Arhus, Denmark Objective. To define the time course of HIV specific IgM and improve HIV IgG detection during the primary HIV infection. Methods. Sera from 52 patients taken during the primary HIV infection, and sera from 436 persons received consecutively for HIV testing were studied. For 24 patients followed during seroconversion, symptoms related to the acute HIV infection were reported. - A catching IgM ELISA for detection of HIV-IgM antibodies (abs) were applied. - A new membrane, polyvinylidene diflouride (PVDF), was evaluated as immunoblotting matrix to determine HIV specific IgG. Results. HIV-IgM was detected within two weeks following the acute illness. The HIV-IgM titer raised to a maximum 4-6 weeks after the appearence of acute symptoms, and declined to zero by the eleventh week. Sixteen out of 29 patients tested for HIV-IgM were positive, and in two of these HIV-IgM re-appeared in serum more than a year after infection. By the PVDF membrane anti-gp41 abs were identified early during seroconversion, and the PVDF immunoblot was clearly more sensitive than nitrocellulose to determine anti-HIV glycoprotein abs. Conclusion. HIV-IgM, which is determined by isolation of IgM before reaction with the antigen and labelled second abs, and immunoblotting on PVDF membranes are important serological tests for an early HIV diagnosis during seroconversion. 1110 DETECTION OF ANTI-HIV-1 IMMUNOGLOBULIN M ANTIBODIES IN PATIENTS WITH HIV-1 INFECTION Ferdinand Muller, K.-H. Muller Division of Immunology of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Hygiene, Hamburg (FRG) Objective and Methods. Serum samples from 247 patients with positive HIV-1 IgG serology were investigated for specific IgM antibodies using a biotin-avidin Western Blot technique. The test systeme has been proved to be IgM specific by absorption of sera prior to performance with anti-human IgM (negative result) or anti-human IgG (positive result). Results. In 109 out of 247 specimens (44%) anti-HIV-1 IgM antibodies against at least one of the main protein antigens (gpl60/120, p66, p53, gp4l, p24 and p17) were demonstrated. IgM antibodies against the endonuclease-related p31 antigen were not observed. IgM antibodies against the p53 and p24 antigens seem to appear early and to persist for a relatively long time after infection. Conclusion. During the first stage of viremia IgM antibodies against the main antigens of HIV-1 were obviously synthesized in most patients as in other bacterial and viral diseases. The patterns of the HIV-1 IgM Western Blot are characterized by individual variability, showing between one and six typical bands. Notes: 1111 VALUE OF IGM-ANTI-HIV AS A MARKER FOR EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF HIV-INFECTION P.Nico Lelie, E. Bakker, R. Bende, H.G. Huisman Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service Objective. Evaluation of IgM-anti-HIV as a marker for early detection of HIV-infection. Methods. Sequential serum samples from 15 male homosexuals taken at 3 months intervals before and after IgG-anti-HIV seroconversion in Western blot (WB, Dupont) and 125J-RIPA were used to detect IgM-anti-HIV with WB (Dupont) and 125J-RIPA. Results. In only 8 of the 15 men IgM-anti-HIV was detectable in IgM-WB, RIPA at the time of IgG-anti-HIV seroconversion or three months thereafter. In one individual persistent IgM-anti-gag reactivity was observed in WB with all available sera during 14 months before IgGanti-HIV seroconversion. However when the IgM-RIPA was used, in this men seroconversion was observed at the time of IgG-anti-HIV seroconversion, whereas all earlier samples were clearly negative in IgM-RIPA as well as in HIV antigen assay (Abbott). Conclusion. IgM-anti-HIV seems not a reliable marker for early diagnosis of HIV-infection and WB may exhibit false positive IgM anti-p24 reactivity. 1112 ISOTYPIC SELECTION OF THE ANTIBODY RESPONSE TO HIV STRUCTURAL AND NON STRUCTURAL (F/3'ORF) PROTEINS J KHALIFE*, Jean Claude AMEISEN*, M CAPRON*, B To assess the isotypic distribution of antibodies (Ab) directed against HIV gag, pol and env proteins and against the HIV non structural regulatory protein F which is expressed by infected cells but absent from the virion; to assess whether the isotypic distribution is influenced by the route of infection (homosexual vs. haemophiliac). Methods. Sera from 115 asymptomatic seropositive individuals (63 homosexuals and 28 haemophiliacs) were analyzed by Western blot Gag-, pol- and env- specific Ab were detected using disrupted purified HIV (Diagnostic Pasteur); F-specific Ab were detected using recombinant F protein (27 Kda) expressed in E. Coli. Isotypes were revealed by monoclonal Ab against human immunoglobulin classes and subclasses. Results. The response to gag products was polyisotypic, including IgM, IgG1, IgG3, and IgA, whereas the response to env was almost entirely restricted to IgG1. The dominant gag-specific isotype IgG3, was absent from the -response to the other HIV proteins. The route of infection had a striking influence on the isotypic profile, namely the exclusive presence of IgE (gag-specific) in haemophiliacs. Seropositive haemophiliacs have a very low incidence of AIDS; we are currently investigating a possible role of IgE (involved in Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against parasites) in effector mechanisms against HIV infected cells. The response to F (present in half the individuals) included IgM, IgG1 and IgA. A limited study of seroconversion, in which F-specific IgG appeared early, revealed that the F response fluctuated later on in half the individuals, in contrast to the response to gag and env; isotypic analysis of the F-specific response showed that this fluctuation was not related to an isotypic switch. Finally, in a limited number of seronegative at risk individuals, gag- and pol- specific IgM or IgA were detected in the absence of any HIV-specific IgG. Conclusion. The occurence of isotypic selection suggests different regulatory mechanisms in the B cell response to HIV proteins, depending on the protein and on the route of infection, and could have implications for the improvement of immunodiagnosis. 140 [Page 141](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/139) 1113 ANTIBODIES TO HIV-1 and **Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA. Ob.iective: The relationship between clinical stage of disease, CD4+ cell numbers and levels of antibody to HIV-1 gag and env proteins was determined in HIV-1 seropositive gay men followed prospectively. Methods: Sera from a longitudinal natural history study of HIV-1 infection were assayed separately in an enzyme immunoassay using recombinant gag and env proteins. Immunoassay results were expressed in units which were derived by interpolation from a standard curve. Analysis was performed on samples from 20 men who later developed AIDS and on 20 randomly selected HIV-1 seropositive subjects who had not developed AIDS within the study period. Results: All study subjects had persistently high levels of antibody to the recombinant emy protein. For both groups, antibody levels to the recombinant gag protein were lower than levels to the env protein. There was no difference in the level of antibody to gag protein between subjects who did or did not develop AIDS. There was a weak positive association between gag/en antibody ratio greater than 0.3 and the smallest decline in CD4+ cell count. Conclusion: Progression to AIDS was not associated with declining or low levels of antibody to gag determinants in this group of gay men. The relative level of anti-gag antibody to anti-eny antibody may be associated with a slower decline in CD4+ cell count. 1114 PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF THE HIVs Gerald Myers*, T. F. Smith** *Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, **Dana Farber Cancer Inst. Harvard, Boston Objective. To elucidate the origins, extents of variation, and mutation rates for HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV. Methods. Homologous nucleotide sequences for a diversity of HIVs were optimally aligned and then analyzed with computer algorithms to produce a highly intelligible and consistent set of evolutionary trees. Results. Viral sequences from Africa, Haiti and the United States are clustered and the argument can be mounted that these clusters are a fair representation, or reconstruction, of their ancestral relationships; trees for the different genomic regions--the LTR, the GAG, POL and ENV coding sequences -- are congruent, with exception of the evolutionary pattern for one viral sequence which is shown by quantitative analysis to be plausibly hybrid, i.e. recombinant. The minimum time for divergence of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 types of viruses is determined to be forty-five years, plus or minus three years. This minimum assumes a linear mutation rate for the two types, and other estimates are attained by relinquishing this assumption. In particular, the possibilities of epidemic-driven mutation, hence a non-linear rate, are analyzed. The average (minimum) base substitution rate for HIV-1 ENV gene is approximately 1.5% per year per virus. Conclusion. Diversification of HIV appears to be in step with the growth of the AIDS pandemic, as if the viruses are not in ecological equilibrium but rather have made a recent evolutionary breakthrough. Notes: 1115 CONSENSUS SEQUENCE AND PHYLOGENETIC TREE FOR HIV-1, HIV-2 PASTEUR, PARIS, FRANCE. Objective: The variability of AIDS virus is a problem for the immunological response research as well as for structure-function relationship studies. The objective is to study the variability by constructing consensus sequences. This allows to construct phylogenetic trees and to classify AIDS viruses. Nucleic acid sequences method for the construction of phylogenetic trees is proposed. The method uses a stepwise approach, constructing successive consensus sequences, each of them being derived from the subgroup of those sequences that have not been yet classified at the considered step of the analysis. Each node of the tree corresponds to a consensus sequence. Result: Consensus sequences for the env region will be presented. The analysis indicates that the SIVmac is genetically close to the agent of AIDS in West Africa, HIV-2. Moreover the divergence of the sequences of SIV and HIV-2 is greater than that observed between HIV-1 isolates (about 95% nucleotide sequence homology). Conclusion: The main interest of phylogenetic analysis is to propose a classification of AIDS virus strains. The originality of the study consists in introducing a new method of tree construction based on consensus sequence modifications. The biological significance of consensus sequences will be discussed in terms of structure-function relationship or genetic variability. 1116 SEQUENCE OF SIMIAN ***Natl. Inst. Health, Japan Objective To clarify the origin and transmission of AIDS group lentivirus. Methods SIVA M[TYO-1] was isolated from naturally infected African green monkey imported from Kenya. The full-length viral DNA of this virus was molecularly cloned and sequenced. The translated amino-acid sequence was compared with other HIV/SIVs using Wilbur and Lipman programs. Results SIVAG., about 9.5kb nucleotides long, has typical genetic organization of HIV/SIV group, 5'LTR-gagpol-central region-env-3'ORF-3'LTR. The central region of SIVm, includes X but not R. The SIVARM LTR, 726bp as consensus enhancer similarity to HIV-l, HIV-2D and SIVMA in gag and pol region. Other regrns of SVAGM have 1'es similarities to those of other HIV/SIVs. T env of SIVA^ includes stop codon in its TMP region, and its amino-acid similarity is slightly closer to HIV-2/SIV than HIV-1. Conclusion The SIVAOM is a neWisolate of HIV/SIV group viruses, and it is considered to be approximately equidistant from HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV, suggesting that SIV is not a direct ancestor o HIV-2. We think human and non-human primates have spiecies-specific viruses for a long time. 141 [Page 142](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/140) 1117 SIMIAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS DETECTION IN *, PMV Bangui, Central African Republic (CAR) **Department of Medical Pathology, University of California, Davis Objective. To determine if there are any strains of SIV in the wild-caught monkeys of the CAR. Methods. Serum samples were taken from 102 wild-caught monkeys among 9 different species in the CAR. Sera were tested for antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 by Western blot. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from monkeys with positive sera were co-cultivated with human PBL and assayed for reverse transcriptase activity. Results. Of the 102 sera, none were found to be positive on HIV-1. However, 2 of 26 healthy African Green Monkeys (AGM, Cercopithecus aethiops) were positive on HIV-2 blot with band to all major proteins and to GP105. A third AGM and 2 of 20 healthy baboons (Papio anubis) had bands to GP105, P68, P36 and P26 but the first two bands were faint. Assay for reverse transcriptase activity was positive after 6 days for the first two AGM's while those of the AGM and the baboons with indeterminate Western blots have continually remained negative. Conclusion. There appears to be a strain of SIV among AGM's in the CAR that is more closely related to HIV-2 than to HIV-1. 1118 MOLECULAR EVOLUTIONARY ANALYSIS OF AIDS VIRUSES Takashi Gojobori*,Etsuko N. Moriyama*,Shozo Yokoyama** *National Institute of Genetics, Japan, **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA Objective. To construct phylogenetic trees of HIVs and SIVs and to estimate divergence times between viruses, using nucleotide sequence data. Methods. Aligning the available nucleotide sequences for various strains of HIVs and SIVs, we estimated numbers of nucleotide substitutions between virus strains by mathematical methods. From these numbers, phylogenetic trees were constructed by unweighted pairgroup (UPG) and neighbor-joining (NJ) methods. Results and Conclusion. The trees obtained clearly show two major groups of viruses: HIV-1 and HIV-2 groups (see Figure). The HIV-2 group contains all the presently available SIVs. (The experimental validity of HTLV-4 is controversial.) The divergence times at all branching points of the tree were estimated. In particular, the divergence time between HIV-1 and HIV-2 groups are estimated to be 150 - 200 years. We also discuss the emergence time of pathogenicity.

Watson*, R. Masinovsky*, I. Leiderman**, R. Ashley***, L. Sannes* *Genetic Systems Corporation, Seattle, WA, ** Long Island Jewish Medical Center, NY, NY, *** University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA Objective. To characterize and determine the incidence of antibodies to HTLV-I in selected high and low risk populations in the U.S. Methods. An enzyme immunoassay was developed for detection of antibody to HTLV-I. Reactive samples were analyzed by Western Blot utilizing purified HTLV-I. Results. Seventy-two reactive Japanese samples were analyzed initially. The majority (94%) of these samples reacted with an OD>1.000, exhibiting antibodies to pl9, p24, and various precursors (p55, p40, p36, p28) by Western Blot. Samples from intravenous drug abusers in the U.S. were then tested, and 16% (25/155) reacted by EIA. However, only 36% of the reactive IVDA samples exhibited high OD values, and most exhibited weak bands or atypical responses to pl9 alone by Western Blot. Additional U.S. panels were analyzed, including 220 normal donors (0.9% reactive) and 364 samples sent to a clinical laboratory for hepatitis testing (4.4% reactive). The majority of reactive U.S. samples yielded low OD values by EIA and weak atypical Western Blot patterns. Conclusion. These results demonstrate that the dominant serological response to HTLV-I in the U.S. is different from that observed in Japanese samples, suggesting that a variant of HTLV-I may be more prevalent in U.S. populations. 1120 DEVELOPMENT OF AN HIV/HTLV-I EIA FOR SIMULTANEOUS DETECTION OF HIV AND HTLV-I ANTIBODIES Anne J. Bodner*, S. Alexander, A. O'Donnel*, *Biotech Research Labs.,Rockville, MD, USA. Objective. To develop and validate an EIA which can be used to test simultaneously for human HIV and HTLV-I antibodies (Abs). Methods. Disrupted HIV and HTLV-I virions were applied to microelisa plates, each well receiving both antigens. An HIV/HTLV-I EIA using these plates was compared with the Du Pont HIV EIA and the HTLV-I EIA developed by Biotech and Du Pont. 60 Sera containing western blot confirmed Abs to HIV or HTLV-I or both were tested on the HIV/ HTLV-I, HIV, and HTLV-I EIAs. 5 HIV and 5 HTLV-I Ab positive sera diluted to test close to the cut-off values of thie single virus EIAs were also tested. 55 normal donor (ND) sera with a range of reactivities with the single virus EIAs were tested. 15 ND sera had reactivities close to the cut-off values of the HIV and the HTLV-I EIAs. Results. The 38 HIV Ab positive samples tested positive on the HIV/HTLV-I and HIV EIAs. The 13 HTLV-I Ab positive samples tested positive on the HIV/HTLV-I and HTLV-I EIAs. The 9 HIV, HTLV-I Ab positive samples tested positive on the HIV/HTLV-I, HIV and HTLV-I EIAs. The ten diluted HIV or HTLV-I Ab positive samples had reactivities on the HIV/HTLV-I EIA comparable to those on the appropriate single antigen EIA. The ND sera performer identically in the HIV/HTLV-I and the single antigen EIAs, with none testing positive. Conclusion. The HIV/HTLV-I EIA detects HIV and HTLV-I Abs with a sensitivity and specificity comparable to those of commercially available EIAs which only detect HIV or HTLV-I Abs. Clinical trials for the HIV/HTLV-I EIA are planned. 142 [Page 143](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/141) 1121 A COMBINATION IMMUNOFLUORESCENT ANTIBODY (IFA) TEST FOR DETECTION OF INFECTION WITH HUMAN RETROVIRUSES (HIV-1, -2, AND HTLVS-I,-II). W.D. Hardy Jr., E.E. Zuckerman, J.W.M. Gold, N. Chein, and D. Armstrong. Infectious Disease Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY Objective. To develop a combined IFA test for detection of antibodies (infection) to human retroviruses. Methods. Multiwell IFA microscope screening slides were prepared with the following mixture of retrovirus infected and uninfected cells: 15% of a mixture of H9 and HUT-78 uninfected cells. Whole blood or serum was tested at a 1:5 dilution or undiluted to ensure maximal sensitivity. Any serum that gave a positive reaction on the screening slide was then tested on specificity slides. Individual specificity slides were prepared as follows: 1) HIV-1: 50% H9/HIV-1 infected cells and 50% H9 uninfected cells, 2) HIV-2: 50% HUT-78/HIV-2 infected cells (or 50% CEM/HIV-2 infected cells) and 50% HUT-78 uninfected cells, 3) HTLV-I: 50% MT-2/HTLV-I infected cells and 25% H9 and 25% HUT-78 uninfected cells, and 4) infected cells and 25% H9 and 25% HUT-78 uninfected cells. Results. In comparative studies of over 1500 patients, the IFA test was as sensitive as the available HIV-1 and HTLV-I ELISA test kits and was as specific (99%) as the western blot techniques. Conclusion, The combined IFA test is practical, economical, sensitive and specific for detection of human retroviruses and can be adapted for use in underdeveloped countries by the use of immunoperoxidase. 1122 1122 DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANTIBODY SCREENING TEST FOR BOTH HTLVI AND HIV WITH A RECOMBINANTLY EXPRESSED VIRAL ENVELOPE FUSION PROTEIN Mathew Longiaru B. Scherer, B. Terry, T. Frenkl, R. Pottathil Roche Diagnostic Systems Inc., Nutley, New Jersey Objective. To develop a combined antibody screening assay for the detection of both HTLVI and HIV specific antibodies in the serum of individuals who have been exposed to either virus. Methods. A specific region of the HTLVI envelope gene was subcloned into a plasmid which over expresses an immunogenic portion of the HIV envelope protein. The resulting fusion protein continued to be over expressed in bacteria and was able to be purified to approximately 95%. Polystyrene beads coated with the purified fusion protein were used to detect anti-HTLVI and anti-HIV antibodies using standard EIA format. Results. The HTLVI/HIV antibody screen EIA was tested with 100 normal human sera as well as a panel of sera from human patients with either AIDS (100 samples) or Adult T-Cell Leukemia (ATL)(22 samples). HTLVI and HIV samples exhibited signal to noise ratios ranging from 3-20. By using the Roche HIV antibody screening test in tandem with this combined test, we could determine whether an individual had been exposed to either HIV or HTLVI, or if that patient had been doubly infected with both viruses. Conclusion. We have developed a screening test which can simultaneously detect HTLVI and/or HIV specific antibodies in patients with either AIDS or ATL. Notes: 1123 CONFIRMATORY PROCEDURES FOR ANTIBODY TO HTLV I IN EIA REPEAT REACTIVE SPECIMENS P. Swanson, J. Breister, E. Anderson, R. Allen, R. Gutierrez, M.Canavaggio, G. Dawson, T. Holzer, C. Wisniewski, H. Lee. Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL. Objective. Confirmation of samples found repeatedly reactive by an HTLV I EIA antibody screening assay (Abbott Laboratories, IL.). Methods. Samples were first tested for antibodies to HTLV I y Western blot (WB). Negative or indeterminate samples by WB were tested by SDS-PAGE radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) using cell lysates from two infected cell lines. Samples were also evaluated by 1251 p24 RIPA and dot blot for antibodies to recombinant proteins p40X and p21E. Results. Western blot confirmed 39/40 (97.5%) of samples from patients with Adult T-cell Leukemia (TSP), (100%) of blood donors from an endemic area (Martinique) and 13/35 (34%) of U.S. blood donors. Of 136 repeat reactive I.V. drug abusers (IVDA), 58% were confirmed by WB and 42% were indeterminate. 66% of IVDA specimens indeterminate by WB were confirmed by RIPA. Conclusion. In the absence of viral isolation, conservative criteria for confirmation of HTLV I infection have been used. WB alone was sufficient for confirming samples from most patients with ATL, TSP and blood donors from an endemic area. However, a combination of WB and SDS-PAGE RIPA were required to confirm samples with lower antibody levels such as IVDA and U.S. blood donors. 1124 SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES CONTAINING TYPE SPECIFIC CONTINUOUS EPITOPES OF THE HTLV-I ENVELOPE PROTEIN Anders Svennerholm', Clinical Virology, and *Medical Biochemistry, University of Gbteborg, Sweden Objective. To identify synthetic peptides that would specifically react with HTLV-I antibody positive human sera. Methods. Peptides (22 to 25 amino acids long) corresponding to five selected regions of the HTLV-I envelope protein were synthesized and coated onto microtiter plates. Reactivity to the peptides of six Western blot (WB) confirmed HTLV-I positive patients sera was tested in an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa). HTLV-1 immunoreactive peptides also were tested with 30 WB confirmed HIV-1 positive sera and with eight WB confirmed HIV-2 positive sera. Results. Three peptides were positive to all six HTLV-I positive sera. None of these three peptides were recognized by any of the 30 HIV-1 positive or eight HIV-2 positive sera. Conclusion. Synthetic peptides corresponding to selected regions of the HTLV-I envelope protein can be useful for type specific detection of antibodies to HTLV-I in patients sera. 143 [Page 144](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/142) I _.... (HTLV I) Antibodies By an ELISA. L. Granati*, G. Isacchi*, G. De Rossi*, G. Mariani*, *Department of Human Biophatology. Haematology section, University of Rome. Italian Red Cross. HTLV I seems to be present in Italy as Manzari et al.already reported. For this reason, antibody to HTLV I by a specific enzyme lynked immunoassay (ELISA Dupont) was detected in 600 cases. Therefore samples from patients with haematological disorders (Haemophilia, Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia, Acute Leukemia, Blood Donors, HIV positive patients, Miscellaneous) were tested for HTLV I ELISA Dupont, HIV (EIA Ortho) and HBsAg (ELISA Organon). With the HTLV I ELISA Dupont test 90% of the cases showed an absorbance less 0.3; 6 between 0.5-0.9, always under the cut off given by Dupont; 3 of them are not resulted repeatedly reactive, in 2 WD are under progLam, in another one (drug abuser, HIV positive, affected by Hodgkin disease) WB showed only proteine P. One patient affected by TCLL resulted repeatedly negative meanwhile with another test was positive for HTLV I. In our experience the cut off (mean positive by 0.60) given by Dupont is to high at least to identify sample with only protein P. Because the HTLV I antibodys' detection in haematological disorders and in blood donors will be emphasized, more attention will be given to the improvement of ELISA test. 1126 ANTIBODIES TO HTLV-I IN IVORY COAST: COMPARISON OF EIA AND IFA M. Canavaggio*, M.Verdier**, E. Krochmal* H. Lee*, F. Denis** * Abbott Laboratories, N. Chicago, IL. USA. ** Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire, Limoges France. Objective: Compare sensitivity and specificity of indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the screening of antibodies to HTLV-I in African serum. Methods: A collection of 931 serums were tested in parallel by IFA and an investigational EIA (Abbott Laboratories). Repeat reactive specimens were confirmed by Western blot and SDS- PAGE RIPA. All 931 specimens were from the Ivory Coast and included high risk individuals such as prisoners, prostitutes, leper, tuberculosis and psychiatric patients as well as control groups such as prison staff and pregnant women and children less than 10 yrs. old. Observations: Of 931 serum samples, 36 were EIA and IFA reactive and 35 were confirmed. One EIA reactive, IFA negative sample was confirmed positive. Three samples were IFA reactive, EIA negative and were not confirmed. Of interest was the high prevalence of antibodies to HTLV-I among leprosy patients (15 of 107, 14%) with a low prevalence rate of HIV-I and/or II antibodies (1/107, 0.9%). In contrast, 66/208 prisoners (31.7%) were positive for HIV antibodies and 9 of 208 (4.3%) were positive for HTLV-I antibodies, with 5 individuals dually infected. Conclusion: This comparison indicates the EIA was more sensitive and specific than the IFA, (respective specificity 99.88%, 99.55%). No cross reactivity with HIV was observed.

Essex*. *Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, **Brown University, Providence, ***New Bedford Area Center for Human Services, ****Mass. State Laboratory Institute. Methods. Selected populations in the Northeastern United States were tested by immunoblot to HIV-2 and HTLV-I antigens to determine the presence of these viruses in this geographic area. Populations tested included 1) individuals at high risk for HIV-1 infection, which were primarily I.V. drug abusers, 2) individuals of West African descent, 3) patients suspected of having an immune deficiency or with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, 4) individuals who tested seropositive by WB to only gag or gag and pol antigens of HIV-1 (env(-)sera) from nearly 1300 HIV-1 reactive sera, 5) sera from Hepatitis B study (HBsAg + sera) in Southeastern Massachusetts. Results. A high degree of cross-reactivity of HIV-1 sera to HIV-2 antigens was noted by Radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) HIV-1+ status when needed.

S.S. Alexander,A.J. Bodner and C.C. Tai Biotech Research Laboratories, Rockville, MD 20850 USA Objective: To identify the major reactive viral proteins detectable on HTLV-I Western blot strips. Methods: HTLV-I was purified from the of cultured Hutl02-B2, MT2 and C91-PL cell supernatants. Viral polypeptides were separated by molecular weight on SDS gels and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose. These membranes were reacted with sera from HTLV-I positive individuals and polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to specific viral proteins. Bound antibodies were detected using biotinylated second antibodies, avidinHRP and 4CN as substrate. Similar experiments were also carried out using recombinant protein from the pX gene of HTLVI (p40x). Antigen reactivity was also demonstrated metabolically radiolabeled cells (RIPA). Results: could be correlated with a 36-38K MW band on Western blot strips but only those prepared from Hut 102-B2 cels. This reactivity was verified by the specific reaction of polyclonal sera prepared against a recombinant pX protein. Conclusion: A Western Blot assay prepared from Hut 102-B2 virus can be used to detect antibody to the pX(tat) protein of HTLV I. 144 [Page 145](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/143) 1129 PREVALENCE OF HTLV I IN U.S. BLOOD DONORS AND HIGH RISK GROUPS J. Burczak, M. Canavaggio, G. Dawson,W. Glusic S. Hojvat, J. Schrode, J. Steaffens, P. Swanson, H. Lee. Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL. Objective. To determine the prevalence of HTLV I exposure among blood donors and high risk populations in the United States. Method. Specimens from 17540 blood donors were tested for the presence of antibody (Ab) to HTLV I using a solid phase ELISA. Of these specimens, 13690 were sera from volunteer donors, 2001 were plasma from volunteer donors, 1849 were plasma from paid donors; sera from 282 intravenous drug abusers (IVDA) and 182 male homosexuals were also tested. Repeat reactive (RR) samples were confirmed by Western blot and SDS-PAGE-RIPA. Results. In blood donors, 38 samples were RR in the ELISA; 17 of 13690 serum samples (0.12%) - 4 confirmed (0.03%); 8 of 2001 plasma samples from paid donors (0.70%) - 7 confirmed (0.38%). In contrast, 13 of 647 serum samples (2.01%) from blood donors in Martinique, an area considered endemic for HTLV I, were RR in the ELISA and confirmed positive. Of 152 samples from homosexual males, 2 were RR and one (0.66%) was confirmed. Among IVDAs, 81 of 282 samples were RR and 67 (24%) were confirmed. Conclusion. HTLV I infection is present in U.S. blood donors with a significantly higher prevalence in plasma donors (p 0.1). This prevalence is 10 times lower than in a known endemic area like Martinique. In contrast to HIV transmission, HTLV I Ab was significantly more prevalent in IVDAs than in homosexual males, suggesting a low efficiency of homosexual transmission. 1130 THE DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES TO HUMAN T-CELL LYMPHOTROPIC VIRUS TYPE I (HTLV-I) IN BLOOD AND PLASMA DONORS. D.R. Bone, C.P. Rubin, T.A. O'Brien, R.L. Egan, S.S. Alexander* and A.J. Bodner*, E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Wilmington, Delaware and *Biotech Research Laboratories, Rockville, Maryland. Objective: To determine the prevalence of antibodies to HTLV-I in normal blood and plasma donors in the United States. Methods: Nearly 25,000 normal blood donors at 5 sites and over 13,000 plasma donors at 4 sites were screened for antibodies to HTLV-I using the Du Pont HTLV-I ELISA. All initially reactive samples were tested in duplicate with the HTLV-I ELISA. All repeatedly reactive samples were further tested using either the Du Pont HTLV-I Western Blot Service or another western blot. Results: Of the 24,759 blood donors, 33 (0.13%) were repeatedly reactive on the ELISA and five (0.02%) were western blot positive (presence of antibodies to pl9 and p24). Of the 13,155 plasma donors, 60 (0.46%) were repeatedly reactive on the ELISA, and 31 (0.24%) of these were western blot positive. Conclusions: These data indicate that a small but significant percentage of blood donors has been infected with HTLV-I and a larger percentage of plasma donors has been infected. These data suggest that routine screening of blood and plasma donors should be considered. Notes: 1131 REGULATION OF VISNA VIRUS TRANSCRIPTION Dana Gabuzda, Jay Hess, Janice Clements The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland, USA Objective. To identify regulatory elements in the viral LTR which control transcription in visna virus, a lentivirus which shares biologic features and sequence homology with HIV. Methods. A plasmid containing the visna virus LTR directing CAT gene expression was transfected into U937 cells by electroporation and into several eukaryotic cell types by the DEAE-dextran method. Transcriptional activity in uninduced and phorbol ester-induced uninfected membrane (GSM) cells, and (SAM) was measured by CAT assays. Nucleotide sequences responding to transacting signals were identified using deletion and linkerscanning mutations. Gel shift assays were performed using nuclear extracts of uninduced and phorbol esterinduced U937 cells and Results. expression in U937 cells is activated by phorbol ester, which induces macrophage-like differentiation. Specific regulatory sequences in the visna LTR respond to trans-acting signals in infected GSM, SCP, and SAM cells. Gel shift assays demonstrate at least one shifted band associated with phorbol ester induction. Conclusion. Visna virus transcription is activated by phorbol ester induction of a monocyte cell line and by trans-acting signals associated with viral infection. These data may provide insight into the molecular basis of viral latency and the activation of viral gene expression associated with disease caused by visna virus and other lentiviruses. 1132 HIV-ANTIGEN POSITIVE CULTURES AND RETROVIRUSLIKE A PARTICLES FROM PREGNANT PROSTITUTE FROM TAMIL NADU, INDIA. Khorshed Pavri, Zimra Israel, M.A. Sreenivasan and Jeanette 3. Rodrigues. National Institute of Virology, Pune, India. Objective. To describe isolation of intracisternal A particles (IAP) from a pregnant prostitute with atypical sero-response to HIV. Methods. Standard methods were followed for virus isolation, monitoring reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, thin-section electron microscopy and for serology. Results. Cell from the co-cultivated cultures collected 15-16 weeks later revealed particles reseibling murine IAPs under electron microscope. The 50-60 nm particles were smaller than those described for rodents. Further evidence comes from the extremely slow growth, absence of giant-cell formation and low activity of RT in the same cultures giving positive reaction for HIV antigen. The prostitute had become ELISA negative at the time of delivery, i.e. within 10 months after she was first recognized as a confirmed HIV seropositive. A serum specimen collected 6 months after the delivery was also negative by ELISA. In WB, persistence of Igi antibodies to p24 and p66 - major gag and pol gene products - and, disappearance of IgG antibodies to envelope glycoproteins also reflected an atypical s eror espons e. Conclusion. This first record of isolation of human IAP expands the evidence of endogenous retroviral sequences reported in human DNA. In a companion presentation we postulate that human IAP could act as a precursor for HIV.

To study the mechanism of integration of retroviral DNA into the host chromosome by making use of a cell-free reaction system, and to establish a method of screening compounds for inhibition of this reaction. Methods. Viral core particles of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) containing linear viral DNA were incubated with exogenously added target DNA in a cell free reaction. The product was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, southern blotting and hybridization. Results. About 10 to 20% of the input viral DNA molecules are joined to exogenously added target DNA during the cell free reaction. This product has the structure of the integration intermediate predicted by an integration mechanism that is similar to bacteriophage Mu transposition. The 3'-ends of the LTR sequences are joined to the target DNA, while the 5'-ends of the viral DNA remain unjoined. A fine structure analysis of the 5'-ends of the LTR sequences in the intermediate indicates that the linear form of Mo-MLV DNA can integrate directly without prior circularization. A search for inhibitors of viral DNA integration has now been initiated using this cellfree reaction system as an assay. Conclusions. The cell-free reaction system for retroviral DNA integration is a powerful tool for the study of the reaction mechanism as well as for the screening of potential anti-viral drugs which inhibit this step of the viral life cycle. 1134 ELEVATED HBLV (HUMAN HERPESVIRUS-6) ANTIBODY IN Bethesda, MD 20892 **North Shore Univ. Hospital, Long Island, NY USA, *** Institute of Pathology, Univ. of Cologne, West Germany Objective. HBLV was isolated in 1986 from patients with lymphoproliferative disorders and AIDS. We investigated the prevalence of antibody to this virus in HIV-1 antibody-positive individuals with or without clinical manifestations, using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Results. Of 299 sera tested from patients with ARC, PGL and AIDS, 66.0% were HBLV antibody-positive with an average of with from 1:20-1:160). By comparision, 47.0% of the sera from 17 HIV-1 antibody-negative homosexual men were HBLV antibody-positive, with and average titer of 1:20 (range 1:20-> 1:80) and only 24% of sera from healthy donors from, USA and Europe contained HBLV antibody with an average titer of 1:20 or greater. Conclusion. These data indicated an increased association of HBLV with HIV-1-infected individuals and also with a population at high risk of developing AIDS. Since HBLV can lytically infect both fresh and established B-and T-cells, i.e. CD2, CD4 and CD7, it is possible that infection by HBLV may contribute to the rapidity of the development of symptoms or to the severity of the immune consequences in HIV-infected individuals. Notes: 1135 Characterization of Human AIDS Program* Herpes Virus Branch** Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, OBJECT: During routine culture of mononuclear cells for HIV a cytopathogenic herpesvirus was found in lymphocyte of 11 individuals, this virus which we call HHV-6 was found to suppress replication of HIV We wished to compare HHV-6 with human herpes 1-5 (HHV-1-5) and Human B Lymphotropic Virus (HBLV) and test if HHV-6 replicates in human T lymphocytes. Method: The antigenic characteristics and DNA sequence of HHV-6 was compared to HHV 1-5 and HBLV. In different cell preparations B, T, T4 and T8 lymphocytes were destroyed or T, T4 or T8 lymphocytes were positively sorted. HHV-6 was then inoculated into the different preparations. Results: (1) Antigenic and DNA sequence characterization indicates HHV-6 is distinct from HHV-1-5 but shows extensive cross reactivity and homology with HBLV. (2) HHV-6 titer was as high or higher in separated T, T4 or T8 cells preparations compared to non-separated cell preparations. Conclusions: HHV-6 is an independently isolated variant of HBLV and can equally well infect and replicate in both T4 and T8 human lymphocytes. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS-LIKE ILLNESS WITH HIV INFECTION Joseph R. Berger* L Resnick ** S Atherton* M Fletcher* M Norenberg* W Sheremeta* M Coles*** J Marcos*** *University of Miami School of Medicine **Mt Sinai Hospital, Miami ***Miami, Florida Two HIV seropositive individuals presented with remitting-relapsing neurological disease clinically indistinguishable from multiple sclerosis (MS). Patient #1, a 29 year old homosexual man, presented with left optic neuritis evolving within 2 week to bilateral optic neuritis and left hemiparesis. MRI revealed a right frontal white matter (WM) hyperintense T2 abnormality. Brain biopsy was characteristic of MS. No papovavirions were demonstrated. Viral probes failed to reveal evidence of HIV, CMV or HSV 1 & 2. His symptoms resolved spontaneously, albeit incompletely. Four months later, he developed acute spastic paraplegia. Brain MRI revealed three new WM lesions. Patient #2, a 28 year old homosexual man, presented with optic neuritis spontaneously resolving over 2 weeks. Subsequently, he has been plagued by frequent bouts of incompletely resolving optic neuritis and spastic paraparesis exquisitely responsive to ACTH. Both patients had decreased absolute T4 cells, initial CSF mononuclear pleocytosis (12 & 58 WBC/mm3), and HIV-specific IgG intrathecal synthesis. In neither has opportunistic infection supervened or HTLV-I been demonstrated. A MS-like illness may occur in association with HIV. Whether it is \"true\" MS rendered florid by simultaneous HIV infection or a new entity remains to be determined. 146 [Page 147](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/145) 1137 A NEWLY IDENTIFIED VIRUS-LIKE INFECTIOUS AGENT DERIVED FROM A PATIENT WITH AIDS S.C. Lo, J.W. Shih, N. Yang and R.Y.-H. Wang. Armed Forces Inst. of Pathology, Wash.,D.C., and Dept. of Transfusions Med., Clinical Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD. Objective. Isolation, characterization and genomic analysis of a new virus-like infectious agent (VLIA). Methods. DNA isolated from Kaposi's sarcoma tissue of an AIDS patient was transfected directly into phenotypically normal NIH/3T3 mouse cells. Transforming foci, exhibiting rapid and multilayered cell growth, were isolated in these transfected cultures. Results. One transformant, SB51, derived from the 2nd cycle of DNA transfection, was found to contain viruslike particles (VLP). The nearly spherical particles revealed heterogeneity in both size and shape. The VLP were 140-280 nm in diameter, had well defined outer limiting membranes (about 8 nm thick), appeared to be cell associated, and were seen in the cytoplasm of degenerating cells. DNA isolated from purified VLP was cloned into various vectors. 8.6 kilo-base and 2.2 kilobase pair cloned probes of this agent, which specifically hybridized to DNA of purified VLP and sb51 cells, but not to that of parental NIH/3T3 cells, were used to assay for infectivity in cell cultures. The 0.22 u filterable agent could infect and be continuously passed in cultures of human embryo cells, monkey BSC cells and NIH/3T3 cells. The DNA genome of this infectious agent was estimated to be greater than 150 kilo-base pairs. By nucleic acid analysis, the infectious agent is distinct from all known members of human herpes virus and vaccinia pox virus. Conclusion. A newly identified virus-like infectious agent, designated as VLIA-sb51, was isolated from a patient with AIDS. 1138 POSSIBLE RELATION OF AN HIV-1 RELATED SEQUENCE IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE) Werner Leitmann, M Krapf,JR of Erlangen-NUrnberg, D-8520 Erlangen, FRG Objective. Our data suggest the association of a retroviral agent with the pathogenesis of SLE as demonstrated by sequencing data obtained from SLE-patients' derived plasma DNA and by cythopathic alterations in a human B cell line caused by plasma nucleic acids from SLE-patients. Methods. Following extraction of high mol. wt. DNA (approx. 20 kb) and RNA (>60 b) from several SLE patients' plasmas we characterized the DNA and RNA fractions by nucleoside analyses. Molecular cloning and determination of the base sequences was thus far pursued for the DNA contents and a comparative screening was performed to elucidate its origin. Furthermore, plasma nucleic acids (PNA) were cocultivated with a human B cell line (B62) and the cells (referred as B62/SLE) were analyzed for morphological changes, immunoglobulin production and metabolic deviations as compared to untreated control cells (B62/-). Results. A cloned plasma DNA displayed extensive homology to the HIV-1 protease gene (85% homology in 150 bp to H9 isolate); all selected clones, additionally, proved to be enriched in d6/dC (50%) and Cp6 frequency indicating a nonrandom origin of PNA. Exclusively B62/SLE cells showed enhanced vacuolization and syncitia formation. A high mol. wt. RNA molecule was induced in the cytoplasm, and further labelling experiments detected myristylated proteins likewise to HIV- 1 specified patterns. Cell lysates showed twentyfold activity of levamisole resistant alkaline phosphatase, while inhibitor-sensitive enzyme was downregulated close to zero. An ELISA assay revealed reduced levels of IgM secretion in B62/SLE cells, while no significant changes in lgO synthesis were observed. Conclusion. HIV-related retroviruses might be involved in the pathogenesis of SLE as outlined by molecular properties of plasma DNA and transfective effects of PNA, Notes: 1139 TYPE-RESTRICTED NEUTRALIZATION OF VIRUSES DERIVED FROM CLOSELY RELATED MOLECULAR CLONES OF A SINGLE HIV-1 ISOLATE 1 2 G D.

Objectives: To investigate immunologic implications of genetic diversity within human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates, neutralization (NT) of three molecularly cloned viruses derived from HIV-1/NIH/USA/1983/HTLVIII by heterologous antisera to recombinant or native HIV envelope glycoproteins (gpl20 or gpl60) or peptides was examined. Results: Antisera to gpl20 or peptides homologous to HX10 had higher neutralization titers (NT) against a restriction. Antisera to gpl60 homologous to HXB3 showed higher NT (1:128-1:256) than HX10 or HTLVIIIB (1:4-1:16). Oligopeptides differing by a single residue showed differences in their ability to block neutralization by these sera. A single nucleotide change appears to be responsible for the observed restriction. 1140 RELATIVE IMMUNOGENICITY OF GP120 ANTIGENIC SEPITOPES AND THE ROLE Lee*, *Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, **Dept. of Virus Diseases, WRAIR, Washington, DC, ***Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD Objective. To map antigenic epitopes recognized by gpl20 antibodies produced during natural infection, and to determine if gpl20 antibody response is associated with disease progression. Approach. Antigenic epitopes are identified on chemically treated or enzymatically cleaved gpl20 and on various recombinant gpl20 peptides. Sera. from 31 seroconverters, 35 asymptomatic seropositives who progressed to AIDS, and 172 HIV-seropositive controls were analyzed in this study. Results. Immunodominant response is directed to discontinuous epitopes of gpl20. This antibody is produced very early in HIV infection and persists throughout the course of infection. Antibody response associated with better prognosis is mapped to the carboxyl portion of gpl20. This antibody is group specific and is not produced early in infection. Conclusion. The majority of naturally produced gpl20 antibodies are directed to discontinuous epitopes. This type of antibody appears to have a negligible role in halting disease progression. The response directed to the carboxyl portion of gpl20, though not dominant, is associated with better disease prognosis. 147 [Page 148](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/146) 1141 ANTIBODIES AGAINST HIV LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT IMMUNOBLOTMING Edgar Lauritzen*, Hospital, ****Bispebjerg Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark Objective. To define a method where antibodies (abs) against low molecular weight (liw) HIV antigens (ags) could be determined in routine settings. To define the prognostic value of abs against HIV Imw ags. Methods. Purified HIV and crude HIV ag from H9 cells was applied, and lysates of uninfected H9 cells served as control. Immunoblotting of the separated proteins were conducted by standard procedures after separation in 5-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Both immunoblotting matrices. - HIV positive sera were collected, that reacted with all visible HIV ags above Mr 15000, and with different Imw HIV ags. These sera were used to define ag-similarity between different 1mw HIV ags. - Sera from AIDS, ARC, and healthy homosexual patients and hemophiliacs are presently being studied. Results. By immunoblotting onto NC, three different Imw HIV ags with M 12000, 14000, and 15000 could be defined. The number of different visible Imw HIV ags increased considerably by application of the PVDF membrane, where six different Imw HIV ags were developed by the positive sera. They displayed M 9000, 10000, 11000, 12000, 13000, and 14000. The composilion of anti-HIV 1mw ag antibodies in sera from different groups of patients are under study. The trend is that ARC patients tend to have a high frequency of anti-HIV 1mw antibodies, while the other groups of patients do not. 1142 SECRETION OF GP120 AND GP160 BY A HIV-I INFECTED CELL LINE AND THEIR INTERACTION WITH THE CD4 ANTIGEN, V.S. Kalyanaraman*, Ranajit Rockville, MD **National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD Objective. Delineate the functional domains of native gpl20 and gpl60 of divergent HIV-I isolates. Methods. HIV-I-infected cell lines were grown in serum containing (SCM) or serum-free defined (SFM) media. Virus yield was monitored by reverse transcriptase assay in cell-free media. Medium.proteins were concentrated by and fractionated chromatography on. lentil lectin Sepharose. Binding of HIV-I by target cells was monitored by incubation with metabolically labeled proteins followed by immunoprecipita-- tion using appropriate antibodies. Results. A clone (6D5) of HUT78 cell line (infected with the HIV-I isolate HTLV-III ) grew equally well in SCM 451 and SFM. There was nearly a fivefold increase in virus yield in the SFM culture. The cell cultures secreted both gpl20 and its precursor gpl60. The proteins were characterized using a number of specific antibodies to gpl20 and gp41 of HIV-I. Further, both gpl20 and gpl60 bound strongly to the CD4 antigen expressed on CEM and similar CD4-positive cell lines. The CD4-gpl20/gpl60 complex was immunoprecipitated only by OKT4 and not OKT4a monoclonal antibody to CD4. The proteins also inhibited the syncytium formation induced by HTLV-IIIB infected cell lines on CEM cells. Conclusion. Secretion of gpl60, in its native form, makes it possible to study the functional domains of both the envelope proteins gpl20 and gp41 of HIV-I. Notes: 1143 To obtain recombinant HIV-2 antigens which can be used to discriminate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections. Methods. Restriction fragments corresponding to amino acids 555-761, 393-773, 5-392, 393-554 of the HIV-2 env gene were cloned into the bacterial expression vector PEX-3. After transformation positive clones were identified by immunoscreening with HIV-2 positive sera. Recombinant fusion proteins were produced in bulk culture, purified by detergent phase extraction and used in Western blot and ELISA. Results. Only the recombinant proteins containing a portion of the transmembrane protein of HIV-2 (aa 555-761) were regularly recognized by patient sera. Constructs derived exclusively from the external transmembrane protein reacted only weakly with some sera. 6 of 30 HIV-1 sera tested showed weak cross-reactivity with recombinant antigens derived from the transmembrane protein. However, parallel testing on a recombinant HIV-1 peptide in ELISA allowed to discriminate between HIV-1 and HIV-2. Conclusion. Recombinant prokaryontic HIV-2 proteins comprising the transmembrane protein are best suited for diagnostic purposes. Parallel testing with HIV-1 antigens allows discrimination between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections. Key words: HIV-2, recombinant protein. Supported by the Ludwig Boltzmann-Gesellschaft and the State of Tyrol. 1144 MAPPING OF Cancer Biology, Harvard School of Public Hlth. **Brown University Objective. To define immunoreactive epitopes on recombinant gpl20 peptides with sera from HIV-1 seropositive individuals. Methods. Recombinant peptides of HIV-1 gpl20 were generated from a bacterial expression vector driven by the tacpromoter. Western blot analysis was performed on these recombinant gpl20 peptides with HIV-1 seropositive sera. Results. 0 0 (n=10) HIV-1 seropositive 17 20 25 56 (n=87) 65 Conclusion. These data indicate that continuous epitopes are distributed throughout the gpl20 molecule. Among the continuous epitopes, the immunodominant ones map near to the carboxyl terminus gpl20. 148 [Page 149](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/147) 1145 EXPRESSION OF THE 3'ORF-READING FRAME FROM HIV-1 IN E.COLI AND REACTION OF THE RECOMBINANT PRODUCT WITH SERA FROM HIV INFECTED HUMAN INDIVIDUALS. N. Kienzle, C. Vinga-Martins, Schwehr, U. FRG. Methods: regions (210 bp and 510 bp) of the 3'orf reading frame (F-protein) from HIV-1 containing the complete C-terminus of the protein were isolated by EcoRV or XhoI restriction enzyme digests and cloned in the tryptophan regulated expression vector pATH. After expression two fusion proteins of 43 kD and 56 kD Mw were obtained and used for the production of specific polyclonal sera or as antigen for detecting antibodies against the F-protein in human sera. Results: First results indicated that sera exhibiting high titers againgst viral structural proteins gag and env reacted approx. to 50% with the recombinant F-protein. In contrast sera from patients in the late phase of HIV infection exhibiting low titers against structural proteins demonstrated much lower reactivity to the F-protein. A few sera from the very early phase of infection tested so far showed antibodies against the F-protein while no or only boarderline reactivity against gag and env were found. Conclusion: These results indicate so far that at least in some cases antiodies against the Fprotein might be an early marker for HIV infection.

Erlwein, J.v.Hintzenstern Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virolocrv, University of Erlangen-NUrnberg, W.-Germany Objective. To obtain better diagnostic reagents for confirmatory testina, we expressed HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigens a expres - representing immunogenic of structural gag- and env-proteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 were produced in E.coli as stable B-galactosidase fusion proteins.These recombinant proteins were taken as antiaens for immunoblot-assays with human sera. The results were compared to reactive bands in conventional immunoblots (carried out with proteins of purified virions). Results.Western blots with the recombinant fusion nroteins gave results in general comparable with conventional ELISA, immunoblot and immunofluorescence. The recombinant nolnyentides representing internal parts of the transmembrane proteins (gp 41 or qp 38) were particularly sensitive and it was possible to distinquish HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection with these nrobes. Conclusion. Immunoblots with recombinant nroteins provide reliable and inexpensive serodiacnostics for HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection without handling infectious cell cultures. Notes: 1147 HIVAGENTM - A NEW HIV ANTIBODIES CONFIRMATORY TEST UTILIZING A PANEL OF RECOMBINANT HIV PEPTIDES. C. S. Chiang*, Vincent P. Perna*, Christine Debouck**, Thomas H. Grove*, *SmithKline Bio-Science Laboratories, USA; **SmithKline & French Labs., USA. Objective. To develop a more accurate and objective HIV antibodies confirmatory test using a panel of recombinant peptides representing the major gene products of HIV. Methods. An HIV antibodies confirmatory test (HIVAGENTM) was developed using a panel of purified, recombinant peptides produced by genetic engineering techniques in E. coli. The six peptides are: Kp24 and Kp55 env; and Kp66/31 from pol. The test has been formatted as an ELISA. The purified peptides are individually coated onto wells of a polystyrene microtiter plate. The presence of antibody is demonstrated by a colorimetric reaction. Results. Reactivity to a peptide is based on a fixed cutoff. A positive specimen has reactivity at least to 2 of 3 different gene products. An indeterminate specimen has reactivity to one gene product. Sero- % % % pos.(a) N pos. indeterminate neg.

Braun, Abbott Abbott Park, Illinois 60064. Objective. To compare the antigenicities of recombinant and viral p41 and p24 antigens of HIV-I. Methods. Full length bacterial antigen analogs were compared with native viral antigens by competition western blot and radioimmunoprecipitin assays. Results. The recombinant antigens competed specifically and completely their respective antigens when tested on viral based western blots. Competitive RIPA studies showed they each competed with their respective viral antigens completely with competition kinetics identical to those of their respective viral antigens. Conclusion. The results suggest that these p41 and p24 bacterial protein analogs were antigenically equivalent to those of the HIV-I transmembrane and core antigens, supporting the contention that for immunodetection purposes, some recombinant antigens can indeed be used in place of the less abundant viral antigens. 149 [Page 150](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/148) 1149 AN IMMUNOMETRIC ELISA FOR ANTIBODIES TO HIV-1 USING LABELED RECOMBINANT ANTIGENS Steven R. Earle,T.A. Harper, M.A. Roser, R. Fico, AIDS/Hepatitis R&D, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL 60064. Objective. The use of labeled HIV antigens in ELISA for detection of bound anti-HIV (immunometric format) was compared with the use of labeled anti-immunoglobulin in regard to sensitivity and specificity. Methods. A solid phase for capture of anti-HIV was prepared by coating polystyrene beads with purified recombinant HIV antigens. Labeled antigens for detection of bound antibodies were prepared by chemically coupling purified recombinant HIV core and envelope antigens to horseradish peroxidase. Results. 227 Western Blot positive sera from AIDS, ARC, and asymptomatic donors were reactive. Sensitivity of the immunometric assay was up to five 2-fold dilutions greater than current tests, and studies on three donors during seroconversion showed detection of anti-HIV improved by 19, 21, and 35 days. Negative samples (N=2600) gave an initial reactive rate of 0.3% with no repeat reactives. A group of repeat reactive samples by current tests (but negative by Western Blot) was not reactive. This ELISA format will allow detection of antibodies to HIV other than human. Thus, goat or mouse antibodies to either gpl20, gp41, or p24 were readily detected. The assay detects IgM as well as IgG. Conclusion. The use of labeled antigens for detection of bound anti-HIV offers improved sensitivity and specificity when compared to the use of labeled anti-immunoglobul in. 1150 A QUANTITATIVE ANTI-p24 HIV-1 CLINICAL MARKER ASSAY R. Earle,R.G. Thys, B.P. Braun, T.A. Harper, M.A. Roser, R. Fico, AIDS/Hepatitis R&D, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL 60064. Objective. Changes in HIV antigen (p24) and anti-p24 levels have been associated with the clinical transition from asymptomatic to AIDS and change during anti-viral therapy. Thus, it was of interest to develop a quantitative ELISA to measure levels of immunoglobulin to p24. Methods. A solid phase for capture of serum or plasma antibodies to p24 was prepared by coating purified recombinant antigen on polystyrene beads. Detection of bound immunoglobulin was accomplished using purified recombinant p24 chemically coupled to horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase. Results. Total assay time for undiluted serum or plasma samples was three hours. A quantitation panel with relative anti-p24 titers from 1 to 1,000 was linear and gave inter-assay CV's of 20%. Preliminary results indicate about 10% of AIDS/ARC samples have no detectable anti-p24, with most of these being antigen positive. A comparison of sensitivity with a current licensed test was as follows: GREATEST RECIPROCAL SERIAL DILUTION TESTED POSITIVE sample 1 2 3 4 5 6 Envacor (core) 960 <40 <40 <80 160 2000 quant. anti-p24 7680 640 160 320 2500 32000 Conclusion. This anti-p24 ELISA is rapid, sensitive, quantitative, and could be utilized in anti-viral therapy and vaccine development. Notes: 1151 FIELD PERFORMANCE OF AN IMPROVED RECOMBINANT (p24 AND p41)ANTI-HIV EIA SCREENING TEST J. Shih, D. Hardesty, A. Wancho, S. Kidd, C. Downey, L. VaTdivia, R. Fico. Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL 60064. Objective. Field performance of an improved recombinant anti-HIV screening test. Methods. Abbott HIV EIA (rDNA) is a recombinant based anti-HIV screening assay. We have cloned the entire gene for gag protein p24 and the entire gp41 gene with the immunodominant region of gpl20. Using these two recombinant antigens, Abbott HIV EIA (rDNA) has been developed as a more specific and more sensitive assay for antibodies against HIV. Format improvements include a shorter total incubation period (90 minutes) and a single step dilution of sample. Results. 78 false positive samples from a viral assay were negative by this assay. Preliminary clinical results with normal blood donor populations (2000 samples) indicate a reactive rate of less than 0.2%. 100% sensitivity has been shown by positive results from over 500 blot positive samples from diverse geographical locations (Africa, Europe, Caribbean, US). Serial dilution of positive samples show enhanced sensitivity of 1 to 2 serial dilutions over current tests. Three seroconversion panels show increased detectability of samples 2 to 4 bleeds (2 to 6 weeks) sooner than current licensed tests. Conclusion. The data demonstrates the improved assay performance using recombinant antigens. 1152 AUTOMATED ANTI-HIV Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, 60064, U.S.A. Objective. To develop an automated sandwich-type immunoassay to detect antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) that utilizes recombinant antigens. Methods. Antibodies to gp41, gp24, and gpl20 are detected by the assay. By virtue of the antigen sandwich type configuration, all classes of antibodies should be reactive. Increased sensitivity is achieved by using covalent coupling of antigens on a microparticle solid phase. In addition, the assay is designed to use fluorescent substrates in the enzyme-linked reaction for the development step. Results. Samples that are borderline positive in current viral based blood screening assays give a positive signal at up to a four-fold greater dilution in this assay. Two hundred negative serum and plasma samples were screened and all were found to be negative. Twenty anti-HIV positive samples were tested and all were found to be positive. By running the assay in the Abbott IMx instrument, 20 samples and 4 controls can be run with all results reported within 40 minutes. Conclusion. Overall this automated, fluorescent assay allows faster turnaround time and better sensitivity than current commercial assays. 150 [Page 151](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/149) 1153 ANTIBODIES TO RECOMBINANT HIV GAG, POL, AND ENV GENE PRODUCTS IN SERA FROM HIV-INFECTED DONORS Quinnan FDA, CBER, Div. of Virology, Bethesda, MD, U.S.A. Objective. To prepare recombinant HIV antigens containing entire or subgenomic portions of individual viral proteins, to use these antigens to screen sera, and to compare the data with that obtained by ELISA using whole virus, Western blot, and neutralization. Methods. Cloned antigens of HIV/HTLV-IIIB were prepared in E. coli. Six antigen-expressing clones were characterized by nucleic acid sequencing: #1 (gag): portion of gpl20, all end, fused to art/trs; #5 (env-orf): carboxyl portion of gpl20 containing the neutralizing epitope. Partially purified antigen preparations were used in ELISA with 120 sera from patients with known diagnosis and controls. Results. The ability of the cloned antigens to detect antibodies revealed differences from Western blot for certain diagnoses. #1 detected loss of antibodies to p24/pl5 with advancing disease. #6 was superior to #3, #4, and #5 at detecting sera containing neutralizing antibodies, and appearance of these antibodies correlated with advancing disease. Conclusion. Individual cloned antigens may be useful in defining antibody patterns associated with severity of disease. 1154 EVALUATION OF HIVAGENTM RECOMBINANT HIV ANTIGENS FOR THE San Francisco; Dept. Med. & Lab. Med, San Fran. Gen. Hosp.; **Smith-Kline BioScience Lab., USA. Objective. To evaluate the ability of recombinant HIV antigens used in the HIVAGENTM to detect antibodies to HIV. Methods. ELISA, Western blot. Results. Recombinant HIV antigens, expressed E. coli, corresponding in an ELISA assay to detect the presence of antibodies to HIV. The percent seroreactivity for the different populations to each recombinant antigen tested sensitivity & specificity; kp55 & 66 were also highly sensitive & specific. Western blot results duplicated reactivity observed with recombinant antigens. Conclusions. Recombinant HIV antigens can be effectively used in an ELISA format to test for antibodies to HIV. The kp41 antigen was best for discriminating between seropositive and seronegative individuals. Notes: 1155 IMMUNOREACTIVE BEAD (IRB) ASSAY FOR THE QUANTITATIVE AND SIMULTANEOUS FLOW CYTOMETRIC DETECTION OF SPECIFIC IgG AND IgM ANTIBODIES TO FOUR rDNAPRODUCED HIV ANTIGENS. James J. Scillian*, School of Medicine, and **Irwin Memorial Blood Bank, San Francisco, CA, ***Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA. Objective. To develop a flow cytometer-based immunoreactive bead assay for the rapid, simultaneous identification and quantitation of antibodies to multiple HIV antigens. Methods. Uniform sized polystyrene beads were coated with four HIV rDNA proteins (p31/5pL, gpl20/7p, p24/10p, and gp41/15.L). Mixtures of these beads were incubated with diluted sera, washed and the bound Ig was identified with FITC- F(ab')2 anti-human IgG or IgM. The stained beads were then analyzed with FACSCAN (B.-D.) according to bead size. Results. Assay specificity was demonstrated by inhibition studies with purified HIV or unrelated antigens. Dilutions linearity. The assay was initially evaluated using 126 blood donor sera for which multiple EIA and Western Blot (WB) results, as well as clinical and culture follow up were available. Using WB assay results as the standard, the IRB assay showed 100% sensitivity and 98.8% specificity. Furthermore, 61/62 (98.4%) EIA false positives {WB(-)} were negative by the IRB assay. Out of 18 EIA positive, WB-equivocal (WB-Eq) sera, 14 (82.4%) were definitely identified as HIV(-) and one as HIV(+) by the IRB assay. Results of the assay performed on serial samples from seroconverters, healthy seropositives and AIDS/ARC patients will be presented. Conclusion. We have developed a sensitive and specific IRB assay for the identification and quantitation of HIV antibodies, adaptable to automation, and which is currently being used in studies on the diagnosis and prognosis of HIV infected adults and children. Clinical evaluation in HIV infected infants is separately presented by Edwards et al. Supported by NIH Contract HB-6-7020. 1156 HIGH SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFITY OF AN IMMUNOBLOT TEST FOR ANTI-HIV USING RECOMBINANT HIV ANTIGENS Gert G Frosner, M Motz, E Soutschek-Bauer, H H Meyer-Ewert** Max von Pettenkofer-Institut and *Medizinische Poliklinik, University of Munich, and **Dept. Virology, University Rechts der Isar, Munich Objective. Specifity and sensitivity of a new configuration of immunoblot test using recombinant p24, p41, and a fusion protien of both (Lancet 1987 II, 1093) is evaluated. Results. Testing of sera of 290 Bavarian blood donors collected in 1977 (prevalence of anti-HIV is assumed to be extremely low at that time) revealed no reactivity against p41 (95 % confidence interval 0-1.25 %). Two sera reacted weakly with fusion protein only, and 8 sera reacted with p24 (1 strongly and 4 weakly). Titration of WHO anti-HIV reference serum lot 68 showed a more than 100fold higher sensitivity for anti-gp41, and a more than 10 fold higher sensitivity for anti-p24 than conventional Western blot. Sensitivity was even higher than in anti-HIV screening test. Anti-p41 was detected in a patient with ARC and in a person with seroconversion in sera negative by screening test. Conclusion. Using anti-p41 as indicator of HIV infection the new immunoblot proved to be highly sensitive and highly specific. As in Western blot nonspecific reactions to p24 will be seen in up to 4 %. 151 [Page 152](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/150) 1157 DEVELOPMENT OF A FAST AND RELIABLE METHOD FOR THE EVALUATION OF RECOMBINANT-MADE HIV ANTIGENS IN AIDS SEROLOGY. E Saman*, L H Heuverswyn*, G Beelaert**, P Plot**, G van der Groen** - * Innogenetics N.V., ** Institute for Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium. Objective: The application of recombinant DNA techniques has allowed us to prepare pure structural as well as nonstructural HIV antigens in E.coli. A recently described technique (Wilhelm, J.H. et al., Experienta 1986,42,100) has been adopted to develop a standardized presentation of these antigens for HIV serology. Methods: Different antigen solutions are applied in parallel lines onto a sheet of protein binding membrane.After drying and blocking steps,the sheets are cut into strips perpendicular to the direction of application. Detection of antibodies to HIV antigens is performed by revelation of the bound antibodies with an enzyme-conjugated second antibody. Upon development, the positive signals appear as lines on the membrane (line immuno assay, LIA). Results:This technique allowed us to evaluate the performance of a panel of 13 recombinant-made and purified antigens on one strip with a panel of 25 sera. Incubation of these antigens with several hundred bloodbank sera allowed us to identify the preparations with lowest aspecific reactions. Application of antigen solution in varying concentrations enabled us to optimize the antigen concentration. Using this technique,we also showed that in a panel of 60 well characterized anti HIV sera, no reaction with SOR antigen was detected whereas 4 sera showed reaction with tat antigen. Conclusion:The LIA technique allows the reproducible production of antigen containing strips in a standardized way. An evaluation of these strips in comparison with the poorly standardized Western Blots is in progress. 1158 NEUTRALIZATION OF ELISA ANTI-HIV ANTIBODY REACTIVITY WITH RECOMBINANT HIV ANTIGENS N. Rolon, T. Hill, J. Geltosky, J. Britz Ortho Diagnostic Systems Inc., Raritan, New Jersey The HIV ELISA is a means of detecting antibody to HIV so that contaminated units of blood and plasma can be excluded from use. However, the majority of sera repeatably reactive by ELISA (0.1 - 0.5%) will be false. Currently, the Western blot (WB), a costly, labor-intensive and subjective test, is employed to distinguish ELISA reactive specimens. In an alternative method, a mixture of HIV recombinant antigens from the core, polymerase and envelope regions is used to neutralize HIV-specific ELISA reactivity. This results in a decreased absorbance value (AV) as compared to a nonneutralized sample control. A false reactive ELISA sample will not react with the recombinant antigens and will not exhibit a decreased ELISA AV. The Neutralization and WB tests have shown a 100% correlation in identifying true positive samples (n=500). In addition, the Neutralization assay has been effective in resolving indeterminate WB results. The Neutralization assay is also a generic procedure compatible with all manufacturers' HIV lysate based screening ELISAs tested. In conclusion, the Neutralization assay provides a versatile, low cost and objective means of discriminating true from false positive reactivity in HIV ELISA screening. Notes: 1159 A SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC ELISA UTILIZING HIV RECOMBINANT GAG, POL, AND ENV DERIVED POLYPEPTIDES J. Huff*, N. Rolon*, *Ortho Diagnostic Systems Inc., Raritan, New Jersey, **Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, California A test has been developed which addresses the need for a highly sensitive, yet highly specific, assay for the detection of HIV antibody in blood and plasma. The Ortho Diagnostic Systems HIV Recombinant Antigen Screening ELISA utilizes four molecularly cloned, expressed polypeptides derived from regions of the gag, pol, and env genes encoding for the p24, p31, gp41, and gpl20 viral proteins. The polypeptides capture only HIV specific antibody which is detected in a typical microtiter ELISA format. Specimens falsely reactive to contaminating antigens from cell lines found in the current viral lysate based tests are not detected. The 2 1/2 hour procedure has demonstrated 99.9% specificity and 100% sensitivity when tested with AIDS, ARC, High Risk Groups, and random donor samples. Moreover, the assay has detected specimens which are non-reactive by several currently licensed antibody screening tests, indeterminate by Western blot (p24 only), and reactive by radioimmunoprecipitation assay. 1160 ANALYSIS OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISOLATED RECOMBINANT CORE P24, ENDONUCLEASE TRANSMEMBRANE D Berns,* and A Polito,** *Wadsworth Center NY State Department of Health, Albany, and **Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, CA, USA. Objective. To characterize gene-product specific antibodies in HIV infection. Methods. Optimum amounts of 4 recombinant antigens and a human IgG reference were separately fixed on nitrocellulose strips. Strips were immersed in specimens for 2 hr, washed, immersed in HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG for 30 min, washed and developed with 4-chloro-1 napthol. Bands with stain intensity = to or > the IgG reference are reactive. Specimens were from blood donors, patients with ARC, AIDS or autoimmune disorders, asymptomatic people with ELISA reactive and Western Blot (WB) reactive or nonreactive findings, and from people with undefined HIV infections signaled by seroconversion. Results. Overall agreement with WB negative specimens was 99.2%; with WB positive, 100%. Frequency ratios of gp41:p24 antibodies in asymptomatic, ARC and AIDS patients were 1.19, 1.39 and 2.82 respectively. At validated seroconversion 100% of recombinant vs 83% of WB or ELISA results were positive. The percent of these specimens with antibody to p24 antigen was 88, to p31 it was 94, to gp41, 100 and to gpl20, 38. Conclusions. Sensitivity and specificity of the recombinant assay is = to or > WB. These results and the clarity and uniformity of bands recommend the assay for serodiagnosis and staging of infection. 152 [Page 153](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/151) 1161 IMMUNOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF HIV-1 GAG AND ENV DETERMINANTS PRODUCED IN E. COLI. Michael F. Nunn, M. Kubitz and M. Nasoff Pharmacia Genetic Engineering, Inc., La Jolla, CA Objective. To express antigenic determinants of HIV with high immunoreactivity and low nonspecific crossreactivity for use in identifying infected individuals. Methods. The gag and env regions of HIV-1 were cloned into an E. coli expression plasmid to generate the p24 protein and the gpl20/gp41 boundary region. Gag/env fusion proteins were also generated. Results. P24 was expressed at the level of 10-20% of cellular protein as a soluble molecule. A derivative of the p24 gene containing a gp41 peptide sequence was also expressed at high levels. The immunoreactivity of these purified reagents with a variety of AIDS patient sera has been compared. Conclusion. The bacterial expression system has proven very useful for expressing high levels of soluble HIV core protein. Derivatives of this protein should prove extremely useful for developing simplified and highly specific HIV diagnostics. 1162 EPITOPE MAPPING OF Labs, Oss, x* Central Veterinary Institute, Lelystad, The Netherlands Objective. To identify immunodominant epitopes of HIVproteins, and to apply synthetic peptides derived from these domains in diagnostic tests and/or in vaccines. Methods. All possible overlapping nonapeptides covering a region of HIV-gag (aa 80-332), were synthesized on solid supports. The peptides still attached to this support, were tested by a two-step binding ELISA (PEPSCAN), using a variety of human-and sheep anti-HIV sera, as well as a series of monoclonal anti-p24 antibodies (McAb's). Results. Using the McAb's, various distinct epitopes were detected. At least four linear McAb-epitopes are present in the region tested. Two McAb's did not show any reactivity, which indicates the presence of at least one other epitope. The sheep hyperimmune sera, elicited against viral lysate, exhibited reactivity with several linear epitopes. Different patterns of reactivity were observed with serum obtained 4 weeks after the first immunization, as compared to serum obtained after repeated booster injections. The interactions with the human anti-HIV sera were generally not very strong. However, one domain of immunoreactivity could be observed, which agrees well with already published data. In addition, one other human epitope was identified. Conclusions. The PEPSCAN-method proves to be a powerful tool for the identification of HIV antibody-epitopes. In the region of gag tested, at least two human epitopes, and more than five animal epitopes are present. Notes: 1163 APPLICATION OF THE HAL ALGORITHM TO PEPTIDES OF THE HIV ENVELOPE PROTEINS John N. Weinstein, Bobak M. Mozayeni, Kai-Li Ting, and H. Robert Guy National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, U.S.A. Objective. To assess structural properties and structurefunction relationships in the HIV envelope proteins. Methods. The HAL algorithm analyzes the potential of peptide sequences for amphipathic alpha-helix formation at a hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface. A hydrophobicity scale is selected from among the many possible choices. A partition function is then developed for each peptide in the protein, and the probabilities of orientational microstates are represented numerically or in color graphical format. We have validated the HAL algorithm by prediction of sequences known to form amphipathic structures, by statistical correlation with the location of known helical segments from crystallized proteins, and by the physical chemical characterization of a synthetic HIV peptide. When applying HAL to libraries of experimentally defined T-cell antigens, we could not find strong correlations with amphipathic helix potential. HAL is here applied to four HIV-1 isolates, using a number of different hydrophobicity scales and sequence window lengths. Results and Conclusions. The HAL algorithm identifies potentially amphipathic helical sequences in gpl20 and gp41. The. most prominent are centered on residues 14 (in the leader sequence), 109 (in a conserved region), 425 (in a conserved region), and 836. Others are centered near 345, 550, and 798 (numbered in terms of the BH10 isolate). 1164 SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE MAPPING OF THE NEUTRALIZING EPITOPES HIV, Javaherian*, Karen Hardock*, P. Bolognesi+, C. Herlihy*, and Scott D. Putney*; *Repligen Corporation, One Kendall Square, Building 700, Cambridge, MA 02139, +Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical School, Durham, NC 27710, USA HIV is recognized as the cause of AIDS. The gpl20 envelope protein of this virus has been shown to include major neutralizing epitopes of the virus. We have demonstrated that a 180 amino acid recombinant fragment of the envelope protein called PB1 can block envelope directed sera in virus neutralization assays. In order to define the neutralizing epitope within PB1 derived from the IIIB strain, we have produced a number of recombinant and synthetic peptides which localized the principal neutralization epitope within amino acid residues 308-331 of the envelope protein. We have shown with synthetic peptides that the neutralizing epitope of other divergent variants is located in this same region. We have also synthesized IIIB/RF hybrid peptides which have enabled us to precisely define the role of individual amino acids in the variant specificity of neutralizing antibodies. The goal of our ongoing effort is to define recombinant proteins, peptides or group of peptides capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies. 153 [Page 154](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/152) ,I ff le 1165 PRESENCE OF ANTIBODIES REACTIVE WITH A REGION OF HIV GP41 SIMILAR TO IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE SEQUENCES OF OTHER RETROVIRUSES CORRELATES STRONGLY WITH HEALTH IN HIV POSITIVE PERSONS: Jonas Blomberg*, Per Johan Klasse* and RUdiger Pipkorn+ *Section of Virology, Dpt of Medical Microbiology, University of Lund, Sblveqatan 23, S-223 62 Lund, Sweden +Zentrum fUr Molekulare Feld, Heidelberg. Objective: A region HIV gp41 which is similar to an immunosuppressive sequnce found in many retroviral transmembrane proteins may contribute to HIV-induced disease. We have looked for antibodies reactive with it which then could be anti-immunosuppressive and defend against HIV-induced immunosuppression. Material: A series of synthetic peptides covering the putatively immunosuppressive region (pHIVIS) of qp41 were used in enzyme immunoassays with sera from HIV-positive healthy and 33 with HIV-related disease-PGL,ARC,AIDS). Results: 1166 HIV-1 ENVELOPE DOMAINS IMPORTANT IN BINDING, ANTIBODY NEUTRALIZATION, AND ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT CELLULAR CYTOTOXICITY (ADCC). David D. Ho*+, J. Giorgi+. *Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and +UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA; **Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; ++E.I. du Pont de Nemours, Wilmington, DE, USA. Objective: To map the functional domains in HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. Methods: Overlapping oligopeptides spanning HIV-1 gp120 and gp41 were chemically synthesized and used to raise sitespecific antibodies in animals. Antisera were then tested in vitro for inhibition of HIV-1 binding to CD4+ cells neutralization of HIV-l, and ADCC activity on HIV-1 infected or coated cells. Results: Two domains (325-384 and 458-484) in gpl20 elicited antibodies which partially blocked virus binding. These findings are consistent with results from mutagenesis studies by Kowalski et al. However, peptides from the putative binding domain (425-450), as defined by Lasky et al, did not elicit binding-inhibitory antibodies. This suggests that, perhaps, antibodies do not have direct access to the binding domain. Antibodies directed against two domains (254-280 and 298-333) in gpl20 and gp41 neutralized HIV-l infectivity. Neutralization of three diverse HIV-1 isolates for antisera versus conserved regions (254-280, 518-532, 609-632, 725-752), whereas restricted neutralization was noted for antisera versus one variable region (298-333). Of all the domains important in HIV-1 neutralization, only one (298-333) is also involved in CD4 binding. Low-level ADCC activity was observed with antisera specific for multiple domains in gpl20, particularly in the carboxyl half of the molecule. Higher ADCC activity was demonstrated using antisera directed against several domains in gp41 (550-565 609-632, 725-752). Conclusion: Our results, taken together with published findings, allow the construction of a functional map of HIV-l envelope glycoproteins, which may be useful in the design of better therapeutic and preventive strategies to combat HIV-1. Healthy Diseased anti-HIVIS + 27 1 anti-HIVIS - 8 32 Other gp41 (total protein and other synthetic peptide) antibody titers and activities did not differ significantly between the healthy and the diseased. Conclusion: The presence of antibodies reactive with pHIVIS was strongly correlated with state of health. They may have a partially protective effect, may be prognostically useful markers and be useful for therapy or prophylaxis. 1167 Laboratory, Stockholm, and **Ferring AB, Malmi, Sweden. Objective. To study peptides from the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) for IgG of HIV-infected persons. Methods. Several 9-25 aminoacid (aa) peptides representing the known p121 (567-648) region were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 430 A Peptide Synthesizer. They were used as solid phase reagents with human sera in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Results Peptides N-terminal Sensitivity Specificity aa n % n % A 580 60 76,7 20 100 B 589 98 99,0 40 100 C 601 237 100 1054 99,3 D 605 79 93,7 20 100 E 606 295 94,6 140 90,7 F 638 143 12,6 40 97,5 The sensitivity varied over the p121 region, with a maximum of 100% at peptide C. Neighbouring peptides had a lower reactivity. Combinations of several peptides increased the selectivity ratio, as defined by positive related to negative mean ELISA absorbance values. Even sera with a poor reactivity to gp41 bands in Western displayed clear-cut ELISA reactivities in peptide ELISAs. Conlusion. Seroreactive sites were identified in HIV-1 related regions of gp41. Only a narrow region gave a 100% sensitivity with HIV-1 seropositive Europeans. This region may display the strongest immunogenic configuration and/or be the best conserved. 1168 SPECIFIC DETECTION OF ANTI-HIV2 ANTIBODIES BY ELISA USING A SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE J Martin*, AM Chevrinais*, C Richardson** M Garcia-Gonzalez*, P K Tsai**, and P Poulettv* * Clonatec, Paris, France ** Syntro, San Diego, CA, U.S.A. Objective. ELISA techniques which use whole HIV2 antigen and western blot do not allow an easy identification of patients infected with HIV2 because of cross reactions between HIVI and HIV2. To detect specifically anti-HIV2 antibodies, a 35 minutes ELISA (HIV2 ELISA) was optimized by using a single synthetic peptide derived from the transmembrane glycoprotein of HIV2. Methods. Microwell strips were coated with the peptide. Diluted specimens or controls were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. After washing, an anti-human immunoglobulin peroxidase conjugate was incubated for another 15 minutes. After washing color development was allowed for 5 minutes using OPD. Results. Of 34 anti-HIV2 sera and 5 anti-HIV 2 plasmas (positive by western blot), 38 were positive by HIV2 ELISA (sensitivity: 97.4%). Of 85 sera positive for anti-HIVl antibodies by western blot, 82 were negative by HIV2 ELISA. Western blot analysis was unconclusive between a HIV1/ HIV2 double infection and a crossreactivity of the anti-HIV1 antibodies with the HIV2 peptide for the 3 sera positive by HIV2 ELISA. 5 plasmas positive by commercially available HIV1 ELISA and negative by western blot (false positive) were negative by HIV2 ELISA. 87 normal sera and 6 sera containing rheumatoid factors (n = 3) or antinuclear antibodies (n = 3) were negative by HIV2 ELISA. Conclusion. The use of a synthetic peptide derived from HIV2 sequences non-homologous with HIVI can allow a rapid and easy recognition of true HIV2 positive specimens. Immunbiologie, Stefan-Meyer-Str.8 Freiburg, Western Germany Developement of a HIV-1 and HIV-2 specific ELISA Immunogenic epitopes of HIV proteins can be predicted by our Program HYCON '86 (W.Tr6ger, unp. results 1987) using nine different parameters. The most promising FAZIT value (a sum of the predicted parameters) is a literature known epitope in the gp41 region of the envelope protein of HIV-1 (Gnann et al. Science,237,1346,38(1987). A corresponding region is found in the HIV-2 protein. The peptides were synthesized using Fmoc(tBu) strategy and oxidized for cyclization. To optimize the ELISA assay system we coupled tripalmitoyl-(S)-glyceryl-cystein to the N-terminus of the peptides. In the HIV-1 peptide ELISA 122 sera out of 126 sera reacted positively, in the HIV-2 peptide ELISA 5 out of 5 sera. None of the 141 uninfected controls were positive for antibody to HIV-1 or HIV-2 in the assays. The result shows the application of lipopeptide conjugates for diagnostics and tertiary structure elucidation. 1170 CONTINUOUS EPITOPES OF THE HIV-1 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN B. Svennerholm*, S. Jeansson*, L. Vahlne\" *Clinical Virology and \"*Medical Biochemistry, University of G6teborg, Sweden Objective. To identify continuous epitopes of the HIV-1 transmembrane protein recognized by infected humans. Methods. Overlapping peptides, 20 to 30 amino acids long, spanning the complete HIV-1 gp41 amino acid sequence were synthesized and coated onto 96 wells microtiter plates. Immunoreactivity of the peptides was tested by conventional indirect EIA using 50 Western blot confirmed HIV-1 positive human sera as well as a panel of negative control sera. Results. Three immunoreactive domains (seven different peptides) containing HIV specific continuous epitopes were identified. One peptide having the sequence DQQLLGIWGCSGKLICTTAVPWN was reactive to all the positive sera without giving any false positive signals. Some peptides repeatedly gave a positive reaction also to some of the negative control sera. Conclusion. It is possible to identify HIV specified continuous epitopes giving a humoral immune response in humans. The HIV-1 transmembrane protein contains amino acid sequences recognized by antibodies also from noninfected individuals.

Vahlne* 'Clinical Virology and \"'Medical Biochemistry, University of G6teborg, Sweden Objective. To identify continuous epitopes as defined by the amino acid backbone of the proteins coded for by the HIV-1 gag gene that would be recognized by antibodies of infected humans. Methods. Fifteen to 25 amino acids (aa) long overlapping peptides corresponding to the entire aa sequence of the HIV gag proteins (p17, p24, p6, and p9) were synthesized and coated onto 96 wells microtiter plates. Immunoreactivity of the peptides was tested by conventional indirect Elisa using Western blot confirmed HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody positive and negative human sera. Results. Four p24 peptides corresponding to two regions of the p24 protein and two non overlapping p17 peptides were identified that reacted with HIV-1 positive sera. One p24 peptide located close to the amino terminus of the protein showed some cross reactivity with HIV-2 positive sera. None of the six immunoreactive peptides were recognized by all HIV-1 positive sera. Many peptides showed strong reactivity to some of the HIV negative sera. All peptides tended to increase background OD values. Conclusion. The p24 and p17 HIV-1 proteins contain continuous epitopes that can be detected with synthetic peptides. Some regions of the amino acid backbone of both p24 and p17 are recognized also by antibodies in seronegative blood. 1172 FINE MAPPING OF AN EPITOPE IN THE TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN OF HIV. P.J.Klasse ~, J.Blomberg ~, R.Pipkorn P ~ Virological Laboratory, University of Lund SZentrum fur Molekylare Biologie, Heidelberg Objective. Detailed mapping of epitopes in a region gp 41 from which an in vitro-immunosuppressive peptide has been derived by others; a study of distinct antibody specificities to the N- and Cterminal parts of a 25 amino acid stretch in this region. Methods. Peptides were synthesized by the Merrifield method. The region around the reportedly immunosuppressive heptadeca-peptide was studied by sequence displacements, elongation, inversion and substitutions. N- and C-terminally bound peptides were used for affinity purification of antibodies from HTVpositive sera. Pectides and complete viral proteins were allowed to compete with a radiolabelled peptide (derived from the center of the region under study) for binding to antibodies in solid phase. Results. Substitutions in the C-terminal end of the reportedly immunosuppressive peptide abrogated its serological reactivity. By affinity purification, reactivities with peptides of inverted or displaced sequences were diminished down to 2%. A C-terminally displaced peptide competed most efficiently with the immMunsuopressive peptide for binding to human antiHIV-antibodies. Conclusion. Two distinct epitopes can be delineated in a conserved and possibly immunosuppressive of 1173 R Houghten, C Parks R Lerner D~ept. Virology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Dept. Mol. BiolosX4 Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, Johnson & Johnson Biotechnology Center, La Jolla Objective. To determine the optimal composition of peptides for site-directed serology with hIV types 1 and 2. Methods. Selected peptides, RVERYLKDQQLLGIWGCSGKLIC for HIV-1 and RIEKYLEDQLNRWGLRFRQVC for HIV-2, representing amino acids in the tranamembranous protein or substituted with glycine were used as antigen in ELISR with rabbit hyperimmune sara and murine monoclonal antibodies against the parental peptide and human postinfection sara for immunochemical dissection. Results. Monoclonal antibodies identified 6 discontinuous epitopes encompassing 4-6 amino acids along the 213 amino acid peptide. Surprisingly human sara both in the case of HIV-1 and HIV-2 only see a single apitope in the peptides. This finding has major implications for the design of peptides to be used in sitedirected serology and also for our understanding of the central problem in biology concerning protein folding. Conclusion. Immunochemical dissection allows identification of the role of individual amino acids for the antigenicity of selected peptides. Possibilities for designing a homogenous assay, eventually to be used for type-specific HIV antibody screening, are at hand. 1174 DETERMINATION OF REACTIVITY OF HIV-1 Walker Bio-Rad Laboratories, Clinical Division, 1000 Alfred Nobel Drive, Hercules, CA 94547, USA Objective. To screen HIV-1 synthetic peptides for reactivity with AIDS/ARC Patients' sera. Methods. Two hundred thirty three peptides (15 a.a. long with 5 a.a. overlap) covering most of the HIV-1 genome were synthesized on polyethylene pegs using the method of Geysen, et al (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA) 81.3998 (1984)). Individual pegs were arranged according to a 96-well microtiter plate format. Immunoreactivi ty of these synthetic peptides writh AIDS/ARC patients' sera was determined by ELISA. Results. The reactive peptides corresponding to all structural gene proteins (tat, sor, trs, 3'-orf and u-orf) were identified using a panel of HIV-1 positive sera. Conclusions. These synthetic peptides can be used for the detection of antibodies to HIV-1 proteins.

L~ ~3TOPOGRAPHY OF HIV-1 Anders Vahlne' Clinical University Department, County Microbiological Laboratory, Sweden GP4l B Svennerholm', of Gbteborg, Central Objective. To identify continuous epitopes of HIV-l gp4l, previously mapped by means of synthetic peptides, that are located at the surface of the native protein. Methods. Seven different synthetic peptides from three immunoreactive domains of gp4l, as determined by reactivity to HIV-l seropositive patients, were coupled to different carrier proteins and used for immunizations of rabbits. Peptide hyper immune sera were tested for reactivity to respective peptide and to the transmembrane protein by indirect immunofluorescence to HIV infected cells, by Elisa using purified virus as antigen, and by western blot. Sera from scropositive patients were adsorbed with HIV-l producing T4 antigen positive tumor cells and tested for remaining antibody activity to the synthetic peptides. Results. All peptide hyper immune sera were reactive to respective peptide. So far only sera from rabbits immunized with two peptides from the carboxyl terminus of the protein seem to recognize the native gp4l. Patients sera have so far been shown to maintain their antibody reactivity to a conserved domain of the protein containg the most immunoreactive continuous epitopes of gp4l. Conclusion. So far only epitopes located to the carboxyl terminus of the protein have been found on the native protein. A reson for the conservation of the middel portion of gp4l dispite strong continuous epitopes might be that they are not expressed on the protein surface. 156 [Page 157](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/155) 1177 DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL DIAGNOSTIC ASSAY FOR HIV INFECTION AND CLINICAL PROGRESSION USING THE SYNTHETIC P17 ANALOGUE PEPTIDE (HGP-30) AND OTHER Objective: measure: 1) antibodies to specific immunodominant epitopes on p17 and 2) circulating p17 antigen in HIV infected individuals. Method: p17 protein is measured using a competitive ELISA based on rabbit antibodies to the synthetic p17 peptide analogue, HGP-30. Antibodies to native p17 and the synthetic p17 epitope, HGP-30, are measured using an ELISA with HGP-30 and other p17 synthetic epitopes as the peptides on the plate. Results: In both animals and humans exposed to HIV proteins and/or pure native p17, antibodies to the specific epitope on p17 represented by HGP-30 were detected. Studies are in progress to correlate clinical outcome with antibody status. Using a competitive ELISA with a sensitivity of 30ng/ml of the peptide analogue, HGP-30, concentrations of p17 in the viral extracts were measured as 10 ng/ml of protein. Studies are in progress to evaluate p17 antigen in infected cell culture supernatants and sera from HIV positive individuals. Conclusion: HGP-30 represents an immunodominant epitope on p17 and may be a useful reagent for development of a diagnostic assay to measure antibodies to specific epitopes on p17 and circulating p17 antigen. This assay may be useful in more accurately monitoring the progression of AIDS following infection. 1178 SYNTHETIC-PEPTIDE IMMUNOASSAY DETECTS TYPE-COMMON ANTIBODIES Mach$, Milan Petz# *Leciva-Pharmaceuticals, 143 10 Prague 4, $Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, 166 37 Prague 6, #Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, 128 00 Prague 2, Czechoslovakia The appearence on the epidemiological/clinical scene of two types of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the aetiologic agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), complicates the detection of seropositive individuals, a serious large-scale problem especially in West Africa. Site-directed serology using synthetic peptides as antigens has been shown to be capable of discriminating between type-specific antibodies to HIV and to the HIV-related West African retroviruses. However, it is also possible to construct a synthetic-peptide immunoassay that recognizes type-common antibodies. We synthesized peptides containing a highly conserved region of the gag p24 proteins of both HIV-1 and HIV-2. These peptides were recognized in an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by antibodies against HIV-1 as well as against HIV-2. Thus, site-directed serology using synthetic peptides provides a means o compiling a sensitive, simple, and inexpensive immunoassay for type-common antibodies against both HIV-1 and HIV-2.

Elliot Parks\" *Johnson and Johnson Biotechnology Center, La Jolla, California, **Department of Virology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden Objective. To demonstrate the use of synthetic peptide ELISA's to detect and distinguish between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection in sera from Africa. Methods. Synthetic peptides representing highly antigenic, immunodominant regions of human and simian immunodeficiency virus transmembrane glycoprotein have been formulated into ELISA assays for the detection of antibodies to these retroviruses. Results. The sensitivity of the HIV-1 synthetic peptide assay compares favorably with commerically available viral lysate assays. In addition, the relatively high false positive rate observed in normal sera from Africa with conventional viral lysate ELISAs has not been demonstrated in the HIV-1 synthetic peptide assay. The HIV-2 synthetic peptide ELISA has demonstrated greater than 98% sensitivity in sera which are confirmed positive for HIV-2 antibodies by Western Blot. Conclusion. These two synthetic peptide ELISAs can be used to accurately detect and distinguish sera from patients that have been infected with HIV-1 or HIV-2. Further results on the use of these assays to resolve HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections will be presented. 1180 TYPE SPECIFIC DETECTION OF HIV-2 ANTIBODIES USING A SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE CORRESPONDING TO A 24 AMINO ACID SEGMENT OF THE HIV-2 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN P Horal*, S Jeansson*, Biochemistry, G6teborg, Sweden \"**Department of Immunology, National Bacteriological Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden.***National Laboratory of Public Health, Bissau, Guinea Bissau Objective. To determine if a synthetic HIV-2 peptide from a region of the transmembrane protein could be used.as antigen for type specific detection of HIV-2 antibodies in clinical specimens. Methods. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the 24 amino acid (aa) sequence DQARLNSWGCAFRQVCHTTVPWVN of the HIV2 transmembrane glycoprotein was coated onto microtiter plates. Indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) was performed with a serum panel consisting of 333 West African HIV-2 western blot (WB) confirmed positive and negative sera including sera from patients attending an outward clinic in Bissau, Guinea Bissau for examination of suspected tuberculosis. In addition twenty two WB confirmed HIV-1 positive sera were assayed. Results. Eighty one out of 82 WB HIV-2 positive sera were clearly positive using the HIV-2 peptide assay. One serum considered positive by WB was in the HIV-2 peptide assay. All HIV1 positive sera peptide assay. Conclusion. An assay based on the HIV-2 synthetic peptide might provide a highly type specific and sensitive tool for diagnosing HIV-2 infection. 157 [Page 158](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/156) 1181 MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES DERIVED FROM SEQUENCE OF GAG, POL AND ENV GENES OF HIV-1 + + and Blood Transfusion, Spofa,Prague,++Institute of Molecular Genetics (SAV, Prague, Czechoslovakia Objective.The possibility to prepare monoclonal antibodies specifically recognizing HIV encoded proteins was investigated by immunizing mice with synthetic peptides derived from sequence of gag, pol and env genes of HIV-1.

Lymphocytes of immunized mice were fused with mouse myeloma cell lines Sp-2/0, PO0 or FO and resulting lymphocytic hybridom s were examined for the production of antipeptide antibodies by ELISA method. Results.Several selected mouse lymphocytic hybridomas produced monoclonal antibodies of IgGl class which were reactive with HIV-1 as demonstrated in ELISA test.

Notes: 1183 DEVELOPMENT OF AN HIV TYPE SPECIFIC ASSAY James E. Drummond*, D Waters*, L Devash**, W Blattner*** *Program Resources, Inc., National Cancer InstituteFrederick Cancer Research Facility, Frederick, MD, USA, **Repligen Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA, ***National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA OBJECTIVE. In order to track intra- and inter-population transmission of specific HIV strains a type-specific rather than group specific assay is necessary. METHODS. Five synthetic peptides corresponding to a hypervariable region of the HIV gp-120 molecule between amino acids 308-331, from 5 different HIV strains (IIIB, RF, WMJ-2, MN, SC) were examined in an ELISA format for viral type-specific properties. Serial sera from a human and 2 chimpanzees infected with HIV IIIB and 80 single samples from high-risk human subjects were assayed at a 1/20 concentration against the 5 peptides. RESULTS. Both chimpanzees and the HIV IIIB-infected human subject exhibited type specific reactivity which correlated with other HIV screening and confirmatory assays. From the high-risk group 34 sera were positive in 2 or more HIV screening and confirmatory assays. However, sera from 33 of these subjects exhibited reactivity against one or more of the synthetic peptides. Two possible explanations are (1) a broadening immune response caused by viral mutation over time within the host in contrast to that seen in the HIV IIIB-infected human and chimpanzees or (2) infection with multiple viral strains in this particular population. CONCLUSION. The data suggests that these peptides could be used in a typing assay which would yield important information about intra- and inter-population transmission of HIV and associated disease. 1184 A PEPTIDE-BASED MICROTITER ELISA KIT FOR THE DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES TO HIV Martial Lacroix, C. Penney, M. Stern, F. Bellini and G. Dionne. IAF BioChem International Inc., Montr6al. Objective - Description of the characteristics and performance of a kit for the detection of HIV-specific antibodies that uses a cocktail of synthetic peptides as antigen. Methods - This work involved the synthesis and testing of close to 120 peptides selected on the basis of predicted secondary structures and hydrophilicit. Results - A c ination of three peptides was found to give optimal sensitivity and specificity. The Table below summarizes the performance of the BioChem assay with three conmercially available ELISA-basea kits (A,B and C), Western Blot (WB) and IFA. % BioChem A B C WB IFA Sensitivity 100 2,6 No. tested 2223 1118 227 204 218 936 The very poor performance of A,B,C and WB with our panel of sera (1,378 seropositives and 845 seronegatives) indicates that these samples are unusually difficult. Some specimens were from patients with conditions (rheumatoid arthritis,lupus) often leading to false positive results. A few samples were found negative by W.B. and positive in both our assay and RIPA. Similarly, 24 samples that gave equivocal results by IFA were found as clean negative or positive in both our assay and by RIPA. Peptide-coated plates are very stable: there is no loss of activity when they are kept for 8 weeks at 37*C. Eleven randomly selected positive sera remained positive at dilutions ranging between 12,000 and 192,000. Conclusion - This data clearly establishes that selected synthetic peptides can form the basis of a very reliable AIDS test. 158 [Page 159](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/157) 1185 BASIC AND CLINICAL STUDIES ON A SYNTHETIC env gp41 PEPTIDE AS A DIAGNOSTIC REAGENT IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TYPE 1 INFECTION Marja-Liisa Huhtala*, A Ncrvanen*, S and A Vaheri** *Labsystems Research Laboratories, Labsystems,**Department of Virology, University of Helsinki,***Department of Microbiology, Aurora Hospital, Helsinki. Objective. To define the nature of the native HIV-1 epitopes. Methods. A sensitive and specific EIA for the detection of serum antibodies to HIV-1 was developed based on a synthetic peptide (env residues 599-613:SGKLICTTAVPWNAS). This test was compared to other HIV antibody assays, whole virus EIA, IB and RIPA, in a cohort of 180 individuals at various stages of HIV-1 infection, including 12 patients with serial serum samples and as control 5000 blood donors. Results. Peptide antibodies were detected in 100% of those with asymptomatic infection and only one patient with LASfailed to react. The peptide antibodies appeared early after infection and were detected with the peptide EIA in two prospectively studied patients at the time seroconversion was observed by IB and RIPA and preceded reactivity in whole virus EIA. Neither of these had antibodies to gp41 or gp120 in IB at the time they were positive in peptide EIA. Natural antipeptide antibodies isolated from HIV-1 positive sera reacted specifically in EIA with the peptide but not with whole virus EIA or with gp41 in IB or RIPA. Conclusions. This peptide region in gp41 remains undetectable, when conventional immunochemical methods are used and those HIV-1 antibody-positive sera that are reactive only for core proteins in IB may still contain antibodies to envelope proteins. 1186 Development of a novel retroviral vector with the host range of a human retrovirus. C Wilson, M. S. Reitz, H. Okayama, and M. Eiden. Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, NCI, and Laboratory of Cell Biology, NIH, Bethesda, Md. U.S.A The HTLV I (Human T cell Leukemia Virus, Type 1) envelope glycoprotein was shown to assemble with MoMLV (Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus) aga and pol gene products and form infectious particles. A series of plasmids encoding retroviral virion components were constructed MoMLV env-minus plasmid containing and Qol coding regions, (2) an env plasmid encoding the HTLV I envelope, and (3) a plasmid containing the MoMLV 5' and 3' LTR's and packaging site, and the gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic G418. Transformation of target cells to G418 resistance demonstrated that the hybrid virions, containing the MoMLV-neo recombinant RNA genome, exhibited host range characteristics consistent with the target cell specificity of HTLV I (at titers around 102 cfu/ml). Experiments with similar plasmids carrying either of two different GaLV (gibbon ape leukemia virus) env genes yielded infectious particles (at titers around 103 cfu/ml) having the host cell specificity of these viruses. This novel means of generating hybrid retroviral particles has several important aspects. (1) Our results indicate that gag-Dol and env hybrid virions can be formed between evolutionarily distant retroviruses. (2) This method may afford greater safety with retroviral vectors, since the components required for assembly are distributed on three different plasmids. (3) The hybrid virions have the host range of a human or other primate retrovirusand therefore may enable infection of human cell types that are not capable of being infected by murine retroviral vectors. (4) This system may enable the characterization of retrovirus-target cell receptor interactions using these hybrid virions instead of their pathogenic counterparts. Notes: 1187 THE FORMATION OF HIV PSEUDOTYPES RESULTS IN EXPANDED CELLULAR TROPISM AND PATHOGENICITY. Deborah H. Spector, Erik Wade, Dowain Wright, and Stephen A. Spector, Univ. of Calif., San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA Objective. Although HIV is the etiologic agent of AIDS, other viral cofactors may play a role in the development or progression of the disease. One potential mechanism is through the formation of pseudotypes which arise when enveloped viruses infect the same cell and acquire each other's envelope proteins. Since HIV glycoproteins mediate the binding to and fusion of the viral envelope with cells containing the CD4 protein on their surface, HIV pseudotypes could possess expanded cellular tropism and pathogenicity. Methods. To test this hypothesis, we studied HIV infection in CEM cells coinfected with an amphotropic retrovirus. Results. In these cells, there was marked acceleration of the cytopathic effect (CPE) which paralleled the synthesis of virus. Six days p.i. there was over 100 fold more HIV in the supernatant of the coinfected CEM cells than in the supernatant of CEM cells infected with HIV alone. In both infections, most the cells were killed, but a population of persistently-infected cells producing high titers of HIV and showing no obvious CPE grew out of the cultures. Consistent with the hypothesis that pseudotypes were being produced, only HIV from the supernatants of the coinfected CEM cells were able to infect and replicate to high titer in human fibroblasts which are CD4- and resistant to HIV infection. Conclusions. These results suggest that coinfection of a cell with HIV and other enveloped viruses in vivo could affect the cellular tropism and pathogenicity 6f the HIV progeny. 1188 EXPRESSION OF THE HIV-1 ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN GENE BY A RECOMBINANT HUMAN ADENOVIRUS Natarajan, V., Dewar, R. L., Vasudevachari, M. B., Salzman, N. P., Georgetown University, Washington, D. C. Objective: Our objective was to express the HIV-1 envelope gene using a human adenovirus as the expression vector. Methods: A recombinant adenovirus was constructed by inserting the HIV-1 envelope gene downstream from the early region 3 (E3) promoter of adenovirus type-5 (Ad5), replacing the coding sequences of E3. Results: The recombinant virus replicated as efficiently as the parent virus in all cell lines tested. Human cells infected with the recombinant virus synthesized the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins gpl60, gpl20 and gp41. A human T lymphoblast line (Molt-4) infected with the recombinant virus expressed immunoreactive HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein on the cell surface, leading to syncytia formation. The envelope gene was expressed using the E3 promoter at early times after infection, and at late times from the major late promoter. When cotton rats were infected with the recombinant virus, antibodies against the HIV-1 envelope proteins were detected. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that the HIV1 envelope glycoproteins can be expressed in an immunoreactive form by the recombinant adenovirus. This study enhances the usefulness of recombinant adenoviruses as expression vectors and potential vaccines. 159 [Page 160](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/158) 11 9 GROUP SPECIFIC EP TCL RESPONSE TOWARDS HIV REQUIRES IDENTIFICATION OF TWO EPITOPES ON THE EXTERNAL ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN.

To identify the hel per T-cell specific epitopes recognized by HIV infected or immunized animals. Methods. Helper T-cell response to native or recombinant HIV envelope proteins and to corresponding synthetic peptides was studied in HIV infected gibbon apes and in rhesus monkeys immunized with a recombinant vaccinia virus carrying the whole ENV gene. Results. A strong-group specific T-cell response was seen in the immunized rhesus monkeys and in HIV infected gibbon apes. Two sequences of gpl2O (aa 376 - 400 and 426 - 450) were recognized by helper T-cells. A broad group specific response, directed against all isolates tested, were seen only when these two peptides, located in relatively well conserved sequences of gpl2O were simultaneously recognized. Conclusions. Identification of all T- and B-cell epitopes involved in a protective anti-HIV response may be required for generation of a subunit HIV vaccine. 1190 NEUTRALIZATION R~ESISTANT VARIANTS J Kelliher***, and P Fischinger*+ *Office of the Director, National Cancer Institute, and **Program Resources, Inc., NCI-Frederick Cancer Research Facility, Frederick, MD, USA, ***Primate Research Institute, Alamogordo, NM, USA, +DHHS Public Health Services, Washington, D.C., USA OBJECTIVE. To compare neutralization phenotypes of early and late virus isolates from HTLV-IIIB-inoculated chimpanzees. METHODS._ Virus isolations from titration and gpl2O vaccine studies were amplified by co-cultivation with PEAstimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and evaluated at 6 and 16 weeks following inoculation into chimpanzees. Reisolated viruses in both H-PBMCs and 11-9 cells were tested for susceptibility to neutralization with 11111 type-specific neutralizing antisera, as well as homologous sera samples from infected chimpanzees. RESUJLTS. All virus isolates tested were found to be 8-to16-fold more resistant to neutralization when compared to the parent 11111 virus. Also, no relationship existed between the degree of neutralization resistant variants and the immunization status of the animal. CONCLUSION. Neutralization resistant variants are generated rapidly in vivo in chimpanzees following inoculation with HTLV-IIIB regardless of prior immunization with gp 120. The generation of neutralization resistant variants in situ may account for the initial type-specific, followed by a more groupspecific, neutralizing antibody response. Notes: 1191 SELECTIVE CONSTRAINTS ON THE EVOLUTION OF gag A env PROTEINS IN HIV-1, Eelv AND Nulv. Andrew Leigh Rrown* and Paula Nonaghan** *University of Edinburgh, **NRC CAPCU, Edinburgh, U.K. Objective: To estimate selective constraints on HIV protein sequences. Nethod: The ratio of the frequency of synonymous nucleotide substitutions (K ) to amino acid replacement substitutions (K ) was estimated after Li et al. (Nol. Ridl. Evol.: 2; 1'50, 19R5). This ratio is unaffected by absolute mutation rate and can be used to compare proteins from different organisms. Results: gpl2O from HIV has the lowest K /K ratio (1.5) of any protein yet studied. gp415aohs a lower K /K (2 1) than relaxin C-peptide, the fastest evlvn 5poqein known from eukaryotes (2.4). Nuch of the evolu t ion of these p ro te ins could therefore be selectively neutral. However, the major core protein gagp24 is relatively strongly conserved in HIV (K /K -12.2) and gpTO, the major envelope glycoS.A protein in and Felv is also relatively conserved (K /K -.O and 4.6). S A Conclusion: Envelope proteins of HIV may not be as good a target for vaccine development as gp7O has been in Felv.

New York Blood Center, New York, **The California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, and ***The National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland Objective. Develop synthetic immunogens eliciting immunity against HIV. Methods. Peptides from the HIV envelope (env) protein (GP120, GP41) were synthesized and used to immunize rabbits. Ab to the peptides used for immunization and to native HIV were tested by double Ab RIA. Ab reacting with denatured HIV proteins were assayed by Western blots. The VN activity of the antisera was determined by ELISA or by tests for reverse transcriptase. VN Ab were detected using indicator cell lines containing the HIV-1 LTR ligated to Results. Antisera against twelve peptides from the HIV env protein were assayed for VN activity. Two peptides from the GP120 region and one peptide from the GP41 region elicited VN Ab. The levels of Ab recognizing synthetic peptides were much higher than the levels of Ab recognizing the HIV env protein. Conclusions. Some synthetic peptides from the HIV env protein elicit VN AB. Peptides mimicking more closely the native HIV protein will have to be designed before the application of synthetic peptides for vaccination against HIV could be considered. 1194 CHARACTERIZATION OF CONSERVED IMMUNODOMINANT EPITOPES ON **Orpegen, Heidelberg, FRG Objective. To characterize functional domains on the HIV-1 envelope and potential targets for neutralizing antibodies, immunodominant epitopes were mapped on gp120 and gp41 with peptide specific antisera. Methods. We have synthesized 18 peptides, consisting of 8-12 amino acid residues, with sequence homology to predicted epitopes. These peptides were conserved among 4 distinct HIV-1 isolates. In addition, these sequences were selected for hydrophilicity or for high probability to constitute to helical structures or reverse turns. Individual peptides were coupled to KLH and used to immunize rabbits. Rabbit sera were titrated by ELISA with peptide, virus, or gp120 as antigens. ELISA results were confirmed by Western blotting and radioimmunoprecipitation. Results. 4 out of 9 peptides induced antibodies to gpl20 and 3 out of 9 to gp41. Two sera against a single peptide of gpl20 neutralized HIV in the MT-4 cell assay up to a dilution of 1:32. All antisera will be investigated further for ADCC or CDCC activity. Conclusions. The method reveals functional epitopes on HIV1 gpl20. Some of our immunoreactive peptides should be considered as candidate antigens for synthetic peptide vaccines. Notes: 1195 HIV sr VACCNE EPMT PEPTIDES Corporation, Cambridge, MA, 2Duke University, IDrham, NC, 3National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, 4Kumamoto University, Japan. Recambinant HIV vaccine candidates have been produced from 5 different HIV-1 isolates in E. coli and from two isolates in insect cells. Immune sera to these proteins show type-specific neutralization in that homologous but not two heterologous isolates are neutralized in cell free and cell associated HIV neutralization assays. We are studying a mixture of envelope proteins from several isolates to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. Chinpanzees have been immunized with one of the E. coli derived proteins, PB1. Neutralizing antibodies and a helper T-cell response is elicited. Challenge experiments are planned using a molecularly cloned virus isolate. Using fragments of the envelope, a 24 amino acid peptide (RP135) was identified that 1) completely blocks fusion inhibition by antibodies elicited by gpl60 or HIV infection of chimpanzees and 2) elicits high titer neutralizing antibodies. A monoclonal to this region neutralizes free virus and blocks fusion of infected cells. RP135 is from a highly variable region and antibodies that bind RP135 do not block binding of gpl20 to CD4. This region, therefore, does not appear to play a role in this interaction. Although RP135 is the principal HIV neutralizing epitope, it may not be the only such epitope and we are studying if other, more conserved epitopes, are able to bind or elicit neutralizing antibodies. 1196 RABBIT IMMUNIZATION BY SYNTHETIC S.M.Andreev, L.Yu.Sklyarov, R.M.Khaitov Institute Public Health, MoscoIwA, USSR Obiective. The immunogenicity of 19 amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to 579-598 sequence of HI\\ opaLl was studied. Nearly 90% of AIDS patients or virus carriers manifested antibodies to this synthesized sequence accordinn to immunoenzyme testing. Methods. For the first immunization the peptide was sorbed on the nitrocellulose powder and was injected in complete Freund's adjuvant in a dose of Inn microorams per rabbit. The same peptide conjuoated to the qelatine was twice injected with 8 and 4 week intervals in a dose of 5n0 micrograms per rabbit. Results. Rabbit sera reacted in a solid phase ELISA with the peptide synthesized in the titers of 10-20x103. The same sera reacted in the titers of 3-5x1ln with Orqanon and Du Pont virus diagnostic <its. Conclusion. The data obtained testify the synthetic peptide synthesized to be adequate for studying the antigenic determinant of a natural virus protein.

Results. Antipeptide sera showed the presence of antibodies recognizing the native viral antigens in all above mentioned tests, including direct visualization of p24 band in WB identical to the band obtained with the mouse monoclonal antibody to p24. The same antisera gave positive ELISA result with the homologous peptide in free or conjuqated form. Conclusion. Peptide immunization resulted in potent anti-HIV natural antigen antisera which may be useful in evaluation of AIDS pathogenesis and diagnostics. 1198 ANTIBODY INDUCTION BY SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES DERIVED FROM HIV 1 PROTEINS O.Mach, M.Reinis, J.Vagner#, and V.Krchnak# Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, #Leciva-Pharmaceuticals, Prague, Czechoslovakia Polyclonal antibodies against synthetic peptides derived from certain proteins of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1 ) were prepared in rabbits or mice. Using a search programme for antigenic determinants (Krchnak, Mach, and Maly, Anal.Biochem. 165, that promised to be the most immunogenic were selected from among the HIV 1 proteins encoded by the gag, pol, tat, and env genes. Corresponding peptides 10 -20 amino acid in length were synthesized by a solid-phase method. The peptides were inoculated into experimental animals either separately or in suitable combinations, but invariably with a covalently bound muramyl dipeptide and without any carrier protein. The antisera obtained were tested for antibodies by ELISA. Antibodies against individal peptides and their combinations formed at satisactory titres despite no carrier protein having been used. Notes: 1199 AN APPROACH TO HIV tat PRODUCT PRESENTATION USING A LOW-NEUROVIRULENT VACCINIA VIRUS STRAIN, LC16mO Asato ***Nippon Co., Kawasaki, ****Natl. Cancer Inst., NIH, Bethesda Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is unique in containing multiple non-structural genes that are regulatory in function. One of these, the tat gene, has been shown to be essential for virus replication and to be expressed highly before production of HIV in cells carring the proviral DNAs. A genetic engineering approach of a recombinant vaccinia virus (RVV) holds promise of a potential live vaccine that may elicit a strong protective response. However, safety of vaccinia virus used as a vector should be considered seriously. We made RVV by inserting the tat gene sequence into low-neurovirulent vaccinia virus, LC16mO. Infection of the RVV along with transfection of a reporter gene (chroramphenicol acetyl transfe'rase) linked to HIV LTR confirmed that it activated the LTR in trans. This trans-activation was dependent on RVV multiplicity and HIV LTR-specific; LTRs from RSV, HTLV-1 and a regulatory sequence of JCV were not affected by the RVV infection. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed a 14 KDa molecule in extracts of the RVV infected cells. The RVV is being used to produce immunity, investigate localization of the tat product, detect anti-tat protein antibody in sera from HIV infected individuals, and analyze inhibitors of trans-activation. 1200 A CASE OF SPONTANEOUS EXTINCTION OF HIV INFECTION S Chamareti, J Seqer2, A Coridian M.D., D Guitard1, A JC M Loche4, B Mach4, L Montagnieri. 1 Institut Pasteur 2 Paris 3 Institut Pasteur Lille, 4 Universite de Geneve. Objective. To demonstrate that spontaneous eradication of HIV infection may occur. Methods. HIV antibody response was followed by all available tests (Elisa, immunofluorescence, Western blot, RIPA). Presence of virus was searched by p24/25 antigen detection, virus isolation in T cell cultures, viral DNA sequences in blood mononucleated cells were looked for by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Results. A 40 year old heterosexual man was found to be seropositive for HIV-1 proteins in 1985, by all tests, and became seronegative in 1987 using the same tests. Determination of 4 polymorphic proteins in the collected serum samples (transferin, haptoalobulin, Gc protein and a lantitrybsin showed the same (rare) phenotype. This would exclude any laboratory mistake in handling the samples. The patient is healthy, has no biological sion of immune depression. He had no antiviral or immunostimulatino treatment. Attempts of virus isolation from his T lymphocytes and of p24/25 antioen detection have been negative. No nroviral DNA sequence could be detected in his white blood cells using the PCR method with a gag probe. Conclusion. Apparently, the subject has become completely free of HIV infection. The possibility of a spontaneous cure, eventhough it is a rare event, is of considerable interest for the care of serooositive subjects. It encourages us for designing new adjuvant therapeutics which could help the immune system of seropositive subjects to eradicate HIV infection. 162 [Page 163](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/161) 1201 HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS (HSPs) Ulmasov, Kh. A., Rudneva, I. A., Gorchakova, T. A. D. I. Ivanovsky Institute of Virology, Moscow, USSR Objective. HSPs are highly conservative proteins induced by stresses. Similar mechanisms of specific gene expression modulation are likely to act in HS and viral infection. We have studied the parameters of HSPs synthesis in HIV-infected cells. Methods. We used S35 methionine electrophoresis in pH-gradient to inducible and constitutive HSP72 forms. Results. We have discovered three constitutive HSP72 forms in H9 cells. HS response of HIV-infected and non-infected cells is identical in increasing the synthesis of HSPs which are produced at 370C, while the differences are connected with biosynthesis of strictly inducible HSP72 forms. HIV infection changes the spectrum of proteins, normally synthesized at 370C. The synthesis of many proteins markedly slows down, but the synthesis of p75, p74, p40, p32 proteins of the cell origins with an unknown function increases. In a number of its properties p75 is identical to glucose regulated protein (GRP) one of the HSP70 proteins induced by glucose deficiency. Conclusion. HIV infected cells apparently use up the main sugar pool for surplus glycosylation of viral glycoproteins, which in turn, cause glucose deficiency and induce GRP-25. 1202 AIDS CONFIRMATIVE TEST BASED ON RECOMBINANT PROTEINS Bukrinsky, M. I., Barsov, E. V., Popov, S. A., Karamov, E. V., [Zhdanov, V. M.1 D. I. Ivanovski Institute of Virology, Moscow, USSR Objective. Recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing gag and env genes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) were used to obtain HIV-1 antigens. Methods. These antigens were used in Western blot to detect antibodies to HIV proteins in sera of AIDS patients. Results. This test, based on recombinant antigens gave no false negative results, with only 5% of false positive results (commercial DuPont blots were used as reference). These false positives are due to reaction with vaccinia antigens. Conclusion. The test can be used as a confirmative one, allowing differential revealing of anticore and antienvelope antibodies. Notes: 163 [Page 164](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/162) Institute, Washington, D.C., Bethesda, MD, USA Hemophiliacs develop antibodies to MHC antigens as a result of exposure to therapeutic blood products and have become infected with HIV-1 by this same mechanism. Historic serum samples allow examination of effects of HIV-1 infection on the immune response to repeated antigenic stimulation. Samples, obtained prior to seroconversion, at seroconversion and at subsequent times to 1987, were tested for cytotoxicity against T and B lymphocytes from 41 normal individuals whose HLA types represent the majority of identifiable MHC class I and class II antigens. The average % reactivity to the B cells of serum from 9 patients who developed AIDS 2-4 yr after seroconversion was 34% prior to seroconversion, 51% at 1st seropositive and 67% at AIDS diagnosis and to T cells, cytotoxicity at these same times was 14%, 23%, and 24%. In contrast, 10 patients who are AIDS free had average B cell reactions of 16%, 30% and 69% at comparable intervals and T cell reactions of 14%, 17% and 34%. While the % cytotoxicity of serum samples from individuals in each group varied, the trend over the period of time studied followed the above averages. The differential response to B and T cells, the increase in range of reactivity to MHC antigens in these patients is unexpected particularly in patients developing AIDS where T helper cells are progressively depleted. The results suggest possible mechanisms for disease progression in HIV-1 infected individuals heretofore unexplored. 2002 INCREASED MHC CLASS I ANTIGEN EXPRESSION FOLLOWING HIV AND CMV INFECTION Bacteriological Laboratory and Karolinska Institute, **Dept. of Neurosurgery, Karolinska Institute, ***Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Stockholm, Sweden. Objective. A cell-line derived from a neuroaesthesioblastoma was infected with HIV to see if these neuronrelated cells were susceptible for HIV and/or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and whether the expression of MHC antigens was affected. Method. A cell-line was established from a surgical specimen of a neuroaesthesioblastoma. Cells were infected with HIV (HTLV-III B) and/or CMV (Towne). After 7 days the cells were fixed and stained for CD-4, HLA-DR, HLA-ABC, CMV antigens and HIV antigen by (IIF). The supernatants were analyzed for HIV p24 antigen by ELISA. Results. All cells were negative for CD-4 and HLA-DR by IIF. cells cells showed 80% positive cells by IIF. CMV infected cells showed 2% cells with CMV antigens; HIV infected cells showed 4% cells with HIV. HIV p24 antigen was detectable in the supernatants of both HIV and HIV-CMV double-infected cultures. Conclusion. The Tp 410 MG cell-line, derived from a human neuroaesthesioblastoma can be infected with both HIV and CMV. The cells show a dramatic increase of MHC class I antigen expression following such infection. Notes: 2003 INFLUENCE OF MHC PHENOTYPE ON CELLULAR CYTOTOXICITY TO HIV INFECTED CELLS D Mann*, Y Tabor**, M Lubet**, J Goedert* National Cancer Institute, NIH*, Biotech Research Laboratories**, Bethesda, MD, USA Cellular cytotoxicity plays an important role in the immune response to viral infection and is generally restricted by MHC Class I or Class II antigens. We report the results of cytotoxicity studies of lymphocytes from 16 HIV-I seropositive AIDS free and 16 seronegative HLA typed males using uninfected H9 (U-H9) and H9 (I-H9) target cell lines. (HLAA1,Bw62,DR4, DQw3). Lymphocytes from study subjects were cultured for 7 days with PHA and 4 hour 51Cr release assays performed at 100:1, 50:1, 25:1 E:T ratios. The results studies with HIV seropositives are as follows: <25% cytotoxicity with no differences between U-H9 and I-H9 at any E:T ratio in non HLA matched (No.4): 4 HLA-A1 matches had 33-75% cytotoxicity with no differences I-H9 ratio:2-Bw62 >14% cytotoxicity to E:T ratios: 4-HLA.DR4 matches, cytotoxicity was 2-fold or greater against I-H9 compared U-H9 at all E:T ratios. In the control group, cells from 1 individual had higher cytotoxicity to I-H9 compared to U-H9; 6 no cytotoxcity to either cell line; the remainder, higher levels of cytotoxicity to U-H9 than I-H9. No association of cytotoxicity with any shared HLA antigen was observed. These results demonstrate the presence of cytotoxic lymphocytes in HIV seropositive individuals to HIV-I infected cells and indicate that the cytotoxicity is restricted by MHC Class II antigens. 2004 HIGH ALLOACTIVATING CAPACITY OF KAPOSI's Wolfgang Wehrmann, Gullardo, Peralta, D. Gross, B. Safai Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Objective. To explore the class II-MHC restricted stimulation of EC from AIDS/KS patients and patients with classical KS, immunologic response of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to the epidermal cells (EC) were examined in mixed skin cell lymphocyte reactions (MSLR). Methods. MSLR were prepared with 1 X 105 EC and PBMC, each in a stimulator/response-ratio of 1:1 per well. EC were isolated from shave biopsies (about 1 cm2) taken from healthy donors as controls and from uninvolved skin in patients. Briefly after trypsinization (0.25%, 370c, 30 min, 5% C02) cells were rinsed with DNAse (0.25%). Cell suspension was filtered and washed. PBMC were separated by LSM-density gradient centrifugation and cultures set up with RPMI1640, 1%Lglutamine, penicillin 100IU/ml, streptomycinl00ug/ml, and 10% human AB serum. Results. Our data show that EC from AIDS/KS patients have a significantly higher stimulating capacity when compared to EC from classical KS patients. Futhermore, the stimulating index of EC from AIDS/KS is much higher than that of EC from normal controls. Conclusions. Taken together these data indicate that EC from AIDS/KS patients have a higher allo-activating capacity in allogeneic lymphocyte response assay. Although several publications mention a decreased expression of human class II-MHC antigens on immunocompetent EC (Langerhans cells) and others mention a decreased number in AIDS patients, our results indicate a high alloactivated triggering effect of these EC on Lymphocytes. 164 [Page 165](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/163) 2005 HLA BACKGROUND AND HLA ANTIGENS ARE RISK FACTORS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF AIDS R.

Altmann*, Quentin J. Sattentau**, John Trowsdale*, Peter C.L. Beverley *Imperial Cancer Research Inn Fields, London UK**Academic Department of Genito Urinary Medicine, University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London UK. Objective Since HLA class-II (class-II) antigens act as the physiological ligand for the HIV receptor, CD4, they may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection. We have investigated whether HIV infection of T cell lines alters class-II expression, and if the presence of these antigens influences virus infectivity. Methods HIV infected H9 cells were ccmpared with their uninfected counterparts for class-II expression by measuring levels of class-II mRNA and cell surface expression of antigen. Class-II antigens on infectious HIV particles derived from H9 cells were detected by clearance of infectivity from virus containing supernatants with class-II antibody beads. Results Large increases were observed in the levels of mRNA detected by various class-II probes in HIV infected as compared to uninfected H9 cells. This was reflected in increased cell surface expression of class-II antigens. Virus derived from H9 cells could be precipitated with class-II antibody beads and certain class-II antibodies were able to partially inhibit syncytium formation by HIV infected H9 cells. Conclusion These findings may have important implications with respect to the role of altered class-II expression in HIV pathogenesis and antiviral immunity. 2008 IN VITRO GENERATION OF CLASS II-RESTRICTED, HSV-SPECIFIC CYTOTOXIC T CELLS IS REDUCED BY THE PRESENCE OF HIV-1 IN CULTURE. Alison C. Mawle, D. Scott Schmid, J. Steven McDougal. Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To determine whether the generation of the class II-specific response to herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 is affected by the presence of HIV-1 in vitro. Methods. HSV type 1-specific cytotoxic T cells were generated by culturing peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) either with HSV or with HSV and HIV-1 for 5 days. Cytotoxic responses were assayed on HSV-infected EBV-transformed B-cell lines in a standard 51Cr release assay. Results. The cytotoxic response to autologous and class II-matched targets was substantially reduced by the presence of HIV. An equivalent reduction was seen if the effectors were treated with a-CD16 and a-CD4. a-CD16 alone did not eliminate the class II MHC-restricted response, although it did eliminate any killing directed at class I-matched targets. No HIV +HIV E:T ratio Class II Class I Class II Class I 25:1 35 24 19 17 12.5:1 25 17 0 11 No difference was seen in the percentage of CD4-positive cells between the effector cell populations cultured with and without HIV. Conclusion. HIV-1 affects the generation of the class II-restricted HSV response in vitro. The percentage of CD4-positive cells is not affected over the time course of CTL generation. This suggests that HIV can affect these cells without killing them and may help explain the devastating herpes infections often seen in patients. 165 [Page 166](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/164) 2009 DOWNREGULATION OF HLA **Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To examine the ability of HIV-1 infection to modulate the cell surface expression of HLA Class I antigens on CD4+ T-cell lymphoblasts and the CD4+ T-cell lines, CEM-E5 and HT. Methods. Cells were examined at various times after HIV-1 infection by FACS analysis for cell surface changes in HLA-I antigen expression. Results. HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T-cell lymphoblasts results in a decreased expression of HLA-I cell surface expression at 18 hr, which returns to normal by 24 hr. CEM-E5 and HT show a more gradual downshift of HLA-I antigens, which is maximal at about day 9 after HIV-1 infection. In outgrowths of CEM-E5 that no longer express CD4 and may or may not express HIV-1 but have HIV-1 integrated into the host cell genome, the cell surface level of HLA-I antigens returns to normal. HT, which can be continually and productively infected by HIV-1, also returns to normal levels. This downshift is not due to selective loss of a high HLA-I expressing subpopulation of cells because the downshift is apparent before significant numbers of infected cells are lost. Conclusion. HLA-I cell surface antigens are reversably downregulated by HIV-1 two CD4+ T-cell lines, CEM-E5 and HT. Further studies will address whether HIV-1 mediates this activity at a transcriptional or translational level. 2010 HLA-DR EXPRESSION IN HIV-1 INFECTION Y. Sei, M. Inoue, M.M. Yokoyama, J.I. Wallace, and J.G. Bekesi Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, N.Y. 10029 USA We analyzed HLA-DR expression on peripheral mononuclear cells derived from 11 patients with AIDS, 12 subjects with ARC, and 10 heterosexual controls. The results showed an increase HLA-DR (+) cell populations which were due to an increased Leu2 (+) HLA-DR (+) cells and BI (+) HLA-DR (+) cells. We also found an increase in the HLA-DR-MAb binding sites per cell, in the LeuM3 (+) HLA-DR (+) monocyte populations of the AIDS and ARC patients relative to controls, while the absolute number of LeuM3 (+) HLA-DR (+) cells was decreased in AIDS and ARC (NEJM; 315; 1611). In order to find the direct effects of HIV-1 on HLA-DR expression, we analyzed phenotypic changes in SB, DK, U937 cell lines. The cell represents Leul2/16+, HLA-DR+ (human respectively. An increase of HLA-DR fluorescence intencity was shown in all of these SB, DK, U937 cells 7 to 15 days after exposure to HIV-1 (HTLV-IIIb). Further, we also extablished chronic HIV-1 infected SB-IIIb, DK-IIIb, U937-IIIb cell lines which are producing HIV-1 with high intencity of HLA-DR. The in vitro experiment using cell lines indicated that HIV-1 exposure induced HLA-DR antigen expression on human B and Monocyte lines. The overall results suggest that chronic antigenic stimulation by HIV-1 may be one contributing factor for an increased HLA-DR expression on peripheral mononuclear cells in vivo. Notes: 2011 HI(H SUSCEPTIBILITY OF IMMATURE THYMIC CELLS TO Objective. Data of complete thymus atrophy were reported in many AIDS cases. In order to investigate if thymus could be target for HIV infection, unfractionated and CD1+ (T6+) enriched thymic cells were infected in vitro. Methods. The presence of the virus genome was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis. Kinetic of infection was evaluated by reverse transcriptase activity and expression of viral antigens. Results. Equal numbers of total thymic cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were infected to establish if difference in the susceptibility to infection could be related to the number of target cells present in the culture. Unfractionated and immature thymic cells were labelled with a fluorescein-conjugated HIV preparation to examine the relation between cell differentiation and response to infection. Thymic cells resulted very sensitive to the viral effect and CD3+ antigen expression was reduced in the infected cells. The immature CD1+ cells appeared more susceptible to HIV infection and produced much more than mature phenotype cells. Conclusions. These results indicate that relative immaturity of the cellular target can positively influence HIV-I replication and expression. 2012 THYMIC ATROPHY IN HIV INFECTION Brian P Mulhall*, I R Mackay\", T Doyle *Clinical Research Unit, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and AIDS Service, Royal Melbourne Hospital, **Dept Radiology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia. Objective. To obviate the difficulties of interpreting thymic hormonal data and autopsy material by attempting visualization of the thymus gland in a group of patients seropositive for HIV, and relating the appearance to disease category and to tests of immune function. Methods. 22 seropositive patients were studied; eleven were asymptomatic (AS), four had group IVa disease (ARC), three Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and four opportunistic infectious diagnostic of AIDS (01). All subjects underwent computed tomographry with a current generation GE 9800 machine. Results. At each age group there was a marked excess of subjects with a low density thymus compared with the normal population. These changes were most obvious in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma or opportunistic infection, but were also apparent in asymptomatic individuals. The density measurements were significantly different between disease groups (p<0.05) and correlated independently with number of Pan-T cells (p<0.05) and total lymphocyte counts (p<0.01). Conclusion. The results suggest that thymic involution occurs early in infection with HIV, and lend support to the hypothesis that destruction of the thymus may be important in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Further results will be presented from a control group of seronegative male homosexuals with original CT photographs. 166 [Page 167](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/165) 2013 MMUNOLOGIC FINDINGS IN Laboratory,Stockholm,Sweden. Objective To determine the nature of immunological changes observed during primary HIV infection. Method Twenty subjects with symptomatic primary HIV infection were examined by agarose electrophoresis for IgG and oligoclonal bands (OCB) (44 samples) 7 and for CD4+ and CD8-'- cells (79 samples). Results Time after onset of illness (mean+SEM) 0-1 week CD4+ cells which were in the low normal range already during the first week of illness did not change significantly during the observation time. CD8-:cells increased during the first month after onset (p<0.05)leading to an inversion of the CD4--/CD8+ ratio (p<O.001).Weak oligoclonal bands were seen early in 50% of the subjects and thereafter with higher frequency paralleling a gradual increase of IgG levels (p<O.02). Conclusion Primary HIV infection is associated with an early rise of CD8+ cells and low levels of CD4+ cells resulting in an inversion of the CD4-/CD8-+ cell ratio. Serum IgG levels show a gradual increase which is paralleled by an increased frequency of demonstrable oligoclonal bands. 2014 PROGRESSION TO AIDS AS A CORRELATE OF CHANGES OVER TIME IN HIV ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC ANTIBODY TITERS AND LYMPHOCYTE SUBSETS. L.H. Bozeman. Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To determine whether changes in HIV antigen-specific antibody titers and lymphocyte subsets correlate with progression to AIDS. Methods. Serum HIV measured by Western measured by 2-color immunofluorescence using specific monoclonal antibodies were assessed on specimens collected about 3 years apart from a cohort of HIV+ homosexual men with lymphadenopathy syndrome. Progressors (P) to AIDS were compared with nonprogressors (NP) at times 1 and 2 and the changes in the test parameters over time were compared for the two groups. Results. At time 1, P had significantly higher titers of antibody to the gp41 of HIV and higher percentages of CD8+ cells (Leul5- subset), Leu7+CD3+ cells and Leu7+Leull- cells. At time 2, P had lower titers of antibody to p32, lymphocyte counts, and CD8-Leu7+ cells were also lower in P. Antibody to p51 and p65 decreased significantly over time in P but not in NP. There was also a greater drop in CD4+ cells (4B4+, 2H4+, and CD8+) in P vs NP and a drop in CD8+ cells (Leul5-) in P vs a rise in NP. Conclusion. Decreases in antibody to pol gene products, p51 and p65, and in both subsets of CD4+ cells as well as an early rise and late fall in CD8+ cells was associated with progression to AIDS. Notes: 2015 ASSOCIATION OF CD4 NUMBERS, HIV BAND-SPECIFIC ANTIBODY TITERS, AND CELLULAR HIV LOAD WITH DEVELOPMENT OF AIDS JKA Nicholson, TJ Spira, CH Aloisio, BM Jones, MS Kennedy, JS McDougal, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To determine whether changes in various laboratory test results of HIV-infected patients predict development of AIDS. Methods. We assessed 4 serial specimens from each of 15 homosexual men with chronic lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS) (6 have now progressed to AIDS) for the following: 1) lymphocyte subset markers (by 2-color immunofluorescence); 2) antibody titers to the various HIV proteins (by Western blot analysis); and 3) cellular HIV load (by a cellular ID50 assay). The specimens covered a period of about 3 years, and all specimens were collected before AIDS was diagnosed. All laboratory tests were evaluated for changes over time, and progressors (N=6) were compared with nonprogressors (N=9). Results. When the first samples were tested (about 1 year after onset of LAS), progressors and nonprogressors did not differ in any of the parameters studied. Over time, there was a greater rate of decline in the numbers of CD4+ (both CD4+2H4+ and CD4+4B4+) cells in progressors than in nonprogressors. Antibody to viral pol (p51 and p65) and &ga (p55) proteins increased in nonprogressors but decreased in progressors over the same period. Viral load (number of cells/106 that will infect 50% of the cultures) increased in progressors but changed little in nonprogressors over time. Conclusion. Progression to AIDS is associated with increasing viral load and decreasing numbers of CD4+ T cells. 2016 PERIPHERAL BLOOD (PB) AND CEREBROSPINAL (CSF) LYMPHOCYTE SUBSETS (CD4 AND CD8) AND BETA 2 MICROGLOBULIN ( / 2m) IN HIV INFECTION WITH AND WITHOUT NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. F. Touraine*, C. 437 Lyon c6dex 03 - FRANCE Blood and CSF from 10 HIV+ stade IV patients were comparatively investigated for CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and for A/2m by RIA. 5 patients had neurological manifestations of toxoplasmosis or HIV encephalitis (group I), 5 had no neurological symptom (group II). In a previous study of 46 HIV- patients with non inflammatory neurological disorders CD4 and CD8 percentages were respectively 45 + 10 and 25 + G in PB, 58 + 11 and 33 + 13 in CSF. Normal values of /3 2m were found to be 1 487 + 46.g/l in PB, 731 + 25 in CSF. In HIV+ patients, the percentage of CD4 lymphocytes was relatively lower in CSF than in PB. It was lower in patients with neurological lesions than in those without central nervous system (C.N.S.) involvement (9.3 vs 14.5). Conversely CD8 lymphocytes were more increased in group I than in group II (49 vs 36 %). CSF A 2m was 4 875 in group I and 3 195 in group II. These results indicate decreased levels of CD4 lymphocytes and increased values of CD8 lymphocytes and /2m in CSF from stade IV HIV+ patients, these alterations being nore prominent in cerebral toxoplasmosis and HIV encephalitis than in patients without CNS 167 [Page 168](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/166) 2017 P. Th.A. Central Lab. of The Neth. Red Cross Blood Transf. Service and Lab. of Exp. and Clin, Immunol. of the Univ. of Amsterdam, *Academic Medical Centre, **Municipal Health Service, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Leukocyte functions were studied in asymptomatic homosexual men (CDC group lI/Ill) who had seroconverted for anti-HIV antibody but still had normal CD4+ cell counts. In longitudinally collected blood samples B-cell differentiation induced by PWM was completely abolished, while SAC/IL-2-induced Ig production decreased gradually until a complete loss after 10 months. In the same period T-cell and accessory-cell functions remained normal. In asymptomatic homosexual men (CDC group II/III) who were at least two years seropositive, compared to age-matched HIV-negative homosexual men, the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed decreased proliferation to anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and decreased CD4+ T-helper activity on pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-driven differentiation of normal donor B cells. Monocytes of HIV-infected homosexual men showed decreased accessory function on normal T-cell proliferation induced by CD3 monoclonal antibody. Elevated spontaneous Ig synthesis was not observed in asymptomatic HIV-infected men. Our results indicate that HIV has a general effect on the immune system, including CD4+, CD8+, B-cell and monocyte functions, before CD4+ cell depletion occurs. 2018 T CELL SUBSETS IN LYMPH NODES (LN) OF PATIENTS WITH PERSISTENT Margarita cells express either C045R (kDa 220) or UCHL1 (kDa 180) of the leucocyte common antigens (LCA). The CD45R+,UCHL1- and the UCHL1+,CD45R- T cells may include virgin and primed T cell subsets, respectively. Both T4+ and T8+ subsets are subdivided in this way. The LCA defined T subsets were examined in PGL lymph nodes. Methods 14 tonsil and 5 hyperplastic LNs were studied as HIV- controls for the 32 HIV+ LN with PGL from male homosexuals using double IF combining T4 or T8 with CD45R or UCHL1. In 6 cases multiple biopsies were seen. Result The total decrease of T4+ cells was manifested in the gradual decrease of both CD45R+ and UCHL1+ subpopulations. By contrast the general increase of the T8+ population was a result of the accumulation of a selected subset: the UCHL1+ population. In the paracortex of the control lymphoid tissues 68+15% CD45R+ and 21+6% UCHL1+ cells were seen the populations while in PGL samples 23+11% CD45R+ and 67+23 % UCHL1+ cells were observed. This inversion of CD45R/UCHL1 has taken place early in the evolution of PGL. In the germinal centres seen in PGL virtually all T8+ cells were UCHL1+. At this site the CD45R expression could not be studied as B blasts also express this Ag, but a similar Ab, Leu-8, showed this population to be negative. Conclusion In HIV Ab+ PGL the majority of accumulating T8+ cells appear to have the features of primed or 'memory' cells opposite to that found in hyperplastic lymph nodes or tonsils from other conditions (controls).

It has been demonstrated that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected cells which express virus downregulate their expression of the CD4 molecule. The present study determines whether PBMCs of infected individuals which express virus are in the CD4+ population of T cells and what is the precursor frequency of these virus infected cells. Methods. We examined highly purified subpopulations of PBMCs from AIDS patients obtained by cell sorting and utilized the techniques of virus isolation by limiting dilution analysis, in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence (IF). Results. Cells were sorted for CD3 positivity (which excluded monocytes), and virus expression as determined by co-culture with PHA blasts was seen predominantly in these 98% pure CD3+ cells (T cells). A smaller delayed expression of HIV was seen in cells which * initially were CD3-, most likely due to expression of HIV in monocytes or in CD3+ cells which were ultimately shown to grow out. Within the CD3+ population, virus was expressed predominantly in the CD3+/CD4+ <1/10,000 Limiting dilution analysis performed on the purified CD3+/CD4+ cells of 3 patients yielded precursor frequencies of HIV expressing cells of 1/800, 1/4000, and 1/1200. Conclusion. Thus, the CD3+/CD4+ cell which maintains expression of its CD4 molecule is the predominant PBMC that continues to support HIV replication in AIDS patients. 168 [Page 169](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/167) 2021 A PROSPECTIVE FOLLOW-UP OF T-LYMPHOCYTE SUBSETS SWEDISH Berntorp**, B B6ttiger*** *Dept of **Malm6 Malma, ***Dept of Immunology, National Bacteriological Lab, Objective.To follow the immunological progression of HIVinfection in haemophiliacs and to recognize some factors that may influence the course. Methods. The T4- and T8-lymphocyte subsets have been studied at least once a year since 1983-84 in all haemophiliacs, who regularly are checked at the Haemophilia Treatment Centres in Stockholm and Malmi. HIV-seroconversion occurred during 1979-83 in this group. All samples have been analysed at the National Bacteriological Laboratory. Results. In all, 153 haemophiliacs have been studied, out of which 79 are seropositive for HIV. There were 76 haemophiliacs from Stockholm and 77 paired both T4 and T4/T8 is seen among seropositive haemophiliacs treated in Stockholm but not in Malmi. There are no differences between the groups except that more patients treated in Stockholm used mainly/exclusively factor concentrates made of US-plasma (S:28, M:7) than of Swedish plasma (S:15, M:29) (*** in Chi square test). Conclusion. Repeated challenges with blood products with presumably heavier viral contamination may aggravate the course of HIV-infection, as assessed immunologically. 2022 OCURRENCE OF LYMPHOCYTES BEARING THE GAMA DELTA T CELL RECEPTOR IN THE PERIPHERAL BLOOD OF AIDS PATIENTS. NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, I)D. Objective. To determine the percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes in AIDS patients which bear the gamma delta T-cell receptor (y6TCR). Methods. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) separated from whole blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation were obtained from healthy HIV-negative heterosexual volunteers, healthy HIV-negative homosexual men, and homosexual men with AIDS. The leukocytes were then stained with one of the following FITC conjugated monoclonal antibodies: 5TCS-1 (specific for the the y6 TCR), OKT3 (anti-CD3), and TCR-1 (specific for the alpha beta framework of the TCR). Leukocytes were then analyzed on a flow cytometer and lymphocytes were detected by gating according to forward and 900 light scatter. Results. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 23 healthy HIV-negative heterosexual volunteers and 23 healthy HIV-negative homosexual men were found to be 1.6 ~ 1.15% (range 0-4%) and 1.6 ~ 1.72%(range of 0-4%) positive for 6TCS-1, respectively. In addition, none of these individuals were found to have a >5% difference between OKT3 and TCR-1 positive lymphocytes. In contrast, 20 out of 120 (16.6%) homosexual men with AIDS were found to have a >5% difference between OKT3 and TCR-1 positive cells. Frozen cells on thirteen of these 20 patients were examined and found to have 8.0 ~ 5.2% (range 1-16%) lymphocytes positive for 6TCS-1. Conclusion. A subpopulation of AIDS patients appear to have an unusually high percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes bearing the y6TCR. Notes: 2023 LACK OF EXPANSION OF THE GAMMA T CELL RECEPTOR (TCR) SUBSET DURING THE HIV INFECTION B. Autran~, F. Triebel*, Y. Dudoit, T. Roussy, Villejuif, FRANCE +Sce Med. Trop. H6p. C. Bernard, Paris, FRANCE Several mechanisms of human cytotoxic immune responses against HIV have been described: cytotoxicity, and a non specific cytolysis mediated by LAK cells. Recently, a new T cell subset has been isolated, bearing a TCR composed of the gamma and a delta chains, which could mediate a non-MHC restricted cytotoxicity. The TiY subset represents a mean of 3% of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) in adult controls. The aim of the present study was to quantify the TiTT cell subset in HIV infected patients at distinct stages of their disease, using a two colour FACS analysis with a monoclonal antibody (VIC2) directed against the1 chain. Thirty-six patients have been analyzed (11 PGL, 10 ARC, 15 SIDA). A mean of 3.45% (0 -13) CD3+ TiT+ cells were detected in the overall population. No statistical differences could be detected between patients with PGL (3.4% + 1.2), ARC (3.7% + 3.5) or AIDS (3.3% + 1) contrasting with the progressive decrease of the CD3+ and CD4+ T cells and with the expansion of the CD8 subset. Moreover the percentages of TiT were not modified when tested at a 6-12 months interval. No activation antigen (HLA-DR and IL2-receptor) could be detected on the Tir+ T cells. These results demonstrate a remarkable stability of the Ti gamma subset at every stage of the HIV infection and suggest that this cytotoxic subset could not be involved neither in the HIV target cells nor in the spontaneous cytotoxic host defenses against HIV. 2024 DIFFERENTIAL CO-EXPRESSION OF LEU-19 ON LEU-11 CELLS IN HIV INFECTED INDIVIDUALS Bonnie Dittel*, A Landay*, H Gebel*, H Kessler**, R Bray* *Dept. of Immunology/Microbiology, ** Dept. of Medicine, Rush Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA Objective. To examine the nature of the NK cell defect in HIV infected individuals. Methods. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were isolated from normal, asymptomatic Ab- and Ab+, and symptomatic Ab+ individuals. CD16 cells were analyzed for the co-expression of Leu-19 (% 16/19) by flow cytometry and PBL were assayed for NK and ADCC in the absence or presence of IL-2 or B-IFN (100 U/ml, 18 hr). Leu-19+ X+S.D. Normal 37~4 NK 88 64 63 26 w/IL-2 175 163 150 70 w/8-IFN 157 144 104 32 ADCC 49 54 66 28 w/IL-2 104 102 160 59 w/8-IFN 80 112 110 42 Removal of Leu-19+ cells from an Asy+ patient reduced NK function from 27 to 3 lytic units even though CD16 expression was only decreased from 16% to 14%. Conclusion. These data suggest that a CD16+/Leu-19- cell is present in Ab+ individuals and may be responsible, in part, for the defect in NK cell function. 169 [Page 170](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/168) 2025 INCREASE IN NUMBER OF CD3+CD4CD8 LYMPHOCYTES AFTER INFECTION WITH HIV-1. J Margolick, V Carey, A Munoz, BF Polk, J Giorgi, J Goldsmith, R Kaslow, C Rinaldo; for the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), Bethesda, MD USA. Objective: To determine the effect of incident HIV infection on the number/mm3 (#) of circulating T lymphocytes (CD3+) expressing neither CD4 nor CD8. Methods: Of 247 MACS subjects followed semiannually who developed antibodies to HIV (HIV-ab) from 1984-87, 227 for whom the time of seroconversion (defined as halfway between the last negative and the first positive test for HIV-ab) was known to within ~3 mo. were studied. For each of 1432 evaluations, D = #CD3+ - (#CD4+ + #CD8+) was calculated and normalized by subtracting the median D for HIV-seronegative subjects at the corresponding evaluation. D was then related to time from seroconversion using regression methods for correlated data. Results: Time from seroconversion (months) 2026 Relationship Between HIV-1 Isolation and T-Cell Subsets Among HIV-1 Infected Individuals. H. Farzadegan, J. Margolick, J.C. McArthur, W. Sutton, B.F. Polk. Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA. Objective: To determine if variablility in the isolation rate of HIV-1 from peripheral blood (PB) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is related to proportion of different T-Cell subsets in PB and CSF. Mlethod: Paired specimens of PB (30 ml) and CSF (6-7 nl) from 42 HIV-1 seropositive homosexual men were obtained simultaneously. Specimens were co-cultivated with PIIA-P CD3 blasts, and two-color flow cytometry at the same time. Results: The HIV-1 isolation rates were inversely related to the percentage of CD4 cells present in both PB and CSF. This inverse relationship was statistically significant for PB (p=0.001), but not for CSF (p=0.53). CD4 (%) Specimen 0-29 30-59 Total Positive Total Positive Blood 25 23 (92%) 17 7 (41%) CSF 25 10 (40%) 17 5 (29%) Conclusion: These findings suggest that other infected cell may be source of virus replication or that more Tcell are infected in subjects with lower CD4 proportion. -9 to-3 Da 4.9 pb.29 a D= mean to 3 -3 to 3 mo. from seroconversion In addition, the mean value for D after 21 mo. was higher than that at 3-9 mo. (p =.025). These differences persisted after allowing the 4 centers to have different correlation structures for D within subjects over time. Conclusion: HIV infection is followed by a prompt and progressive increase in # of CD3+CD4-CD8- T cells, whose role in host resistance to HIV merits further study. Notes: 2027 MORPHOLOGIC LYMPHOCYTE MARKERS OF IMMUNE DEFICIENCY. H.E. Nieburgs, J.G. Bekesi* Dept Pathology, University Massachusetts Medical Berkshire Medical Center, Pittsfield MA 01201; *Dept Neoplastic Diseases, Mt Sinai School of Medicine, New York NY 10029; USA. Objective. To study the morphology and pathogenesis of lymphocytes in homosexuals and intravenous (iv) drug abusers with AIDS. Method. Microscopic study of peripheral blood smears of 142 patients (pts) included 29 with AIDS, 82 homosexuals, 14 iv drug abusers with AIDS, and 17 controls. Results. In 24 of 29 pts (83%) with AIDS, lymphocytes were found with enlarged nuclei. Nuclear borders were irregular, cleaved or lobulated. Often large, prominent, deeply stained structureless clumps of chromatin had occasionally a uniformly sized clear round area in their center. These changes were also found in 19 of 82 homosexuals without symptoms of AIDS. Of these, 15 (79%) were HIV seropositive with inversion of T-cell ratios. In contrast, 79% of the 14 iv drug abusers with AIDS had lymphocyte and segmented neutrophil nuclei with a cribriform structure. All drug addicts with AIDS had severe inversion of T4/T8 ratios with impaired lymphocyte function and with marked leukopenia. Culture of blood lymphocytes together with spermatazoa revealed penetration of sperms into lymphocyte nuclei resulting in nuclear patterns that were identical to those of HIV-infected homosexuals. Conclusion. Relevance of lymphocyte changes to route of HIV transmission and to diagnosis of asymptomatic individuals at risk. 2028 BEREAVEMENT ASSOCIATED ALTERATIONS IN PHENOTYPES HOMOSEXUAL MEN Kemeny, M.E., Fahey, J.L., Schneider, S., Weiner, H., Taylor, S., and Visscher, B. UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA Objective: To determine whether or not individuals experiencing AIDS-related bereavement (death of 2 or more close friends over the past year) differ from non-bereaved individuals in percentages of lymphocyte subsets. Methods: 100 age-matched bereaved and nonbereaved subjects (50 HIV+, 50 HIV-) were selected from a large cohort of homosexual men assessed at 6-month intervals for loss events, affective state, psychological response to the risk of AIDS, and health behaviors. Lymphocytes from subjects were evaluated using a panel of monoclonal antibodies and two color flow cytometry to assess percentages of 21 subsets of CD4, CD8 and natural killer cells. Results: Preliminary results indicate significant differences between bereaved and non-bereaved subjects in several lymphocyte subsets. Further analyses will determine whether patterns of differences are associated with serostatus and depression following bereavement. Other factors that could explain differences between groups (e.g., sexual practices, drug use) are being evaluated. Conclusion: The distress following AIDSassociated bereavement may be associated with alterations in specific subsets of lymphocytes. 170 [Page 171](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/169) 2029 REDUCTION OF T HELPER/INWDXERS OF B LYMPOCYS AND INCREASE OF T SUPPRESSORS AS AN EARLY PATTERN OF HIV INFECTION.

Jakobsen KD, Hofmann B, Dickmeiss E, Ryder LP, Svejgaard A et al. Tissue Typing Laboratory, University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen. Subjects infected with HIV may have severely impaired lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogens and antigens. Because HIV infects T-cells bearing the CD4 receptor, a normal proliferative capacity is expected from the CD8 cells. The proliferative responses to PHA and PWM of CD4 and CD8 depleted (antibody coated magnetic beads) lymphocytes were investigated in eight control subjects, eight HIVinfected subjects with normal proliferative responses, and eight HIV-infected subjects with decreased proliferative responses. Both CD4- and CD8 enriched lymphocytes from HIV-infected subjects with low responses had dedreased proliferative responses, and decreased IL-2 production, whereas the responses of the same. subsets from control subjects and HIV-infected with normal responses were largely normal. Suppression by the CD8 positive cells is not responsible for the decreased proliferative responses because depletion for this subset did not increase the responses. These results confirm previous investigations in patients with definite AIDS indicating that not only the CD4 but also the CD8 cells frcm some subjects without AIDS have a decreased response. Moreover, the monocytes from patients with AIDS have earlier been shown to have normal antigen presenting capacity. The study indicates that the proliferative capacity of CD8 cells is deficient in HIV-infected subjects without AIDS. Notes: 2031 SUPPRESSOR ACTIVITY IN AIDS AND ARC PATIENTS. Enrica Tamburrini, A. Antinori, G. Ventura, P. Nervo, L. Ortona 2032 LONGITUDINAL EVALUATION OF CD8 T-LYMPHOCYTE SUBSET ALTERATIONS IN HIV-1 INFECTION Janis V Giorqi UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA Clinica Malattie Infettive - UniversitA Cattolica - Roma - Italy Objective. i) To enumerate cells with suppressor phenotype (CD8+ CD11+); ii) to assess functional suppression of AIDS and ARC T lymphocytes (CD8+, CD8+CD11+, CD8+CD11-). Methods. 4 AIDS patients (29-55 y.o., males) and 2 ARC pa tients (33 and 41 y.o., males) were studied utilizing a two-color immunofluorescence assay and an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte culture technique. Results. They showed that i) AIDS and ARC patients had normal CD8+ CD11+ lymphocyte to suppress (PWM stimulated or sponta neous) IgG and IgM synthesis by allogeneic lymphocytes controls (i.v. drug abusers without HIV infec tion and subjects without any risk factor and HIV infection). Addition of supernatants from cultures of AIDS or ARC cells did not suppress responses of control PBMC; IL-2 addition resulted in a very little enhancement of the in vitro synthesis of IgG and IgM by allogeneic control PBMC. Conclusion. Although simple demonstration of cell-mediated suppressor activity in vitro does not establish his signi ficance \"in vivo\", these findings may explain the diminished specific antibody responses to vaccination in patients with HIV infection. Objective. To characterize the CD8 T-lymphocyte alterations in HIV-1 infection and define changes that correlate with disease stage. Methods. Dual-color immunofluorescent flow cytometry was performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes from HIV infected homosexually active men who are participants in a longitudinal study of the natural history of AIDS. Monoclonal antibodies used included OKT10 (CD38), HLA-DR, Leu7 and Leu8 as well as Leu2 Results. In normal healthy controls, almost all CD8 T-lymphocytes were OKT10-, HLA-DR- and about 60% were Leu8+. HIV seroconversion was accompanied by an increase in activated CD8 T-lymphocytes that were OKT10+, HLA-DR+ and Leu8-. This alteration was persistent in HIV seropositive men, and usually did not resolve once it had occurred. In AIDS, there was a further expansion of the circulating CD8 T-cell compartment. However, at this stage, the CD8 T-cells that appeared had phenotypic markers characteristic of immature cells. During the later stages of disease progression, the number of CD8 T-cells with normal phenotype diminished, contributing together with CD4 cell loss to the lymphopenia characteristic of late AIDS. Conclusion. An expansion in several distinct phenotypic subpopulations of CD8 T-lymphocytes contributes to the increase in CD8 cells observed in AIDS and other manifestations of HIV infection. Because they appear at different stages of disease, these phenotypically distinct subsets of CD8 lymphocytes may play diverse roles in the immune response to HIV. 171 [Page 172](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/170) 2033 THE EXPANDED CD8 CELLS IN Ziegler-Heitbrock*, tMedical Policlinic, Universitiy of Munich, Munich, FRG Objective. In addition to the depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes AIDS is characterized by an absolute increase of CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor cells. Since these expanded CD8+ cells may be important in pathophysiology of HIV infection we performed a detailed characterization of this subset using two- and three-color-immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Results. In a selected group of patients (healthy, ARC, AIDS, all but one without clinical evidence of acute infection at the time of study and without treatment) we can demonstrate that the increase of CD8+ cells is largely accounted for by the CD8+/Leu7+ cells. While in average per 1p of blood control donors had 322 CD8+/Leu7- cells and 70 CD8+/Leu7+ cells, the HIV infected patients exhibited 484 CD8+/Leu7- and 537 CD8+/Leu7+ cells. In order to investigate whether the CD8+/Leu7+ cells are activated T lymphocytes we employed three color immunofluorescence to study expression of DR antigens. Our results show that in average 42% of the CD8+/Leu7+ cells in the HIV infected patients do express DR antigens and thus are activated. Conclusion. Our data indicate that the expanded CD8+/Leu7+ cells are probably directly activated by HIV-virus and they suggest an active involvement of this distinct subset in pathophysiology of AIDS. 2034 SELECTIVE DEPLETION OF LOW ** Unite d'Oncologie Virale, Institut Pasteur, Paris.

Notes: 2035 PREDICTIVE FACTORS OF AIDS DISEASE IN LONG TERM FOLLOW-UP. C.Amiel, T.May, M.C.Ben&, F.Bertrand, G.Faure, Ph. Canton. Dept. of diseases, Biochemistry Lab. and Immunology Lab. Nancy. France. Objective: Long term effects of HIV infection on clinical and biological parameters were evaluated in a chohort of 45 HIV+ patients, over an 18 months period. Methods: None of the patients had AIDS disease or treatment. The sex ratio was 8:1, the mean age 31+9 years and risk factors were homosexuality (55%), IV drug abuse (24%), transfusion (20%) or multiple heterosexual partners (1%). Clinical follow-up was focused on opportunistic infections, development of malignant diseases, appearance of ARC. Biological investigations included the assessment of lymphocyte count, enumeration of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells numbers of CD4+ cells at presentation defined three groups of patients. in group 1 (19 pts. 42%), they were higher than 400/mm. In group 2 (13 pts., 29%), CD4+ cells ranged between 200 and 400/mm. CD4+ cells were less than 200 in the 14 patients of group 3 (31%). A progressive decrease of CD4+ cells was observed in all groups, with more than 50% loss in respectively 45%, 46% and 71% after 18 months. AIDS disease developed in 1 patient from group 2 and 7 from group 3. Lymphocyte count, IgG and 2m levels dit not appear predictive of AIDS. However, 3 of these patients had significantly increased levels of IgA. Conclusion: This study confirms the value of CD4 counts and IgA assessment in predicting the development of AIDS and demonstrates the consistent deterioration of these parameters in HIV+ patients. 2036 PATTERNS OF CHANGE IN CD-4 CELLS IN HIV-1 SEROCONVERTERS AND PREVALENT SEROPOSITIVES Roger Detels, P English, J Taylor, J Fahey J Giorgi, and B Visscher UCLA and the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study Objective. To look for changes in trends of CD-4 cell counts over time which might signal 1) infection with HIV-1 in seroconverters or 2) an event triggering progression to clinical disease in HIV-1 seropositive men. Method. Overlapping successive slopes of CD-4 cells constructed for 3 consecutive 6 month visits over 2 years in 49 seroconverters, 535 men seropositive at baseline and 541 persistently seronegative men were compared. Change was defined as a difference in overlapping successive slopes which was greater than that observed in 95% of seronegative men at each visit. The time of change in the slope of CD-4 cells will be compared temporally to changes in other immune parameters, in types and.frequency of sexual activities and in antibody titers to other sexually transmitted agents. Results. Change in slopes of CD-4 cells was observed in 16% of seronegatives, 45% of seroconverters and 19% of seropositives. Among those demonstrating change the change was upward in 60% of seronegatives, but downward in 82% of seroconverters and in 71% of prevalent seropositives. Thus 13% of all seropositives demonstrated a downward change, similar to the 14% rate of seropositives that developed AIDS. Conclusion: The results suggest that initial infection with HIV-1 is usually accompanied by a decline in CD-4 cells, that levels of CD-4 cells remain constant in the majority of seropositive men over a 24 month period, but that a downward shift can be identified in 13% of seropositive men over two years. 172 [Page 173](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/171) 2037 THE DIAGNOSTIC AND PROGNOSTIC SIGNIFICANCE OF CD4+ CELL NUMBERS ON THE PHA-REACTIVITY IN WHOLE BLOOD CULTURE OF HIV-INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. M. Roos*, F. de Lab. of Exp. and Clin. Immunol. of the Univ. of Amsterdam, **Municipal Health Service, ***Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands A cohort of healthy male homosexuals entered a prospective study on the pathogenesis and prognostic markers with regard to the development of AIDS. In the seropositive population individuals with persistent HIV-antigenemia show a 7 times higher incidence of developing AIDS as compared to the antigen-negative individuals. In this study the CD4+ cell numbers and the PHA-WBLC* were determined. The following results were found: 1) In the seropositive population there is a slight tendency towards a decrease in CD4+ cell numbers and the PHA-WBLC; 2) In the antigen-positive population the CD4+ cell numbers and the PHA-WBLC are lower than in the antigen-negative population; 3) CD4+ cell numbers do not decrease during or shortly after the moment of HIV-antigen appearance; 4) There is a correlation between the numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes and the PHA-WBLC; 5) In asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals who have been found gn two occasions to have a CD4+ lymphocyte number 40.5x10 /1, the chance for developing AIDS within 2.5 years was 50%. Only 7% developed AIDS while still having normal CD4+ cell numbers. Our results indicate a good prognostic value for both determination of CD4+ cell numbers and PHA-WBLC with respect to clinical symptoms (ARC, AIDS). * PHA-WBLC = Phytohaemagglutinin - Whole Blood Lymphocyte Culture 2038 DEFECTIVE TRANSMEMBRANE SIGNALLING IN HIV-1 INFECTED T CELLS AND CD4+ T CELLS FROM HIV SEROPOSITIVE PATIENTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR IMMUNODEFICIENCY G Linette, R Hartzman, P Pierce, D Smoot, C June Georgetown University, Washington DC; Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, MD OBJECTIVE:Infection with HIV-1 is often accompanied by a state of immunosuppression; specifically, the CD4(helper/ inducer) subset of peripheral blcod T cells appears to manifest severe functional abnormalities. Our objective was to define the mechanism(s) associated with this functional T cell defect. METHODS:CD4+ T cells from HIV patients(Walter Reed stages 3-6) and normal donor T cells infected in vitro with HIV were stimulated with CD3(T3/antigen receptor) or CD2 (E rosette receptor) monoclonal antibody(mAb). Cellular activation was measured phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate hydrolysis and release of intracellular free Ca2 using the fluorescent indicator Indo-1. RESULTS:HIV-1 in vitro infected T cells exhibit a profound but selective impairment of transmembrane signalling in response to CD3 mAb,while the response to stimulation by CD2 mAb remains normal. Uncoupling of the CD3 molecule from signal transduction is specific to the CD4 subset as the ability of the CD8 subset to respond to either CD3 or CD2 mAb remains intact. In preliminary experiments, CD4+ T cells from HIV patients also exhibit an impairment of transmembrane signalling thru the CD3/ antigen receptor pathway. CONCLUSION:The CD3 transmembrane signalling defect present within the CD4 subset provides a mechanism to explain the profound immunodeficiency seen in AIDS patients. Notes: 2039 DIFFERENT RATES OF CD4 T CELL FALL AND IN SEROPOSITIVE HOMOSEXUAL MEN: FACTORS C Rinaldo, M van Raden of Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, L.A., USA Objective: Definition of the various rates of CD4 T cell change seen in seropositive homosexual men, and their relative frequency and correlated factors. Methods: The percent of CD4 lymphocytes were measured in an ongoing study of a cohort of 1827 seropositive homosexual men seen at 6-month intervals for 3 years in 4 centers. The slope of CD4 T cell change was determined by linear regression. Results: The persistently seropositive men showed an average decrease of 6.4%, 8.7%, 4.8% and 6.7% in CD4 T cells per year in Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago and Pittsburgh, respectively. There was a wide variation in individual changes: 80% had slopes within the range of normal variation (5th-95th percentiles for seronegative men)and 30% of these had no CD4 T cell decrease (slope greater or equal to 0)). 20% had a more rapid fall. Increased serum IgA and age correlated best (p<0.001) with rapid fall of CD4 T cells. The negative slope of the CD4 T cell changes and the initial CD4 T cell levels correlate strongly with progression to AIPS. Conclusion: Serial measurements of CD4 T cells are central to monitoring consequences of HIV infection. 2040 IMMUNOREGULATORY T CELL SUBSETS IN HIV INFECTION: A.G., Imberti L. Depts. of Chemistry, Pediatrics and Infectious Disease, University of Brescia, ITALY. The main targets of HIV infection are CD4 lymphocytes, as the CD4 appears to function as the receptor for HIV, It has been demonstrated that CD4+ lymphocytes can be divided into two distinct subsets by means of two monoclonal antibodies: the anti-2H4 and the anti-4B4 that recognize respectively the suppressor-inducer and the helperinducer cells. In this study, we have analyzed the expression of 2H4 and 4B4 antigens in subjects at different stages of infection with HIV, in order to clarify the involvement of different functional subsets of CD4+ lymphocytes during the progression of the disease. In the stages of infection with clinical manifestations (LAS, AIDS) the number of helper-inducer cells was significantly reduced. Furthermore, a profound loss of peripheral blood suppressor-inducer cells was demonstrated only in patients with AIDS, but not in patients with LAS, in HIV+ asymptomatic subjects and in uninfected drug abusers. A high of CD4+ cells coexpressing both 2H4 and 4B4 antigens has been found in LAS and AIDS patients and may reflect the immune activation caused by viral infection. These results demonstrate that HIV has a cytopathic effect on both the CD4+ subsets. However, the decrease of the helper-inducer subset becomes evident earlier during the course of the infection. 173 [Page 174](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/172) 2041 SEQUENTIAL DECREASE University Medical Center, **American Red Cross Blood Services, St. Louis, MO, USA The Hemophilia Center enrolled 106 hemophiliacs (27 seronegative, 14 seroconverters and 65 seropositive on first study) between 1982-85 and sequentially measured T-cell subpopulations and n vitro ymphoproliferative responses which we re Then correlated with HIV serology. Statistical analysis was performed comparing seropositive vs seronegative hemophiliacs since T-cell subpopulations were altered in the latter compared to normal controls. Seropositive hemophiliacs' mean CD4 cell numbers were decreased compared to seronegative hemophiliacs (P < 0.01) and decreased from 649 cells/mm7 in 1983 (seronegative 639 cells/mm\"9) to 324 cells/mmO in 1987 (P < 0.01), mean time of 3.0 years. The percentage of seropositive hemophiliacs with CD4 cells < 150 increased from 0% in 1983 (seronegative 0%) to 28.6% in 1987 (P < 0.01). In asymptomatic seropositive subjects, 14.3% had CD4 cells < 150. CD4 cells were estimated to decline by -59.8 cells/mms/year, 80.3% of hemophiliacs the decline was -27.7 and in ARC and AIDS was -89.3 and -79.4, respectively. Lymphproliferative responses to PHA and tetanus by seropositive hemophiliacs were decreased compared to seronegative hemophiliacs and decreased sequentially. The % NR to PHA in seropositive hemophiliacs from 90.2% in 1982 (seronegative 93.0%) to 71.7% in 1987 (P < 0.05). The percentage of seropositive hemophiliacs unresponsive to tetanus stimulation (SI < 3.0) increased from 20.8% in 1983 (seronegative 7.1%) to 41.0% in 1987 (P < 0.05). This study revealed that HIV infection in hemophiliacs studied sequentially resulted in an increasing percentage of individuals with low CD4 cell number and in vitro function. 2042 DIURNAL CYCLE OF THE ABSOLUTE CD4 COUNT IN EARLY STAGE HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS. J.L.Malone*, T. E. Simms**, G. C. Gray**, K. F. Wagner*, D. S. Burke** *U.S. Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland, **Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, D.C. Objective.To study the causes of absolute CD4 count (T4) variation for HIV-infected(+) patients. Methods. HIV(+) adult males (n=16: 12 in Walter Reed stage (WR-) I,II, or III, and 4 in WR-VI) and HIV(-) matched controls (n=6) each had a total of 10 blood samples drawn within 3 days. The times were: 0800, 1200, 1600, and 2200 on day 1; 0800, 1200, and 1600 on day 2 and day 3. Results. Analyzing the 10-sample distributions obtained over 3 days for each patient,6 out of the 12 WR-I-III patients had maximum T4 values more than double the minimum T4 value. For each of the WR-I-III patients, the coefficients of variation (CV=standard deviation x 100/ mean) of the T4 averaged 23, and the CV for the differential lymphocyte count of the white blood cell count (WBC) averaged 20. Mean afternoon and evening T4 counts for the WR-I-III patients averaged 50-100 cells above the 0800 nadir (repeated measures ANOVA p=.04). Conclusion. The high CV observed in repeated T4 cell assays on HIV(+) patients can be explained in part by diurnal cycle and high variability in total lymphocyte count estimations. ** Hopital To investigate CD4 subsets (4B4, 2H4) levels in the different stages of HIV infection.

The mean number of CD4 lymphocytes was significantly lower in patients with AIDS or ARC (0.157 x 109/1) but - to a less degree - also in those with PGL or HIV (0.401 x 109/1) in comparison with healthy heterosexual controls (0.869 x 109/1). The mean number of CD8 lymphocytes was normal in patients with AIDS and ARC, slightly decreased in those with PGL, but clearly elevated in HIV persons (0.891 x 109/I). By applying a proliferation assay of peripheral blood lymphocytes against phytohemagglutinin A, no discrimination between the four groups could be made. Responses to pokeweed mitogen were strongly reduced in patients with AIDS and in the normal range in those with ARC, PGL and HIV. Further, concanavalin A responses and the reaction against candida and purified protein derivative were diminished in both AIDS and ARC patients but completely normal in PGL and HIV patients. Finally, delayed type hypersensitivity skin test revealed anergy in patients with AIDS and ARC but normal reactions in those with PGL and HIV. Thus, by using several assays, it is possible to characterize AIDS, ARC, PGL and HIV patients immunologically. Follow-up of these patients may show the relevance of these findings as predictive markers. CONCLUSIONS. 1) Both 4B4 and 2H4 were found to be alterec during HIV infection. 2) Furthermore, levels of 4B4 and 2H4 differed significantly between SPC and LAS stages, despite similar levels of CD4 total pool. 174 [Page 175](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/173) 2045 LYMPHOCYTE REACTIVITY J Wasserman*** *S6dersjukhuset, **Roslagtull Hospital, ***Central Microbiological Laboratory, Stockholm Objective. To evaluate the importance of decreased lymphocyte reactivity to mitogens as a prognostic factor for the development of AIDS. Methods. The lymphocyte reactivity to Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), Concanavalin A (ConA) (PWM) was investigated in 19 HIV seropositive homosexual male patients and 21 healthy controls. Results are given as means of the lymphocyte responses (counts per minute) to 3 concentrations of each mitogen and expressed as percentages of the mean response of the controls. The patients have been serially followed up with clinical examinations during 39-42 months from the time of their enrolment in this study. Results. 11/19 patients had decreased lymphocyte reactivity defined as a relative response less than 50% to at least 1 mitogen. One patient had AIDS at the entry of the study and further 5 have developed AIDS within 3-37 months. These 6 patients had decreased lymphocyte reactivity to at least 1 mitogen and 2 of them (with AIDS and AIDS within 3 months respectively) were low responders to all 3 mitogens. On the other hand, none of the 8 patients who had normal lymphocyte response to all mitogens has clinically deteriorated during the observation period. Conclusion. Decreased mitogen reactivity may serve as a prognostic tool. For this purpose, a combined measurement of the reactivity to PHA, ConA and PWM is of value. Patients responding normally to these mitogens seem to have a better prognosis. 2046 Mitogenic lymphocyte stimulation in patients at risk for AIDS: Search of prospective parameters in a cohort of 122 men. P. Kern, I. Th6ne, S. Schwander, M. Dietrich. Clinical Department, Tropical Institute, Hamburg, Germany. The study was initiated in 1984 in order to identify factors that may predict the development of AIDS. We have recruited 122 homosexual and bisexual men as well as 46 healthy volunteers for follow-up investigations. At the time of first presentation 74 patients were antibody positive for HIV-1, 64 of whom presented with PGL. Besides clinical and laboratory investigations including lymphocyte phenotype analysis, patients' Ficoll-Paque separated mononuclear cells were stimulated by mitogens. The uptake of H3 thymidine was measured after 4 days' in vitro culture as well as the production of cytokines into the culture medium. During the follow-up (up to 3 years) 14 patients developed AIDS (CDC classification). Immunological findings of those revealed a continuous decrease in mitogen stimulation as compared to those not developing AIDS. The global lymphocyte functions studied served as an earlier diagnostic sign as compared to the absolute number of CD4 lymphocytes or a more precise immunological classification of the disease (Zolla-Pazner et al., PNAS 1987). Our investigations support earlier investigations of functional abnormality of patients' lymphocytes, but served also as prognostic parameters for the development of AIDS in HIV-1 infected men. Notes: 2047 MITOGEN AND ANTIGEN RESPC~SIVENESS IN HIV SEROPOSITIVE PATIENTS A. Venet, M. Ekwalanga, M. Stern, P. Even. Laennec HIV Study Group. Paris, France. It is known that in AIDS mitogen and antigen responsiveness is markedly depressed due to a quantitative and qualitative defect of T4 cells, respectively. We studied these responses in a proliferation assay in 51 HIV seropositive non-AIDS patients in order to evaluate their immune status at earlier stages of HIV infection. Mitogen induced proliferation was reduced for all mitogens tested (PHA, ConA, PWM, OKT3) but in all cases these responses were highly correlated with the individual T4 cell counts and percentages. Antigen responses were evaluated using tetanus toxoid and herpes antigen. Data are expressed as responders. low-responders or non-responders by comparison with a group of 25 normal controls. Antigen unresponsiveness was observed in 75% of patients with less than 300 T4 cells/ul whatever the antigen used. For patients whose T4 cell counts were between 300 and 600/ul, no or low response was observed in 72% with tetanus toxoid and in only 17% with herpes. These figures were 57% and 25% for tetanus toxoid and herpes respectively in the group of patients with more than 600 T4 cells/ul. Patients with more than 300 T4 cells have also been evaluated in a short term follow-up of 12 + 5 months: they were considered as worsened if their T4 cell count decreased by more than 30% and/or if HIV-p24 antigen appeared in their serum. Worsening was observed in 30% of antigen non- or low-responders but only in 17% of the responders. In conclusion, these data indicate:i) that the defect in mitogen responsiveness appears to be the consequence of the quantitative defect in T4 cells as it has been described in AIDS; 2) the loss of antigen responsiveness may occur early in the course of the disease, more markedly in patients with low T4 cells; 3) the kinetics of this defect are different for common and rarely encountered antigens; 4) the trend in the prognostic value of impaired antigen responsiveness needs further studies with longer follow-up. 2048 RELATIVELY PRESERVED PROLIFERATIVE RESPONSES TO PHA AS OPPOSED TO DECREASED PWM RESPONSES IN LYMPHOCYTES FROM HIV-INFECTED SUBJECTS MAY BE DUE TO RELATIVELY PRESERVED CD2 BUT DEFICIENT CD3 RESPONSES. Hofmann B, Jakobsen KD, Dickmeiss E, Platz P, Ryder LP, Pedersen C, Svejgaard A, et al. Tissue Typing Laboratory, University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), Copenhagen. Results: The lymphocyte proliferative responses in 50 control subjects, 184 asymptomatic subjects (II) with antibodies to HIV, and 82 with HIV-related disease or AIDS (IV) showed that the responses to PHA were largely preserved(median 11:71% and IV:40% of the responses of two simultaneously investigated control subjects), whereas the responses to PWM (11:32% and IV:11%) and to candida albicansw ere severely decreased in most subjects with HIV antibodies. Lymphocytes may be stimulated to proliferation via the T3/Ti-complex (T cell receptor/CD3) and via the \"alternative\" pathway (CD2). The PWM response is primarily mediated via the T3/Ti complex, while PHA stimulates both via the T3/Ti complex and via the CD2 pathway. The response induced via the CD2 receptor was investigated on resting T cells, i.e. lymphocytes depleted for macrophages and preactivated cells. Addition of PHA to these cells resulted in expression of IL-2 receptors (CD25) but not in proliferation or IL-2 production, whereas addition of PHA plus sheep red blood cells (SRBC), which bind to the CD2 receptors, caused proliferation and IL-2 production. Addition of PWM+SRBC did not result in proliferation. A comparison of the responses to PHA-SRBC of resting T cells from 12 controls, 19 HIV seropositive persons, and seven patients with AIDS showed that these responses were largely preserved in 19 seropositive men, while it was decreased in the AIDS patients, although all AIDS patients showed clear cut responses. 175 [Page 176](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/174) 2049 JACALIN: A NEW TOOL TO PATIENTS. N. J.L. UA 1172 and Department of Infectious Diseases, Poitiers University Hospital, France. Objective:We have undertaken a study of the proliferative response of human lymphocytes to the lectin jacalin. In normal subjects, we observed a strong stimulation of T but not B cells. Preliminary results showed that this response is particular by the lack of expression of CD25 detected by the anti-Tac antibody and of IL2 release by the CTLL2 assay. This led us to study the proliferative response of lymphocytes from HIV-infected patients. Methods: Jacalin from and fractionated by DEAE-Trisacryl chromatography. The response ( H- T incorporation) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with various clinical forms of HIV-infection to different concentrations of jacalin fractions was compared to that induced by PHA and PWM. Results: A depressed response to jacalin was found in every clinical group. It correlated with both the percentages and absolute numbers of CD4 lymphocytes. In some patients, low or very low jacalin responses contrasted with a normal reactivity to PHA. Conclusion: Jacalin reactivity appears to be potentially a useful marker of T lymphocyte functions in HIV-infected patients. Whether it has a clinical significance will be evaluated from the patients'follow-up.

Objective: To establish whether the immunosupression persists with chronic A-N exposure. Methods: Nine HIV negative, healthy male volunteers inhaled a similar ten dose schedule extended by administering another 4 doses (0.3ml) on 2 days of the next two weeks (14 doses over 3 weeks). Immune function assays included identification of lymphocyte subsets, natural killer cell lytic activity (NK), lymphocyte PWM) and polyclonal induction of IgG and IgM synthesis and were performed on days -7,-3,4,8,11,15 & 18 of A-N exposure and on post A-N days (Dpn) 331 (NK)Lysis(%) 38 + 6 29 + 3 24 + 4 27 + 3* 33 + 3 39 + 4 PWMa 54+13 93+27 69+15 62 + 9 43 + Iga 11+ 4 4+ 1 8+ 3 3 *significant change from baseline Conclusion: A-N induces immunosupression followed by nonspecific immuno-stimulation on cessation.

Notes: 2051 CHARACTERIZATION OF AN HIV-1 INFECTIONENHANCING FACTOR IN HIV-1 SEROPOSITIVE SERA. W. Edward Robinson, Jr., D. C. Montefiori and W. M. Mitchell Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN USA Objective: An activity in HIV-1 seropositive serum enhances HIV-1 infection by decreasing time to viral-induced cytolysis. The objective is to characterize the components which enhance HIV-1 infection and to determine their frequency in seropositive sera. Methods: Serum HIV-1 infection-enhancing activity was analyzed in microtiter infection assays utilizing MT2 cells as targets for infection by the HIV-1 isolates HTLV-IIIB and HTLV-IIIRF. Cytolysis was measured by vital dye uptake as a measure of infection endpoint. Infection-enhancing activity was characterized by heat inactivation (60~C, 1 hr.), cobra venom factor (CVF) inactivation, complement component deficient sera, and protein-A sepharose chromatography Results: 11/16 patients tested had enhancing activity that overrode neutralizing activity. Activity was removed by heating at 600C for one hour. Activity was restored by mixing inactivated HIV-1 serum 1:1 with normal, fresh serum or complement Clq deficient serum. Guinea pig serum, complement C3 and factor B deficient sera could not substitute for normal serum. Protein-A chromatography removed the heat-stable component, CVF removed Conclusions: The HIV-1 infection-enhancing activity of HIV1 serum is widespread, can override virus neutralization and is composed of two components: one an immunoglobulin and one the alternate pathway of complement. 2052 POTENTIAL PROGNOSTIC VALUE OF HIV-1 INFECTION-ENHANCING ANTIBODY IN HIV-1 SEROPOSITIVE SERUM. W. Edward Robinson, Jr., D. C. Montefiori and W. M. Mitchell Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN USA Objective: To identify the role of HIV-1 infection-enhancing antibody in HIV-1 pathogenesis. Methods: Serum drawn annually for 6 years from an HIV-1 seropositive individual was assayed for immunoglobulin by ELISA, virus neutralization, and infection-enhancing activities. Serum from an additional patient drawn every two months for six months was also assayed for enhancing and neutralizing titers. Virus neutralization was performed by incubating heat-inactivated (1 hr. 600C) serum with HIV-1 for one hour prior to addition of MT2 cells. Infectionenhancement was determined by mixing serum 1:1 with complement serum before addition to virus. MT2 cells were added after one hour at 37~C. Cell viability was determined by vital dye uptake. Results: In the first patient ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence titers were negative in 1982, peaked in 1983 and fell until 1987. Neutralization titers peaked in 1984 - 85 and fell in 1986 and 1987. Enhancing titers increased from 0 in 1982 to peak (1:64) in 1987. The second patient who progressed from ARC to AIDS to death in six months had falling neutralization and enhancing titers. More importantly, his HIV-1 neutralizing titer dropped to zero in the presence of complement after four months. Conclusion: Infection-enhancing titers increased although ELISA and virus neutralizing titers (total anti-HIV-1 immunoglobulin) decreased in one patient over a period of 5 years. In a second patient with a rapid course, HIV-1 neutralizing ability in the presence of complement fell to zero before death. His infection enhancing titer fell as well. Thus, infection-enhancement and complement may play a role in disease progression. Further patients will be studied prior to the conference. 176 [Page 177](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/175) 2053 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN T CELL COLONY FORMATION AND CD4 LYMPHOCYTES IN HIV ANTIBODY POSITIVE HOMOSEXUALS Alan Winkelstein, LA Kingsley, H Hawk, Pitt Men's Study University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. Objective. T cell colony formation (TCC) has been shown to be depressed at all stages of HIV infection. The present studies investigated the relationship between TCC and CD4 cell number. Methods. 328 homosexual men were evaluated, using techniques previously described (J. Immunol 134:151, 1985). Based on CD4 cell counts, they were stratified into 4 groups: Group I- Ab(-); II Group 6.5 10.8* 6.9 * Significantly different from Group I. Conclusions. The progressive decrease in the TCC/CD4 ratio indicates that HIV infection causes a functional defect in residual lymphocytes. Further, the increased value in TCC+IL-2/CD4 cells in Group III subjects suggests that the abnormality results from an initial failure of IL-2 secreting cells rather than a deficiency in T colony precursors. 2054 2-MERCAPTOETHANOL ENHANCES T CELL COLONY FORMATION IN AIDS AND ARC Elinor M Levy, J Wu, P Black Boston University School of Medicine One contributing factor to the loss of T cells in AIDS may be the impaired ability of T cell precursors to expand, as reflected in a decreased ability of patient cells to form T cell colonies in agar (T-CFU). We and others have noted such a defect in people with AIDS and ARC, and have found that suppressor cells and suppressive plasma contribute to decreased T-CFU formation. We had also noted that the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol (2 -ME) could enhance colony formation. We report here that 2-ME can partially reverse the defect in T-CFU formation by overcoming the effect of suppressor cells and suppressive patient plasma. In a group of 10 AIDS patients with opportunistic infections, T-CFU formation was initially 43.9 + 10.0% (mean + SE) that of control levels. 2-ME caused an increase of 212.4 + 34.8% in TCFU formation. T-CFU by control cells in the presence of patient plasma increased by 285.2 + 67.0% when 2-ME was added. Similar data were obtained with 13 ARC patients. Suppressor cell activity from 4 AIDS and 3 ARC patients decreased from 41.0 + 6.4% to 8.5 + 2.6% when 2-ME was added (t = 5.0, p<0.001). The data suggest that antioxidants such as 2-ME may be useful in treatment protocols to enhance T cells numbers in patients with AIDS or ARC. Notes: 2055 NON-LYMPHOID DENDRITIC CELLS AS IN-VIVO VIRAL TARGETS AND RESERVOIRS IN HIV INFECTION John A. Armstrong, R. Home, P.U. Cameron Royal Perth Hospital, Wellington St., Perth 6000, Western Australia. Objective. To elucidate the status of non-lymphocytic dendritic cells (DC) in the pathogenesis of HIV infection. Methods. Correlative immunological and ultrastructural studies, and in-situ hybridization for viral RNA, were performed with nodal biopsy among 87 local and referred cases; arising from sexual, I-V contamination and breast feeding modes of transmission. Results. Substantial accumulations of HIV particles occurred regularly among follicular dendritic cells (FDC) in germinal centres of PGL nodes examined at the stage of follicular hyperplasia. Overt infection and lysis of FDC themselves coincided with commencing follicular involution and loss. Virus can be detected prior to development of PGL. Thus, abundant intranodal FDC-associated virions were the first convincing evidence of active infection in an infant of 11 months exposed to infection postnatally through breast feeding; likewise in another (adult) case, presenting with a solitary palpable node prior to seroconversion. Migratory Langerhans cells were increasingly prominent in the paracortex as follicular involution progressed. Although vulnerable to HIV infection, neither they or resident interdigitating dendritic cells, nor DC isolated from the blood, constituted viral reservoirs comparable to the germinal centre FDC. Conclusion. Fixed tissue and migratory DC populations, with limited CD4 expression, are among prime targets of HIV in vivo. To prevent destruction of antigen-presenting FDC, effective antivirals will need to act in early stages of the infection. 2056 Infection of peripheral blood ^ dendritic cells (DC) by HIV S. Patterson, S. Knight, J. Gross, P. Bedford Clinical Research Centre, Harrow, U.K. Objective To examine the susceptibility of bone marrow derived DCs to HIV infection Methods Preparations of peripheral blood from normal donors were enriched for DCs and then infected with the IIIB strain of HIV. After culturing for up to 14 days, they were examined by electron microscopy or processed for in situ hybridization to detect viral DNA and RNA. Uninfected DC preparations were labelled by the immunogold technique to detect T4 antigen. Results HIV budding from the surface of DCs was observed by electron microscopy 5 days after infection. Multinucleate cells were rare in infected cultures. Virus was never seen budding from macrophages, the main contaminating cell type in these preparations. By immunogold labelling a low level T4 antigen was detected on approximately 14% of the DCs. A greater number of cells were found to be positive for viral DNA than for RNA by in situ hybridization whilst in persistently infected H9 cells there was no difference between the percentage of cells labelling for RNA and DNA. Conclusions Bone marrow derived DCs are susceptible to in vitro infection with HIV. In situ hybridization studies suggest that some cells may become latently infected. As a consequence of HIV infection antigen presentation may become impaired and thus could contribute to immunosuppression seen in AIDS. A-12 177 [Page 178](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/176) 2057 LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF IMMUNOLOGIC MARKERS AND PROGRESSION OF HIV INFECTION IN HEMOPHILIC MEN. K. Raska, Jr., H.C. Kim, E.G. Martin, K. Raska III, J. Raskova and P. Saidi. UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ 08854, U.S.A. A prospective five year study of immunologic parameters was performed in a group of 44 HIV infected hemophilic men together with retrospective analysis of their frozen plasma for HIV markers. Fourteen of the subjects developed AIDS, 11 generalized lymphadenopathy and 19 remained asymptomatic. Both asymptomatic patients and those with lymphadenopathy have shown a comparable decrease of CD4 cells; lymphadenopathy patients had a higher number particularly of the CD8+, Leu 7+ subset. There was no difference in the number of NK cells or B cells, in the expression of IL-2 receptor and HLA-DR antigen on T lymphocytes, or in the mitogenic lymphocyte responses in vitro between asymptomatic and lymphadenopathy groups. Patients in the AIDS group showed a further decrease in the number of CD4 cells prior to development of AIDS. All but two AIDS patients had a low level of Ab to HIV p24 antigen long before AIDS developed; a low level of p24 Ab was also seen in 6 out of 11 subjects with lymphadenopathy but only in 3 out of 19 asymptomatic subjects. The levels of Abs to gp41 and gp 120 HIV antigens were similar in all three groups. The frequency of HIV antigenemia was highest in AIDS patients. We conclude that the relatively best prognosis in our patient population was associated with a high level of p24 antibody. 2058 SEROLOGICAL AND IMMUNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN RELATION TO DEVELOPMENT HIVINFECTED SWEDISH HAEMOPHILIACS Blenda Laboratory, *Malm6 Hospital, Malmb, ***Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm and ****Sahlgrenska Hospital, GBteborg. Objective. To determine possible prognostic markers of HIV disease in haemophiliacs. Methods. HIV-1 antigen was determined with a commercial ELISA (Abbott) and antibodies to p24 by Western blotting. T cell subsets were determined by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies. Results. In June 1987, 43 out of 90 HIV-1-infected haemophiliacs were still symptomfree of HIV disease. 18 had developed persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and 23 patients other HIV-related symptoms. Six patients had AIDS. Markedly lower numbers of T4-cells were seen one year, but not two years, before the onset of HIV-related symptoms or AIDS compared to the asymptomatic and PGL patients who showed a slower decrease of T4-cells. HIV antigen was present and p24 antibodies lacking in 12% and 5% of asymptomatic subjects, in 11% and 11% of PGL patients, in 26% and 22% of patients with other HIV-related symptoms and in 4/6 and 2/6 AIDS patients, respectively. Conclusion. The decrease of T4-cells was a prognostic marker for HIV-disease. The presence of HIV antigen and absence of p24 antibodies were related to more severe disease. Notes: 2059 CD4 PEPTIDE BLOCKS FUSION BETWEEN HIV INFECTED MACROPHAGES (MO) AND UNINFECTED CD4 POSITIVE T CELLS S. Crowe*, J. Mills*, J. Kirihara*, J. Lifson**, R. Sweet***, M. Hospital; **GeneLabs, Redwood City, California; ***Smith, Kline & French Laboratories, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Objective. To test whether fusion between HIV infected mn and uninfected CD4 positive T lymphoma cells (VB) can be blocked, using a synthetic soluble CD4 peptide (SK&F) or monoclonal antibody directed against CD4. Methods. We labelled infected mo with fluorescein (green) and VB cells with rhodamine (red) to test for multinucleated giant cell (MNGC) formation by fusion. Syncytia (red & green) were scored after 48 hours incubation, by fluorescence microscopy. Results. HIV infected mn fuse with uninfected VB lymphcma cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes to form MNGCs. HIV infected m5 also fuse with uninfected mo. Fusion can be inhibited with CD4 peptide (50 ug/ml) and CD4 monoclonal antibody (S3.5, provided by E. Engleman) at 20 ug/ml. Conclusion. Fusion between HIV infected mo and VB cells is blocked by both CD4 peptide and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies. The fusion between HIV infected m9 and uninfected CD4 positive T cells may provide a mechanism for CD4 lymphocyte depletion in vivo. Conceivably, fusion of infected and uninfected m0 would expand the in vivo reservoir of HIV infected mO. Inhibition of fusion by the synthetic CD4 peptide may provide a novel approach for future antiretroviral therapy. 2060 HIV-MEDIATED NEUROTOXICITY OVERCOME BY TROPHIC FACTORS SECRETED BY MONOCYTES. Howard E. Gendelman, Monte S. Meltzer, John Van Arnold* Susan K. Burgess*, Walter Reed Army Inst. Res., Washington, DC and *Glaxo Res. Labs., Chapel Hill, NC Objective. Examine the role of HIV-infected macrophages in pathogenesis of AIDS encephalopathy. Methods. Neurons isolated from fetal rat brain survive < 3 days in serum-free medium and serve as an assay for trophic and toxic factors in culture fluids from cytokine-treated, HIV-infected human monocytes or lymphocytes: recombinant granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor (rGM-CSF), interleukins 1 or 2. Neuron cultures were stained at intervals and examined for cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. -Results. Culture fluids from monocytes treated with rCSF-1 or rCSF-1 and rGM-CSF for 2 to 3 wks markedly increased neuronal viability and differentiation: neurons in these cultures survived > 4 wks and displayed large numbers of complex dendritic processes. Cytokines alone or fluids from monocytes cultured in control medium or interleukins were ineffective as were culture fluids from PHA stimulated lymphocytes. The monocyte-derived neurotrophic factor was heat-labile with a Mr of - 25,000. Culture fluids from HIVinfected lymphoblast or monocyte cultures were toxic to these neuronal cultures. HIV-induced toxicity could be partially overcome by the monocyte-derived neurotrophic factor. Conclusions. AIDS encephalopathy may be a sequella of direct neurotoxicity by HIV and altered production of neurotrophic factors by infected macrophages 178 [Page 179](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/177) 2061 HIV-1 INFECTION OF A RABBIT MACROPHAGE CELL LINE: ABSENCE OF RT ACTIVITY IN INFECTED CELL SUPERNATANTS Henrietta Kulaga*, Thomas M. Folks**, Immunoregulation, #Lab of Molecular Microbiology, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD. Objective. To study events following HIV-1 infection of an SV40 transformed rabbit macrophage cell line. Methods. An SV40 transformed cell line, MFA, shown to be a rabbit macrophage by molecular, cytochemical and functional criteria, was infected with high titered HIV-1 stock. Infection was monitored by RT activity in cell free supernatants, Western blot analyses of cell lysates, detection of viral DNA and RNA by Southern and Northern blots, electron microscopy and by infection of susceptible human indicator cells with cell free supernatants. Results. No RT activity was detected in MFA supernatants although human indicator cells were infected with these same supernatants. All other criteria for infection including analyses for viral protein and nucleic acid were positive for HIV-1 infected MFA cells and Western blots revealed all expected viral proteins including reverse transcriptase. Levels of viral protein and RNA reached peak values at day 10-14 following infection. It was shown that supernatants from noninfected MFA cultures contained factor(s) that inhibited RT activity in cultures with known activity levels. Conclusions: A rabbit macrophage cell line supported infection by HIV-1 although no RT activity was present in the supernatant. Supernatants from noninfected MFA cells inhibited RT activity but did not block passage of infection to susceptible cells. 2062 SPLENIC AND PERITONEAL MACROPHAGES (MO) PROVIDE A MAJOR RESERVOIR OF HIV IN VIVO S. Crcwe, J. Mills, J. Kirihara, P. Lekas, M. McGrath University of California, San Francisco; San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, California 94110 Objective. To determine whether HIV infected tissue m0 constitute an important viral reservoir in vivo. Methods. We have isolated mg from splenic tissue from 6 ARC patients, and peritoneal fluid from one HIV infected patient (sampled on 3 occasions). Cells were examined by immunocytofluorographic analysis on the day of isolation for HIV p24 antigen expression. Sufficient splenic m0 were obtained from 2 individuals to follow the time course of p24 antigen expression in these in vivoinfected cells in culture. Results. On the day of isolation, 3-38% of m0 expressed HIV p24 (mean 13%). The time course of HIV p24 expression showed an increase from 3 to 34% in donor 1, and 5 to 28% in donor 2, by day 4 of culture. This differs markedly to the time course following in vitro infection of mr, in which peak HIV p24 antigen expression does not occur until day 10-14. Thus the peak in the in vivo infected m0 time course cannot be explained by de novo infection in vitro. It is likely that these cells were latently infected and activated by either the isolation procedure or through released cytokines. Less than 0.5% of lymphocytes isolated from the same tissue expressed HIV p24. Conclusion. Our data show that tissue m0 provide a major reservoir of HIV in vivo, and emphasize the importance of testing for efficacy of potential antiretroviral agents in this cell population. Notes: 2063 MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF HIV INFECTION OF MACROPHAGES Crowe*, J. Mills*, M. McGrath*, G. Reyes** *University of California, San Francisco; San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, California, **GeneLabs, Redwood City, California Objective. To determine the form of HIV genome in infected m0 and to estimate the number of copies of viral DNA per cell. Methods. MO were infected with HIV-DV for 15 days at which time 33% of cells were expressing HIV p24 (by cytofluorographic analysis). DNA was extracted from 5 x 106 m0 and a Southern blot of this DNA was probed with the 3' half of the full length HXB-2 HIV gene clone. Results. In contrast to chronically infected T cell lines, in which the viral DNA is present in a predominantly integrated form, stably infected m0 contained integrated and unintegrated forms of HIV gencme in approximately equivalent amounts, confirmed by Hind III cleavage of m0 DNA. By comparison of intensity of hybridization with molecular standards, we found that HIV-infected m0 contained 10-30 viral copies per cell. RNA dot blots demonstrated no difference in the time course of U937 (monocyte cell line) and human m0 HIV RNA expressed following infection. Further molecular studies are in progress. Conclusion. HIV infected mo contain integrated and unintegrated forms of HIV genome in equivalent proportions; there are 10-30 viral copies per infected cell. 2064 IMMUNOLOGIC FUNCTION OF HIV INFECTED MACROPHAGES F LeSane, S Gardner, M Popovic, D Mann National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA Cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage have been shown to be infected with HIV in vivo and can be infected in vitro. Since one function of these cells is antigen presentation, we sought to determine if this function was altered in HIV-1 infected macrophages. Macrophages were isolated from peripheral blood by adherence and infected with HIV-1. HIV-1 infected macrophage (I-macs) stimulated allogeneic T cells to a lesser but not significant extent than uninfected macrophages (U-macs) as measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Tetanus toxoid (TT) responding T cells were exposed to autologous TT pulsed I-macs and U-macs for 24 hours; T cells removed and cultured with U-macs from the same donor. 3H-thymidine incorporation was equivalent with both U-macs and I-macs. Infection of T cells measured by RT activity was greater in T cells exposed to TT I-macs than I-macs without TT. When T cells were cultured continuously for 14 days in the presence of TT pulsed I-macs, no TT response was observed. However, HIV infection was maximal at 7 days compared to 14 days with non-TT treated I-macs. Immunopurified gpl20 also inhibited TT response. These results show that HIV infection of macrophages does not alter antigen presentation, suppression of antigen response may be related to the effects of gpl20 on CD4 bearing cells and the kinetics of HIV infection of T cells is enhanced when antigen is presented with HIV. 179 [Page 180](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/178) 2065 DEFECT MACROPHAGE FUNCTIONS Rollag',S.S. Freland' *Institute of Bacteriology and **Medical Department A, National Hospital, Oslo, Norway Monocytes were cultured for 1 day (mo) and 10 days (monocyte-derived macrophages, MDM) from patients with HIV infection CDC group II,III, IVC1 (AIDS), HIV seronegative homosexual men (SNHM) and blood donors (BD). Cell number and protein were assayed at day 1 and 10. The oxidative burst (OB) was measured as reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) in response to zymosan and PMA and the effect of interferon (IFN) a,(3 and r on NBT reduction was assayed. The MDM number, cell protein and OB was reduced in the majority of AIDS patients. In gr.III, cell protein was reduced in half of the patients. MDM number and protein were reduced in patients with p24 antigen in serum and correlated lymphocyte count. The response to IFNs was unaffected in all groups. No difference in mo functions was observed between any group.

Methods: Liver samples from 23 patients seropositive for HIV1 (SIDA: 16, ARC: 5, LAS: 1, unclassified: 1) were obtained by percutaneous biopsy (14 cases) or at autopsy (9 cases). Cryostat sections were labelled with a three-stage indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Monoclonal antibodies against 3a (Becton Dickinson) were used as primary antisera. Lymph nodes from infected individuals and liver sections from seronegative subjects were respectively used as positive and negative controls. Results: Monoclonal anti p24/p55 produced liver cell staining in 6/23. It consisted in 4 cases (2 pre-, 2 post-mortem) of a diffuse cytoplasmic staining of numerous Kupffer cells. In 2 further autopsy specimens, granular staining of scattered cells was shown. Positive cells included sinusoidal cells as well as, for 1 case, histiocytes in a granuloma. In addition, in all cases the CD4 molecule was localized, using leu 3a antibody, on endothelial sinusoisal cells. Conclusion: These results suggest HIV infection of non parenchymal liver cells. CD4 molecule was identified on endothelial cells. The staining obtained with the anti-P24 seems mainly localized in Kuppfer cells. Thus, HIV infection of this monocyte-macrophage cell type might be involved in some liver pathological lesions (such as sinusoidal abnormalities) in AIDS. Notes: 2067 INFECTION AND REPLICATION OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS-1 (HIV-1) IN PURIFIED CD4 NEGATIVE PRECURSOR CELLS FROM NORMAL HUMAN BONE MARROW Thomas M Folks*, S Kessler**, M Cottler-Fox****, J Justement*, J Med. Res. Inst., Bethesda, MD, ***Geo. Wash. Univ. Sch. Med., Wash., DC, ****Georgetown Univ. Sch. Med., Wash., DC. Objective. Since the reservoir of virus containing cells in patients infected with HIV-1 has not been determined and may be of nonlymphoid origin we investigated the possibility that highly purified normal human bone marrow precursor cells might be susceptible to viral infection and support replication. Methods. Purified normal human bone marrow cells were prepared from cadaveric marrows by positive selection using the monoclonal antibody K6.1 (CD34). The population isolated CD3) or monocyte (Leu M3) blood elements and comprised less than 1% of the starting population. The cells were infected with high MOI (1:1) HIV-1. Cells were monitored for HIV by reverse transcriptase (RT), electron microscopy (EM) and immunofluorescence (IFA). Results. Positively selected CD34 cells were found to express increased amounts of RT activity beginning at 35 days post infection (PI) and continued to produce RT for over 2 months. Approximately 5% of the cells were IFA positive for HIV antigens at 14 days PI. EM studies revealed greater than 50% of the cells at 2 months PI had viral particles assembling and accumulating at the plasma membane and within cytoplasmic compartments. Histochemical and surface phenotype analysis revealed that these cells were mostly of promyelomonocytic origin. Conclusions. These results indicate that (1) bone marrow cells devoid of mature blood elements are susceptible to HIV-1 infection (2) myeloid/monocyte precursors are capable of replicating HIV-1 (3) the bone marrow may serve as a reservoir of HIV-1 infection. 2068 MONOCYTE-CYTOLYTIC FUNCTION IS MEDIATED BY CD4, AND IS INHIBITED BY HIV. RJ Debs, J Krowka, D Stites, EN Brunette, N Diizgiines, and R Philip, UCSF Medical Center, San Francisco, CA. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) can selectively lyse transformed or virally infected cells, while sparing normal cells. We investigated the influence of target cell infection with HIV on PBM-mediated lysis of the CD4+ human tumor cell lines, HUT-78, H-9 and U937. PBM, isolated from normal human donors by gradient separation and plastic adherence, were activated with IFN-y or IL-2, and their ability to lyse 5lCr-labeled tumor cell targets was measured. Activated PBM effectively lysed HUT-78, U937, and H-9 cells, but non-transformed CD4+ T cell clone K8.3. Lysis of all three tumor cell lines was substantially inhibited (p < 0.05) by infection with either the SF2 (ARV) or HTLV3B strains of HIV. This effect was not due to impaired PBM viability, since PBM pre-incubated with HIV retained full capacity to lyse tumor cells. Pretreatment of HIV-infected target tumor cells with Actinomycin D largely restored target lysis by PBM. Inhibition of PBM-mediated lysis was since or vaccinia-infected HUT-78 or H-9 cells were effectively lysed of either the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (Leu 3a) or HIV during the effector phase of the assay substantially reduced PBM-mediated lysis of uninfected HUT-78 or Identical concentrations of anti-HLA-ABC, anti-HLA-DR, or IgG isotype control antibodies did not inhibit PBM-mediated target cell lysis. We conclude that the CD4 molceule plays an essential role in mediating PBM cytolysis, and that HIV infection significantly inhibits PBM function. HIV may interfere with CD4-mediated effector-target cell binding, or may act via an immunosuppressive retroviral envelope protein. 180 [Page 181](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/179) 2069 INFECTIBILITY BY FRG) Objective. To present Reverse Transcriptase (RT) data from cultures of HIV infected Mo/M% using different HIV strains, different maturation states of Mo/Mo as well as chemotherapeuticals. Methods. Human blood-born Mo/Mi were cultivated on hydropioTFi membranes described Andreesen, J. Immunol. Methods, 56: 295-304 (1983)). Mo/M~' were infected either in tubes wTfh hydrophobic surfaces or in microtiterplates (24 wells) after different maturation times. Results. Hydrophobic membrane derived Mo/MO are easily infected by HIV. RT activities in supernatants (SN) of these cultures range from 5 000 cpm to 70 000 cpm/ml SN. Virus production in infected Mo/M cultures can be demonstrated for several weeks. Conclusion. Due to the likely role of Mo/MJ in the pathogenesis of AIDS there is anurgent need for suitable in vitro systems to study the behaviour of HIV infected Mo/FW cultures. With our system we can not only characterize HIV infected Mo/FM but we can also use this model for the screening of chemotherapeuticals. 2070 ENHANCEMENT OF HIV REPLICATION II HUMAN MONOCYTES BY LOW TITERS OF ANTIHIV ANTIBODIES of Pathology,Uppsala University ~Department of Virology,Karolinska Institute HIV grows in nonocytes and T lymphocytes if CD4 is present on the surface and the cells are of human origin.Entry of the virus may also take place via other means than CD4,notably via?c receptors or complement receptors on phaoocvtic monocytes.Usina normal blood monocytes or U937 lines and subclones we have explored the capacity of HIV seropositive sera to inhibit or enhance HIV replication in these cells.Car wNas taken to ensure that dilutions of HIV sera into normal human serum would nake results depend on specific immune \"factors\" in the HIV serooositive serum samoles.The results sho7 that when HIV-seropositive serum is diluted in normal serum high concentrations will inhibit HIV replication whereas lower concentrations mostly induce enhancement of replication.Our data then point to the possibility that also in vivo anti-HIV antibodies under certain conditions may have neaative impacts,that is to help HIV replication.Data will be nresented to demonstrate the actual nature of the enhancina molecules,conditions necessary for viral enhancement to take place and the role of CD4 under these conditions. Notes: 2071 SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HIV DURING IN VITRO DIFFERENTIATION MACROPHAGES F differentiation of macrophages(MA) from blood monocytes(MO)correspond to modifications in susceptibility to HIV? Methods Adherence purified MO were cultured for more than 4 wks in 50%Human Serum RPMI 1640 without additional growth factors. Cytoplasmic and membrane differentiation markers(LeuM5,Paml FCR,Leu3a,OKT4)and HIV binding revealed by anti gpllO mAbs,were monitored.Susceptibility to HIV and kinetics of virus replication were analysed Results MO differentiated within 4 days into MA. CD4 expression, very weak in MO, increased 8X and remained stable until day 14.HIV binding increased in parallel but, unlike CD4+ lymphocytes,it was not inhibited by anti-gpll0. Using a limiting dilution plaque assay, which determi nes the frequency of infected cells (FOIC), we observed that after HIV exposure FOIC of MA was 100 fold higher than FOIC of MO.HIV replication in cell culture was not inhibited using either Leu3a or anti-gpll0 mAbs. Conclusion Increase of susceptibility to HIV during maturation of MO to MA parallels differentiation markers expression including CD4. However HIV penetration into MO/MA may involve alternative pathway independent from gpllO-CD4 interaction. 2072 INTERRELATIONSHIP OF MONOCYTE/MACROPHAGE CD4 ANTIGEN EXPRESSION AND P., Mathijs J. and Cunningham A.L. ICPMR, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Monocytes/macrophages are one of the major targets for HIV infection in vivo. The expression of CD4 antigen receptor for the virus on the surface of monocytes was variable with 65%-90% of cells in 46 subjects being positive by dual staining flow cytometry. In 6 subjects, there was fluctuation in the proportion of CD4+ monocytes with time. On adherence to plastic (not teflon), a marked decrease in CD4 expression was observed between one and 24 hours. No CD4 expression by 5 day adherent macrophages could be detected using a battery of commercial anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies in flow cytometry or direct immunofluorescence. Leu M3 and OKM5 surface antigens increased in density over the five days. However CD4 mRNA levels by slot-blot and Northern hybridization remained constant throughout the five day period, suggesting a posttranscriptional down-regulation of CD4. HIV infection of recently plastic adherent purified monocytes and five day adherent macrophages with two fresh HIV isolates showed two different kinetic patterns. HIV antigen and RT levels in infected monocyte cultures remained high for 3-4 weeks before detachment and necrosis of the cells occurred. Infection of macrophages generated much lower HIV levels and in 4 of 8 cultures these declined to undetectable over two weeks leaving persisting viable macrophages. Hence the level of HIV replication approximated CD4 expression. Whether HIV enters 5 day macrophages via CD4 receptors via another mechanism is currently being studied by blocking with anti-CD4a monoclonal antibodies. 181 [Page 182](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/180) 2073 TOWARDS CULTURED KAPOSI'S SARCOMA CELLS. R Philip, C Lindquist, and R Debs, UCSF Medical Center, San Francisco, CA. AIDS is complicated by the frequent occurrence of severe opportunistic infections, and an aggressive form of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). A variety of defects in cell-mediated immunity, including monocyte/macrophage dysfunction, have been reported in association with AIDS. We have examined the ability of cytokine-activated peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) from AIDS patients to lyse both their autologous fresh KS tumor cells, and a cultured KS tumor cell line originally derived from a biopsy of a KS tumor. Cytokineactivated PBM from both normal controls and from AIDS patients showed significant and comparable enhancement of tumor cytotoxicity when either WEHI-164 or the KS cell line were used as targets in a 51Cr lysis assay. IL-2, IFN-y and TNF each enhanced PBM from AIDS patients. However, when fresh KS tumor cells were used as targets in the cytotoxicity assay, PBM from several AIDS patients showed enhanced anti-KS cytotoxicity compared to PBM from normal controls. Monocytes from the other KS patient did not kill autologous fresh KS cells. Cytokine-activated PBM from normal donors did not show enhanced cytotoxicity when fresh KS tumor cells were used as targets. Therefore, substantial enhancement of monocyte tumoricidal function in AIDS patients may be achievable by appropriate cytokine therapy. In addition, in vitro PBM tumor cytolytic assays should be correlated with in AIDS patients. 2074 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS-1 ACTS AS AN ACTIVATION AGENT FOR CIRCULATING HUMAN McCartney-Francis*, Suzanne Wahl* *National Institute of Dental Research, **National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, U.S.A. Objective. To determine the effect of in vitro exposure to HIV-1 on monocyte activation as determined by monokine and cell surface receptor expression. Methods. Human peripheral blood monocytes were purified by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation and then exposed to the monocyte-derived HIV-1 strain Ba-L for one hour. RNA was prepared from HIV-l-exposed and control cells at various time intervals from 2 to 24 hours and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization with the various growth factor probes. Results. HIV-l-exposed monocytes expressed increased steady-state levels of interleukin 1 (ILl) and interleukin 2-receptor (IL2R) mRNA within 6 hours as compared to control cells. Upon further activation of these cells with lipopolysaccharide, no differences in inducible growth factor (IL1, IL2R, transforming growth factor f, tumor necrosis factor) mRNA levels were observed between control and HIV-monocytes. Conclusion. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that circulating monocytes from AIDS patients expressed increased levels of IL2R, class II antigens (HLA-DR), and IL1 mRNA, suggesting the prior in vivo activation of the monocytes. These in vitro studies suggest that HIV-1 is the direct causative agent of the monocyte activation. Notes: 2075 ENHANCED INTERLEUKIN 1 (IL-1) PRODUCTION BY MONOCYTES FROM HIV-1 SEROPOSITIVE SUBJECTS AND A MONOCYTE CELL LINE INFECTED WITH HIV-1. P. Skolnik, B. Kosloff, R. Byington, T. Flynn, M. Hirsch. Infectious Disease Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Ma. 02114. Objective. To determine whether alterations in IL-1 production occur after in-vivo or in-vitro HIV-1 infection of monocytes. Methods. Monocytes (from 3 sources) were cultured for 24 hrs in the presence or absence of endotoxin (1 ug/ml); supernatants were then assayed for IL-1 the bioassay. Monocytes were derived from: 1) 14 seropositive (sero+) subjects and 6 healthy, seronegative controls by adherence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to plastic Labtek slides; 2) acute infection and A4.5 (CD4+, HLA-DR-) HIV-1; mixing of chronically HIV-1 infected A3.5 or A4.5 cells with uninfected cells. Results. Monocytes from 9 of 14 sero+ subjects produced greater amounts of IL-1 than controls; the remaining 5 subjects produced similar amounts of IL-1 compared to controls. Monocyte cell lines A3.5 and A4.5 acutely infected with HIV-1 did not produce more IL-1 than their uninfected counterparts. In contrast, mixing of chronically infected and uninfected A3.5, but not A4.5, cells resulted in enhanced IL-I elaboration. Conclusion. Endotoxin-stimulated monocytes from a majority of sero+ subjects produce more IL-1 than controls. In-vitro experiments with monocyte cell lines suggest that cell-cell contact in the presence of class II major histocompatibility antigens (HLA-DR) may play a role in this enhancement. 2076 ALTERATION OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS-1 (HIV-1) EXPRESSION IN PROMONOCYTE CLONES BY INTERFERON-y Folks*, Duh*, A Rabson**, AS Fauci* *NIH, Bethesda, MD Objective. We have evaluated the regulatory influences of recombinant human IFN-y on HIV-1 expression in chronically infected virus producing and non-producing promonocyte clones. Methods. Two procedures were followed: (1) one system employeed the use of constitutive reverse transcriptase (RT) producing clones. (2) Another used the non-producing latently infected U1 clone which could be induced to produce RT following treatment with phorbol myristate Levels of intracellular viral mRNA and protein expression were determined by dot blot analysis using viral DNA probes and by western blot analysis of cell lysates using pooled AIDS sera respectively. Results. It was found that Ul, when treated only with IFN-y, could be induced to produce low levels of supernatant RT; however, RT production induced by PMA, PHA-sup, or GM-CSF was inhibited by over 75% if the cells were treated simultaneously with IFN-y. Likewise virus expression in the constitutive producing clones when treated with IFN-y alone could also be inhibited by greater than 75%. Finally in order to determine if intracellular viral products were being inhibited concomitantly with viral release, we treated U1 cells with PMA or PMA plus IFN-y and tested for viral mRNA and protein. It was found that both mRNA and protein levels were only moderately altered following IFN-y treatment. Conclusion. These studies indicate that IFN-y has potent suppressive effects on both inducible and constitutive HIV producing promonocyte lines. And, the suppressive effects observed can best be explained by incomplete assembly of the virus particle at the cell membrane. 182 [Page 183](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/181) 2077 HIV-1 REPLICATION IN PROMONOCYTIC CELLS U937: A ROLE FOR IFN-a Katherine Mac. Gazzolo 69372 Lyon Cedex 08, France. Objective. To examine whether interferon a (IFN-ot) is involved in Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage. Methods. Cells used in this study were the promonocytic cell line U937 (100% CD4+) and the lymphoblastoid 1h at 37~C) with cell-free supernatant harvested from HIV-1 (LAV strain) infected CEM cells, both cell types were resuspended in fresh medium. When needed, an antiserum against IFN-a or a monoclonal antibody to IFN-a was added to the culture at different concentrations. The expression of HIV-1 p24 antigen was then determined by indirect immunofluorescence, at regular intervals. Results. The expression of p24 was detected in more than 95% of HIV-1 infected U937 cells, 30 to 75 days after infection, depending on the viral inoculum. Conversely, the same percentage of HIV-1 infected H9 cells were found p24 positive, 10 to 14 days after HIV-1 infection. When polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against IFN-a was added to the medium of HIV-1 infected U937 cells, it were observed that the expression of p24 was detected earlier in those cultures than in untreated infected cells. In contrast, no effect was observed when the infected U937 cells were treated by an anti-IFN-y serum. Thus, one effect of anti-IFN-a is to significantly reduce the length of the period between infection and the apparition of the first p24 positive cells. Results of a typical experiment are shown in the following table. 2078 PERSISTENCE OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) IN HUMAN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONOCYTES Guido Poli, C Wilson, TM Folks, C Fox, F Massari, AS Fauci, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD Objective. To evaluate in vitro the nature of HIV infection of human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM). Methods. PBM from 8 healthy donors were cultured in adherence conditions in the presence of 10% human AB serum for more than 40 days; non-adherent cells were extensively removed. The adherent cells, virtually 100% monocyte-derived macrophages, were challenged at different times of culture with a laboratory-adapted strain of HIV. In addition, PBM from 16 HIV-infected patients at various stages of disease were maintained in similar in vitro conditions. Cell cultures were studied at different times in terms of cytopathic effect (CPE: syncytia formation and/or cell death) and presence of reverse transcriptase activity (RT) in the culture supernatant. Results. Healthy donor PBM exposed in vitro to HIV do not generally show evidence of infection, in terms of CPE or RT activity. However, both the cells and their supernatants after more than 40 days, could still efficiently infect allogeneic phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated-peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). In addition, when PBM obtained from HIV-infected subjects were cultured for prolonged periods of time, significant supernatant RT levels were detectable in only 1 of 16 patients tested, whereas the presence of infectious virus in the majority of cultures was revealed by the addition of PHA-stimulated PBL. Conclusion. These observations indicate that human circulating monocytes can harbor HIV for prolonged periods, without evidence of cell death and/or viral destruction or inactivation. This strongly supports the hypothesis that mononuclear phagocytes can serve as a chronic HIV reservoir, disseminating the virus to susceptible targets throughout the body, such as CD4+ lymphocytes and the brain. Days after infection 21 26 35 47 57 59 69 75 p24-.ositive U937 cells.% untreated treated with anti-lFN-a(50U/mnl) 0 0 0 0,5 0 7,5 0,5 40 2,5 90 10 95 80 95 95 ND Conclusion. These results suggest that the replication of HIV-1 in U937 cells is specifically restricted by IFN-a. The further analysis of the precise mechanisms of IFN-a action on HIV-1 replication should contribute to clarify the role of mononudear phagocytes in AIDS M Popovic**, CL SW Wahl*, *National Institute of Dental Research, **National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. Objective. To determine whether HIV-1 infection alters respiratory burst activity by human monocytes. Methods. Monocytes were isolated from AIDS and control subjects. Also, normal monocytes were exposed in vitro to a macrophage-derived strain of HIV-1 (Ba-L), and infection was confirmed by reverse transcriptase activity. Respiratory burst activity measured by 02 reduction of ferricytochrome c was determined for patient monocytes and for in vitro HIV-1-exposed monocytes for 24 hrs following the addition of either buffer (spontaneous 0 production) or f-met-Leu-Phe, gamma interferon or PHA (stimulated 02 production). Results. Compared to control monocytes, AIDS monocytes exhibited a significant reduction in spontaneous and stimulated 02 production (p<0.02). To determine if this reduction was associated with HIV-1 or other in vivo factors, monocytes exposed to HIV-1 in vitro were assayed for 02 production. In comparison to shamexposed monocytes, HIV-exposed monocytes exhibited an initial increase in spin taneous (but not stimulated) 02 production on day 1. However, by day 7 a dramatic reduction in both spontaneous and stimulated 02 production was present in the infected monocytes. Conclusion. AIDS monocytes exhibit reduced production of 02, and in vitro exposure of normal monocytes to HIV-1 dimi ishes their capacity to secrete 0. The reduced respiratory burst activity of monocytes from AIDS patients may play a critical role in the increased rate of infections in these patients. 2080 METABOLIC ALTERATIONS IN HIV INFECTED MONOCYTES Alan Landay*, and L Rothberg* *Dept. of Immunology/Microbiology and **Dept. of Medicine, Rush Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois USA Objective. To determine whether a monocytotropic strain of HIV induces changes in cell surface antigens and/or alters oxidative burst in human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) by flow cytometric analysis. Method. PBM were obtained from normal donors by centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque and further purified by lel adherence. PBM were routinely 95-98% pure by peroxidase staining, latex injestion and CD14 cell surface staining. PBM were infected with the HIV-DV strain (Gene Labs) and incubated in suspension in burst activity of cells loaded with 2,7 dichlorofluorescin diacetate was measured by acetate (PMA) or aggregated IgG stimulation. Results. Our data showed decreased expression of CRIII (CD11) and FcRI receptors and no change in CD14 expression. Decreased response to aggregated IgG induced oxidative burst activity was alsc seen. Infection in these cultures was demonstrated on day 7 by a p24 antigen captureassay. Uninfected control cultures showed results comparable to freshly isolated cells. Conclusion. These data are consistent v:ith our previous findings of alterations of monocyte function (Blood 68: 127A) in HIV infected patients. Our experimental systen allows us to directly measure effects of HIV on monocyte function. The results suggest that HIV can induce alterations that may be critical to host defense. 183 [Page 184](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/182) 2081 ANALYSIS OF THE SIGNALS TRANSACTIVATING HUMAN MONOCYTES F. Virale, Paris, France Monocytes are a major target cell of HIV infection, and may be an essential reservoir for the virus. In order to evaluate the mechanisms leading to reactivation of the HIV genome in this cell lineage, we have transiently transfected, by either DEAE-dextran or electroporation techniques, the monocytic cell line THP-1 or human adherent circulating monocytes with a LTR-CAT expression vector. CAT activity was assessed in cell lysates 24-48 h after transfection. In non activated cell cultures, basal expression of the LTR was very low. A clear enhancement of CAT synthesis was observed in the hours following cell stimulation with phorbol esters. Various recombinant immunoregulatory molecules were used in this system. Our results suggest that the state of activation and differentiation of monocytes influences the functionning of the HIV-LTR, a conclusion implying that immune responses may modulate HIV replication through the secretion of cytokines. 2082 2082 LFA1 EXPRESSION AND France. Objective: LFA1 (leukocyte function antigen), is a member of a family of adhesion molecules involved in cellcell interactions, strengthening cell attachment. This heterodimeric glycoprotein on lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes and LFA1 expression was investigated on PB and BAL mononuclear cells in 50 patients with AIDS, as well as this of CD3, CD4 and CD8 on mononuclear cells of the same patients. Methods: Classical indirect immunofluorescence techniques were used with LFA1+ cells was decreased on PB lymphocytes as well as on BAL mononuclear cells, respectively 73.3% and 54.4%. In a control series, 100% of PB cells were LFA1+. Among BAL cells, a mean percentage of 77.5 of LFA1+ cells was observed in a series of patients with other pulmonary diseases: asthma, interstitial syndrome and sarcoidosis. No correlation was found when linear regression was used to compare LFA1+ cells percentages between PB and BAL (p=.63). There was no straight relationship either between the percentage of LFA1+ cells and lymphocyte markers. Conclusion: The HIV virus thus appears to induce a significant alteration of the LFA1 molecule, involved in adhesion mechanisms. This could add to the immune deficiency resulting from the disappearance of CD4+ cells. Notes: 2083 OPSONIZATION, AN INFECTION PATHWAY FOR interaction,binding through Fc receptors of HIV coated with specific human IgG could lead to infection of monocytic cells (MO). Methods CD4+lymphoid CEM and MO U937 cells were comparatively infected with HIV preincubated or not with saturating concentrations of purified human anti-HIV IgG,in the presence or the absence (1)In CEM: as expected,either treatement with Leu3a or of virus with HIV IgG interfered with gpllO-CD4 interaction and blocked HIV infection.(2)In U937:infection was only partially inhibited by Leu3a;HIV preincuba tion with IgG that neutralized infection of CEM did not inhibit infection of U937 cells;however when cells were first treated with Leu3a they could not be infected with IgG-coated HIV. Conclusion Since HIV particles are present in phagocytic vesicles,these data indicate that M can indeed ingest opsonized HIV,which can then lead to productive infection. Interaction with CD4 appears nonetheless necessary in this process. 2084 INCREASED PRODUCTION OF PROSTAGLANDINS (PGs)BY General \"Gregorio Marafion\". Madrid. Spain. We analized the plasma levels of PGE2 in a group of drugaddicts with AIDS (n=6) and the synthesis and release of PGs by monocytes from these patients, in order to investigate the possible contribution of these metabolites to immmunosuppression. Plasma concentrations of byciclic PGE2 were determined by RIA (R.C.,Amersham). Processingthe samples under stringent conditions (anticoagulant, ciclooxygenase inhibitor and low temperature) the results showed no significant difference in the PGE2 levels in AIDS group (24+13 pg/ml) as compared with 8 normal controls (28+11pg/ ml). Similar results were obtained using plasma samples after solid phase extraction of PGs. To determine PGs-synthesis and release by monocytes, cultures of platelet-depleted adherent cells (>95% monocytes), were incubated for 4 hours in medium containing[3H]arachidonic acid (Amersham). PGE2 fraction was isolated from culture supernatants (CS) by SEP PACK C18 microcolumns and by silicic acid columns. Our in vitro results show significantly increased production of PGs from AIDS patients (n=3) as compared with 6 healthy controls. PGs secretion was inhibited by adding indomethacin to monocyte cultures (Table): PROSTAGLANDIN RELEASE BY UNSTIMULATED PGs/g protein) protein) 10.1~1.8 20.1~2.0 We also studied the suppressive action of PGs released in CS on the IL-2 production by PHA-stimulated PBMC. The results showed that suppression by CS from AIDS group was about 2-fold greater than that shown by CS from controls. This suppressive effect was eliminated by adding indomethacin to the monocyte cultures. 184 [Page 185](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/183) 2085 INDEPENDENT PREDICTIVE VALUE OF IN VIVO CELLULAR IMMUNE FUNCTION FOR DISEASE PROGRESSION IN HIV SEROPOSITIVE PATIENTS. DL Birx, JL Rhoads, DS Burke, RR Redfield. Walter Reed Army Medical Center and Institute of Research, Wash, D.C. Objective: To develop an anergy panel to 1} evaluate in vivo cellular immune function in HIV seropositive patients, 2} determine correlation with circulatory CD4 {+} cells, and 3} predict HIV disease progression. Methods: 1172 anergy panels and simultaneous CD4 counts were performed in 731 patients. The anergy panel consisted of 0.1cc patients have been followed serially for 12-42 months and observed for clinical evidence of HIV disease Results: Antigen significantly correlated with number r=0.99. Progressive loss of antigen reactivity independently correlated with HIV disease progression. Anergy independently predicted the development of opportunistic infection. Conclusion: This panel provides a clinical parameter that correlates with absolute CD4 number and is predictive of HIV disease progression and development of opportunistic infection. 2086 COMPARISONS OF CONVENTIONAL SKIN TEST AND MULTITEST IN HIV POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS F. Lozada-Nur and M. Conant* *University of California, San Francisco, CA USA Objective. To compare the clinical value of the Multitest with the conventional intradermal skin testing. Methods. Eleven male homosexual patients with AIDS, 2 with generalized lymphadenopathy & 7 healthy non-AIDS homosexual men comprised our group. Their ages ranged from 28 to 52 years (mean, 35 years). All subjects were simultaneously tested with 4 recall antigens in one forearm and the multitest in the other. T4/T8 ratios were available in 14 patients. Results. By ID skin testing 8 patients had a positive response while with the multitest only 3 had a positive response. Twelve patients had a positive reaction to the candida antigen by both tests. Both skin tests as well as the T4/T8 cell ratios performed in our patients did reflect the degree of immunosuppression characteristic of this group. Conclusion. From the results observed in this group of immunosuppressed patients, it seems appropriate to use larger amounts of Ag than the one required for pure screening. While the multitest is faster and safer to work with, it may not be as accurate in diagnosing immunocompetence as the conventional skin testing. Notes: 2087 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SKIN TEST REACTIVITY AND T4 COUNTS IN HIV-1 SEROPOSITIVE ACTIVE DUTY NAVY AND MARINE CORPS PERSONNEL Douglas L. Mayers.*, K Wagner*, D Wilson*, T Zadowicz**, W Harrison***, T Heffernan****, et al., U.S. Naval Hospitals *Bethevda,**Portsmouth,***San Diego,****Oakland Objectives. To determine the relationship between OKT4 -positive (T4 count) and delayed hypermensitivity skin teat results (DHS) in a screened population of HIV-1 seropomitive patients. Methods. We evaluated the relationship between T4 counts and DHS results in 1477 patients identified by the HIV screening program mandated by the Department of Defense. The skin tests were applied by the Allergy Department at each hospital. Three hospitals used the Merieux Multitest CMI (MCMI) and one hospital* used intradermal (ID) injection of a panel of 5 antigens. For data comparison, normal (N) is defined as reactivity to 2 or more antigens; hypoergic (H) as reactivity to 1 antigen, and anergy (A) as no 4) 147(18) 644(78) Conclusions. Skin testing using ID antigens is significantly more responsive to T4 counts than the MCMI panel, especially for T4 counts ( 200. The majority of clinical centers evaluating HIV patients are currently using the MCMI panel. We recommend routine use of intradermal skin test antigens to determine delayed hypersensitivty results in HIV positive patients. LUC O PROGNOSTIC VALUE OF LANGERHANS CELLS IN system, in addition to T4 lympho cytes would seem to play an important role in HIV infection. So viral particules have been identified in epidermis Langerhans cells (L.C.). Accordingly, we researched a correlation between the number of L.C. in normal epidermis of HIV patients, the absolute number of T4 lymphocytes in plasma and the clinical stage of HIV infection. Method. 58 patients HIV+ were studied with the following stage: 6 stage II, 29 stage III and 13 stage IV (CDC classification) and 10 healty heterosexuals with negative HIV serology as control group. The absolute number of T4 cells in plasma was determined by an \"indirect immunofluorescence technique\" (IIT). The number of L.C. was studied cutaneous sections with an IIT using a CD1 monoclonal antibody. These sections were obtained normal sun protected inner aspect of the upper arm: Normal - 75- 2 LC per lenqht of epidermis aligned through the diameter of the field (x300). Result. A correlation (R=0,823) was found between the number of Langerhans cells in normal epidermis and the absolute number of T4 lymphocytes in plasma. The number of Langerhans cells was obviously lower in stage III and IV. Conclusion. So this study demonstrated the prognostic value of LC in normal epidermis of HIV patients in addition to the T4 lymphocytes in plasma. Further, it confirmed the important role played by \"macrophagic cells\". 185 [Page 186](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/184) 2089 symptomfree HIVpositives have HIV-infected Langerhans cells in the epidermis of the skin. 14ethods. Epidermal cell suspensions were obtained from 3 symptomfree HIV-positive individuals and cultured. Each day cells were harvested, cytocentrifuged onto slides and stained for HIV1 antigens using a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies for the HIV proteins pl5,p24 and gpl20 in the APAAP-technique. Results. In two of the individuals the cells were positive after 3 days in culture, and the third was positive after 4 days in culture. Supernatant from one of the cultures infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from another donor. Conclusion. Epidermal Langerhans cells from symptomfree HIV-positive individuals may be latent-infected. In ARC/AIDS patients HIV has been demonstrated in the epidermis of the skin, and we have previously demonstrated that epidermal Langerhans cells can be infected in vitro with HIV, and that they produce and release HIV into the culture medium. 2090 LANGERHANS CELLS (LC) IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF THE HIV INFECTION Julia Ramsauer1 P Racz, K Tenner-Racz2 M Dietrich, P Kern1, W Meigel2 1 2 Institute for Tropical Medicine, AK St. Georg, Hamburg Objective. To study the changes of LC (number, morphology) in the skin of HIV infected patients. Methods. We studied 150 skin biopsies including 25 Kaposi's sarcomas from different stages of HIV infection and 50 ones from control persons with immunohistology (monoclonal antibodies to p18 and p24 core proteins paraffin sections (S-100 protein, Giemsa staining). LC/mm2 by image analyzer IBAS 2000 (Zeiss). Results. In patients, also in the early phase of the infection, the LC stained much weaker than in controls. The number of LC was reduced especially in skin with Kaposi's sarcoma. The majority of LC was localized atypically (basal layer) and their processes were much shorter than in controls. LC were also found migrating in the dermal lymphatics. Almost every cell in the basal layer of the skin showed an unspecific positivity with p18. However, p24 positivity is specific and stains some LC. Conclusion. The altered morphology of the LC probably reflects a functional damage in antigen presentation. The positivity of some LC with p24 suggests LC are target cells for the HIV infection.

Departments of Clinical Immunology, Royal Perth Hospital, Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre and University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia. Previously we have reported an association between C4BQO and progressive generalised lymphadenopathy associated with infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Since the C4B locus is within the MHC, it is possible that this association is secondary to reported associations with Class I or Class II MHC alleles but available evidence strongly suggests that the C4BQO association is primary rather than secondary. Possible mechanisms include a direct effect of C4B deficiency, especially since C4B is particularly important in some complement functions. We propose that deficiency of C4B results in facilitated infection of follicular dendritic cells by HIV. These observations may be important in that: 1. HIV can clearly utilise several cell surface receptors. 2. The cell surface receptor used by HIV may be important in determining the consequences of infection. 3. C4 deficiency may be correctable. and 4. Identifiable genetic factors may be important in determining susceptibility to infection. These possibilities are being assessed in goats with CAEV and in an in vitro system.

Methods. Lymphocytes isolated from HIV-antibody (n=64) negative (n=31) subjects were tested against 51-Cr labelled HTLVIIIB infected U937-2 cells. The ADCC function was tested with autologous and allogeneic sera and with rabbit IgG antibodies against b2-microglobulin. Results.70% of lymphocytes from HIV infected patients could mediate NK activity. All normal donors mediated killing. No significant difference were seen between different clinical stages of disease. Taking the percentage of specific 51-Cr release as a measure of the magnitude of cytotoxicity, lymphocytes from normal donors were killing more effectively than from HIV infected patients. 71% of the HIV infected subjects could mediate b2-microglobulin specific ADCC. They had lower mean-percentage of cytotoxicity than the healthy donors. Similar results were seen when ADCC was tested with serum and effector cells from the same patient and with an allogeneic HIV antibody positive serum. No difference was seen when comparing donors from different clinical stages. Conclusion. The reduced ability to mediate NK and ADCC seems to be present already in early stages of disease. This suppression may contribute to disease progression. 2094 LEU2+/7+ NATURAL KILLER (NK) CELL SUBSET LEVELS IN HIV CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) *St Stephen's Hospital, **Westminster Hospital - London. Objective To ascertain whether a rise in the Leu2+/7+ subset occurs in AIDS and its association with CMV infection. Methods 25 HIV seropositive patients were compared with 25 patients with proven Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), 13 CMV Detection of Early Antigen Foci (DEAFF) patients, 11 with CMV and and 7 with biopsy proven CMV infection. Leu2+/7+ subset values nearest to time of diagnosis were used. Statistical analysis employed the Mann-Whitney U test. Results All the groups with CMV (biopsy proven, retinitis or DEAFF positive) had significantly higher Leu2+/7+ markers than well HIV seropositives (p<0.002 in all cases). Although the PCP group also had raised levels of Leu2+/7+ cells this was not significant when compared to well HIV seropositives. There were no significant differences in Leu2+/7+ labelled cells between 'proven' CMV (retinitis and biopsy positive) and patients in whom CMV was diagnosed by DEAFF testing. Conclusions Previous studies have shown raised Leu2+/7+ subsets in patients with all stages of HIV disease and in the CMV infected recipients of bone marrow and cardiac transplants. Our study reveals that patients with AIDS and CMV infection have significantly higher Leu2+/7+ levels than well seropositives. We suggest that this may be a useful marker of occult CMV infection in AIDS. There is no difference between the Leu2+/7+ levels in DEAFF positive or biopsy proven CMV disease, and this subset may provide a non-invasive early marker of CMV infection. Notes: 2095 NK CELL ACTIVITY AND HIV GP41 of Virology and Immunology* - Southwest Founda tion for Biomedical Research - San Antonio - Texas - USA. Objective. To evaluate the inibitory effect on normal natural killer (NK) cell activity of two synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid sequences 735-752 and 846-860, respectively, as deduced from the amino acid sequences of HTLV-IIIB gp 160. Methods. The effect of different concentrations of two HIV synthetic peptides 735-752 and 846-860 on normal human NK cell activity assayed against K562 tumor target cells in an in vitro 51Cr release cytotoxicity assay was evaluated. Results. Peptides 735-752 and 846-860 conjugated to protein carriers exerted a significant inhibition on the normal NK cell activity. At variance, control peptides similarly con jugated had no effect on NK activity. Addition of exogenous recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2) resulted in a partial restoration of the suppression of NK cell activity exerted by both peptides. Binding experiments indicated that peptides 735-752 and 846-860 did not affect the formation of effector cell/target cell conjugates, suggesting an inibitory effect subsequent to the formation of lytic complex. Conclusion. The results suggest that these peptides may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the defective NK cell activity observed in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). 2096 PATHOGENESIS OF DEFECTIVE NATURAL KILLER CELL ACTIVITY IN AIDS. MC.Sirianni,S.Soddu,F.Aiuti Department of Clinical Immunology,Univ.Rome, Italy Objective. To investigate if some cytoskeleton components are defective in AIDS patients,since actin and tubulin were demonstrated to be involved,respectively,in binding and killing phases of natural killer (NK)activity and patients with AIDS are not able to kill the target cell K562 while maintaining the capacity to bind it. Methods. PBL from patients and controls were labelled with monoclonal antibodies to actin and tubulin and indirect immunofluorescence was used to visualize their distribution in conjugates between PBL and K562 -cell line. Results. A polarization of actin in PBL from both controls and AIDS patients was found,whereas the tubulin rearrangement,at the site of attachment between effector and target cells,usually observed in normal controls,was not evident in AIDS. Conclusion. These data suggest that a deficiency of tubulin rearrangement may underlie the inability of the NK cells from AIDS patients to kill their target. 187 [Page 188](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/186) 2097 NATURAL KILLER CELL ACTIVITY AS A PROGNOSTIC THE PROGRESSION West Germany Blood samples, positive for antibodies to HIV-1, were obtained from 51 patients out of which 37 were symptomless subjects. Ten healthy antiHIV negative individuals served as control. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were isolated and either used without further treatment (= unstimulated cells) or stimulated overnight with either vesicular stomatitis virus for interferon (IFN) a - or concanavalin A for IFN7 production which in turn activates natural killer (NK) cells. The in vitro 51Cr release assay was applied for the quantification of NK cell activity. It turned out that NK cell activity of stimulated PBL from those subjects who were still free of symptoms (CDC stage 2) was within the normal range. In contrast, NK cell activity in unstimulated PBL from patients in CDC stage 2 which yielded in 24.7 +/- 8.9 percent specific lysis was 2.6-fold elevated (P << 0.001) as compared to unstimulated PBL from healthy donors (9.4 +/- 2.9). NK cell activity of unstimulated PBL was 5.2 +/- 5.2 from patients belonging to CDC stage 3 and it was almost absent in CDC 4 patients (0.75 +/- 0.55). In order to clarify whether NK cell activity in unstimulated PBL from patients in CDC stage 3 and 4 can be restored by exogenous IFNa, this immunomodulator was added at a concentration of 1000 NIH-units/ml to the overnight cultures. However, after this treatment no significant increase of NK cell activity was determined in the cultures. Furthermore we have selected 4 cases for a follow-up study and confirmed that the loss of NK cell activity was followed by a progression of the disease. The data strongly suggest that the decrease of NK cell activity in unstimulated PBL from patients of CDC stage 2 can be used as a valuable parameter to follow the development of CDC stage 3 and 4 in patients currently in CDC stage 2. 2098 ERYTHRODERMA MIMICKING SEZARY'S SYNDROME IN AN AIDS PATIENT: A and **Department of infectious diseases, H6pital Claude BERNARD, Paris, France. We report the case of a 25-year-old man with HIV I infection and lymphadenopathy who successively developed a lichenoid eruption with photosensitive distribution and hyperpigmented erythroderma. Histologic findings in the skin biopsies were consistent with Sezary's syndrome with a dense lymphoid infiltrate in the superficial dermis and mild epidermotropism. Large atypical circulating lymphoid cells were also found. Lymphocytes within the cutaneous infiltrates and in the blood were uniformly of the suppressor-cytotoxic subset (CD3 + CD4 - CDR +). Clonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor genes was absent in the circulating atypical lymphoid CDR + cells. HTLV I antibodies were absent.. Lichenoid eruptions (consistent with a GVH like disease) and photosensitivity have already been described in AIDS patients (Toback 1986 - Rico 1987) and are poorly understood. Erythroderma consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma has been briefly reported by Kaplan et al. In the present case, the clinical and histological presentations were typical of Sezary's syndrome but the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma was eliminated by the absence of clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor genes. We postulate this patient had a polyclonal CDR lymphoid proliferation within the skin, as it has already been described within the lungs (lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis), the lymph nodes and the nerves. Notes: 2099 IMMUNOGLOBULIN E IN HIV DISEASE (HIVD) W Lowenstein, Labrousse, D Israel-Biet, H Sors, F Fontan, OG Ekindjian, P Even HIV Study Group, Hopital Laennec, Paris, France IgE synthesis is tightly controlled by helper and suppressor T cells and derived factors. IgE are increased in parasitic and atopic diseases, congenital (SCID) or acquired (GVHD) T cell deficiencies and autoimmune disorders. Because HIVD associates B cell polyclonal activation, T 3cll immune deficiency, autoimmune activity, atopic symptoms and drug hypersensitivity, we have measured IgE levels in 100 control subjects (C) and 254 HIV + patients classified in 3 non AIDS groups according to the T4 count/pl, I (> 600, n = 104), II (300 - 600, n = 79) and III (< 300 n = 31) and one AIDS group (IV, n = 40). IgE were measured by antigen capture EIA using anti-IgE-Fc mAb's. IgE (m iSEM,IU/ml) of patients differed from C and increased from groups I to IV: C: 82 ~ 9, I: 149 + 24, II: 169 A 28, III 302. 88, IV: 414. 128 (max.value 4,500). Most intergroup differences were significant. IgE were similar in previously atopic and non atopic patients. IgA also increased signicantly from group I (2.3 ~ 0.2) to IV (6.1 ~ 0.6 g/1). Both IgE and IgA were inversely related to T4 cells (p<.005) but not intercorrelated (p=.32). IgG increase from I to III (19.5 ~ 0.7 to 24.7: 1.7 g/l p<.01) and were not correlated to IgA or IgE. In 52 group I and II patients studied for 9-26 months, IgE, IgA and IgG increased regularly and significantly. In 27 patients whose T4 cells decreased markedly (> 30 %) in 12-26 months, the IgE increased simultaneously from 105 e 25 to 519 ~ 306 (p<.01). IgE are an evolution marker of interest in the follow-up of JHIV + patients. 2100 Presence of IgE-binding factor in AIDS Patients. C. Carini, J. Hargolick and K. Ishizaka, Johns Hopkins Univ. Sch. of Med. and Sch. of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, MD. USA 21205. A nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding for rodent IgE binding factor (IgE-BF) has been revealing a clear homology between this factor (IgE-BF) and the endogenous retrovirus like intracisternal A particles (IAP) gene of the mouse. This finding encouraged the possibility that T cell factors with affinity for IgE might be produced by infection of human T lymphocytes with retrovirus such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thirty-five HIV infected subjects (5 AIDS; 9 AIDS related complex-ARC; 9 Lymphoadenopathy syndrome-LAS; 12 sero positive asymptomatic) were screened in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) for the release of IgE-BF. We were able to show that MNC of 18 patients spontaneously formed IgE-BF and those of 6 additional patients released IgE-BF upon stimulation with IgE. MNC of normal and atopic individuals, used as control, failed to release IgE-BF either constitutively or upon stimulation with IgE. Of the 24 patients who were positive for IgE-BF productivity, 4 showed high level of serum IgE. All 35 patients showed an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio. Fractionation of MNC showed that T cells was the major source of this IgE-BF. It was also seen that purified T cells released soluble factor(s) which stimulate uninfected T cells to release IgE-BF. yIFN or IL-4 were incapable in the non-infected T cells to induce the production of IgE-BF. Further experiments showed that the T cells of 2 HIV infected subjects expressed a high density of FcdR+ assayed by cytofluorometry. These results indicated that HIV infected T cells released an IgE-BF and that virus infection might also enhance the expression of Fc R+ on these T cells. 188 [Page 189](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/187) 2101 HIV ANTIGEN INDUCING HISTAMINE RELEASE IN AIDS PATIENTS DUE TO TYPE I ALLERGY. Michael Pedersen*, C.M.Nielsen**, H.Permin*, S.Norn***. *Laboratory of Immunology, Seruminstitut Copenhagen, ***Department of ) induce production of specific IgE in AIDS patients estimated by the basophil histamine release test. The development of type I allergy directed against HIV was investigated in vitro in 10 AIDS patients and in 10 healthy control persons.Methods. Basophil histamine release test was used as a sensitive test to detect type I allergy directed against HIV antigen. Results. 80% of the AIDS patients showed significant histamine release due to stimulation with HIV antigen, whereas basophil leukocytes from healthy control persons did not release histamine. Surface imrunoglobulins were found to be involved in the cell activation, since histamine release was abolished and regained by renoval from and refixation to the cell surface of the cell-bound irmunoglobulins before stimulation with HIV antigen. An enhangement of histamine release by HIV way investigated by a short preincubation of the cells with HIV antigen. Histamine release was thereafter induced by stimulation of the cells with anti-IgE, CA and HSV. No enhancement of histamine release was found by HIV antigen, niether in AIDS patients norrii controls. Conclusion. The histamine release-causedibythe HIV antigen suggest that HIV infection can induce antiHIV IgE production besides specific HIV IgG and IgM antibodies. Mediator release by type I allergic reactions directed against HIV might therefore be suspected as a pathogenic factor in AIDS. 2102 ANTIBODY ISOTYPES DIRECTING ANTI-GP120 ANTIBODY DEPENDENT AND CELL MEDIATED CYTOTOXICITY Chet L. Nastala, Douglas S. Tyler, H. Kim Lyerly, Thomas J. Matthews, Dani P. Bolognesi, and Kent J. Weinhold Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA Objective: To determine the isotypes of the antibodies mediating anti-gpl20 specific Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) and anti-gpl20 specific Cell Mediated Cytotoxicity (CMC) seen in HIV seropositive individuals. Methods: Human isotype specific monoclonal antibodies were used in 6 hour Cr5 release assays to inhibit anti-gpl20 specific ADCC and CMC against gpl20 adsorbed and infected CEM.NKR target cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from seropositive individuals were used in CMC and natural killer (NK) assays. PBMC's from seronegatives were used inhibit specific anti-gpl20 CMC without affecting NK activity. There is no specific blocking effect seen with anti-IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, or IgG1 myeloma protein. ADCC mediated affinity anti-gpl20 eluate is also blocked by anti-IgGI and partially inhibited by anti-IgG2 and anti-IgG4. The cellular cytotoxic response (CMC) can be abolished by anti-IgGI and partially inhibited by anti-IgG4. Conclusion: Both ADCC and CMC specific for gpl20 are primarily directed by IgG1 antibodies although IgG4 may also be involved in CMC. There appear to be other isotypes in the high affinity fraction of anti-gpl20 antibodies capable of mediating cytotoxicity. Notes: 2103 IgG SUBCLASS RESPONSE TO HIV DIFFERENT CLINICAL STAGES. Kristina analyse the anti-HIV IgG subclass response in sera from different clinical stages of HIVinfection and relate this to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Methods. Lymphocytes from healthy donors were tested against HTLV IIIB-infected U937-2 cells and sera in a 3 h 51Cr release assay. The subclasses were detected by HIV enzyme immunoassay (ELISA). Results. IgG1 was the dominant anti-HIV subclass, present in all sera and with similar mean titers at different clinical stages. The IgG3 titer decreased during disease progression. IgG2 and 4 subclasses were less prevalent. High I.gG1 titers correlated with a positive ADCC reaction, but there was no direct relation between IgG1 and ADCC titers. Sera which contained HIVIgG1 as the only detectable subclass in the ELISA test were able to mediate ADCC. Since IgG3 is mainly directed to core proteins (p17, p24 and the precursor p55), and ADCC to the envelope region, this subclass is less likely to mediate ADCC. Conclusion. IgG1 is the major ADCC active IgG-subclass in HIV infected individuals and is present in all HIV seropositive subjects. 2104 EARLY RECOGNITION OF HIV IgM PATTERN IN HIV Ig6 SEROPOSITIVE NEWBORNS IN RWANDA. P. Van de Perre i, Lepage Ut, 0, Nzaramba *, D,G, HitimanaND, From tk AIDS Project, Kigali, Rwanda (4), and Depatment of Pediatrics, Centre Hospitalier de Kigali, Kigali, Rwanda (0), OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical significance and the time of appearance of igM to HIV in sero+ asymptomatic newborns and in children with AIDS, METHODS: In the Pediatric Department of the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali, we selected 5 consecutive symptomless newborns born of HIV sero+ (EIA and WB) mothers (3 F and 2 M. age range: 0-27 days) aswell as 13 consecutive patients diagnoses as having AIDS according to the WHO definition (9 F and 4 M, age range: 3-19 months) who were all born of HIV sero+ (EIA and VB) mothers, After precipitation of Rheumatoid Factor (Absorbant RF, Behring) a IgM HIV WB test (Biotech Du Pont de Nemours) was performed on all 18 samples, A positive IgM WB test was defined as the presence of reactive band with either p17 or p24 with or without a p55 reaction, RESULTS: HIV igM was detected in 4/5 asymptomatic newborns and in 2/13 pediatrics AIDS cases (Fisher's Exact Test, p=0,021), CONCLUSIONS: HIV IgM can be detected as early as in the first days of life, in infants born of HIV infected mothers, it could be a valuable marker able to discriminate true HIV infection from passively acquired HIV Ig6 antibodies (this is one of the purposes of an ongoing prospective cohort study), HIV IgM are less frequently detected in full-blown pediatric AIDS, 189 [Page 190](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/188) 2105 1gM response in HIV. Malcolm R. MacKenzie, M.D. University of California, Davis. Information on the 1gM response to HIV is limited due to the difficulty of establishing the time of primary exposure. Two individuals were studied pre and post a known exposure to HIV. Sera were studied with (EIA), (IFA), Western blot (WB) and antigen capture (AC). Sera were fractionated on QAE-Sephadex to isolate 1gM and IgG. Positive samples were tested in WE with recombinant p24, p31, gp4l, gpl2O. One sample was available days (d) 2, 23, 26, 33 and 51 post exposure. Whole sera AG was weakly positive d 23, definite d 26. IFA and WE (p24 only) d 33 and all positive by d 51. The fractions proved more sensitive. 1gM fractions showed reactions in WB with p51, p55, p65, d 2, 23, 26, and 33, p24 and p4l d 51. IgG fractions showed no reactions until day 33 with p24, p51, p55 and p65, d 55. No reactions were seen with gpl2O in these studies. The second pt Ag positive d 35, p24 in WE. At 42 days EIA, IFA and WE positive at p24 and p41. The fractions, 1gM was positive p24 and p55 in the pre sample and at 35 days and 40 days was positive with the addition of p65. IgG fraction was negative pre and positive with p24 and p51, 55 at both 35 and 40 days. 1gM responses in HIV are seen before IgG and AN. 2106 QUANTITATION OF HIV SPECIFIC IgG AND 1gM 2106 IN INFANTS BORN TO ANTI-HIV(+) MOTHERS BY AN IMMUNOREAC~TIVE BEAD (IRB) ASSAY Vyas; University of California, San Francisco, CA 4~becIize. To evaluate infants born to anti-HIV( +) women for temporal changes in antigen specific IgG and 1gM against rDNA-produced HIV antigens. Methods. A IRB assay used to quantitate IgG and (p24, p31, gp4l, and gpl2O; Chiron Corp.) has been described in another abstract by Scillian, et al. Serial serum samples collected between birth and the age of one year were tested with IRB. Clinical follow-up, other anti-HIV assays and cultures were performed in evaluating 10 infants: 7 clinically well infants, who became seronegative by standard techniques, were also culture negative and presumably uninfected; 3 infants were culture positive. One infected child over the age of one year was also studied. Results. In 9 infants studied serially, IgG against gp41 decreased steadily in all uninfected infants and increased in 2 of the 3 infected infants. Rates of decline of IgG against p24, p31, and gp120 varied greatly with 2 of 6 uninfected and 2 of 3 infected infants, having transiently increasing IgG against at least one antigen. Remarkably, 1gM against p24 or gpl2O was transiently increased in 4 of 7 presumed uninfected infants. All 3 infected infants had, at some time, increased 1gM against at least one antigen. Five of the 7 presumed uninfected infants had significantly increased HIV specific 1gM and/or increasing HIV specific IgG. Conc1Jssion. Using an antigen-specific discrete IRB assay, we have demonstrated declining HIV specific IgG antibodies in high risk infants. However, antibody responses, not consistent with declining passive maternal antibody, were observed in 5 of the 7 infants, previously considered to be uninfected. These observations suggest that perinatal HIV infection rates may be higher than previously estimated. Current investigations utilizing improved HIV culture techniques and HIV identification by the polymerase chain reaction (Ulrich et al, in press) may validate this observation.

Objective. Determine the development of antibody isotypes specific for HIV-l in sequential specimens collected over 30 months from seroconverters. Methods. Sera from 5 visits (at 6-month intervals) from 20 subjects enrolled in the MACS, who seroconverted by ELISA between visit 1 and 2, were examined by Western blot (WE) for IgG, 1gM, and IgA to HIV-l. WE were measured by reflectance densitometry. Results. WB analysis of 20 ELISA-negative sera from visit 1, indicated both IgG and 1gM reactivity in 5 subjects, IgG only in 2, and 1gM only in 5. 1gM reactivity never developed in 4 subjects. None had IgA at visit 1, but 9 had IgA by visit 3. IgG was generally reactive against all major HIV-l proteins. In 1gM revealed anti-HIV Ig in 12/120 ELISA-negative sera from individuals who subsequently seroconverted. Although most of the visit 1 WE patterns were technically indeterminate, subsequent serum specimens were unequivocally positive. For 5 of the visit 1 sera, reactivi ty was evident only on 1gM WB. Assays measuring isotypespecific antibodies may be valuable in detection of early HIV infection. 2108 EARLY NATURAL HISTORY OF HIV-1 INFECTION WITH THE LABORATORY STRAIN, HTLV-IIIB W. Blattner*, P. Nara*, Bethesda, Durham, NC, and ***PRI, Frederick, MD Objecti ve: To examine over 2 years the early natural history of laboratory acquired HIV-1 infection. Methods: Monitor immune response to viral antigens; whole virus, gpl2O analysis; clinical parameters. Results: The earliest sample was weakly reactive on whole virus ELISA, had a single gpl2O band on Western blot and lacked group and type specific neutralizing antibodies. Over 9 months, antibody titers to whole virus, gpl2O, and p24 f~luctuated but rose step-wise, while neutralizing and gpl2O subfragment antibodies restricted to the Ill-B strain appeared in parallel. At 12 to 18 months, antibody response broadened to recognize group specific epitopes as measured against other viral strains and gp120 subfragments. Neutralizing antibodies to the parent Ill-B strain were detected on the second bleed, 5 months after the ini ti al sampl e and persisted, while neutral izing antibodies to the strain of virus isolated from the worker at 18 months were low or absent until 12 to 18 months. The subject is clinically healthy with an elevated TB percentage. Conclusion: Over 12-18 months, the predominant immune response was type specific. The virus may have mutated so that the focused Ill-B type specific immune response created antibodies irrelevant to neutralizing the strain that emerged in this individual. 190 [Page 191](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/189) 2109 T-CELL EPITOPES ON HIV ENVELOPE ARE RECOGNIZED BY SOME NONINFECTED PARTNERS BUT NOT BY INFECTED MEN. Annamari Ranki*, S. Mattinen**, J. Antonen**, P. Ashorn**, and K. *Dept. of Dermatology, University Central Hospital, Helsinki and **Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland. Objective. To study the recognition of HIV-specific T cell epitopes by HIV infected or exposed individuals. Methods. T cell response to HIV was studied in 58 HIV-infected men and in 13 noninfected men with verified sexual exposure to HIV. Inactivated HIV virions, purified HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120, recombinant envelope protein PB1 (aa. 295-474), a synthetic envelope peptide aa.426 - 450 and recombinant p24 protein were used as antigens. Results. None of the HIV-infected persons responded to gp120 or to HIV; the occasional response to PB1 or p24 corresponded to a proliferative response to E. Coli-extract. In contrast, 5/13 sexual but unequivocally noninfected partners to HIV-infected men, did respond. No response towards the synthetic peptide aa. 426-450 of gp120, shown to act as a helper T-cell epitope in gpl20-immunized chimpanzees or HIV-infected gibbon apes, were seen. Conclusion. HIV infection seem to suppress HIV specific T cell response. The epitopes recognized by human beings may be different from those recognized by immunized animals. 110 RESPONSE TO PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE (PV) AMONG 2 1 HIV INFECTED DRUG USERS (IVDU) AND HETEROSEXUAL PARTNERS (SP) OF PERSONS WITH AIDS. Robert S Klein*, P Selwyn*, D Maude*, C Pollard*, G Schiffman**. Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine*, Health Science Center, Brooklyn**, New York, U.S.A. Objective. Studies of antibody (Ab) responses to PV in HIV infected (HIV+) pts. have included mostly homosexual men and have reported conflicting results. We studied Ab responses to PV in IVDU and SP of persons with AIDS. Methods. Subjects included 11 HIV+ IVDU, 9 HIV- IVDU, 10 HIV+ SP, and 6 HIV- SP. No subject had HIV related symptoms, but lymphadenopathy was present in all HIV+ pts. Ab titers to 12 pneumococcal capsular antigens (Ag) were measured by RIA pre- and 6 months post-vaccination with PV. Ab responses were compared between groups by Wilcoxon 2-sample test. Results. HIV- IVDU and SP had greater overall Ab responses than HIV+ IVDU and SP respectively (p<.05). For both IVDU and SP, responses measured were significantly greater among HIV- subjects for 7/12 Ags. Mean pre- and post-vaccination Ab titers for 5 capsular Ags are shown. Mean.Ab (ng/ml) 3 Type 6A Type 7F Type 9N Type 19F Pre Post Pre Post Pre Post Pre Post Pre Post HIV+ IVDU 687 756 375 517 856 980 312 320 710 HIV- IVDU 809 1289 777 2284 375 807 832 1521 HIV+ SP 427 526 409 510 770 1047 226 313 443 464 HIV- SP 463 1057 822 1434 617 2292 304 952 410 743 Differences in Ab responses between HIV- IVDU and HIV- SP were not significant. T4 cell counts, available only for SP, did not correlate with Ab responses among HIV+ or HIV- subjects. Conclusion. HIV+ asymptomatic IVDU and SP had impaired Ab responses to PV. Ab responses in HIV- IVDU and HIV- SP were similar. Notes: 2111 INHIBITION OF T CELL PROLIFERATION BY A MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY SPECIFIC FOR A T CELL ACTIVATION ANTIGEN EXPRESSED ON HIV INFECTED CELLS Grassi F.*, A. Beretta*, L. di Sanita, Roma, Italy. *Unit for Applied Cell Biology, University of Umea, Sweden. A monoclonal antibody obtained from mice immunized with HIV was selected on the basis of its reactivity against a 40 Kd band in commercially available HIV western blot strips. The antibody (L31) was also reactive against a protein of the same molecular weight present on activated T cells suggesting the cellular nature of the antigen recognized on the western blot strips. The expression of the antigen on T cells is activation dependent since it increases 20 times after activation by anti-T3 antibodies and IL2. The antigen is also present on HTLV-I infected HUT78 cells but not on the non-infected cells. When added to cultures of anti-T3 activated T cells L31 strongly inhibits the proliferative response. L31 also inhibits activation by anti-CD2 antibodies. Preliminary data of competition experiments performed with AIDS sera suggest the presence in some AIDS patients of antibodies with L31-1ike specificity. 2112 CHARACTERIZATION OF AN AIDS-RELATED AUTOANTIGEN Neyman. University of California, San Francisco, CA. Previously we showed that patients with AIDS and AIDS-related conditions produce a cytotoxic autoantibody that binds to an 18-KD protein on lectin-stimulated or virally infected CD4+ T-cells 1987). Using the human CD4+ T-cell line, HUT-78, we have now isolated and characterized the target autoantigen. Isolation of the 18-KD protein from lectin-stimulated HUT-78 cells performed by electroelution from preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The eluted protein was shown to bind serum antibody from AIDS patients on immunoblots. Amino acid sequencing revealed that the target antigen has >90% homology with a histone protein, H2B. AIDS serum antibody specifically bound to this histone on immunoblots and inhibited binding of rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-histone H2B antibodies to stimulated T-cells and to the purified histone. AIDS serum antibody also blocked binding of a specific lectin, leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (PHA-L), to purified histone H2B, indicating the association of a particular carbohydrate moiety with the target antigen. By flow cytometry, AIDS serum antibody selectively blocked binding of monoclonal anti-histone H2B antibody to lectin-stimulated intact HUT-78 cells. The target antigen was also detected in the cell supernatant after trypsin hydrolysis of intact cells, indicating that the histone protein is found on the cell surface. Furthermore, monoclonal antibody against histone H2B reacted with purified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preparations derived from either HUT-78 cells or CEM cells. This finding suggests that histone H2B may be involved in HIV processing by infected cells. We conclude that the CD4+ T-cell antigen that is the target of autoantibody binding in AIDS is a glycoprotein that shares homology with histone H2B. Antibody against histone H2B may play an important role in the autoimmune response against CD4+ T-cells in AIDS. 191 [Page USA. Objective To discover how HIV-1 down-modulates cell surface membrane (Sm) expression of CD4. Methods Three HIV-1 isolates were used to infect CEM cells. We followed reverse transcriptase (RT) biosynthesis to 52%, while CD4 RNA declines to ca 20%. RT varies with the relative multiplicity of infection (Moi) titered as RT. A p160 is seen with RIPA. Other Sm markers (eg T9) do not vary with infection.

Macatonia, Stella C. Knight and Steven Patterson, Clinical Research Centre, Watford Road, Harrow, HA1 3UJ, UK. Objective: Dendritic cells are susceptible to infection in vitro with the Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Patterson & Knight (1982) J.Gen.Virol. 68:1177). This study was to determine whether infection of DC with HIV impairs their antigen presenting capacity. Methods: The capacity of DC to enhance concanavalin A responses and to present influenza virus was examined. DC from normal human blood were exposed to 10-106 IU of HIV. Infected or untreated DC (500-2000) were added to syngeneic lymphocytes (12.5-100 x 103) in 20 ol hanging drops. Cultures contained concanavalin A (0.05-5Mg/ml) or received normal or HIV infected DC pulsed in vitro with influenza virus X47. Tritiated thymidine incorporation was measured after three or four days. Results: In the absence of HIV, normal DC markedly enhanced mitogen responses of lymphocytes and were also effective at presenting influenza virus. By contrast HIV infected DC became less efficient at augmenting concanavalin A responses as dose of HIV increased. Also proliferative responses to influenza virus were reduced using HIV infected DC compared with uninfected DC. Conclusion: The capacity of HIV infected DC to inhibit potent mitogen and antigen proliferation responses suggests that the profound immunosuppression in AIDS may operate via DC. This could be by a direct effect of HIV on antigen presentation or by transfer of virus from infected DC to T-cells. Units: RT is in cpm/1,000; SmCD4 is % positive CEM; CD4 is % OD of 55kd band normalized to same band of CEM; CD4 RNA is % OD of 3kb band normalized to same band of CEM; pl60:CD4 is OD ratio. *: day 35. Conclusions [1] Three independent HIV-1 isolates inhibit UD4 biosynthesis. 12] This does not arise from altered CD4 RNA splicing or CD4 protein cleavage since no new species appear.

[4] CD4 mRNA levels show some decline. complexed with new p160 (probably env gpl60) at a constant ratio near unity. Hence The drop in CD4 biosynthesis occurs in infected cells. Notes: 2115 HUMORAL AND CELLULAR FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE IMMUNOSUPPRESSION IN AIDS. L.V. Sacks, P. John, L. Peer, M. Yuille, R.H. Tomar, Division of Clinical Pathology, SUNY HSC, Syracuse New York. Proliferative defects of HIV infected cells and the immunosuppressive effects of serum from patients with AIDS on normal cells have been well established. We investigated the combined contributions of cellular and humoral factors to the impairment of mitogen stimulated lymphocyte proliferation in patients with HIV infection. Samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) from 2 healthy and 5 HIV infected individuals were washed and incubated with panels of sera from a variety of healthy and HIV infected subjects, in a PHA stimulated lymphocyte proliferation assay. The relative immunosuppressive effects of the serum samples were highly reproducible, regardless of the source of cells, HIV infected or healthy.The proliferation of cells from AIDS patients ranked lower than normal cells in corresponding cultures and serum from AIDS patients was more immunosuppressive than from non AIDS patients. Inhibitory serum compounded the proliferative defect of cells in AIDS patients. Conversely, proliferation of cells could be significantly enhanced by culture in non-inhibitory serum regardless of the serum donor, autologous or non-autologous. Serum inhibitors exacerbate the proliferative dysfunction of cells from patients with AIDS. Some recovery of cellular proliferation can be achieved using non-inhibitory serum. 2116 SERUM P.Even. Laennec HIV Study Group. Paris, France. Immunosuppression of HIV disease is still not fully understood. Serum suppressive factors, so far only reported in AIDS patients (pts) with opportunistic infections (01), certainly play a role in this dysfunction. The purpose of this work was to evaluate such factors not only in other AIDS presentations but also in HIV + non-AIDS pts. We thus studied 8 pts with OI, 7 with a Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and 35 HIV + non-AIDS pts. whom we classified according to the Laennec Working Staging System (LWSS), which takes into account pts clinical status (class A:asvmptomatic, B:lymphadenopathy, C:constitutional symptoms ) and T4 counts (Stage I:T4>600/jl~ Normal peripheral blood cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 with 10% normal human serum, in the presence of PHA (iyg/ml); serum from HIV+ pts or HIV- controls was added at initiation of the cultures (10% final concentration); cells were allowed to proliferate for 72 hours at 37', with the addition of tritiated thvmidine for the last 18 hours. Our results 1) confirm the existence of serum blocking factors in AIDS related 01 2) show their presence in KS also 3) display a suppressive activity in early staaes of the disease, i.e. in pts with normal T4 counts 4) strikingly, we showed that the intensity of this suppressive activity was not correlated with pts clinical status (no difference between classes A, B and C, neither between 01 and KS); in contrast, it is highly correlated with pts T4 counts, the lower these ones, the higher the suppression. The origin and the pathogenic role of these factors remain to be determined, but they are most likely to play a role, concurrently with the quantitative depletion of T4 cells, in the immunosuppression of HIV disease. 192 [Page 193](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/191) 2117 STUDY OF INHIBITORY EFFECT OF HIV INFECTED SERA, ON NORMIAL PROLIFERATIVE RESPONSE TO PHA P Echaniz, J D Zulaica, E Cuadrado. Hospital Ntra Sra de Aranzazu. San Sebastian SPAIN Normal lymphocitic response to mitogens is inhibited by HIV retrovirus and soluble suppresor factors in infected sera. Objetive. Quantify the inhibitory effect of sera in the various clinical stages of HIV infection. Methods. Normal lymphocytes were preincubated with patient's sera, prior to stimulation with PHA, and proliferative response was caipared with the observed when the same cells were preincubated with its own sera. Results. % Inhibition of normal response lonaitudinal study was performed in 15 HIV+IVDA followed since 1985, and in 9 vertically infected children followed since their birth. These cases were classified as clinically stable or proaressive according to their clinical preliminary results are suggestive of a correlation of inhibitory effect of HIV+ sera with the procoresion of disease. 2118 NETWORK THEORY OF AIDS M. Grant, M. S. Weaver and G. W. Hoffmann. University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada Ziegler and Stites have suggested that AIDS is an auto-immune disease triggered by HIV. We have modified and extended their theory in the light of recent progress in the development of the symmetrical network theory. Immunization with foreign lymphocytes leads to the production of anti-anti-self antibodies. Homosexuals typically receive foreign lymphocytes in ejaculates, so they are likely to develop anti-anti-self immunity. The CD4 receptor for the AIDS virus is anti-self, so the virus can be regarded as antianti-self, and the anti-viral response is anti-anti-anti-self. We suggest that AIDS involves a combination of two immune responses: anti-anti-self and anti-anti-anti-self. These responses could synergize with each other to destablize the immune system network. The theory leads to several new experimentally testable predictions and ideas concerning possible methods for prevention of the disease. One prediction that has been confirmed is that anti-anti-CD4 antibodies should be present in AIDS patients' sera. The theory predicts that three substances, that are leading vaccine candidates, namely gpl20, gpl60 and anti-CD4 are all likely to cause AIDS in high risk groups. The theory suggests that certain anti-anti-gpl20 antibodies will be useful for both prognosis and prevention of the disease. References: Ziegler, J. L. and Stites, D. P. (1986) Clin. Immunol.

Objectif: To evaluate the prevalence of L.A. in a population of HIV infected patients and the correlation with their clinical and immunological status. Hemophiliac patients were excluded. Methods: A 19 months prospective study including all seropositive patients whatever their staging. Every 6 months: clinical and biological assessment, routine coagulation study. Patients with abnormal APTT were screened for antiphospholipid activity using human and rabbit cephalin. In parallel CD4+/mm3, HIV Ag p24, Ac anti-p24 and W blot were performed. Results: 278 patients entered the study. Coagulation screening was actually performed on 220 patients. 13/220: 6% patients exhibited a L.A. When compared in terms of age, sex, risk group, CDC staging, CD4+ lymphocytes count, there were no difference between patients with L.A. and the overall HIV infected patients population. 4/13 patients with L.A. had O.I., comprising one pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). L.A. exhibited a very variable concentration during follow up with transient disappearance. Specificity was comparable with L.A. encountered in other autoimmune diseases: high rates of thrombocytopenia (6/13), false positive VDRL (4/13) and anticardiolipin antibody (5/12) observed. We report no thrombotic or hemorragic complication. Conclusion: A prospective study concerning an overall population of 278 patients shows that prevalence of L.A. is 6% and is not related to O.I. nor PCP. L.A. is asymptomatic and do not seem to be a prognostic factor. 2120 REMDVAL OF CIRCULATIING fIUNE COMPLEXES BY ERYTH2120 ROCYTE TRANSFUSION IN PATIENTS WITH AIDS AND ARC Y Inada, J Sulzberger, W S Clark, M Lange St.Luke' s-Roosevelt Hospita ColumbiaUniversity,NewYorkJSA Objective. We have demonstrated that absence of erythrocyte C3b receptor (E-CRl), which are needed for the elimination of pathogenic imnune complexes (CIC), and positive direct Coanbs tests are associated with progression from an asymptonatic HIV positive state to overtAIDS. In this study we evaluate the potential benefit of transfusing packedE with high CR1 activity in patients with ARC and AIDS. Methods. 10 of 18AIDS patients (post 1st episodePCP) and 10 of 19 ARC patients (oral thrush) were randomized to receive at least 2 units of packedE (Tx) at 2 and 4 month intervals respectively. An additional 7 ARC patients received a single partial exchange transfusion(Ex-Tx). A subsequent follow up included periodic measurement of CIC,CRl,direct Cocmbs test and T4/T8. Results. All controlAIDS patients(8) experienced recrudesce-- nce of AIDS (ave. 4.5 month) and died(ave. 9 mos). Of the transfusedAIDS patients(10), 2 have developed furthermanifestations of AIDS, while the other 8 have remained in relatively stable condition at 6 mos. 9/9 controlARC developed AIDS (ave. 8mos). By contrast, 4/10 of ARC withTx developedAIDS and 6 remained relatively symptom free at 10 mos. Of 7 Ex-Tx, 1 developed PCP, and 6 are symptom free. Decrease or complete disappearance ofCIC occurred in 80% of 29 Tx episodes within 7 day post Tx. CR1 activity of patients with Tx was significantly increased in the Ex-Tx group.Itmoderately increased in the other groups,but returned to initial levels after 2 months. CR1 activity in controls failed to improve. Significant differences in Coanbs test positivity before and after Tx was not observed in patients with interval Tx. In contrast 5/7 with ExTx denonstrated decreased Cocmbs test with increased CR1 activity. No decrease was observed in controls.16/20 receiving Tx showed improvement inT4/T8 ratio(0.13-0.36) compared to decreasing ratios(0.28 to 0.15). Conclusion*Our observations to date suggest that increased CIC and degreased CR1activity can bepartially improved by E-Tx with high CRlactivity. A possible delay in progresslon of disease may be achieved in both AIDS and ARC patients. 193 A-13 [Page occurrence pathogenesis of drug allergy in symptomatic HIV-infected patients.

To establish the immunological status of the different stages of HIV infection in Spaniards, whose paleo-North African origin makes them an interesting ethnic group for the study of AIDS in Caucasians. We studied 237 patients, CDC-classified as 81 asymptomathic (AS), 68 with lymphadenopathy (LAP), 57 AIDS-related complex (RC) and 31 AIDS. 81% were drug addicts and a high incidence of tuberculosis was assessed in advances stages of HIV infection (23% in RC+AIDS vs 2% in AS+LAP, p< 0.001). phytohaemaglutinin, anti-CD3 and pokeweed, and skin tests (Multitest, IMC). Results. Advanced stages (RC,AIDS) vs earlier stages (AS, LAP) os the disease showed the following features (more markedly in AIDS than in RC): lymphopenia (p(0.001), low CD3+ and CD4+ PBML numbers low PR (p<0.001). All groups had high IgG levels, and high IgA levels were recorded in RC mg%) and AIDS and 0.001 respectively; these high IgA levels correlated significantly with the existence of concomitant infection, namely tuberculosis (p< 0.001). Lastly, high monocyte and CDllb+ PBML numbers were recorded in LAP patients vs all other groups (p0.001) These alterations may be of pronostic value to clinicians.

Box 9190, 1006 AD Amsterdam. Objective. Determination of the targetantigens in immune thrombocytopenia related to HIV-infection. Methods. Sera and ethereluates from platelets of fifteen HIV-infected men, containing antibodies against platelets as determined by immunofluorescence, were characterized by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence with normal platelets and platelets of a type I Glanzmann disease patient. Results. Immunoprecipitation showed in all sera and eluates a 100 kD and a 150 kD band, suggesting that the antibodies were directed against the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex. In contrast to Stricker (New Engl. J. of Med. 313:1375-1389) never a 25 kD band was observed. The gpIIb/IIIa specificity of the antiplatelet antibodies was further supported by the finding that all sera and eluates did not react with the platelets of a patient with a genetic determined absence of the gpIIb/IIIa complex (M. Glanzmann type I). Conclusion. The specificity of platelet autoantibodies observed in HIV-infection is comparable to the specificity of platelet auto-antibodies in classical autoimmune thrombocytopenia. PROTEIN A-SILICA (PROSORBA~ COLUMNS). Harry W. Snyder, Jr., M. Channel, J.P. Balint, F.R. Jones, and the Prosorba~ Clinical Trial Group. IMRE Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA, 98109. Objective. To induce recovery from HIV-related ITP by extracorporeal removal of platelet-binding IgG and circulating immune complexes (CIC) from patient plasma using protein A-silica columns. Methods. A clinical trial was performed evaluating the effectiveness of immunoadsorption of plasma over Prosorba~ Columns in achieving improvement in ITP. Twentynine patients were evaluated after receiving 4-8 treatments involving adsorption of 250 ml plasma per treatment with the U.S. FDA-approved device. Results. In 16 patients platelet directed IgG and CIC -levels were decreased by 69% and 43%, respectively. The removal of CIC was associated with immune modulation leading to stimulation of an anti-F(ab') antibody response. The antibody functioned by binding to both platelet directed IgG and CIC, neutralizing their binding capacity for platelets and enhancing their clearance from the circulation. This clearance was associated with significant normalization of platelet counts in those patients from pre-treatment levels of 46,438 ~ 6,342/mm3 to peak levels of 102,125 ~ 12,399/mm3 1-3 weeks after completion of the treatment (P < 0.01). Twelve patients sustained elevated platelet counts over a mean follow-up period of 8 months without any other treatment. Conclusion. Immune modulation by extracorporeal immunoadsorption of IgG and IC is a modality for HIV-associated ITP. 194 [Page 195](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/193) 2125 PREVALENCE POPULATION G.Rossi**,R.Stellini*, F.Franceschini***, Laboratory. BRESCIA (ITALY) Objective. To Study epidemiological,clinical and immunolo gic data of HIV+ subjects with thrombocytopenia (T). Methods. 657 consecutive HIV+ subjects were screened for the presence of T (-100xlO /1). Epidemiological and clini cal features of patients with T were compared with those of HIV+ controls with normal blood counts. Results. T was detected in 72/657 cases (11%); 14 cases, mainly in CDC group IV,with associated anemia or neutrope nia,and 11 cases with transient T on follow up were esclu ded. Compared to HIV+ controls,the 47 patients with isola ted-persistent T had similar distribution in CDC groups. Male sex(p<.02)and i.v. drug abuse(p<.02)were more freque nt among HIV+ patients with T.

Methods.Thirty-eight HIV seropositive patients(28 belong ing to WR1-2 stages and 10 to WR3-6 stages) and 40 control subjects were assessed for the presence of cold agglutini ns(CA),anti-smooth muscle(ASMA),nuclear(ANA),mitocondrial (AMA) and parietal cell antibodies(APCA) in serum.Moreover, the same serum samples were assayed for immune complexes (IC) and decreased levels of two complement components(C3 and C4).The statistical differences between the HIV pati 2 ents and the controls were evaluated by means of X test, whereas the differences between WR1-2 and WR3-5 were asses sed by means of Fisher's exact test. Results.CA were present in 12 HIV patients(31%,p(0.001), whereas ASMA were detected in 72%(p<0.001), IC in 23%(p(0.01) and low C4 level in 57%(p(0.001). No abnormality was found in the control group.The prevalence of low C4 was signifi_ cantly higher in WRl-2(66%,p=0.03) than in the WR3-6 group. Conclusion.Autoantibodies production is an early finding in HIV infection,preceding the onset of overt immunodefi_ ciency,with possible pathogenetic LYMPHOCYTE G. Opelz*, K. Schimpf**. *Institute of Immunology, University of Heidelberg, *Rehabilitation Hospital and Hemophilia Center, Heidelberg, FRG Immune parameters were studied in 86 hemophilia patients (6 with AIDS) and 87 healthy controls. We found lymphocytotoxic alloantibodies in HIV+ (HIV positive) sera which reacted preferentially with B lymphocytes but also with T lymphocytes and which reacted more frequently at 4C than at 37C. The antibodies were not directed against HIV induced structures on T lymphocytes and they were reactive with both CD4+ In addition to were which coated patient lymphocytes in-vivo. Increased proportions of in-vivo antibody coated cells were found 'in 37 of 86 hemophilia patients. Antibody binding was labile so that the immunoglobulins were partially removed from the lymphocyte surface by washing. The autoreactive antibodies were of IgG and IgM type, fixed complement as demonstrated by increased anti-C3d+ cells in the patients' blood, and reacted with CD4+ as well as CD8+ lymphocytes. There was a statistically significant correlation of increased Ig+ cells in whole blood with HIV infection, decreased CD4/CD8 ratios, increased serum neopterin levels, and abnormal in-vitro responses to pooled allogeneic stimulator cells or CD3 monoclonal antibody. Patients with increased Ig+ cells were lymphopenic, had decreased absolute counts of CD4+, CD25+, CD21+ and OKM5+ cells, and higher percentages of CD8+ and OKIa+ cells in their blood than patients with normal levels of Ig+ cells. Our data suggest a role of autoreactive antilymphocyte antibodies in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency. 195 [Page 196](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/194) 2129 PRODUCTION OF AN INHIBITOR OF THE TAC MOLECULE FROM HIV-INFECTED SUBJECTS' ADHERENT CELLS. A. AMMAR, Y. Hop. Paul Brousse Villejuif, FRANCE. Adherent cells from some AIDS patients produce spontaneously an activity which inhibits proliferation of normal T cells through decreased expression of the Tac molecule of Interleukin 2 receptor (IL 2-R)1. We studied the production of this activity during the different clinical stages of HIV-1 infection as well as its relationship with virus products. Fetal calf serum-free media conditioned (CM) by patients' unstimulated adherent cells were tested for inhibition of Tac expression on mitogen stimulated normal T cells. The inhibitory activity was detected in 60%, 56% and 50% patients with ARC, LAS and asymptomatic subjects, respectively. The CM displayed a specific activity (ID50) ranging between 0.12-0.50 ug of protein/l10 cells. These CM did not contain neither RT activity nor detectable HIV-1 antigen and could not infect normal T lymphocytes. Western Blot analysis of concentrated proteins could not reveal either HIV-1 proteins (recognized by moAbs against the gpl20 and p24) or antibodies against these proteins. Moreover, moAbs against these proteins could not abolish the inhibitory activity of the CM. Northern analysis of T-cell mRNA with a specific Tac cDNA probe revealed that the inhibitory activity decreases the transcription of the Tac gene. These results strongly suggest that this inhibitor is of cellular origin and block the transcription of certain genes important for the T cell activation. 1. LUNARDI-ISKANDAR et al. Leuk. Res. 11: 753, 1987. 2130 R.H. Tomar, P.A. John, A.K. Hennig, D.C. Blair, L. Peer, R. Oates, L. Miller, P. Woodhall. SUNY-HSC, Syracuse, N.Y. HIV infection initiates a series of events progressing to AIDS. These events produce serum changes which may provide clues to immunopathogenesis and be useful as indicators of the stage of infection. We have measured four serum factors in subjects at different stages of HIV infection. Soluble Interleukin-2 receptors (sIL-2R) were determined by an Elisa. Paraproteins were established by serum immunofixation or immunoelectrophoresis. Antilymphocyte antibodies (ALA) were measured by immunofluorescence with cell lines as targets and flow cytometry read out. Serum inhibition (Inhib.) was performed using PHA, 20% serum and 100,000 cells/well. Asymptomatic, antibody positive subjects usually had elevated levels of sIL-2R. Paraproteins, usually IgGkappa, were often present in this group. Antilymphocyte antibodies were not usually found until individuals developed lymphadenopathy or ARC. Serum inhibition of \"normal\" lymphocyte proliferation was not seen until late in the course of infection, i.e., AIDS or ARC (TABLE). Patterns emerge defining the stage of infection and perhaps, response to therapy. We believe that this information also provides insights in the pathogenesis of AIDS. TABLE(no.positive/no.tested) HIV-1 INFECTION R4 1rbis Rudolf IF Kunze P Trinkler, R Krasser, B HSkarabis HD Erlangen; FRG. Objective: In three clinical stages of HIV-1 infection 8 subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and 16 serum parameters were analysed. Methods: PBMC of 45 HIV-1 the CD5 lymphocyte antigen, human granulocytes and monocyte-U937 cell line. The pattern of values in the clinical stages was compared to a controlgroup (n=15) and analysed using the SPSS software. Results: 1. Independend of the clinical staging a decrease of Leu8+ cells in the CD4+ subset was observed as well as increase of the subset CD8+Leu8,. A decrease of the subset CD16+Cdll+ accompained by an increase of Leu7+CD8+ (p<.05) was also seen in A, B and C. 2. Already 14 of 16 serum parameters were outside of the normal range (p< 0.05) in A, where also the greatest deviation from the normal range were found (IC, IgM). The titers of AAB were enhanced in all clinical groups. 3. Statistical analysis was performed to find out which parameters discriminate between the clinical groups and reflect the staging. The greatest influence on the discriminance have IC, IgM and AAB against CD5. Conclusions: These results demonstrate wide ranging alterations of the immune system already at a time when no clinical signs of HIV-1 infection are detectable. 2132 DETECTION OF HIV ANTIGEN AND ANTIBODIES AFTER SOLUBILIZATION OF IMMUNE COMPLEXES. Tilt Mathiesen, V-A. Sundqvist, E. Ohlsson and B. Wahren Dept. of Virology, National Bacteriological Laboratory, and Dept. of Neurosurgery, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. Objective. This study was undertaken to study HIV antigen and antibodies following solubilization of immune complexes by a method simple enough for use in routine serology. Methods. Acid hydrolysis was used to solubilize immune complexes in serum and CSF samples from HIV-infected patients and healthy controls. HIV p24 antigen, HIV IgG1-4 antibodies and anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) antibodies were measured in serum and CSF from 15 HIVinfected patients and 10 healthy, controls. Serum levels of HIV p24 antigen were measured in 13 additional HIVinfected patients and 15 additional controls. Results. Before treatment, low levels of HIV p24 antigen could be detected in two patients. After hydrolysis, HIV p24 levels rose in one of these patient sera and HIV p24 became detectable in 8 additional samples. The controls remained negative. A concomitant increase in HIV antibodies was seen. An increase in HIV antibodies without corresponding HIV p24 antigen increase was demonstrated in 11 patients. After, but not before, acid hydrolysis, anti-MBP antibodies were found in serum from 7 and in CSF from 8 patients. Conclusion. Acid hydrolysis appears to be a method to solubilize immune complexes. We have demonstrated that some of the complexes in HIV-infected patients contain HIV antigen and antibodies and also antibodies against MBP. 196 [Page 197](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/195) 2133 CIRCULATING IMMUNE COMPLEXES (CIC) IN HOMOSEXUAL MEN WITH HIV INFECTION Clive Loveday and IVD Weller Academic Department of Genito-Urinary Medicine, University and Middlesex School of Medicine, London. Objective. To measure the CIC concentration and their immunoglobulin(Ig) composition in patients with HIV infection; to determine the relationship between the levels of these complexes and serum concentrations of Ig and HIV p24 antigen. Methods.One hundred negative controls (30 homosexuals and 30 heterosexuals) were studied. CIC concentrations and 6omposition were measured by a conglutinin binding assay (Flexia 1) and confirmed by PEG precipitation. Ig classes and subclasses were measured by radial immunodiffusion. HIV p24 antigen was determined by enzyme immunoassay. 90% of GroupII &10T There was an inverse relationship between the number of Ig classes in complexes and the stage of HIV disease,GroupIV having a significantly higher frequency of only 1 Ig class, largely IgG, compared to GroupIII and II(p=0.02 and 0.0005,respectively). At no stage was a direct relationship between serum Ig levels and CIC concentrations or composition seen. In asymptomatic GroupIV patients there was an inverse relationship between serum p24 and CIC concentrations, Conclusions.We observed raised CIC levels in the majority of patients with HIV infectionan inverse relationship between complex Ig and length of disease, and no relationship to serum Ig levels. 2134 CORRELATION OF PERSISTENT IMMUNE COMPLEXES AND ABNORMAL T4/T8 RATIOS IN HIV INFECTION W John W Morrow*, C Christian*, S Roy*, H Bank, San Francisco; ***University of California, Berkeley; CA Objective. To assess the immunopathologic role of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in HIV infection. Methods. We used the data base and the serum bank of the San Francisco Men's Health Study (SFMHS), a longitudinal clinical and epidemiological investigation conducted since 1983. A group of 4276 specimens of sera from 1023 (including 811 homosexual or bisexual) men were tested for CIC using a modification of the Immunomedics Elisa test Kit. The test is based on monoclonal anti-Clq coupled to solid phase for capturing CIC from the test serum and detection of the CIC with either anti-IgG or with anti-IgM probes. Results. Seropositive Seronegative Seronegative Homosexuals Homosexual Heterosexual Total at start 405 406 2] Seroconversion N/A 30 CIC detected anytime 228 53 ] Persistent CIC detected 96 (13M & 84G) 8 (4M & 6G)* Persistent CIC with persistent T4/T8 < 0.9 92 (56)\" 3 (2M &2G)' No CIC detected 207 322 19 No CIC with persistent 172 (93)\" 81 T4/T8 <0.9 *Total less than the sum due to specimens with both IgG and IgM CIC **AIDS/ARC. Conclusion. Although persistent IgM and IgG CIC are most frequently encountered in HIV-seropositive homosexual/bisexual men, they are not an indicator of disease progression as assessed by T4/T8 abnormalities, or clinical signs and symptoms of AIDS/ARC.

CONCLUSION.(a)The Clq-BA of sera is already altered at the onset of HIV-infection and varies early according to the disease activity; (b) elevated Clq-BA seems to result from the B cells hyperactivity.In our experience,the Clqbinding test represents a useful tool to follow HIV-infected patients as well as the determination of the OKT4 cells. 2136 SOME EFFECTS OF CHRONIC HIV INFECTION ON THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM Clive Loveday and IVD Weller Academic Department of Genito-urinary Medicine, University and Middlesex School of Medicine, London.

One hundred and forty two homosexual,antiHIV positive patients and 60 controls were studied. Total complement(CH50) and components Clq,C4,C3,C5, Clinh. and factor B were measured.Acute activation was evaluated by C3 conversion and C3d generation. Results. CH50 levels and components increased with duration of HIV infection compared to control values: Hetero. Neg.Homo.

Eight patients in GIII and IV (4,4) had prompt rises in CH50 and components during bacterial infections (mean CH50 123u/ml increased to 187u/ml). In 7 patients with PCP an increase in CH50 preceded the clinical/histological diagnosis and paralleled the course of illness, falling to normal in the second week of treatment (Mean CH50 2-4 weeks before admission:130u/ml; 1 week before admission 217u/ml). Conclusions. Resting CH50 and components increased with duration of HIV infection. The complement system appears to remain functional,responding to acute bacterial infections. Complement changes associated with PCP may be of early diagnostic value. 197 Center,Hippocration Hospit., Athens,Greece. In the present study we estimated the (S-82m) concentration in 21 Hemophiliacs positive for HIV and 17-HIV positive carriers.The S-62m levels were measured by the Phadebas RIA(Pharmacia). In the same patients we evaluated the Fc-IgG-L. R. of their Lymphocytes.The mononuclear cells were separated from the whole heparinized venous Blood after gradient centrifugation.The mature phagocytes were eliminated carbonyl iron phagocytosis and magnetism.The Fc-IgG-L.R. cells were enumerated by using Latex particles coated with human IgG.The S-62m concentration found in healthy Greek donors is 1.5+0.6mg/L.The X value of percentages of Fc-IgG pos. cells found in the same population is 17.34%-7.32.In our study the X value of S-62m found in HIV-carriers is 1.303 mg% and not_statistically significant (s. sg.).The Fc-IgG X value of percentages of cells found in HIV-carriers was 43% and in HIV-Dos.Hemophiliacs with S-62m>1.5mg%.The significance of S-62m is not until now clear but is more clear the high %of Fc-IgG-L.High numb.of Fc-Tg \"G-L.R.might predict a bad prognosis were able to enhance Fc-R bu uIsing 62m and to inhibit then by anti-62m in vitro 2138 CHANGES OF INTRATHECAL IMMUNOGLOBULIN PRODUCTION AND SIGNS OF IMPAIRED BLOOD-BRAINBARRIER FUNCTION IN HIV SEROPOSITIVE INDIVIDUALS DURING A FOLLOW UP PERIOD Lars Hagberg*, A Forsman**, E Rybo***, L Svennerholm***, of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, ****Dept of Virology, Stockholm Method. Cerebrospinal fluid and sera was analyzed in 15 HIV seropositive individuals twice with 1-1I year interval. Concentration of IgG and albumin were determined by the forced immunodiffusion method, and CSF IgG index was determined. The blood-brain-barrier function was measured as the albumin quotient. Results. Four patients with AIDS or ARC lowered the intrathecal immunoglobulin production and 3 significantly raised the albumine quotient above the normal value 7.2 during the follow up period. Two patients with Guillain Barre in association with the primary HIV infection raised the IgG index but fell in the albumin quotient. Among 9 asymptomatic or LAS patients 4 had raised IgG index in the first analyzis and 3 in the second one year later. One asymptomatic patient had pathologic blood-brain-barrier damage in the first sample and two during follow up. A slight increase not reaching above the limit for normal value in albumin quotient were seen in 5 asymptomatics and LAS patients during the period. Conclusion. The intrathecal immunoglobulin production in HIV positive individuals is gradually lowered in late stages of infection and signs of blood-brain-barrier damage has a tendency to increase. Notes: 2139 CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) CHANGES IN HIV-1 INFECTION Mats Andersson, T Bergstrdm, C Blomstrand, S Hermodsson, C Hakansson, G-B Liwhagen Sahlgren's Objective. of intrathecal IgG response in neurologically asymptomatic HIV-infected patients. Methods. Thirtyfour consecutive HIV-seropositive patients (Mean age:36 years) were given a neurological examination and a lumbar puncture. Twentytwo of them were repunctured J-1 year later. Fifteen patients fulfilled the criteria for lymphadenopathy syndrome. Only 4 had neurological symptoms possibly related to HIV. The duration of the HIV infection could be determined in 23 patients. CSF and serum were examined with cytology, protein quantifications, isoelectric focusing (IEF) and HIV antigen test. HIV antibodies were studied with ELISA and Western blot (WB). Results. CSF lymphocytosis was found in 21 patients and increased IgG index as sign of intrathecal immunoglobulin production in 2 patients. A significant correlation was found between duration of HIV infection and increase in CSF mononuclear cells, increased intrathecal IgG production and number of CSF enriched gamma bands at IEF. All patients had HIV antibodies in CSF detectable with WB (2 patients only against 1 protein band). Only 5 patients sera and no CSF sample were positive in the HIV-antigen test. No signs of opportunistic infections was found in serologic screening or attempted virus isolation. Conclusion. Increasing intrathecal B-lymphocyte activation seems to be a frequent phenomenon in the natural history of the HIV infection. 2140 PATTERN OF CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID HIV MARKERS IN AIDS FREE PATIENTS AT VARIOUS STAGES FROM INFECTION R. ITALY. Introduction. We studied the pattern of CSF markers to HIV in relation to the serological profile at various months from infection. Methods. 26 serum and CSF samples were simultaneously collected from 23 HIV-Ab +ve neurologically symptomless Blot Results. The various serum-Ab were found at different concentrations in all pat. The following table summarizes the pattern of CSF HIV markers: N.of samples months from inf. HIV-Ag Ab anti-env. Ab anti-core.(6 - + 5 6-14 - + 6 14-24 - + + 14 )24 - + +/~ Among the 14 old infected pat. 9 showed all CSF and serum Ab. In the other 5 a fall of CSF anti-core preceded the serological one. Conclusions. The CSF HIV-Ag is perhaps present only at earliest times of inf. The CSF HIV-Ab, in early stages, appear later as compared with serological profile (particularly those to core-Ag). This is of diagnostic relevance allowing distinction among primary inf., reinfection or endogenous reactivation. In old inf. pat. the CSF profile may assume a prognostic value anticipating the serological fall of anti-core Ab. We think that CSF-Ab may indicate not only the local immune response to CNS infection, but even the movement through the BBB of activated lymphocytes and/or the physiological diffusion of serum Ab (thus reflecting, at lower concentration, the serological situation). 198 [Page 199](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/197) 2141 C GES IN CEREBROSPINAL FLUID WITH INCREASING DURATION OF HIV-1 INFECTION AND NEUROLOGICAL FINDINGS: THE MULTICENTER AIDS COHORT STUDY (MACS) Guillermo van Wielink, JC McArthur, H Farzadegan, T Moench, I T Johnson, BF Polk. Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore MD, USA Obiective. To correlate changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with duration of HIV-1 infection and neurological findings. Methods. CSF was obtained from 38 neurologically normal HIV-1 seropositive homosexual men participating in the MACS, 29 of whom had a documented time of seroconversion (SC) and from 22 patients with AIDS or ARC and neurological findings (either symptoms or signs of CNS dysfunction; CNS opportunistic infections excluded). Intrathecal synthesis (ITS) of anti-HIV IgG was determined by ELISA and HIV-1 virus isolation by antigen capture. Results. ABNOMAL CS YRS (33%) 2 (22%) 2 (22%) The differences were not significant when related to duration of infection. However, ITS was present in 18/22 (81%) with neurological findings conpared to 7/38 (18%) without neurological findings (p<0.001, Chi-square). Conclusion. These studies confirm that the nervous system is an early target for infection with HIV-1 and delineate the CSF changes with increasing duration of infection. Intrathecal synthesis of anti-HIV IgG correlates with neurological findings. 2142 AND CHARACTERISATION OF CYTOTOXIC T LYMPHOCYTES DERIVED FROM CEREBROSPINAL FLUID OF AN AIDS PATIENT Krishan K Sethi*, I Stroehmann**, H Niiher*** *Progen Biotechnical Laboratories Heidelberg, **Medical Clinic, University of Bonn, ***Department of Dermatology, University of Heidelberg Objective. To demonstrate CTLs in CSF, to clone them and to characterize their phenotypes and HLA restriction patterns. Methods. T lymphocytes collected from CSF of an AIDS patient were cloned by limiting dilution and expanded with 11-2. Using a selected panel for HIV-I infected target cells the clones were characterized for their HLA restriction patterns. Phenotypes of the clones were determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Results. 7 clones displaying T4- and T8+ phenotypes mediated lysis of HIV-I infected cells in the context of HLA class I antigens. 2 clones demonstrated HIV-I specific lytic activities, which were apparently restricted by HLA class II antigens and both of these clones showed T3+, T4+, T8 -and Ia+ phenotype. Conclusion. CSF of AIDS patients can contain CTLs, which can be shown to lyse HIV-I infected cells in vitro and belong to different T cell subpopulations. Whether CTLs in vivo help with the elimination of the virus or are involved in the pathogenesis of T cell depletion and/or of neurological disorders remains to be elucidated. Notes: 2143 INTRATHECAL SYNTHESIS OF HIV-ANTIBODIES: EARLY MAPKER PREDICTING THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) INVOLVEMENT IN HIV-I of Padova, Italy. Objective. HIV-I infection results in a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including neurological disorders. Looking for an early marker which could reflect the CNS infection, we studied the intrathecal synthesis of HIV-antibodies (HIV-Ab) in HIV-infected subjects without neurological complications. Methods. The intrathecal synthesis was investigated in 36 patients, ranging from WR1-WR6 stages, by detection of HIV-Ab in serum and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) by Western blot, IgG index, IgG oligoclonal bands (OB) in serum and CSF by isoelectric focusing. Results. The IgG OB were detected in 12 out of 36 subjects, independently of the WR stage. The affinity driven transfer of focused IgG to HIV-I precoated nitrocellulose showed that same IgG were HIV specific. Evaluating all the parameters, 27 patients, including WR1 subjects, had intrathecal synthesis of HIV-Ab and the patterns of HIV-Ab detected in serum and in the paired CSF are different in 20 cases. Finally direct evidence of intrathecal synthesis of HIV-Ab was provided by in vitro production of HIV-Ab from CSF lymphocytes. Conclusions. These results indicate that CNS infection occurs frequently and at early stage of HIV-I infection. 2144 HIV ISOLATION FROM CEREBROSPINAL FLUID IN RELATION TO IMMUNOLOGICAL DEFICIENCY AND NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS Anders S6nnerborg*, A *The Central Microbiological Laboratory of Stockholm County Council, **Roslagstull Hospital, *** Danderyds Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Objective. To study the frequency of positive HIV isolation from CSF in HIV infected patients in relation to immunological deficiency, neurological symptoms and duration of the HIV infection. Methods. The cells in five ml of CSF were collected by low speed centrifugation. The cellfree CSF was then centrifuged at 30.000 rpm for one hour.The cells and the pelleted material were inoculated within five hours from lumbar puncture onto human peripheral mononuclear cells grown in RPMI medium. The culture supernatants were assayed for HIV antigen with anantigen capture ELISA. Results. HIV was recovered to an equally high extent from patients with PGL, ARC or AIDS (71%, 68%, 63%, respectively) and to a lower extent (36%) from patients without clinical signs of immune system dysfunction. The rate of positive isolations was similar in three groups with different degrees of immunodeficiency, but low in the group with normal immunological values (p<0.05). The recovery rates appeared to be unrelated to the duration of the infection. HIV was recovered as often from patients with neurological symptoms as from patients without symptoms. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that the majority of the patients have central nervous system (CNS) involvement early in the course of the HIV infection and that HIV replication in CNS may occur in the absence of o pronounced systemic cellular immunodeficiency and frequently without causing neurological symptoms. 199 [Page 200](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/198) 2145 CSF FINDINGS IN ASYMPTOMATIC (AS) Marshall, USAF Medical Center, Lackland AFB, Texas, USA Objective. To describe CSF findings in HIV+ AS individuals (with or without lymphadenopathy, no cutaneous anergy, and >400 CD4 lymphocytes/cmm. Methods. 426 HIV+ AS patients had CSF studies including nucleated (nuc) cells, protein, IgG, IgG Index (IgG-I), IgG Synthesis (IgG-S), and Oligoclonal Bands (OB). All patients had neurological exams. Results. 59.2% had at least 1 CSF abnormality (Abn), 28.4% had 3 or more Abn, and 8.7% had 5 or 6 Abn. Overall 9.9% had CSF proteins >56mg/dl, 13.6% had nuc cell counts No HIV related Abn findings on neurological exam seen regardless of CSF findings. N=373* Mean S.D. Range *(Albumin Cells 5.97 A correlation matrix revealed no relationship between cell count or protein and any other parameter. Conclusion. CSF abnormalities are frequently seen in asymptomatic neurologically normal HIV infected individuals, including increased Intra-Blood-BrainBarrier IgG. 2146 SYMPTOMATIC AND ASYMPTOMATIC HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS AT EARLY AND LATE STAGES OF INFECTION Eloaaara, I Seppdld, E Neurologq and Bacteriology and Immunology University of Helsinki, Aurora Hospital, Helsinki The intrathecal B-cell response was analyzed in 42 patients at various stages of HIV infection. Eighteen neurologically symptomatic patients had, when compared to neurologically symptom-free patients, intraBBB the CSF and/ or serum (11/18 vs 3/24). The neurological patients at early stages (ASX, LAS) showed increased total intrathecal IgG synthesis (9/9) coincident with OCBs in serum (7/9) slight mononuclear pleocytosis (7/9), IgG production within the CNS (6/9). In advanced infection (ARC, AIDS), the proportion of neurological patients with intrathecal HIV-specific IgG synthesis (8/9) was higher, while the proportion of those with increased total intra-BBB IgG synthesis (5/9, level leukocyte count (1/9; p(0.001) were lower than at early infection. In addition, neurological patients had, when compared to non-neurological subjects, elevated CSF(2.2 mg/1) results indicate intra-BBBhumoral immunoactivation in early stages of HIV infection and declining B-cell response at advanced infection. Elevated beta-2-microglobulin may, in the absence of BBB impairment, serve as a marker of HIV-related CNS 1. Depts of Immunology and Internal Medicine, Rikshospitalet, Oslo. 2. Dept of Virology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm. 3.Dept of Infectious Diseases, Ostra Hospital, Gothenburg. 4. Dept of Virology, Stockholm City Council Central Microbiological Laboratory, Stockholm. Objective: to investigate the occurrence of an intrathecal antibody (Ab) response to HIV in different stages of HIV infection. Methods: sera and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from 29 HIV infected individuals were analysed for Abs to HIV and to HIV gp41 by ELISA. A \"CSF HIV Ab index\" (CSF/serum ratio of HIV Ab titers divided by CSF/serum ratio of albumin) was used to evaluate intrathecal Ab synthesis. An imprint immunofixation (IIF) method was used for additional analysis of HIV IgG Abs and for analysis of Abs to seven other viral and microbial antigens. Results: elevated CSF HIV Ab indices indicating intrathecal Ab synthesis were observed in 19 (65%) of the 29 patients. These comprised 1 of 3 asymptomatic carriers, and 2 of 3 cases with PGL, 8 of 9 with ARC and 8 of 11 with AIDS. Intrathecal Ab synthesis to HIV gp41 was observed in 5 of 23 tested. IIF disclosed intrathecal synthesis of HIV IgG Abs in 11 of 13 tested; intrathecal Ab responses to other infectious agents were not detected except in one case of ARC. Conclusion: the results confirm previous report on intrathecal HIV Ab synthesis in HIV infected patients and suggest that HIV may reach the brain at an early stage of the infection. 2148 MYELIN BASIC PROTEIN WITHIN THE CEREBROSPINAL FLUID AS A MARKER FOR THE subcortical demyelination. An elevation of myelin basic protein (MBP) levels within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be a marker of central nervous system demyelination as shown in patients with multiple sclerosis. To study the role of CSF BMP as a useful and early marker of HIV-encephalitis we investigated CSF samples of 40 consecutive patients with HIV-infection of various stages. Methods. MBP reactivity was measured using a radioimmunoassay technique. MBP levels greater than 4.6 ng/ml were considered as clearly elevated, from 3.4 to 4.6 ng/ml as marginally elevated. CSF MBP levels were correlated with the neurological findings and the presence or absence of CSF abnormalities (cell count, protein, oligoclonal bands). Results. CSF MBP was clearly elevated in 2 patients (5.0 and 5.3 ng/ml, respectively), one of whom presented with severe dementia and one with moderate dementia and severe myelopathy associated with HIV-infection. However, in 11 patients who showed neurological findings and/or CSF abnormalities consistent with HIV-infection of the brain CSF MBP levels were marginally elevated in 5 patients and normal in 6 patients. Conclusion. Our results indicate that CSF MBP is no sensitive marker of HIV encephalitis. The 2 patients with marked increase of MBP levels experienced a rapid course of the disease. Chronic progressive courses of multiple sclerosis show no MBP elevation. It is speculated that the lack of MBP elevation in most patients with HIV-encephalitis is also due to the mainly slowly progressive course of this disease. 200 [Page 201](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/199) 2149 ISOLATION FREQUENCY AND CHARACTERIZATION OF HIV FROM CEREBROSPINAL FLUID AND BLOOD OF PATIENTS WITH VARYING SEVERITY OF HIV NFECTION. 3 3 Francesca CHIQDI, Albeit J., Lindqvist of Virology, Karolinska Institute; 2. National Bacteriological Laboratory; 4. Dept of Virology, Stockholm County Council, Central Microbiological Laboratory, Stockholm; 3. Dept of Infectious Diseases, Ostra Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Objective: isolation of HIV has been attempted from the CSF of 63 subjects at different stages of HIV infection, including asymptomatic carriers and patients with or without neurologic/psychiatric complications. In addition blood was collected from 40 of these subjects for virus isolation. Methods: isolation of HIV-1 from CSF and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and transmission to T-lymphoid and monocytoid cell lines. Restriction enzyme analysis of DNA by southern blotting. Results:HIV could be isolated from the CSF at all clinical stages and there was not much variation in isolation frequency at early and late stages of HIV infection (45 and 37%, respectively). In contrast the frequency of HIV isolation from the blood was 32% at the early stages and 77% in the late stages. HIV isolation from the CSF was more frequently positive in patients with neurologic/psychiatric complications than in patients showing no such disturbances (48 and 32% respectively). Conclusion: The results suggest that whatever the mechanism for the increase in frequency of virus isolation from the blood, it does not operate beyond the blood-brain barrier. Viruses obtained from paired CSF and blood Samples showed in some cases distinct replication.pattern. To establish the degree of similarity between CSF and blood isolates, biological and genomic characterization of the paired viruses will be carried out. 2150 CELLULARTROPISM OF NONCYTOCIDAL AND CYTOCIDAL ISOLATES OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS HIV FROM PATIENTS WITH NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. Rita Anand*, S.S. VedBrat** and R.J. Wyatt*, *National Institute of Mental Health, St. Elizabeth Hospital, Washington DC,**Braton Biotech Inc, Rockville, MD, USA. Objective. Cellular Tropism was studied to better understand the pathogenesis of AIDS caused by the neurological isolates of HIV. Methods. Cytocidal isolate (HIV-BR or NAl) as well as non-cytocidal isolates (NA4 and NA5) were obtained from infected patients with neurological disorders (Anand et al 1987, The Lancet II: 234). Susceptibility of different cell types, such as Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PMNCs) and established cell lines of monocytic, neuronal and glial origin, was investigated using Reverse Transcriptase (RT) activity as an indicator of virus production. Results. Both T4 and T8 positive fractions of PMNCs elicited high RT activity following infection. Since monocytes were not removed from these T-cell fractions, purified monocytic cell preparations, obtained by panning of PMNCs with OKMl antibodies, were also tested. Monocytic lines revealed active infection with cytocidal as well as non-cytocidal isolates. Cultures infected with cytocidal isolates, however, revealed higher RT activity. Monocytic cultures showed higher RT activity than glial and neuronal cultures for 45 days. Conclusion. The possible presence of a non-T4 viral receptor molecule common on monocytic, neuronal and glial cells as indicated by the cellular tropism and the ongoing studies on cell surface antigen expression will be elaborated. Notes: 2151 LOW REPLICATIVE HIV-1 ISOLATES FROM AN AIDS PATIENT: VIRUS EXPRESSION IN NATURAL TARGET CELLS * ** * Suzanne Gartner, R. Zeman, H. Lischner, R.C. Gallo, M. Popovic Lab. of Tumor Cell Biology, NCI/NIH Bethesda, MD, USA St. Christopher's Children's Hosp. Philadel. PA, USA Objective. To evaluate the level of virus replication in monocyte/macrophages (M/M) and T lymphocytes infected with either of two HIV-1 isolates from different tissues from an AIDS patient and to identify factors that modulate virus expression. Methods. The HIV-1 isolates were assayed for their replicative capacity in normal M/M and T cells and in neoplastic cell lines. Virus expression was evaluated by reverse transcriptase assay, immunoperoxidase staining for viral proteins and in situ hybridization for viral mRNA. Results. HTLV-III was recoverable by cocultivation of patient CG's brain tissue with normal peripheral blood-derived M/M, but not with normal T cells. In contrast, HTLV-III CG was recoverable by cocultivation of this child's thymicthissue with normal T cells but not with M/M. Using the same multiplicities of infection, these isolates exhibited a 50-100-fold lower ability to infect both normal M/M and T cells when compared with HTLV-III and HTLV-IIIBa-L, HIV-1 isolates with high replicative potential. Similarly, the percentage of virus-positive cells and the level of viral mRNA expression were significantly lower. Replication of these two isolates was not accompanied by detectable cytopathic effects. Furthermore, CD4+ neoplastic cells could not be productively infected with these isolates. Conclusion: These findings extend the observation reported by Asjo et al (Lancet, 1986) by demonstrating that even an individual with full-blown AIDS can be a source of low replicative HIV-1. Preliminary results regarding the modulation of HTLV-III _b expression in M/M by humoral and cellular factors an- its relevance to the pathogenesis of the disease will be described. 2152 THE CLINICAL FEATURES OF CMV ENCEPHALITIS IN AIDS Joseph R. Berqer*, J Gregorios* *University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami Objective. To determine whether the clinical features of cytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis in AIDS are sufficiently specific to allow for the diagnosis in the absence of tissue specimens. Methods. A retrospective chart review of 14 AIDS patients with pathologically confirmed CMV encephalitis was performed. Special attention was given to the neurological examination, neuroradiological features and CSF findings. Results. The neurological features were diverse. An altered mental status was invariable and focal findings and seizures were frequently observed. Brain CT scan findings could be normal or reveal diffuse atrophy or focal, contrast-enhancing lesions. CSF was normal or showed a mononuclear pleocytosis and elevated protein. Conclusion. The clinical features of CMV encephalitis in AIDS are nonspecific and insufficient to allow for diagnosis in the absence of pathological confirmation. 201 [Page 202](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/200) 2153 EYE MOVEMENT ABNORMALITIES AS A PREDICTOR OF THE AIDS DEMENTIA COMPLEX Jon Currie(l,2), Elizabeth Benson(3), Ben Ramsden(l), Michael Perdices(4), David Cooper(4). (1) Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria, Australia; (2) Save Sight & Eye Health Research Institute, Sydney; (3) Monash University Medical School; (4) NHMRC Special Unit in AIDS, Sydney. Objectives: to determine whether the severity of the AIDS dementia complex (ADC) can be correlated with abnormalities of eye movement and whether these eye movement abnormalities can be detected prior to the onset of clinical dementia. Methods: we used infrared oculography to record the eye movements in HIV seropositive (HIV+) or AIDS patients with or without ADC and correlated the results with neuropsychometric evaluation. Results: Eye movement abnormalities (EMA's) were present in all patients with mild, moderate or severe ADC and in 86% of AIDS or asymptomatic HIV+ patients at risk for ADC, but without clinical dementia. These EMA's included disturbances of both saccadic and smooth pursuit function and their severity correlated strongly with the severity of dementia. The abnormalities were qualitatively similar to those found in Alzheimer's disease but quantitatively less severe. Conclusions: Recording of eye movements is a valuable, non-invasive technique for the early detection of neurologic dysfunction in asymptomatic HIV seropositive or AIDS patients, even prior to other clinical evidence of ADC. In particular, it may be of use in selecting high risk patients requiring antiviral therapy and in monitoring the neurological response to such treatment. 2154 CSF HIV IMMUNOLOGY IN SOME NEUROLOGIC SYNDROMES OF AIDS Pearl Ma. Margaret McCaffrey, J. Masdeu St. Vincent's Medical Center of New York, New York Eighty-seven (87) patients with neurologic symptoms were referred for HIV antibody testing. Forty-seven (47) of these had also HIV-antigen determination [EIAAbbott]. Detailed clinical findings were available in 37 patients. The CSF HIV findings are listed in the following table: Antigen Antibody Number Total 47 99.99 HIV antibody was present in all cases but one of cerebral opportunistic infection (7) and in all cases of neoplasm (3), HIV encephalitis (10) and myelitis (3). HIV antigen, however, was present in none of the neoplasms but in approximately one third of the other groups (28% of opportunistic infections; 30% of encephalitis and Notes: OF INFECTION IN CEREBROSPINAL FLUID OF HIV SEROPOSITIVE PATIENTS WITH AND WITHOUT NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. C. Caudie*, 03 - FRANCE AIDS is frequently complicated by neurological lesions due to direct HIV infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Opportunistic infections and lymphomas may also develop in the CNS. In this report we assayed CSF cytology, intrathecal synthesis of HIV specific antibodies as compared to serum antibodies, presence of oligoclonal bands (OB), presence of HIV antigen in CSF and blood and beta 2 microglobulin. 30 adults with HIV infection were investigated. No significant correlation between these results and clinical neurological status was found. Intrathecal synthesis of antibodies to HIV and of total IgG, presence of oligoclonal bands, were found both in patients with and without AIDS or AIDS related complex. Increased p 2m concentration was found not only in the sera but also in CSF, levels being sometimes higher in CSF than in serum especially in patients with neurological toxoplasmosis or HIV encephalitis ( > 3000 jg/1). Modification of cell and protein profile of CSF still appears difficult to describe precisely. However signs of alterations are found early in the course of HIV infection and may be further amplified when HIV encephalitis develops. 2156 NEUROLOGICAL HIV INFECTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH A DEFECTIVE ANTIGEN SPECIFIC T CELL RESPONSE. Annamari Ranki*, S. Mattinen**, I. Elovaara***, A. Lagerstedt**, and *Department of Dermatology, University Central Hospital, Helsinki, **Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Tampere, and ***Aurora Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. Objective. To compare the immunological profile of HIV infected individuals with and without neurological involvement. Methods. 20 HIV infected men were followed up for 2 years with repeated immunological and neurological studies including CSF analyses. Results. 10 men had neurological involvement and 10 had not; the clinical status varied from asymptomatic to AIDS in both groups. The neurological group had slightly but not *significantly decreased T-helper cell numbers but clearly lower response to a recall antigen, PPD than the group without neurological symptoms. None of the patients with a normal PPD response had liquor oligoclonal bands; these patients also less frequently had inflammatory cells in the CSF. Conclusion. The low or absent T cell response in HIV infection may be caused by infection of antigen presenting dendritic cells and macrophages. These cells may also be responsible for the spread of the infection to the central nervous system. 202 [Page 203](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/201) 2157 NEUROLOGICAL COURSES Int. Medicine University-Clinic,53 Bonn,W-Germany Objective.Within a compass of a clinical course we have cared for HIV-positive hemophiliacs since Sept./1986.We try to find out with the help of our investigations whether and when occaissions arises which differences exist in the neurological course of our HIV-hemophiliacs in comparison to other HIV-risk groups. Methode.We examined 2ol HIV-hemophiliacs and 28 age-matched controls partly once and partly several times.According to the clinical criteria ( CDC ) the patients were classified.We looked for the progression of the neurological signs and the dynamics of the EEG.Owing to possible bleeding complications in general we renounced on analysing the CSF. Results.Patients of stad. I-III didn't show significant signs for a subacute encephalitis/AIDS Dementia complex but signs of cerebellum,Fasciculus cuneatus/gracilis and polyneuropathies.In general they show a slight progression of these symptoms.Central findings of stad. IV patients correlated statistically (p o,o5 ) with diffuse slowing and focus in EEG. Conclusion.Based on our results it seems that HIV-positives of stad. I-III primarily show extra-cerebrale signs in comparison to stad. IV. Data will be correlated with HTV-cnirse. 2158 MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING FINDINGS IN HEALTHY HIV-1 INFECTED HOMOSEXUAL MEN: THE MULTI-CENTER AIDS COHORT SIDY (MACS) 1 Medical Institutions, Baltimore MD; University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh PA, USA Objective. A longitudinal study is underway to determine the incidence and prevalence of HIV-l-related neurological disorders and to correlate clinical findings with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods. 161 healthy HIV-l-seropositive (SP) and 110 HIV-1 seronegative (SN) homosexual men participating in the MACS were screened for the presence of neurological or neuropsychological disorders. Individuals with ARC or AIDS were excluded from this analysis. 41 HIV-1 SP and 26 SN subjects underwent MRI. MRI's were analyzed for the presence of cortical atrophy and white matter hyperintensities by two independent observers masked to all clinical details except age. Results. Cortical atrophy was noted in 10% of HIV-1 SP individuals compared to 11% of HIV-1 SN men. One or more white matter hyperintensities were observed in 20% of HIV-1 SP and 34% of HIV-1 SN subjects. These differences were not statistically significant (Chisquare). Conclusion. In this group, MRI abnormalities occurred with equal frequency in HIV-1 infected and uninfected individuals. This suggests that the MRI findings are not specific for HIV-1 infection. Sequential study will determine whether MRI is sensitive for the early detection of HIV-1 encephalopathy. Notes: 2159 PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIES ASSOCIATED WITH HIV INFECTION: CLASSIFICATION AND PATHOGENESES David R. Cornblath and Justin C. McArthur Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA Objective. To classify the peripheral neuropathies associated with HIV infection and to study pathogenesis. Methods. 50 individuals with HIV infection and peripheral neuropathy were studied. Results and Conclusions. We found three types of peripheral neuropathy by clinical exam and course, electrodiagnosis and nerve biopsies. Inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, both acute and chronic, is mainly seen in HIV carriers. The disorder is similar to that in not-infected patients. Evidence for immunopathogenesis is based on the findings of endoneurial inflammatory cells, mainly CD8, response to immunosuppression, and presence of circulating antiganglioside antibodies. Multiple mononeuropathies occur in ARC. Nerve biopsies reveal active vasculitis suggesting that this disorder is due to immune complex deposition, a supposition supported by our finding of glomerulonephritis in one patient. Predominantly sensory neuropathy occurs in the late stages of HIV infection and is the most frequent neuropathy. Physiological and pathological findings suggest a combination of axon loss and demyelination. Autopsy studies have suggested a dorsal root ganglionopathy with central peripheral distal axonal degeneration, possibly due to HIV infection. Further studies are necessary to completely characterize the peripheral neuropathies associated with HIV infection and determine pathogenesis. 2160 EVIDENCE IN RHESUS MONKEYS (RM) OF RESTRICTED HIV-1 REPLICATION IN-VITRO AND IN-VIVO Martha A Wells, S Daniel, M Phelan, P Snoy, G Quinnan FDA, CBER, Div. of Virology, Bethesda, MD, U.S.A. Objective. To determine the susceptibility of RM peripheral blood lymphocytes (RM-PBL) to HIV-1 infection and to explore RM as a model of infection. Methods. The capacity of HIV-1 to replicate in RM-PBL and the effect of serial passage of virus in RM-PBL in-vitro were studied. In addition, four juvenile RM were inoculated intravenously with 2.5 x 106TCID50 of cell free virus (CFV). Two of these also received homologous acutely-infected PBL one month later. HIV-1 culture, and Western blots (WB) were performed monthly for 7 months. Results. In three experiments, in-vitro infection of RM-PBL resulted in peak RT activity between 10 and 21 days and 10 to 50% of the cells appeared to be infected by indirect immunofluorescent assay. Replication was transient and was not increased by serial passage of the virus. In one animal inoculated with CFV and one given CFV plus infected PBL antibody responses to env (gp120,160) and gag (p17,24,51) proteins were seen on WB. Despite progressive antibody responses, virus cultures remained negative except for one as yet unduplicated result. Conclusion. HIV-1 can replicate in Rhesus PBL, but replication is restricted in-vitro and in-vivo. Rhesus may provide a model for understanding aspects of the pathogenesis of AIDS. 203 [Page 204](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/202) 2161 G, Grosse G and Heise W OBJECTIVE: We studied the morohological changes in the brains of patients with the AIDS dementia comolex, since previous reports in this respect are not conclusive. METHODS: The brains of 25 patients, dvina of AIDS, were studied by conventional histology. In 5 cases, which have presented the AIDS dementia complex, and in one case with a fulminant encephalitis, the material was studied also by electron microscopy. RESULTS: In the brains of all patients with dementia we found a non inflammatory soongiform enceohalopathv (SE) in the external layers of the frontal and temooral cortex as well as in the basal ganglia and in the thalamus, always more emphasized in the vicinity of cerebrosoinal fluid spaces. Similar chances were found in the case with fulminant encephalitis. Here the distribution of the spongiform change was broader with remarkable damaae also to the brain stem. These changes were not present in the brains of AIDS patients without dementia. Ultrastructurally, these changes were indistincuishable from the spongiosity seen in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings stress that this noninflanmatory SE can be an alternative cause of the AIDS dementia. We have found the SE in all cases with clinicallv diacnosed dementia and it seems obvious that this chancae in AIDS dementia is not an infrequent condition. 2162 PALLIDONIGRAL DEGENERATION IN AIDS: IMPLICATIONS FOR HIV-RELATED B Price*, Departments of Neurology* and Neuropathology** Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York Objectives. To further characterize brain HIV infection associated with pallidonigral degeneration noted in two patients with the AIDS dementia complex (ADC). Methods. The brains of two ADC patients, both with prominent motor impairment consistent with 'basal ganglion dysfunction', were evaluated histologically and virologically (culture, immunocytochemical localization of p25, and in situ hybridization assessing viral mRNA). Results. In both brains there was severe neuronal loss in the globus pallidus (GP) and substantia nigra HIV-infected microglia, macrophages and multinucleated cells were present in the affected brain regions, but despite neuronal degeneration, HIV infection was not detected in neurons or other glial elements. While one brain showed severe generalized HIV encephalitis, infection in the other was largely restricted to the GP and SN. Conclusions. These findings represent an exception to the apparent sparing of neurons in the neuropathological spectrum of ADC, although consistent with its subcortical pathophysiology. Two contrasting, but not mutually exclusive, hypotheses are offered: 1) Productive HIV infection of macrophages and microglia releases products toxic to certain neurons, or 2) Selective HIV targeting of particular neurons explains the localization of infection, and the neighboring infected macrophages and microglia are 'indicator cells' that have low-grade latent neuronal infection. Notes: 2163 CHARACTERIZATION OF HIV ENCEPHALITIS AND ITS ASSOCIATED OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS R Vazeux, MC Cumont, M Brahic, L Montagnier et al., Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. Objectives. To characterize Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) encephalitis by identifying the HIV infected cells, determining which additional pathogens are present as opportunistic infections, and investigating the possible interaction between HIV and the other agents. Methods. We have extensively screened frozen CNS tissue of 60 AIDS patients for the presence of pathogens using a combination of immunohistological staining and in situ hybridization. Several blocks from five different regions of the CNS (hemispheres, basal ganglia, brain stem, cerebellum, spinal cord) were studied from each patient. Results. HIV was detected in 18 of the 60 patients. In 11 of these, a massive and multifocal HIV infection was found with clusters of HIV infected cells in all regions and in almost every section, and 8 others had a lower level of infection. The majority of HIV infected cells were mononucleated, process-bearing cells. Using both single and double immunohistological procedures, we found that they were positive for macrophage/microglial cells markers. We could not demonstrate the presence of HIV in astrocytes, neurons, nor endothelial cells. Associated disseminated cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and JC virus encephalitis (PML) were found in 8 HIV infected brains, sometimes in the same region and the same section. We were unable to demonstrate the presence of two viruses in the same cell. Conclusion. In severe cases, HIV encephalitis is a multifocal and massive brain infection of macrophages/microglial cells, without necrosis. Opportunistic pathogens are often associated with foci of HIV infection. 2164 A MODEL FOR PERINATAL AND PEDIATRIC AIDS NEUROPATHOLOGY: HUMAN FETAL CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM ORGANOTYPIC CULTURES. Wm. *Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA Objective. A tissue culture model was established to test the hypothesis that HIV can infect neural tissue during gestation. Such an infection might account for the dysmorphism and neurologic dysfunction seen in some children with congenital HIV infection. Methods. Sections of fetal cortex obtained from HIVseronegative women were established in organotypic culture. Sample cultures were harvested twice weekly and processed for biochemical studies, light and electron microscopy to determine baseline values. Thereafter, continuing studies focused on the ability of HIV to infect this tissue and cause pathology. Cultures were incubated in the presence or absence of HIV. At 3 day intervals, sample cultures were processed for microscopy and nucleic acid hybridization studies. Results. Cultures incubated in the absence of HIV develop and differentiate normally. However, tissue cultured in the presence of HIV for at least 7 days showed significant pathology and cellular infection by HIV. Conclusions. HIV can infect neural cells and cause pathologic changes in vitro similar to those observed in vivo. This model may permit the definition of mechanisms associated with AIDS-related neuropathology. 204 [Page 205](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/203) 2165 NEUROPATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS IN 40 CASES OF AIDS F. Gray, R. Gherardi, M. Favolini, A. Sobel, J. Poirier. H6pital Henri Mondor, Crdteil, France. The central nervous system of 40 AIDS patients were examined in post mortem between August 1982 and 1987. They included 2 children born to intravenous drug abusers and 38 male adults. Among these later 27 were homosexual, 4 had received contaminated blood transfusion, 3 were drug addicts, 2 were Haitian and 2 had lived many years in Central Africa. The brains of 8 patients without clinical or radiological evidence of nervous system involvement showed non specific changes which included microglial nodules, lymphocytic perivascular cuffs, mineralization of the blood vessels and granular ependymitis. Among the 32 brains from patients with neurological symptoms, toxoplasmosis was the most common finding (19 cases); it usually produced multifocal necrotic lesions, but diffuse pseudo-encephalitic changes were also found. Other opportunistic infections included cytomegalovirus encephalitis (8 cases), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (2 cases), multiple microabcesses (1 case), mycobacterium avium intracellulare (1 case), cryptococcosis (1 case), aspergillosis (1 case), 2 patients had cerebral lymphoma, one was primary and the other secondary to a lung lymphoma. Encephalitis with predominant white matter lesions and multinucleated giant cells, characteristic of HIV infection was found in 15 cases and its yearly incidence was found to be increasing. All these lesions were variously associated in the same brain, sometimes in the same area and, on occasion, were present in the same cell. 2166 DISTRIBUTION OF HIV ANTIGEN IN THE CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. S M de la Monte, MD and D H Gabuzda, MD. Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. The characteristic HIV-related neuropathologic lesions in AIDS include subacute mixed axonal and demyelinative peripheral neuropathy. These have in common prominent degeneration of myelin and mononuclear cell (predominantly T cells and macrophages) inflammation. To further investigate pathogenic mechanisms of HIV in the nervous system, immunocytochemical distributions of P15/17, P24, and GP120 antigens were examined in the cerebrum, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves from autopsied patients with AIDS. Among the 17 AIDS patients, HIV antigen was detected in endothelial cells and mononuclear inflammatory cells in brain (8/17-47%), spinal cord (4/8-50%), and peripheral nerve (3/12-25%), and in occasional glial cells-probably astrocytes in the brain and spinal cord. There was no unequivocal immunostaining of neurons with anti-HIV. In contrast, there was no specific immunostaining of neural tissue from 5 controls. The findings suggest that the myelin degeneration observed in peripheral nerves, spinal cord, and brain infected with HIV may be due to vasculopathy rather than primary infection of Schwann cells or oligodendrocytes. Notes: 2167 IMMUNOPATHOLOGY OF SUBACUTE ENCEPHALITIS OF AIDS. S M de la Monte, MD; D H Gabuzda, MD. Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. USA The immunopathology of subacute encephalitis of AIDS was investigated in 18 patients without opportunistic infection or lymphoma in the CNS. The percentage of T200 + inflammatory cells (relative to total nuclei) was greater in white matter (23.3 + 2.3%) than grey matter (15.6 + 2.4%), and the absolute densities (144.0 + 5.2 and 215.1 + 1.4 per mm\") were significant. higher than normal (22.2 + 0.5 and 40.6 + 1.0 per mm; p<0.001). T-200 + cells were distributed in perivascular spaces and parenchyma in subacute encephalitis of AIDS, but almost entirely in perivascular spaces of control brains. Leu-4 + T cells and Leu-M3+ macrophages were the predominant inflammatory cells, and CD8 + cells were more abundant than CD4+ cells, as observed in HIV-infected peripheral nerves and other tissues. Class I (HLA-ABC) and Class II (HLA-DR) antigens (56%) (versus 0% of in controls), and the intensity of immunostaining on endothelium was increased in subacute encephalitis of AIDS. Gliosis (GFAP+), apart from PV, was increased in brains with subacute encephalitis of AIDS compared to normal (71% versus cortex; 64% versus 20% p<0.01). The results suggest that subacute encephalitis of AIDS is in part due to specific T cell and macrophage-mediated tissue destruction. 2168 HIV AND BIOCHEMICAL FINDINGS IN BLOOD AND CSF Margareta Larsson*, A Forsman*, L Hagberg**, G Norkrans** *Department of Psychiatry III, **Department of Infectious Diseases, University of G6teborg, Sweden Objective. HIV infection is associated with psychiatric and neurologic symptoms. To explore possible changes in brain function reflected by the concentrations of CSF and blood constituents, we have investigated 24 patients with HIV infection at varying stages of severity. A control group of 14 healthy subjects was included for comparisons. Methods. The biochemical analyses were performed by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence or electrochemical detection. Results. The number of platelets was 23 % lower, the platelet-content of 5-HT 36 % lower, and the tryptophan concentrations in blood and CSF 28 % and 30 % lower, respectively, in the HIV patients than in the controls. These reductions were statistically significant already among the asymptomatic HIV patients, but the most pronounced changes were seen in the patients with AIDS. No significant change was detected in the CSF levels of 5-HIAA, noradrenaline, or dopamine, but decreased levels of 5-HIAA were observed in 4 cases. Conclusion. Significant changes in the indolamine turnover in the blood and brain compartments were seen at an early stage of HIV infection and found to be most pronounced in patients with AIDS. This may lead to effects on the production of the enzyme nicotinamidadenosindinucleotide (NAD) as well as on the transmitter serotonin, thereby inducing \"the slim disease\" and affecting the brain function. Key CSF, monoamines, tryptophan, NAD. 205 [Page 206](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/204) 2169 DECREASE OF THE BUDDING OF HIV FROM CELL LINE nonprotein extract of rabbit dermis inflamed with vaccinia virus and widely used as an analgesic and anti-allegic drug, elevated OKT4/8 ratio in ARC patients(1986,The 5th International Symposium of Hemophilia Treatment). Here we examined the effect of Neurotropin on virus production in vitro. Methods. A virus -producing MOLT-4(MOLT-4/HIV)was treated with Neurotropin for 4days. Infectious virus in culture medium was titrated on HTLV-1 carrying MT-4 cell by using IF test. Extracellular viral particle protein and intracellular viral protein were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with AIDS patient'serum. Thegiant cell was formed by co-cultivation of MOLT-4 and The phosholipid extracted from MOLT-4/HIV was assayed by TLC. Result. The 70% decrease in infectious virus particles released from MOLT-4/HIV and the 40% decrease in giant Icell formation was observed by treatment with 100pg/ml of Neurotropin. By immunoprecipitation from HIV virion fraction, the decreased amounts of the gag protein were observed in MOLT-4/HIV treated with Neurotropin. On the other hand, there was no decrease in intracellular viral protein. By treatment with Neurotropin, the increased amounts of phospholipds were observed. Conclusion. Neurotropin inhibited the buddingor jnaturation process of HIV particles. S Peptide-T and VIP on Brain 2170 Metabolism USA Neuronal binding sites for HIV envelope glycoprotein (gpl20) have been detected within the CNS and an octapeptide (PEP-T=Ala-Ser-Thr-Thr-Thr-Asn-TyrThr) has been shown to compete effectively with gpl20 for such sites (C.Pert et al. PNAS 1986). We have investigated the -PEP-T VIP, on rat brain glucose utilization using 2-deoxy-D-[-14 C]glucose as described by Sokoloff [DAla1]-PEP-T amide (wl2 pmole, i.c.v.) decreased glucose utilization in several brain areas, including parts of the cerebral cortex a poor competitor for the gpl20 binding site, was without effect, and increasing the dose of [D-Alal]-PEP-T amide to ~290 pmole produced a loss of effect. VIP (o12 pmole) increased glucose utilization with a pattern of regional effects that differed from those noted with [D-Ala ]PEP-T amide. Injections of the VIP antagonist (i.c.v. ^12 without effect. These studies indicate that [D-Ala1 ]-PEP-T amide may affect neuronal activity in a manner dissimilar to that of VIP, and further studies with gpl20 will indicate whether this protein can also alter brain metabolism and in this way produce neurologic symptoms associated with HIV.

David J. Eilbott*, H. Burger*, Brook, Stony Brook, NY, **Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, DC Objective. To determine if HIV is present in the spinal cords (SC) of AIDS patients with myelopathy using in situ hybridization (ISH), and to correlate the localization of HIV with the histopathologic findings. Methods. SC were obtained at autopsy from two AIDS patients with clinical evidence of myelopathy. Sections were hybridized in situ for HIV RNA using a [35S]labelled HIV RNA antisense probe consisting of three pooled fragments of the HIV genome. Parallel sections processed for routine histopathologic examination demonstrated subacute vacuolar myelopathy. Results. In both patients, ISH localized HIV RNA predominantly to mononucleated and multinucleated cells in the SC white matter, correlating with the areas of greatest involvement by histopathology. HIV RNA was also detected in mononuclear cells in the spinal subarachnoid space, junctions between white and gray matter, and at entry and exit zones of spinal nerve roots. The mononucleated and multinucleated cells that hybridized for HIV RNA appeared morphologically to be macrophages. Further studies are underway to immunohistochemically identify the cell type more precisely. Conclusion. HIV RNA was detected by ISH in the SC of two AIDS patients with myelopathy. The close correlation of HIV RNA localization with histopathologic findings suggests a role for HIV in the pathogenesis of the myelopathy of AIDS and AIDS-related conditions. 206 [Page 207](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/205) 2173 the specific IgG,IgM,and IgA against Pneumocystis carinii (PC) during the development of the disease AIDS. Methods.Eight homosexual patients fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of AIDS given by the CDC were included in the study. Six patients suffered from PC-pneumonitis during the period and in four cases the diagnosis were confirmed at autopsy. Two patients had Kaposi's sarcoma. Only one patient was alive at the end of the study. Between two and twenty-one sera per patients were assayed for specific antibodies. Twenty-nine healthy volunteers served as control subjects. The antibodies was measured by ELISA using soluble PC-antigens. Results. The median OD-values are given. IgG IgM IgA Healthy controls 1.36 1.31 0.10 AIDS-patients - Initial Ig level 1.10 1.13 0.52 - Final Ig level 0.65 0.77 0.29 Conclusion. All patients, except one, had decreasing antibody level in all immunoglobulin classes. The level of IgG and IgM were in all patients below the level of the normal subjects. However, the IgA level was during the whole period above the level of the normal subjects. 2174 EFFECTS OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS-1 (HIV-1) INFECTION ON THE ANTIBODY CLASS-SPECIFIC **Univ Colorado Sch Med, ***Denver Dis Control, Denver, CO, U.S.A. Objective. To characterize the effect of HIV infection on antibody class-specific responses to T-cell independent antigens and on total immunoglobulin levels. Methods. IgG, IgM, and IgA responses to 23-valent capsular polysaccharide vaccine were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3 and 6 weeks after vaccination in 53 healthy men seronegative for HIV-1 (controls), 27 asymptomatic homosexual men seropositive for HIV-1 (ASX+), and 21 patients with AIDS (AIDS). Results. All groups showed significant rises in polysaccharide antigen-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA at 3 and 6 weeks (P<0.05). Responses among controls were significantly greater for all antibody classes than responses among ASX+ and AIDS. Rates of seroconversion (>2-fold rise) were significantly lower among AIDS compared with rates among ASX+ for specific IgG and IgA, but not IgM. Whereas total serum IgG levels were increased in both ASX+ and AIDS compared with controls (P<0.001), total IgM levels tended to be elevated only in the ASX+, and total IgA levels were elevated only in AIDS (P<0.05). Conclusions. HIV-1 infection produces alterations in polysaccharide antigen-specific and polyclonal antibody responses. The blunted IgM, as well as IgG and IgA, responses to T cell-independent antigens suggest that HIV-1 affects B cell regulation independent of T4 cell depletion which occurs prior to the onset of HIV-1 -associated illness. Notes: 2175 ANTIBODY-DEPENDENT CELLULAR CYTOTOXICITY TO HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS Patrick K. Lai and David J. Volsky, Department of Virology, Showa University Research Institute, St. Petersburg, Florida and Laboratory of Molecular Virology, St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center, Columbia University, New York, USA. Immune mechanisms may control infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) involving co-operation of Fc receptor-positive effectors and antibodies binding specifically to antigens was effective in lysing HIV-infected, antigen positive, target cells of both central nervous system (CNS) and hematopoietic origin. Interestingly, lysis by ADCC was not restricted to HIV-infected cells. T cells briefly adsorbed with infectious HIV were also lysed, sugaestino that ADCC interfered with viral dissemination by cellto-cell contact and by cell-free HIV. Analyses of serum ADCC activity in 38 HIV-infected subjects revealed no correlation between ADCC reactivity and antibody titer to HIV, but sera from 10 (36%) of 28 asymptomatic carriers and patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) did not lyse lymphocytes adsorbed with HIV/N1T virus, while all 10 sera from AIDS patients did. This pattern of serum ADCC activity in HIV-infected subjects with different stages of disease is discussed with respect to type-specific and cross-reactive group-specific responses to HIV as well as autoimmune reactivity, 2176 EVALUATION OF **Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To evaluate various target cells for use in an HIV-1 specific antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay. Methods. The T-cell line, CEM-ES, acutely HIV-1, CEM-E5 subclones chronically infected with HIV-1, EBV-transformed B-cell lines, and CEM-ES infected with vaccinia vectors containing HIV-1 p24 or HIV-1 gpl20 were used as target cells in a standard 51-Cr release HIV-1 specific ADCC assay. Results. Acutely HIV-1 infected CEM-E5 showed peak sensitivity to lysis in an HIV-1 specific ADCC assay on day 9 after infection. Chronically HIV-1 infected CEM-E5 clones that productively express HIV-1 were better ADCC targets than infected clones that do not express HIV-1. One clone, C5D7, was particularly sensitive to lysis in the ADCC assay. This cell line grows continually and stably in culture. EBV-transformed B-cell lines and CEM-E5 infected with HIV-1 p24 vaccinia constructs were lysed in the ADCC assay, but HIV-1 specific lysis was often difficult to distinguish because of high background lysis in control targets, presumably due to EBV or vaccinia-specific antibodies. Conclusion. The chronically infected CEM-E5 clone, C5D7, is the best target for HIV-1 specific ADCC in our system. It is easily grown in culture and shows maximal HIV-1 specific ADCC compared with other target cells evaluated. 207 [Page 208](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/206) 2177 COMPLEMENT-DEPENDENT CYTOTOXIC Univ.Med.School, Debrecen, XXNatl.Inst.Haematol. Blood Transf., Budapest, Hungary Objective. Although several authors found autoantibodies reacting with lymphocytes in sera of patients with AIDS and AIDS-related conditions, little is knotwn on the mechanisn of action and pathological significance of these antibodies. In the present study we investigated the presence of complement-dependent cytotoxic antibodies (CDCA) against uninfected, stimulated and HIV-infected in sera of 11 HIV seropositive asymptomatic haemophiliacs. Methods. Uninfected and HIV-infected H9 cells were stimulated with PHA (20 ug/ /ml) or Con A (1 ug/ml) for 72 hr. was tested by the Cr-release technique: 5x10 were heatinactivated serum samples. 100 ul guinea pig serum was used as complement source. Results. CDCA against HIVinfected H9 cells were found in sera of 5/11 HIV-seropositive patients. In 3 sera CDCA were found only after Con A stimulation of the HTLV III-H9 cells. No CDCA were found with uninfected H9 cells even after PHA or Con A stimulation. A correlation was found between the titres of antibodies detected by membrane IFA and CDCA, while no correlation was obtained between cytotoxic antibodies and absolute number of CD4+ lymphocytes. Conclusion. The present results indicate the presence of complementdependent cytotoxic antibodies in HIV-infected patients and demonstrate that their development may proceed the onset of AIDS or ARC. 2178 ONTOGENY AND SPECIFICITY OF ADCC FOLLOWING HIV-1 INFECTION K. Lyerly*, R. Redfield**, L. Arthur***, T. Matthews*, W. NC, **WRAIR, Wash., DC, ***FCRF, Frederick, MD, ****EEB/NIH, Bethesda, MD Objective. To chart the natural history of ADCC following HIV-1 infection of humans and chimpanzees, and to determine epitopes of HIV-1 relevant to ADCC using immunoaffinity purified antibodies. Methods. Sera from 120 HIV-1 infected Walter Reed staged patients were tested for ADCC activity against HTLV-II, HTLV-IIIRF2 or HIV-2 infected CEM.NKR 6 hr. chromium release assays. Serial serum samples from known isolate (HTLV-III ) infected humans and chimpanzees as well as immunoaffinity purified anti-envelope antibodies were tested against CEM/III and CEM/RF Results. The majority of sera from HIV infected patients, regardless of disease stage, mediated ADCC against HIV infected cells. Additional sera tested against CEM/III and CEM/RF exhibited equivalent activity agains HIV-1 isolates, but failed to direct ADCC against CEM/HIV-2. Serial bleeds from HTLV-IIIB infected humans and chimpanzees revealed the early presence of antibodies directing ADCC against both CEM/III and CEM/RF2. Finally, immunoaffinity purified anti gpl20 antibodies mimicked the activity of whole serum in directing ADCC against CEM/III and CEM/RF26 Conclusion. Broadly reactive HIV-1 antibodies directing ADCC appear early after infection and are apparent throughout all stages of disease. Such activities are due to high affinity anti-envelope antibodies which fail to cross-react with HIV-2. Notes: 2179 PERSISTENT SINGLE ANTI-P24gag BLOT NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HIV1,HIV-2, OR HTLV-1 TRANSMISSION TO RECIPIENTS OF of the Netherlands Red Cross Bloodtransfusion Service, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Objective: To investigate the clinical significance of persistent or intermittent single anti-p24g reactivity in Western Blot (WB) of blooddonors. Methods, donors and patients. The seauential serum samples (n = 68) of 11 blooddonors, who all had a persistent or intermittent single anti-p24 reactivity in the HIV-1 WB for more than 2 years, were tested for antibodies against: HIV-1 (RIPA), HIV-2/HTLV-4 (WB), and HTLV-1 (WB). The blood of 10 of the 11 donors was cultured for HIV. Of 10 recipients of bloodcomponents from 6 of these donors, serum samples before and 6 months after transfusion were also tested for HIV-1, HIV-2 and HTLV-1. Results. In the donors, HIV-culture results were all negative; no serologic signs of HIV-2 or HTLV-1 infection were observed. In the recipients of bloodcomponents from these donors no signs of HIV-1, HIV-2 or HTLV-1 infection was found. Conclusion. Persistent or intermittent single anti-p24gag reactivity in blooddonors does not represent infection or HTLV-1. 2180 ANTIBODY-DEPENDANT CELLULAR CYTOTOXICITY (ADCC)-INDUCING Brown*, Koenig*, S Grove*, Bethesda Md. USA, **Project SIDA, Kinshasa, Zaire, ***Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Md. USA Objective. Because of reported unique clinical and epidemiologic features of HIV-1 infection in central Africa, we investigated HIV-1 specific ADCC in HIV-1 seropositive asymptomatic and symptomatic Zairian patients. We correlated these findings with presence or absence and titer of HIV-1 specific antibody. In addition we analysed cross-reactive anti-HIV-2 ADCC activity using HIV-1 infected Zairian sera. Two cloned human CD4+ T cell lines (A5, Supt-1, and Supt-l-HIV-2) were used as target cells. Freshly separated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were used as effectors in a 4 hour 51Cr release cytotoxicity assay. Quantitation of antibody to p24 and gp41 was determined by Elisa. Results. Significant levels of ADCC were found in greater than 80% of 55 seropositive patients. Quantitative comparison of serum titers eliciting ADCC does not appear to demonstrate a correlation with clinical status of the patient. In 4 of the 5 patients with no ADCC activity, gp41 was negative by Western blot and by Elisa. In 15 sera which demonstrated high titer HIVI specific ADCC activity, no ADCC activity was observed using HIV-2 infected target cell lines. Conclusions. Significant ADCC can be demonstrated in the majority of Zairian patients infected with HIV-1. ADCC titers do not appear to correlate with clinical status of the patient. Sera demonstrating high titer HIV-1 specific ADCC demonstrate 208 [Page 2181 HUMORAL Koup*, JL Sullivan*, D. Brettler*, PH Levine*.*Depts.

Powell*, USA, **Project SIDA, Kinshasa, Zaire, ***Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore Md. USA Objective. Previous reports describe a positive correlation between levels of ADCC and an asymptomatic HIV-1 infection. We studied serum samples collected from seronegative Zairians transfused with seropositive blood, to follow the development of ADCC prospectively. Methods. Freshly purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as effectors for the 4 hour 51Cr release cytotoxicity studies. CD4+ T cell clones A5 and Supt-l were used as targets. Anti-gp41 and anti-p24 antibodies were quantitated by ELISA. Serum from ten seronegative recipients of seropositive blood was collected immediately before transfusion and at 1,3,6 and 12 months after transfusion. Results. In four of the seven patients analyzed to date, significant levels of ADCC appeared in the 6 month blood sample. In the four patients with evidence of ADCC, high levels of antibody to gp41, as determined by quantitative ELISA correlated with the development of ADCC, even though antibody to gp41 or gpl20 was negative by Western blot. In three cases where no significant ADCC was seen by six months, ELISA determined levels of gp41 and gpl20 were low or undetectable. Level of ELISA determined anti-p24 did not correlate with levels of ADCC. Conclusions. Onset of HIV-I specific ADCC is seen in concert with rising levels of ELISA-determined anti-gp41 by 6 months after transfusion in 4 of 7 individuals transfused with HIV-1 seropositive blood. All ten individuals seroconverted to HIV between year 1 and 2 of study, after which all showed HIV-specific ADOC activity, and 9 of 10 had detectable (but low titer) HIV-specific neutralizing antibodies. These humoral responses remained constant or increased over the four years of followup in all ten hemophiliacs. Despite these sustained humoral immune responses to HIV, CD4 cell numbers steadily declined, with five of 10 hemophiliacs having <400 CD4 cells/ul by year 4 of study. Conclusion: HIV-specific neutralizing and ADOC antibodies generated after natural infection do not appear to offer protection against depletion of CD4 cells in HIV-infected hemophiliacs. Notes: 2183 HIV SPECIFIC KILLER CELLS ARMED IN CYTOPHILIC ANTIBODIES D.S. Tyler, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA Objective. To determine the nature of the antigen receptor on patient effector cells directing gpl20 specific cytolysis of HIV expressing targets. Methods. Gpl20-specific cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) was measured by reacting peripheral blood (PBMC) from HIV-1 seropositive indjv1iduals Affinity purified anti-Fab and anti-Fc F(ab')2 fragments were used to block gpl20-specific CMC. Cytophilic antibodies were eluted from enriched subpopulations of patient PBMC by incubation at 560C. Results. Complement depletion revealed that direct CMC was mediated exclusively by a CD16 subpopulation of patient PBMC. Greater than 90% of gpl20 specific CMC was inhibited following addition of affinity purified F(ab')2 antibody fragments directed against the Fab, and Fc portions of human IgG. Comparable reagents directed against human albumin had no effect on CMC activity. Eluates from PBMC of seropositive individuals contained cytophilic antibodies with specific anti-gpl20 activity that could be precipitated with staphylococcal Protein A (SPA). Selective enrichment of specific cell subpopulations revealed the origin of the cytophilic antibody to be CD16 cells and not B cells, monocytes or T cells. Conclusion. The gpl20 specific CMC seen in HIV-1 seropositive individuals is directed by cytophilic antibodies bound to circulating CD16 K cells and represents a direct form of ADCC which may provide a primary cytotoxic host defense. 2184 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HIV-1-SPECIFIC T CELL MEDIATED IMMUNE RESPONSE. BD Walker*, TJ Flexner**, MS Hirsch*, B Moss**, RT Schooley*. *Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA USA; **NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD USA. Objective: To define the antigens recognized by HIV-1 -specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in infected individuals, and to further characterize the cytotoxic effector cell population. Methods: CTL targets were prepared by infecting EBV immortalized B cell lines (established individually for each subject in the study) with recombinant vaccinia viruses containing HIV-1 genes (env [HTLV-IIIB or RF strains], gag, pol, and tat), or a control vector. Effector cells were either a) fresh autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), b) CD8+ lymphocytes purified using monoclonal antibodies and expanded in vitro c) PBMC or CD8+ lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with specific HIV-1 antigens. Results: a) env-specific CTL were detected in 20/20 HIV-1 seropositive subjects, and declined markedly with onset of opportunistic infections in two subjects who progressed to develop AIDS, b) RT specific CTL were seen in 10/12 HIV-1 seropositive subjects, and were predominantly HLA class I restricted (B locus) in the three subjects studied, c) gag-specific CTL were detected in fresh blood of 3/20 HIV-1 seropositive subjects, but could be detected in others following in vitro stimulation, d) CD8+ CTL could be expanded in vitro activity. Conclusions: HIV-1-specific MHC-restricted CD8+ CTL are present in infected individuals; these cells can be stimulated and expanded 209 [Page 210](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/208) Elvin*, CR Rizza**, J Gallwey***, AJ *Nuffield Department of Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, ** Haemophilia Centre, Churchill Hospital, ***Harrison Department, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. U.K. Objective. To investigate the role and specificities of HIV specific CTL in seropositive individuals we have established an assay using recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) to express HIV gene products. Methods. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from seropositive haemophiliacs and homosexuals at all stages of HIV disease were cultured in vitro. A small fraction of PBMC were stimulated for 12 hours with PHA at 1:200 dilution, washed twice, and then added back to unstimulated PBMC. Cells were cultured for 6-12 days before use as effectors. Autologous or HLA mismatched EBV transformed B cells infected with rVV are used as targets in a 4 hour 51Chromium release assay. Results. HLA restricted HLA-specific CTL responses to env and gag gene products were found in healthy seropositives. Four out of ten patients responded to env, five responded to gag. One patient with AIDS (p24 Ab- and Ag+) had no gag or env CTL responses. The characteristics of the CTL response were further defined by HLA restriction and antibody blocking studies. Conclusion. Human HIV specific CTL recognize HIV env and gag products expressed by rVV. 2186 218HIV-SPECIFIC CYTOTOXIC IN Koup*, M Ieyden*, DL Panicali**, *Depts Pediatrics & Medicine, U Mass Med Center, Worcester, MA and **Applied Biotechnology, Inc. Cambridge, MA, USA. Objective: To investigate HIV-specific cell-mediated immunity in HIV. Methods: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses were studied in six congenitally infected infants, using freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PEMC's), and target cell lines (autologous and allogeneic T-and B-lymphoblastoid cells lines) infected with reccmbinant vaccinia viruses expressing HIV gene products. Results: CTL responses were detected in the six congenitally infected infants. This response was restricted to target cells expressing HIV envelope proteins (Vac/env 29.4 ~ 9.0) as opposed to targets expressing HIV gag proteins (Vac/gag 9.0 ~ 2.6) or vaccinia alone (Vac 7.4 ~ 3.0). This envelope-specific cytotoxicity was resistant to NK-cell depletion, but could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to the Tcell receptor, as well as class I histoccnpatibility antigens. Virus-specific CTL could be detected in infants as young as 12 weeks and as old as four years. In four infants with virus-specific CTL, serum contained HIV p24 antigen, or HIV was isolated from PBMC. Conclusion: Demonstration of HIV-specific CTL in infected infants provides an important immunological marker to distinguish active HIV infection from passive maternal antibody. Cytotoxic T-cells may play an important role in the HIV infection. Notes: McKenzie**, D Panicali**. *Depts. Pediatrics & Medicine, U Mass Med Center, Worcester, MA and **Applied Biotechnology, Inc. Cambridge, MA, USA. Objective: To characterize responses in seropositive hemophiliacs. Methods: B cell lines from HIV-seropositive hemophiliacs and seronegative controls were infected with reccibinant vaccinia vectors expressing HIV genes. These cells were used as targets in a standard 51Cr release CTL assay with freshly isolated PBMC's as effector cells. Results: CTL responses were detected against autologous B and T cell lines expressing HIV proteins in HIVseropositive hemophiliacs, but not in HIV-seronegative controls. CTL responses were directed against both HIV env/gpl60 (specific lysis 36 ~ 5%, n=12) ~ 7%, n=9). Cytotoxicity was resistant to NK-cell depletion and could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to the T-cell receptor and MHC class I histoccmpatibility antigens (53% and 73% respectively), indicating the T-cell origin of these responses. Studies carried out thus far indicate that high levels of HIVspecific CTL responses are detectable in PBMC from hemophiliacs at all stages of disease (asymptcmatic, ARC, AIDS) and that these responses do not correlate with known determinants of HIV disease progression (decreased CD4 cell numbers or ability to isolate virus from PBMC). Conclusion: Cytotoxic T-cells may play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of HIV infection. 2188 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF HIVSPECIFIC CYTOTOXIC T LYMPHOCYTES IN HUMANS and antigen specificities of HIV-immune cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in HIV-infected patients. by two different approaches: (a) broncho-alveolar lavage of seropositive patients with lymphocytic alveolitis; and (b) in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood or lymph node lymphocytes with autologous HIV-infected as well as mouse P815 tumor cells doubly transfected with the HIV-1 env, gag or F gene and a HLA class I gene. Relative frequencies of effector CTLs and of CTL precursor cells were estimated by limiting dilution analysis. Results and Conclusions. (1) HIV-specific CTLs are present at high frequencies in HIV-infected patients; (2) CTL frequencies drop as the patient's general state deteriorates; (3) human CTLs recognize conserved epitopes on HIV env, gag and F proteins; (4) HLA-A2 and HLA-A3 class I transplantation antigens differ in their ability to present HIV-1 antigens to immune lymphocytes. 210 [Page 211](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/209) 2189 CYTOTOXICITY TOWARDS INFECTED AND NON INFECTED CELLS IN HIV SEROPOSITIVE PATIENTS. Claire-Michble Farber, A. Crusiaux, L. Schandene, J. Wybran. Erasme Hospital, Free University of Brussels. Objective. We evaluated natural killer (NK) function in subjects non at risk for HIV infection who were HIV seronegative, as well as cytotoxicity for HIV infected cells. We compared the results obtained to those found in asymptomatic HIV seropositive patients, patients with HIV linked PGL and AIDS patients. Methods. Mononuclear cells of patients were incubated for 4 hours with 51Cr labeled target at various effector/target ratios. Targets were the MOLT3 lymphoblastoid T cell line. For cytotoxicity, the same assay was performed using MOLT3 cells infected with HIV in a standardized fashion. Results. There was no significant difference between HIV seronegative and asymptomatic HIV seropositive in NK function directed against non infected MOLT3 cells. Cells from HIV seronegative patients showed a higher response to MOLT3/HIV infected targets than to MOLT3; this was not observed in HIV seropositive asymptomatic patients; those exhibited a low response to HIV infected targets. Patients with PGL and AIDS had low NK function towards both MOLT3 and low cytotoxicity towards MOLT3/HIV cells. Conclusions. NK function as assayed here is not decreased in HIV infected patients; this is in opposition with most data found in the literature. However, cytotoxicity function directed against HIV infected targets is lowered in HIV infected patients; this could further our knowledge of the physiopathology of HIV infection. 2190 HIV SPECIFIC CYTOTOXIC LY;iPHOCYTES IN SEROPOSITIVE HIV-1 SUBJECTS Y F France. Objective. To characterize cytotoxic effector cells in the peripheral blood of HIV-1 seropositive patients and to determine the viral antigens recognized by such effector cells. Methods. Autologous EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cells were infected with recombinant env (gpl60), gag (p55), 3'ORF/F(p27) SOR/Q (p23) as targets in a 4hr Cr release assay. Uninfected cells and cells infected with the wild type vaccinia virus were used a controls. Results. In the HIV negative group (6 individuals), no cytotoxic activity specific for HIV antigens was detected. In the HIV seropositive group a strong cytotoxic activity was detected against the env region (13 to 43 % at 100: 1, E: T ratio) in 11 out or 11 subjects. Lysis of targets expressing the gag antigen occurred in 9 out of 11 subjects (7 to 27 % at 100: 1 ratio), and in two cases out of four lysis of targets cells expressing the Q or the F antigen was detected (7 to 11 % at 75: 1 ratio). The characterization of the effector cells and the relationship with the disease will be discussed. Conclusion. We have shown that in addition to the env and gag antigens, the Q and the F antigens can serve as targets for cytotoxic effector cells present in the peripheral blood of HIV infected patients. These results may be of importance for the pathogenesis of HIV infection and for the evaluation of vaccine candidates. Notes: 2191 INDUCTION OF BSF2/IL6 and Cell. Biol., Osaka U., Osaka, Japan and **Dept. Micro. & Immunol., UCLA Sch. Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA Obiective. Polyclonal B cell activation is commonly observed in AIDS and HIV infection. The effect of HIV on the generation of BSF2/IL6 was examined, since this interleukin is essential for the differentiation of activated B cells, in addition to other biological functions. Methods. Blood mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from healthy donors. MNC and/or purified T cell, non-T cell (adherent-cell depleted) or monocyte/macrophage cells were exposed in vitro to various concentrations and preparations of HIV. BSF2/IL6 mRNA was measured by dot hybridization; BSF2/IL6 secretion was measured using a BSF2/IL6 responsive cell line (MH60-BSF2). Results. Exposure of MNC to HIV led to the rapid production of BSF2/IL6. Monocyte/macrophages produced BSF2/IL6 on exposure to HIV; HIV-exposed T or B cells did not produce BSF2/IL6. Increased BSF2/IL6 mRNA levels were observed as early as 2h after stimulation. The BSF2/IL6 inducing activity in the HIV preparations could be neutralized by anti-HIV serum. Conclusion. These findings indicate that HIV infection of monocyte/macrophages induces BSF2/IL6 production. HIVinfected monocyte/macrophages may contribute to the polyclonal B cell activation seen in AIDS. It is important to explore the role of BSF2/IL6 in the lymphadenopathy and B cell lymphomas associated with AIDS and HIV infection.

Israel, Khorshed Pavri National Institute of Virology, Pune, India. Objective. To review criteria for consideration of seropositivity to HIV in the light of fluctuating antibodies in asymptomatic individuals. Methods. ELISA for HIV-Ab and HIV-Ag as well as Western blot (WB) both IgG and IgM were carried out on serum samples of asymptomatic individuals. ELISA kits for HIV-Ab (Abbott, Wellcozyme); Dupont WB kits and antigen detection kits (Abbott) were used following the manufacturer's instructions. Results. We report here for the first time, a marked decline or loss of antibodies to the envelope glycoprotein which were clearly detectable 16-17 months earlier. There was persistence of IgM antibodies to the major gag protein (p24) and in one instance to the env glycoprotein (gp41) in the absence of IgG antibodies for the same. The samples which were earlier reactive for HIV-Ab in ELISA were later negative. Antigen was not detected in these samples. Conclusion. These responses could in fact, signify fluctuating antibodies to latent infection(s) with complete or defective human immunodeficiency, or related retrovirus(es). The data emphasize that solitary anti-p24 bands need not necessarily be non-specific or considered as early antibodies. 211 [Page 212](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/210) 2193 Decker. NEUTRALIZATION OF HIV-1 AND HIV-2 BY ANTICORE. Mark Knigge, D. Paul, L. Falk, R. Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill. USA Objective. A correlation between neutralization activity and anti-core titer in sera of HIV-infected subjects has been observed. This study was done to characterize the ability of anti-core to neutralize HIV infection. Cross neutralization between HIV-1 and 2 was also investigated. Methods. Neutralizing activity of sera was measured by the ability of serum dilutions to inhibit infection of H9 cells with HTLV-IIIB. Neutralization titers were determined using HIV Ag and RT as a measure of virus growth. Human anti-HIV sera, animal monospecific serum, and affinity-purified anti-core were tested for neutralization and for levels of specific antibodies of HIV. HIV Ags were purified and tested for their ability to block neutralizing activity. HIV-1 and HIV-2 positive antisera were tested for neutralizing activity for HIV-2 isolate, as measured by syncytia and HIV Ag. Results. 1) High neutralizing activities in sera (titers up to 105) correlated with high titers Monospecific and affinity purified anti-core neutralized HTLV IIIB. 3) HIV core Ag specifically blocked neutralizing activity. 4) HIV-2 infection was neutralized by both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antisera that contained anti-core activity. Conclusion. These findings provide evidence of a direct role for anti-core in neutralizing both HIV-1 and HIV-2 in vitro. Data are consistent with the hypothesis that anti-core antibodies have a protective effect in vivo. 2194 THE ABSENCE OF NAB AGAINST HIV-1 CARRIERS M. Inoue*, Y. Sei*, Medical Center, New York, N.Y. 10029 USA, **Kurume University School of Medicine, ***Nichinan Hospital, Miyazaki, ****Kyushu University, Japan The presence of neutralizing antibody activity (NAb) against HIV-1 and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory antibody (RTIAb) were tested in the sera of 72 HTLV-1 carriers and 61 healthy controls. Anti-HIV-1 antibodies were determined by both ELISA and Western blot assay. Serum HIV-1 RT inhibition test using proteinA column was performed for the presence of RTIAb. Neutralizing activity of sera was tested by a newly developed microculture assay using H9-HIV-1 susceptible cells. One of 72 HTLV-1 carriers was found to be HIV-1 positive. Thus the one, a hemophilia patient, was found to be HTLV-1/HIV-1 co-infected individual. All control individuals were HIV-1 (-). 2 out of 71 HIV-1 (-) HTLV-1 cariers and the HIV-1 (+) HTLV-1 hemophilia patient had strong RTIAb. All controls were RTIAb (-). Although the HTLV-1/HIV-1 co-infected hemophilia patient had strong NAb, all of 71 HIV-1 (-) HTLV-1 cariers had no NAb. Overall results suggest that some antigenic determinants of HIV-1 RT which effect the enzyme activity may be weakly cross-reactive to some antiHTLV-1 sera. However, the RTIAb (+) sera had no NAb capability against HIV-1, implying that HIV-RTIAb may not support neutralization against HIV-1 in vivo. The results also suggest that the exposure of HTLV-1 may not contribute to NAb against HIV-1 in HIV-1 infected individuals. Notes: 2195 DEVELOPMENT OF NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY TO HTLV-IIIB IS ASSOCIATED WITH LYMPHADENOPATHY AND A DECREASE IN CD4+ CELL NUMBER Leigh A Sawyer*, A Saah**, CBER, Division of Virology, Bethesda, MD, U.S.A. **Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), U.S.A. Objective. To determine the time course of the development of neutralizing antibody (NA) in sequential serum specimens from 20 individuals and the significance of NA with respect to clinical and laboratory parameters of HIV infection. Methods. Sera, clinical, and laboratory data collected for each of 5 visits (6-month interval between visits) for 20 subjects enrolled in the MACS, who seroconverted by ELISA between visit 1 and 2, were examined. NA titers were determined against HTLV-IIIB virus. Results. Fifteen of 20 subjects developed NA titers >1:8 within 1 year of seroconversion by ELISA. Four of 20 patients never developed NA at a 1:8 dilution. None of these four developed lymphadenopathy versus 15/16 who developed titers of >1:16 (P=0.001). An interesting observation was an inverse correlation between CD4+ cell number and NA titer. Conclusion. NA to HTLV-IIIB begins to appear at low titers several months after seroconverting by ELISA. One possible explanation is that HIV neutralizing epitopes may not be expressed early in infection. The development of NA is associated with lymphadenopathy and a decrease in CD4+ cell number. 2196 INVESTIGATION OF THE MECHANISM OF NEUTRALIZING ACTIVITY AGAINST HIV Michael A. Skinner, Alphonse J. Langlois, Charlene B. McDanal, Jim Rusche, and Thomas J. Matthews Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA Objective. To investigate the mechanism by which sera raised against a hypervariable but immunodominant epitope of the envelope glycoprotein gpl20 exert their virus neutralization and syncytium-inhibiting effect. Methods. The neutralizing activity, inhibition of infected-cell syncytium formation, and the blockade of purified gpl20 binding to CD4 were measured in sera from animals immunized with recombinant baculavirus gpl60, E.coli PB1 and the synthetic peptide RP 135. The results were compared to those obtained using sera from infected humans. Results. The sera from goats immunized with the gpl60, PB1, and RP 135 exhibited potent, type-specific virus neutralization and syncytia inhibition. In contrast, sera from infected humans elicited broader neutralization activity and syncytia inhibition, but at a lower serum titer. The human sera effectively blocked the binding of gpl20 to CD4 at a low concentration while the heterologous antisera exhibited little or no blockade. Conclusion. The broader in vitro virus neutralization activity in human sera may be due to the development of activity against a conserved epitope of the CD4-binding site of gpl20. This may prevent virus binding and subsequent infection. Alternatively, the activity may be due to broadened activity against the hypervariable region known to elicit high-titered type-specific activity. 212 [Page 213](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/211) 2197 Neutralizing Antibodies (NA) Against HIV-1 Among Seropositive Homosexuals With Normal CD4 Counts After Three Years of Follow-Up. H. Farzadegan, P. Nara, N. Dunlop, B.F. Polk. Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, MD and National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA. OBJECTIVE: Among a cohort of 1153 gay/bisexual men who were enrolled in Study to Help AIDS Research Effort (SHARE) as part of MACS, 31% were found to be seropositive at their first visit. A subgroup of these seropositive men remained healthy with stable CD4 count~. 600 during three years of follow-up. Others showed a drastic or gradual decrease (unstable CD4 400) during the same time. METHOD: The neutralizing antibody (NA) titer was studied in these two groups using syncytial forming viral infectivity assay with CEM-SS cell line against HTLV-IIIb strain. RESULTS: Our preliminary results show that the mean titer of 90% inhibition was 1:8 to 1:16 among stable and less than 1:4 among those with unstable CD4 counts at baseline. However, after three years of follow-up the 90% inhibition titer of NA was two-fold greater (up to 1:512) among participants with normal CD4 count. CONCLUSION: The possible protective effect of NA at higher titers in this assay is of potential importance in identifying protective antibody titers. Further work is needed in neutralization assay techniques. 2198 ACTIVITIES OF PATIENTS SERA AGAINST HIV-1 AND HIV-2 IN ADCC, ELISA, WESTERN BLOT AND NEUTRALIZING ASSAYS AND CORRELATION WITH CLINICAL STATUS Stephen G. Werner*. S. Staszewski*, E-B. Helm's, R. Kurth* *Paul Ehrlich Institute, Frankfurt, \"Centre of Internal Medicine, Frankfurt. Objective. To compare the abilities of antisera taken from a wide range of HIV seropositive patients to react in ELISA, Western blot, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and neutralizing assays against both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and to correlate these results with the clinical status of the patients. Methods. ELISA and Western blot analyses of antisera from over 80 patients were performed using standard techniques. Neutralizing antibody was measured as a suppression of HIV-induced syncitia formation using the CEMSS cell line (provided by Peter Nara. NCI-FCRF, USA). ADCC activity was measured in 4 hour chromium release assays using A301 cells infected 9 days previously with HIV-1 (IIIB and RFII) or HIV-2 as targets and fresh human PBL's from a healthy donor as effectors. Patients were examined routinely and their clinical status described using the Walter-Reed classification system. Results. Without exception, antisera giving a positive reaction to HIV-1 by ELISA and Western blot were able to mediate lysis of HIV-1 infected cells by effector PBL's. However, no correlation between ELISA titer and ADCC titer was observed, and nor could ADCC reactivity be correlated with reactivity to any particular viral protein in Western blot. Similarly, neutralizing antibody titers were highly variable. So far. no significant correlation between the antibody reactivities in any of the assays and the clinical status of the patients has been observed. Whereas the majority of the sera showed only group specific ADCC reactions, two of the HIV-1 positive sera had the ability to elicit strong ADCC lysis of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 infected cells, while their Western blot and neutralizing antibody reactions remained typically group specific, indicating that a double infection was unlikely. Conclusion. Although no clear correlation between any of the parameters measured and protection from disease was observed, the potential in vaccine development for an antibody able to elicit lysis of both HIV-1 and -2 infected cells by healthy PBL's is obvious. Notes: 2199 CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SEROLOGICAL RESPONSES OF HEMOPHILIACS TOWARDS HIV: ANALYSIS OF VIRAL SPECIFICITY AND NEUTRALIZATION ACTIVITY OF SERA AND CORRELATION WITH DISEASE. A. Pintera, W. Honnena, K. Revesz', H. C. Chen', M. Hilgartner, and J. Conwayb. 'Public Health Research Institute and bComell University Medical Center, New York, New York. A series of 374 sera, representing serial bleeds of 92 hemophiliac patients, have been analyzed by a sensitive radioimmunoprecipitation assay which identifies p51. The time of seroconversion was pinpointed in several cases. Of particular interest is the fact that despite the uniformity of the route of exposure and the constant nature of the infecting agent, these patients vary considerably in the patterns of viral antigens recognized. Two major reactivity classes were defined. In many cases, the initial response was against the complete set of viral gene products, including strong titers against both env and gag components. In other cases, the initial response was directed only against env proteins, in particular gpl20, but not against the major gag product, p24. Some of these cases subsequently went on to develop a more generalized response against the other viral proteins, while in others the env- specific pattern was constant. The different categories of sera are presently being characterized for viral neutralization activity, using both the HTLV-III and ARV-2 strains of HIV, in order to see if any correlation exists between these variant patterns and the protective activities of these sera. Preliminary results identify two classes of patients; one which possess low titers of neutralizing antibodies, and a second group which possess relatively high titers of neutralizing antibodies against conserved or type-specific epitopes ANTI-P24 AND -GP120 ANTIBODY IN ASYMPTOMATIC HIV SEROPOSITIVE SUBJECTS (AHS) AND NOT IN AIDS A.Castagna* University of Chicago, Chicago, IL; Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL **** General Regional Hospital, Bolzano, Italy. Objective. To study immunological abnormalities in sera and CSF from 24 patients with AIDS and neurological involvement, and 6 AHS. Methods. We used an Isoelectric Focusing (IEF)-HIV-1 p24 and gpl20-overlay technique. Results. Anti-gpl20 antibody (ab) activity was demonstrated in all sera and 2/6 CSF of AHS and in 17/20 sera and 10/20 CSF of AIDS patients. This activity did not vary in pi distribution with progression to AIDS. All AHS anti-p24 ab activity showed a wide pi range. We found anti-p24 ab activity with a very restricted heterogeneity in only 3/22 sera and 2/24 CSF from AIDS patients. Silver-stained oligoclonal (OG) IgG bands were more frequently observed in AHS sera (6/6) and CSF (5/6) than in AIDS sera (10/22) and CSF (11/24). Multiple anti-p24 but few anti-gpl20 OG bands were detected in all sera from AHS subjects. In AHS CSF anti-p24 OG bands were more frequently detected (5/6) than anti-gpl20 OG bands (1/6). We found no OG anti-p24 or anti-gpl20 ab activity in sera and CSF of AIDS patients. Conclusions. 1) Asymptomatic HIV infection is characterized by appearance of anti-HIV OG bands both in serum and CSF; 2) the progression from AHS status to AIDS with CNS disease correlates with loss of OG anti-p24 bands; 3) a selective loss of OG anti-p24 ab could explain the restricted heterogeneity and progressive disappearance of anti-p24 ab associated with evolution to AIDS. 213 [Page 214](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/212) 2201 QUANTITATTON OF WESTERN BLOT PROFILES USEFUL IN MONITORING AIDS PROGRESSIONI G. Schmidt*, K. Amiraian*, J. Wethers*, H. Frey**, N. LeGendre*** *New York State Dept. of Health, Albany, NY, **St. John's Riverside Hospital, Yonkers, NY, ***lillipore Corporation, Bedford, MA Objective. To demonstrate the utility of ouantitative HIV Uestern Blot analysis in assessing AIDS clinical status. Methods. Antibody responses of 57 patients were auantitated by densitometric analysis of Uestern blotted strips. Inmobilon-P\" Transfer Membrane strips were developed using peroxidase-labeled goat antihunan IgG and diaminobenzidine as substrate. The ratio of np41 to p24 staining intensity was calculated for each sample. Results. In this study, a ratio of <2.0 correlated with a benign clinical state, and a ratio >2.0 with AIDS or progression to AIDS. The percentage of asymtonatic patients with ratios >2.r who subsequently developed ARC was about twice that of those,ho remained asymptomatic. Similarly, the percentage of ARC patients with ratios >2.0 who developed AIDS was 30% higher than the oercentage of those who did not during the period of this study. Conclusions. An increasing ratio of gp41 to p24 antibodies is oredictive of progression to the diseased state. Densitometric analysis of antibody responses should prove useful to physicians in staging and monitoring HIV-infected individuals. Due to its superior mechanical strength, Immobilon-P membrane is an ideal substrate for densitometric scanning and Quantitative evaluation of patient sera profiles. 2202 ANALYSTS OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN A LABORATORY WORKER INFECTED WITH THE HTLV-III STRAIN OF HIV. Thomas J. Matthews4, Alphonse J. Langlois*, Kent J. Weinhold*, Michael A. Skinner*, Lyerly*, William A. Blattner*, and Dani *Dept. of Surgery, Duke Univ. Med. Ctr., Durham, NC Objective. To chart the development of biologically, relevant antibody responses which accompany HIV infection. Methods. Eleven sequential serum and plasma samples obtained over a 24-month period were subjected to a variety of biologic and serologic analyses. Results. The first sample studied exhibited weak Western Blot and ELISA reactivity and was devoid of measureable HIV-1 neutralizing and syncytia inhibiting activities as well as antibodies capable of blocking gpl20/CD4 binding. There were however, significant levels of broadly reactive ADCC activity in this initial sample. Within 5 months, HIV-1 strain specific neutralizing and fusion blocking antibodies became apparent. The first true shift from restricted to broad reactivities occurred much later, 1987, approximately 18 months after seroconversion. At this time, antibodies which blocked binding of gpl20 to CD4 were increasing. Conclusion. These results reflect the presence of the three separate classes of biologically important epitopes in the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1: 1) antibodies which medidate ADCC (conserved); 2) those that neutralize virus (isolate restricted); and 3) those that block gpl20/CD4 binding and neutralize virus (conserved). Their significance for vaccine development against HIV will be discussed. Notes: 2203 A FOLLOW-Up OF HIV-POSITIVE PATIENTS BY AND TO G.Martinez-Riqud, J.Blomberg, P.J.Klasse Department of Medical Microbiology,Virology section Lund,Sweden Objective. It is widely accepted that the pattern of reactivity to certain HIV-proteins detected by the electrophoretic immunoblot(EIB)-technique varies during the course of infection. We evaluated consecutive sera from 18 HIV-positive persons (7 diseased, 8 healthy and 3 recently seroconverted: according to CDC-criteria) by reflectance measurement. The patients were followed during a period from 2 to 24 months. Methods. Reflectance measurement by densitometry of electrophoretic immunoblot. We measured the absolute values of EIB-bands and ratios between absolute values. Results. We found that some of the ratios correlated to health state, antigen positivity and antip24-titers. Conclusion. By densitometry of EIB-strips one can get a detailed view of the humoral response during the course of- HIV-infection, wnich may be clinically useful. 2204 A CONSTRUCT OF HIV ISCOM 1 2 2.1 Stefan Ozel,Hans Gelderblom,Bror Robert-Koch Institute,D-1000 Berlin 65, W.Germany OBJECTIVE To understand the structure and function of Iscom which is a carrier structure of protective antigens in a candidate HIV vaccine. METHODS The Iscoms containing HIV antigen were studied by analytical eletronmicroscopy. Samples were prepared by cryotechniques with different contrasting methods. Goniometer analysis was used as a control of morphology and also for further 3-dimensional reconstruction of the Iscom structure. RESULTS We are able to demonstrate that Iscom particles prepared from HIV envelope proteins, known to elicit high antibody titers and neutralizing antibody, exhibit icosahedral symmetry. The particles, about 30 -35 nm in diameter, appear to be resistant to physical-chemical stress. The proteins appear as globular sub-units on the Iscom particle. CONCLUSION Using cryo-techniques a compact,icosahedral structure is envisaged. The structure of the Iscom is stable. The protein sub-units are probably spaced on a icosahedral, cage-like matrix of Quil A and lipid.Beside inbuilt adjuvant activity the regular shape and the space between the antigens may contribute to the high immunogenicity of the Iscom. 214 [Page 215](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/213) Hoffman* and B. Golding*. *Laboratory of Cell Biology, Division of Blood and Blood Products, F.D.A., Bethesda, MD. Objective: To determine whether immunization with HIV-1 conjugated to the T-independent carrier, Brucella abortus (Ba), induces anti-HIV antibody responses. This would provide a basis for immunizing HIV infected individuals having deficient T cell, but intact B cell function, with a T-independent HIV vaccine. Methods: Conjugation was performed by the carbodiimide method, adding 100 HIV-1 particles to 1 Ba bacillus. Mice (BALB/c) were immunized, in groups of five, at intervals of four weeks, with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),HIV-1, HIV-1 conjugated to Ba (HIV-Ba), and Ba. Alum was used as an adjuvant. Sera were assessed for anti-HIV-1 activity by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), immunoblot and neutralization. Results: The mice immunized with HIV-Ba responded earlier and developed higher titers against HIV-1 than HIV-1 alone, as determined by EIA. HIV-specific antibody was not found in the mice receiving PBS or Ba. Isotype analysis revealed IgG2a as the major isotype induced by HIV-Ba, but IgGl was predominant following HIV alone. Immunoblots showed that HIV-Ba and HIV alone induced antibodies which reacted with all the HIV antigens. The HIV-Ba antibodies Ba is immunogenic in mice and may provide a strategy for inducing neutralizing antibodies in humans including those with deficient T cell function. 2206 SYNTHETIC GLYCOLIPIDS WITH ADJUVANT ACTIVITY IN IMMUNOCOMPETENT AND IMMUNOSUPPRESSED MICE IMMUNIZED WITH VIRAL VACCINES 1, **Central Research and Development, Leverkusen, FRG Objective. To evaluate synthetic glycolipids which display structural similarities to naturally occurring glycolipids for their use as adjuvants in combination with viral vaccines. Methods and Results. Derivatives of N-alkyl-N-glycosylcarboxamides were tested in vitro (Mishell Dutton test) for immunopotentiating activity. One of the most active compounds was found to be N-(2-L-leucine-amino-2-deoxyB-D-glucopyranosyl)-N-octadecyl-dodecanoic acid amide (Bay R 1005). Bay R 1005 enhanced protection of mice which had been immunized with heat-inactivated herpes simplex type I virus (HSV I), B-propiolactone-inactivated pseudorabies virus or with antigen purified from HSV I. After challenge with infectious virus survival rates and mean survival time of the immunized mice treated with Bay R 1005 were significantly increased as compared with the controls which received only vaccine. Concomitantly, an increase in neutralizing antibodies was observed. Bay R 1005 was also active in immunocompromised animals. Restorative and adjuvantive effects were observed in mice which were immunosuppressed by bacterial lipopolysaccharides or Melanoma B16 tumors. Conclusion. Based on these results Bay R 1005 may prove useful as adjuvant for the immunization of patients with immunodeficiencies (e.g. AIDS patients). Notes: 2207 NON-SPECIFIC CELLULAR IMMUNE RESPONSE IN NAIVE AND HIV-I INFECTED CHIMPANZEES Louis J. Lafrado, DA Quintana, JC Holloman AFB, NM 88330 Objective. The objective of this study was to determine the effect(s) of retroviral infection on the neutrophil (PMN) and natural killer (NK) cell functions in chimpanzees. Retroviral infections in other species have been shown to suppress these cells. Methods. Heparinized venous blood was collected, diluted 2X with HBSS and centrifuged over a histopaque gradient (1.077g/ml). PMN were isolated from the resulting pellet while NK cells were harvested from the mononuclear band. PMN function was assessed using the chemiluminescence (CL) as a parameter of function. NK cell function was addressed with the 51Cr release from labelled K562 target cells. Effector to target ratios were used in the range of 10:1 to 200:1. PMN were primarily examined for their responsiveness to calcium mobilization and influx across the cell membrane. Results. Preliminary data indicate that chimpanzee PMN and NK cells respond similarly to other species. Stimu-- of with latex beads, fMLP in response values (mV). Preincubation of PMN with retroviral proteins would suggest a suppression of calcium dependent activation of the CL response. NK cell function was titrated over the range and also yielded consistent results (51Cr release). The effect of HIV challenge on PMN and NK cells in chimpanzees will be discussed. 2208 KINETICS OF HELPER T-CELL RESPONSE TO HIV-1 IN priming of helper T-cells is essential to develop protective immunity to viruses, we investigated the kinetics of PBL specific proliferative responses (PR) to HIV and to vaccinia(VV)antigens in chimpanzees(Ch) vaccinated with different HIV/VV recombinants. Methods Ch were immunized with the original VV strain as control,or with constructs expressing gpl60,given exclusively or mixed with one or two other constructs producing p25 or IL2, the latter in an attempt to amplify immune responses. Results (1)In contrast with strong and sustained PR to VV,PR to HIV was weak and transient even when the IL2 recombinant was used:it had disappeared by the 4th week after the 1st boost, it could still be present but greatly reduced 6 weeks after the 2nd.(2)Only PR to purified gpl60,and no separate PR to p25, could be detected in Ch which had simultaneously received gpl60 and p25 constructs.(3)This corresponded with weak non-neutralizing antibody production. Conclusion The limited and transient nature of helper T-cell reactivity to HIV is probably due to reduced specific memorycell priming.It might explain why such Ch are not protected from infection when subsequently challenged with live HIV. 215 [Page 216](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/214) 2209 CELL MEDIATED CYTOTOXICITY AGAINST TARGET CELLS EXPRESSING HIV-1 PROTEINS Scott Koenig, P Earl, D Powell, HC Lane, S Merli, AS Fauci et al., National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD Objective. We previously reported that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HIV seropositive individuals (HIV-SI) can lyse lymphoblastoid cells (LCL) infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) expressing HIV (HTLVIIIB) envelope and gag pro teins. Cytotoxic activity was detected predominantly in healthy HIVSI and patients with ARC and only rarely in patients with AIDS. We have extended these studies to characterize the specificity and cell types mediating this response. We also sought to determine if the HIV-specific cytotoxic response could be reconstituted or augmented in HIV-SI (healthy, ARC, and AIDS) participating in a study of AZT used in combination with syngeneic bone marrow transplan- tation (BMT) without ablation from healthy seronegative identical twins. Materials. Freshly separated PBMC from HIV-SI served as the effector cells and autologous LCL or P815 (murine mastocytoma) cells transfected with human class I genes (P815-CL I) and infected with rVY expressing env or gag proteins, served as target cells in a 4 hour Cr release cytotoxicity assay. Results. PBMC from HIV-SI lysed LCL targets expressing two dissimilar HIV env proteins from the HIVIIIB and HIVRp isolates comparably. In contrast, lysis of LCL targets expressing IV env was not seen. Lysis of the P815-CL I target cells expressing HiV env proteins by PBMC mismatched at Class I suggested that cytotoxic cells of non-T cell origin may be present in the unfractionated population. By fluorescence-activated cell sorting of the PBMC, cytototoxic responses against env expressing targets was demonstrated in both CD3 and CD3- subpopulations. Conclusions. Cytotoxicity against target cells expressing env proteins appears to be directed against a conserved region of env. PBMC from HIV-SI may be composed of multiple cell types that could mediate cytotoxicity against HIV infected cells in vivo. 2210 COMPARISONS OF NEUTRALIZATION KINETICS RATES FROM INFECTED HUMANS, INFECTED CHIMPANZEES AND GP120 VACCINATED ANIMALS Peter L. Nara*, N Dunlop*, J Kessler*, and P Fischinger*+ *Office of the Director, National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research Facility, Frederick, MD, USA, +DHHS Public Health Services, Washington, D.C., USA OBJECTIVE. To determine the kinetic rates of neutralization for HIV-1 infected humans and chimpanzees and compare these to gpl20 envelope vaccines given in various adjuvants to various animal species. METHODS. All sera were tested at various time points and dilutions and evaluated for the non-neutralizing virus fraction in an HIV-1 induced syncytial-forming microassay with various HIV-1 isolates. RESULTS. Sera from infected humans, chimpanzees and animals vaccinated with gpl20, in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) were capable of neutralizing 200 syncytialforming units of virus in less than 1 minute. Serum from chimpanzees given gpl20 in alum required 15 min. for similar neutralization. Other vaccination/adjuvant results too numerous to mention here will be discussed. CONCLUSION. It appears infected humans and chimps, as well as animals vaccinated with gpl20 in CFA, produce a rapidly neutralizing antibody during the course of their infection or immunizations. These findings are encouraging in light of other lentivirus infections of animals (i.e., visna), where the neutralizing antibody has less affinity for the virus than the virus has for the host cell. Therefore, protection through vaccination from a cell-free virus challenge is still theoretically possible. Notes: 2211 COMPLEMENT DEPENDENT CYTOLYSIS OF HIV INFECTED CELLS WITH ANTI-IDIOTYPE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST THE CD4 MOLECULE T Ohno, M Nakamura, M Kamada M Watanabe, Y Kohno and M Kobayashi The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo We have prepared MoAbs against the OKT4A antibody in an;ttempt to develop anti-idiotypes which identify HIV epitope that bind to the CD4 receptor. Murine MoABs designated JT1 -1D7 and JT2-N1 5 has been generated which binds to the OKT4A antibody. MoAb JT-1-1D7 has Ilso been found by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay to bind to purified virus from the HIVIIIB isolate. Similar findings have been obtained with the divergent Haitian AL 1212C and African 906 strains. Moreover MoAbs has been found to broadly neutralize infectivity of the HIV-IIIB, AL 1212C and 906 strains. We also demonstrate by immunofluorescence that JT1-1D7 can discriminate demonstrate HIV infected cells. In attempting to therapeutic use of this MoAb against infected cells, the complement dependent cytolysis of HIV infected cells was studied. HIV-IIIB infected H-9 cells were incubated for 60 minutes at 37Co with MoAbs and rabbit complement. The cells were washed with PBS three times and stained with trypanblue to score live and dead cells. As increase the MoAb, complement dependent cytolysis was obtained. 2212 MODULATION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TOWARDS ANTI-FELV IMMUNITY ANTIBODIES Albert D.M.E. Osterhaus, K. Weijer, A.G.C.M. UytdeHaag National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, The Netherlands Among the approaches to develop a FeLV vaccine, we considered the generation of an anti-idiotype vaccine. Virus neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibodies were generated against an epitope of gp70 shared by all three subtypes. Against one of these, MoAb 3-17, a panel of 15 anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies (MoAb2) were generated. They proved to recognize partially overlapping private idiotypes within the paratope of MoAb 3-17. Repeated immunizations with low-titered anti-FeLV serum titers in BALB/c mice. In a second series of experiments rabbits were immunized with an affinity purified polyclonal cat antiFeLV neutralizing antibody preparation. Immunization of BALB/c mice with Ig from these rabbits resulted in high anti-FeLV antibody titers within 3 weeks. 216 [Page 217](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/215) 2213 STRATEGIES TO DEVELOP IDIOTYPE-BASED VACCINES FOR al., *Department of Virology and Immunology, Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, San Antonio, TX USA and **Becton-Dickinson Monoclonal Center, Mountain View, CA USA. Objective. To assess the idiotype (Id) based vaccine concept by using mouse monoclonal (MoAb) anti-CD4 preparations to induce in vivo an internal image antiId response which serologically mimicks CD4 and blocks human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro. Methods. Our laboratories have identified several anti-CD4 MoAb that recognize distinct CD4 epitopes and have the capacity to block HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infectivity in vitro. We have immunized a series of small experimental animals and baboons with individual anti-CD4 MoAb or a cocktail of different blocking anti-CD4 in order to examine whether an anti-Id response could be induced. Results. The data indicates that: (i) an anti-Id response can be induced which binds HIV-1 and SIV gpl20 by Western blot analysis; (ii) a cell mediated immune response to HIV-1 antigens was induced by anti-CD4 immunization, and (iii) no immunosuppression was observed in baboons receiving anti-CD4. We are currently assessing the in vitro neutralizing activity of the anti-Id response to the various anti-CD4 MoAb against divergent HIV-1 isolates and SIV. In addition, this vaccine approach is currently being tested in rhesus monkeys for efficacy of SIV induced disease. Conclusion. Our data indicates the potential use of Id based vaccine strategies for controlling HIV infection. 214 ANTI-IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODIES THAT DETECT 2214 INTERSPECIES ANTI-HIV gag REGION ANTIBODIES AND ELICIT ANTI-HIV RESPONSES IN RODENTS W. J. W. Morrow*, T. Anderson,** I. Gaston*, K. Steimer***, M.S. California, San Francisco; **Berkeley Antibody Company, Richmond, California; ***Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, California Objective. These studies were designed to demonstrate the feasibility of an anti-idiotype strategy for developing a vaccine for the control of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Methods. Anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Ids) were elicited in rabbits by immunization with a murine monoclonal antibody (Abl) that identified an epitope on the p25 gag core protein of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Anti-isotype and anti-allotype antibodies were removed by extensive absorption on mouse immunoglobulin affinity columns, and the binding of the antiidiotype antibodies to the Abl was characterized. Results. After demonstrating the idiotype-anti-idiotype binding complementarity of the antibodies, the ability of the anti-Ids to recognize interspecies idiotypes was studied. The anti-idiotype antibodies were demonstrated to be capable of identifying a common idiotype associated with anti-HIV antibodies from the sera of both humans and chimpanzees infected with the AIDS retrovirus. Finally, it was determined that the anti-Ids were capable of stimulating the production of anti-HIV (gag antigen-specific) antibodies in inoculated rats. Conclusions. These data indicate that these anti-idiotype antibodies bear the internal image of HIV gag region epitope, and that they can elicit HIV-specific immune responses. Furthermore, these results indicate that the anti-idiotype approach to vaccine development is feasible and that this strategy may prove to be useful to protect individuals from HIV infection. Notes: 2215 HGP-30: A SYNTHETIC SUBUNIT AIDS VACCINE BASED Objective: To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and neutralization activity of a candidate AIDS vaccine based on the protective potential of antibodies to the p17 gag protein of HIV. Method: Immunogenicity is defined by an ELISA specific for HGP-30; neutralization activity by inhibition of HIV infection of H9 cells and safety by autopsy and blood hematology and chemistries. The synthetic peptide designated HGP-30 is an analogue representing the 30 amino acid region of the p17 HIV-1 between amino acids 85 and 115 and is conjugated to KLH and given with alum or CFA to increase immunogenicity. Results: The vaccine was safely administered to mice, rabbits, dogs, monkeys, and chimps. Immunogenicity was found in all species and neutralization of in vitro HIV infection was group rather than type specific. Successfully immunized animals are also primed to respond to either whole virus or viral protein challenge with high titer antibodies to p17. Immunization of chimps with 50ug/kg of the vaccine resulted in significant antibody titers following 4 vaccinations over 6 months. Conclusion: The pl7-based vaccine is safe, immunogenic, and predicted to provide group specific protection. Preclinical toxicology studies have been completed and a multi-center Phase I trial in high risk seronegative volunteers is planned. 2216 DIVERGENT HUMAN T-CELL AND IgG RESPONSE TO HIV PEPTIDES. Britta Wahren*, J. Rosen**, E. Sandstrbm***, S. Modrow****, H. Wigzell***** *National Bacteriological Laboratory, Stockholm, **Johnson & Johnson, Biotechnology Center, La Jolla, USA, ***S6dersjukhuset, Stockholm, ****Max von Pettenkofer Institut, Munich, Germany, *****Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden Objective. To delineate HIV peptides that cause immunoreactivity with cells or antibodies in natural infection. Methods. HIV peptides were designed with three approaches in mind: 1) with properties ascribed to epitopes reactive with immunoglobulins turn); T-cell reactivity (amphipathicity, (X -helix); and 3) covering the entire region with overlapping linear sequences. Sera and lymphocytes of 60 HIV-infected persons were assayed. Results. Several peptides corresponding to gag p24 and p15 regions gave high and frequent T-cell responses. The major IgG reactivities were instead defined to interspaced regions. In the envelope region, the peptides causing cellular proliferation were mainly from the site ascribed to CD4 binding, while IgG reactivity was - as expected - strong to aminoterminal peptides of the known p121 region of gp41. The COOHterminal of the pol region had poor reactivity both with cells and IgG. Conclusion. HIV-specific peptides evoking cellular (T4) responses were identified. They differed from those reactive with naturally induced HIV-specific IgG. F. Krowka, Robert J. Debs, Vernon C. Maino and Daniel P. ~tites University of California, San Francisco, CA and Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA We have investigated the lymphocyte proliferative responses induced by liposome-coupled (LC) synthetic peptides corresponding to highly conserved, immunodominant regions of the HIV envelope glycoprotein (gpl20). The peptides were coupled covalently to pre-formed liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and maleimidophenyl-butyryl-phosphatidylethanolamine, and incubated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from individuals seropositive (Ab+) or seronegative (Ab-) for HIV. LC-peptides stimulated significant proliferation of PBMC from HIV Ab+ asymptomatic and ARC patients. In the presence of interleukin-2, 61% of HIV Ab+ individuals' lymphocytes proliferated in response to one LC-peptide, and 69% to another. Only 25% of ARC or AIDS patients' cells responded to either of these LCpeptides, indicating a significant correlation between poor reactivity to immunodominant HIV epitopes and disease progression. PBMC from HIV Ab- individuals did not respond to the LC-peptides. The free peptides, two control peptides coupled to liposomes, or unconjugated liposomes did not elicit any proliferative response from any of the donors tested. Our results suggest that conjugation of antigens to liposomes may facilitate their presentation by macrophages. Stimulation of cellmediated immune responses by LC HIV peptides may have therapeutic and/or prophylactic applications for HIV infections. 2218 T J. Rosen* Johnson and Johnson Biotechnology Center, La Jolla, CA, **National Bacteriological Laboratory, 105 21 Stockholm Objective: To determine which regions of HIV gpl20 are capable of stimulating murine T cells and to compare these regions with those recognized by human T cells. Methods: Overlapping peptides corresponding to the HIV:HTLVIIIb gpl20 amino acid sequence were synthesized. These peptides were injected into mice as free peptides and the presence of peptide-specific antibody was determined. Reactive peptides were further characterized for the presence of T cell stimulating determinants by immunizing mice and examining the primed lymph node cells for specific peptide-induced cell proliferation. The responding cell phenotype was characterized by antibody plus complement depletion experiments. Stimulatory regions in the murine model were compared to those regions reactive with human (AIDS patient) lymphocytes. Results: A relatively large number of peptides from gpl20 were capable of priming and stimulating murine T cells. The response was primarily limited to the Thelper cell subset. The majority of peptides which stimulated murine T cells were not significantly reactive with human patient T cells. Conclusions: The majority of T cell-inducing peptides were not common to mouse and human lymphocytes. The subset of peptides which are reactive in both species may be useful in vaccine development, particularly when coupled to neutralizing B cell determinants. Notes: 2219 HUMORAL AND CELLULAR (HIV-IMMUNOSOME). L. Publique du Quebec. Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, P.Q. Canada. Objective. To prepare an experimental HIV-subunit vaccine and to evaluate its capacity to induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in laboratory animals. Methods. The HIV-immunosome (HIV-IMS) was prepared by anchoring purified gp160/120 into the bilayer of preformed liposomes. antibodies induced by HIV-IMS were determined by W.B., RIPA and neutralization. HIV-IMS capacity to induce Interleukin-2 production in mice was also evaluated. Mice (C57/BL) were immunized with different concentrations of HIV-IMS. At 7 days, their spleens were removed and the splenocytes put into culture with or without HIV-antigens. At 24 hours. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) activity in the culture supernatants was measured using an IL-2-dependant established CTL line. Results. The humoral immune responses were different whether purified gp160/120 or HIV-IMS were used to immunized animals. Splenocyte supernatants of HIV-IMS-primed animals exhibited high levels of IL-2 activity. Furthermore, in vitro restimulation with the same antigen led to an increase in IL-2 production. Conclusion. These observations indicate that HIV-IMS is adequate to elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Therefore, the usefulness of HIV-IMS as vaccine against AIDS deserves further investigation. 2220 AN IMMUNODOMINANT EPITOPE OF HIV ENVELOPE RECOGNIZED BY CLASS IMHC-RESTRICTED MURINE CYTOTOXIC T CELLS. J. A. Berzofsky, H. Takahashi, J. Cohen, A. Hosmalin, K.B. Cease, R. Houghten, J. L. Cornette, C. DeLisi, B. Moss, and R. N. Germain. NCI and NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA Objective and Methods. To investigate the epitope-specificity and Ir gene control of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses, we elicited CTL to the HIV gpl60 env protein by infecting mice with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the gpl60 gene and restimulating the T cells in vitro with a transfected cell line expressing the same gene. CTL were tested on transfected targets or untransfected targets in the presence of synthetic peptides. Results. H-2d mice were found to be CTL high responders and H-2k mice low responders to the gpl60-vaccinia construct under these conditions. Using 41 synthetic peptides based on segments of gpl60, primarily from \"regions able to fold as amphipathic helices, we found that H-2d mice respond mostly to a single immunodominant site conforming to the amphipathic a-helix model seen by CD4-CD8+ CTL in association with the Dd class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. Conclusions. The detection of a response in the context of only 1 of 4 class I MHC molecules tested, and the presentation by that one of primarily a single epitope of gpl60, indicate that the CTL repertoire elicited by the HIV envelope in association with murine class I MHC molecules may be very limited. Because this epitope is in a variable segment of the sequence, a vaccine based on this epitope would have to be polyvalent. Yet, the variability also suggests that this region may be under selective pressure from human CTL, and so this site may be immunodominant in humans also. These results may be of clinical importance in vaccine developmern:. 218 [Page 219](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/217) 2221 INDUCTION OF HIV ANTIBODIES BY HYBRID VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES Sally E Adams*, E L Berrie*, J M Senior*,S M Kingsman**, A J Kingsman*. *British Bio-Technology, **Dept. of Biochemistry, Oxford University, Oxford, U.K. Objective. To present HIV antigens to the immune system in a polyvalent, particulate form by the production of hybrid Ty:HIV VLPs in yeast. Methods. The TYA gene of the yeast retrotransposon Ty, encodes the major structural protein of Ty-VLPs. A series of expression vectors have been developed in order to express any coding sequence as a fusion protein with most of the TYA gene. A range of TYA:HIV env and gag fusion genes have been constructed in vitro. Results. Overexpression of such fusion genes in yeast results in the production of large numbers of hybrid Ty:HIV VLPs. These are easily purified and react with anti-HIV sera. Immunogold labelling using monoclonal antibodies shows that the added antigen is located on the exterior of the hybrid particles. Immunization of rabbits with purified hybrid Ty:HIV VLPs elicits the production of sera that reacts with HIV antigens. Furthermore, Ty-VLPs induce a significant antibody titre in rats in the absence of any adjuvant. Conclusion. A range of hybrid Ty-VLPs have been produced carrying from 3kd to 43kd of additional protein. The system therefore appears to be extremely versatile. The immunogenicity of the hybrid Ty-VLPs in conjunction with the demonstration that the added antigen is presented on the outside of the particle suggests that this hybrid Ty-VLP technology may provide a novel approach to the development of an AIDS vaccine. 2222 INDUCTION OF HIV-SPECIFIC CD8 CYTOTOXIC T lymphocytes (CTLs) following immunization with virus recombinants containing the HIV-1 env or F (3' orf) gene. Methods. BALB/c, DBA/2 and C3H/He mice were immunized by the vaccinia virus recombinants. The appearence of HIV-specific CTLs was detected with syngeneic mouse cells that express the HIV-1 env or F gene following DNA transfection. Results. The CTLs detected are positive for Thy-i and Lyt-2 (CD8) surface markers, and negative for L3T4 (CD4) marker. They are restricted by class I H-2 transplantation antigens, and are specific for the HIV-1 antigen used for vaccination. Finally, DBA/2 mice immunized with the env gene recombinant are resistant to the growth of transfected, syngeneic tumor cells expressing HIV-1 env antigens. Conclusion. Our murine experimental system can be used to study cell-mediated immune responses elicited by vaccinia virus recombinants containing HIV-1 genes. Immunization with structural envelope proteins or with non-structural F protein induces HIV-1-specific CTLs.

The protein has a molecular weight of 160 kDa, is expressed on the surface of infected cells and can be produced in large scale cultures of Vero cells. The purified protein has been used to immunise a variety of animal models and it elicits high titres of antibody that show cross neutralising antibody activity in vitro. The glycoprotein was also shown to elicit a pronounced cellular immune response. 219 [Page 220](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/218) 3001 INHIBITION OF REPLICATION OF ANALOGS H. The of replication of HIV in H9 cells and Mo-MuLV in 3T3 cells U = uridine, T = thymidine) was examined. All analogs were less active inhibitors of HIV replication than AZT, except FLT, which was as active as AZT: IC50 FLT < AZT < AZU = FLU < < FLPU << AZEU. The 3'-fluoro analogs and AZEU did not inhibit MuLV replication at non-cytotoxic concentrations. AZU and FLU were less cytotoxic than the corr. T analogs. The 5'-triphosphates (TP) of AZU, AZT, AZEU, FLT and FLEU were tested as inhibitors of the HIV- and MuLV-RTs. For HIV-RT the following order of potency (Ki/Km) of the 5'-TPs was found FLT = AZT < AZU < AZEU < FLEU. The 5'TP of AZEU, FLT and FLEU did not inhibit MuLV-RT (Ki/Km > 1.0), explaining in part the lack of effect of these analogs against MuLV. 3002 POTENTIAL OF D. N. G. R. inhibitory effects on rec. HIV-RT and calf thymus DNA polymerase a were studied. For HIV-RT the Ki/Km values were between.0.5 and 0.11. All inhibitors showed a competitive mode of inhibition with respect to dTTP. Relative to inhibition of DNA polymerase a, PredUTP was the least selective and iPredJTP the most selective inhibitor. The potential of the corr. nucleoside analogs as anti-HIV agents was limited Cax were low, with elimination half-lives (T~) of only minutes. However, the 5'-TP of nPre-araU was a potent inhibitor of HIV-RT (Ki/Km = 0.01), nPre-araU was not cytotoxic, Cmax values were relatively high, F was >30 %, and T2 3 h. Thus, nPre-araU is a lead for a potential anti-HIV agent. Cellular Pharmacology August, Marongiu, Gao, H.-Y. Qian and W.H. Dept. of Pharmacology, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06510 USA Objective. To define the cellular '-didehydro-analogs of thymidine (d4T) and cytidine (d4C), anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro, in human H9 T-cells. Methods. The cytotoxicity of d4T and d4C toward H9 cells in culture, the prevention of toxicity by various nucleosides, and their effect on macromolecular synthesis were determined. Studies of the subcellular distribution and metabolism of labelled d4T were also performed. Results. The ID50 for H9 cell growth was 500 MM for d4T, 49 cM for d4C, and 150 AM for AZT. dThd prevented the cytotoxicity of an ID50 dose of AZT, but not that produced by the ID50 of d4T. dCyd or dUrd were unable to prevent d4T or AZT cytotoxicity. AZT had profound effects on macromolecular synthesis, whereas d4T and d4C (both 100,mM) had no inhibitory effect on RNA, DNA or protein synthesis. d4T and d4C had no significant effect on cellular dThd metabolism. Radioactive d4T was taken up into the acid soluble and macromolecular fractions. Conclusion. d4T shows great promise as a drug for therapy of AIDS. 3004 Protection of monocyte-macrophages (M/M) against HIV infection by dideoxynucleosides in vitro.

Objective: Evaluate the ability of several dideoxynucleosides (ddN) to protect M/M against HIV infection. Methods: M/M elutriation, 2-hour esterase <1% E+. M/M were infected with the monocytotropic strain of HIV-1 Ba-L, in presence of AZT, and 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine (ddA). Supernatant p24 and reverse were assessed for 42 days. Results:Although untreated M/M showed high HIV production, >98% viral inhibition was obtained in fresh (2-hr was seen in 5-day M/M in most experiments but at higher drug concentrations: 0.5uM AZT, O.luM ddC and 5uM ddA.

The hr exposure 3H-ddC pmole/106cells endogenous deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) which competes with ddCTP, M/M, 4.4 M/M and pmole in Conclusions: achievable concentrations of ddN can protect M/M from HIV-infection; the level of such HIV-inhibition, however, may be influenced by the relevant kinases associated with the M/M differentiation. 220 [Page 221](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/219) AND ANTI-HIV A Van Aerschot, M Baba, R Pauwels, J Balzarini, E De Clercq Rega Institute, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium Objective. Synthesis of new nucleoside analogues with potential anti-HIV activity. were of DAST with the precursors having a B-D-threopentofuranosyl configuration afforded the compounds in yields varying from 35 to 65 %. The 2',3'-didehydro2',3'-dideoxy derivatives of cytosine, uridine, thymidine and adenosine were prepared by previously published methods. The guanosine derivative was synthesized from the mesylated precursor having the B-D-erythro configuration by treatment with potassium tert-butylate in DMSO. Results. Among the didehydro derivatives, only 2',3'dideoxycytidinene and 2',3'-dideoxythymidinene showed good activity with a selectivity index in ATH8 cells of 100 and 27, respectively (as compared to 17 for azidothymidine). The 3'-fluoro derivatives of 2',3'-dideoxythymidine and -uridine were found to be very active inhibitors of HIV replication, with a selectivity index in MT-4 cells of 200 and 400, respectively. The diaminopurine and guanine derivatives had a selectivity index of 80 and 96, respectively. Conclusion. The 3'-fluoro-2',3'-dideoxyribosides of thymine, uracil, diaminopurine of cytidine and thymidine are potent and selective HIV inhibitors, worthy of further exploration. 3006 IN VITRO INHIBITION OF HIVREPLICATION FRG. Objective. The for nucleoside analogues more potent than AZT for HIV-therapy. Methods. Nucleosideanalogues were synthesized by established methods. Their anti-HIV-activity and toxicity was tested in two in vitro culture systems. In theMT4 system inhibition of HIVcell toxicity was measured by H-thymidine incorporation into DNA. In the peripheral blood mononuclear cell system viral replication was followed by determination of the amount of HIV p24 antigen by a competition radioimmunoassay. Results. Sixty nucleoside analogues were tested including some for which activity has been reported earlier for comparison. The most active compound was FT. This compound was 5-10 times more potent (TD5 2 nM in MT4 system) than AZT (TD5 13 nM in MT4 system) in both systems. Its cytotoxicity was also enhanced by approximately the same factor resulting in a therapeutic index very similar to that of AZT. The corresponding deoxy-uridine derivative was approximately 200 times and the 5-methyldeoxycytidine derivative 1000 times less active. The deoxyguanosine was even less potent. Reduction of the azido group to an amino group abolished activity of AZT and 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyguanosine. 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyadenosine was not active. Conclusion. FT is an analogue with higher antiviral in vitro activity than AZT. Its development for anti-HIV therapy should be pursued. Notes: 3007 *Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY and **Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center, Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To study in vitro effects of 3'-F-TdR on replication of HIV-1, FeLV and lymphocyte evaluated in H9 cell cultures inoculated with HTLV-III in the presence of 3'-F-TdR. Supernatants were assayed for RT activity; HIV antigen in H9 cells was detected by IFA. Anti-FeLV effect was evaluated by an IFA focus inhibition assay and antiSIV effect in human PBMC cultures inoculated SIV/SMIM; supernatants were assayed for RT activity. Results. 3'-F-TdR inhibited HIV-1 replication, compared with infected controls, by 99% at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1.25 pM; by 83.3% at 0.625, inhibited by 96.0% at 100, 72.4% at 10, 21.5% at 1 and 16.5% at 0.1 pM. SIV replication was inhibited by 94.6% at 0.1, 97.8% at 0.2, and >99% at 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 UM. 3'-F-TdR inhibited incorporation of 3[H]thymidine into DNA of HL-60 cells with an ED5 of 133 yM; cell growth, at 72 hours, was inhibited with an ED5 of 19 pM. LPR to mitogens were reduced to 77% of control at 0.1, 50% at 1, 27% at 10 and 17% at 100 NM. Conclusion. In vitro anti-HIV-1, -FeLV and -SIV activity of 3'-F-TdR is comparable to that reported for AZT; however, it exhibits greater CT and inhibition of LPR. 3008 PREFERENTIAL INHIBITION OF University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Ga, and \"University of Georgia, Athens, Ga, USA. Obiective. The potency and selectivity of CS-87, AZT, and CS85 5'-triphosphates as inhibitors of HIV-1 and SIV reverse transcriptases (RTs) was determined. Methods. Partially purified RTs from HIV-1 and SIV-infected cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells and cellular DNA polymerase a were used in reactions directed by (rA)n-(dT)12-18 or activated DNA with the normal substrate dTTP held at 1 gM. Results. The triphosphates of CS-87, AZT, and CS-85 were competitive inhibitors of HIV-1 and SIV RTs with respect to dTTP. AZT-TP and CS-87-TP were about equally potent inhibitors, whereas CS-85-TP was about 10-fold less inhibitory. The Ki-values for AZT-TP, CS-87-TP, and CS-85-TP using HIV1 were 4.0, 5.9, and 50 nM, respectively. Using SIV RT, the Ki-values were 5.0, 7.5, and 45 nM, respectively. Km for dTTP was 0.5 pIM and 1.5 gIM for HIV-1 and SIV RTs, showing that AZT-TP and CS-87-TP had an up to 300 times higher affinity for the RTs than dTTP. Cellular DNA polymerase a activity was reduced by 50% at 23 piM AZT-TP or CS-87-TP, and at 375 IM CS-85-TP. Conclusion. CS-87-TP and AZT-TP were equally effective and selective inhibitors of HIV-1 and SIV-1 RTs. CS-85-TP, although 10 times less potent, had a selectivity similar to the other nucleotides. 221 [Page vs. DNA POLYMERASES o.

Objective. To evaluate the effects of 5-AZA-cytosine nucleoside analogs on the replication of HIV-1 in vitro to determine if they have significant anti-HIV-1 activity. Methods. CEM cells, infected or not with HIV-I [from L. Montagnier), were treated AZA-cytidine (5-AZA-C] and 5-AZA-2'-Deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC) for 1 to 7 days in culture. Zidovudine (AZT),]. at the same concentrations, was included as a reference anti-viral agent. Cell viability was ascertained by vital dye exclusion. The degree of cytopathic effect as cell aggregation/fusion and vacuole formation, was assessed. Indirect immunofluorescence with human anti-HIV antisera was used to evaluate the number of infected cells. The Reverse Transcriptase (RT) activity of the cell supernatants was determined by standard methods. Results. At concentrations greater than 10-6M, the 5-AZA-C and 5-AZA-dC were toxic to the CEM cells. At 10-61O, both 5-AZA-C and 5-AZA-dC inhibited the replication of HIV-1 in the cells. Low amounts of RT were present in supernatants of drug-treated, infected cells and reduced fluorescent labelling was observed. The anti-viral effect seen with AZT was similar to or reduced compared to both test nucleoside analogs. Conclusion. Our preliminary results indicate that both 5-AZA-C and 5-AZA-dC have a pronounced anti-viral effect on HIV-1 replication in vitro and further investigation of their potential in treating AIDS is warranted. Notes: 3011 PRINCIPLES OF SYNTHESIS OF USSR Academy of Sciences, **National Cardiology Research Center of the USSR Academy of Irledical Sciences, Moscow Within the last 7-8 years syntheses of a great number of new 3'-substituted nucleoside 5'-triphosphates have been carried out, their properties to inhibit the DNA synthesis catalyzed by different DNA polymerases from mammals, bacteria, phages and retroviruses studied. There has been revealed a large group of this class compounds capable of inhibiting the DNA biosynthesis by the principle of termination. It is shown that DNA polymerases are caracteristic of strongly different specificity towards the above mentioned analogs. An empirical rule is formulated in order to construct and synthesize 3'-substituted nucleoside 5'-triphosphates that selectively block the DiTA synthesis catalyzed by reverse transcriptases of retroviruses, these substances not effecting the DIHt synthesis catalyzed with marm-alian polymerases. Some of the nucleoside analogs under study lhave been found to irilibit the reproduction of HIV-1 and RiV in appropriate cell cultures. 3012 EFFECTS OF HYDROXYUREA ON THE PHOSPHORYLATION 1, Institute, Stockholm **Dept. Virology, National Bacteriological Laboratory, Stockholm. Objective: To investigate the effects of inhibition of concentrations of hydroxyurea. The amount of mono-di- and triphosphate of the nucleoside analog added were HPLC. Results: Hydroxyurea increased the phosphorylation of 3'-fluorothymidine. At low concentrations (0.01pM) of the drug the major part was phosphorylated to the triphosphate while at increasing concentrations of the drug (up to 1pM) there was an accumulation at the monophosphate level. Conclusion: Phosphorylation of 3'-fluorothymidine can be increased by inhibition of the de novo pathway for deoxynucleotide synthesis. The drug is efficiently phosphorylated to the monophosphate level while the phosphorylation to the diphosphate seems to be rate limiting in the formation of the triphosphate. 222 [Page 223](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/221) 3013 STUDIES ON THE METABOLISM AND UPTAKE OF DIDEOXYADENOSINE (ddAdo) IN HUMAN LYMPHOCYTES. **University of Miami Medical School, Miami, *Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Florida, U. S. A. Objective. To study and compare the uptake and metabolism of ddAdo in Hg cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Methods and Results. The cells were briefly incubated with (2,8-JH)ddAdo,separated by centrifugation on an oil layer and drug accumulation was calculated from the cell associated radioactivity. Extra- and intracellular ddAdo and its deaminated product,ddIno,were quantitated by HPLC When exposed for 10 min and 24 hrs, ddAdo was deaminated by 60% and 98% respectively in the tissue culture medium containing 20% heat inactivated fetal calf serum. Preincubation with ddAdo's by 65% in Hg cells and 55% in PBL. The effects of other natural nucleosides on drug accumulation markedly differed between H9 cells and PBL: 50 uM deoxyadenosine (dAdo)enhanced accumulation,40% in Hg cells nucleosides inhibited accumulation. Conclusion.(i) under normal cell culturing conditions, most of ddAdo is converted to ddIno and the antiviral activity of ddAdo may be due to ddlno;(ii)intercellular metabolic differences may exist among various cells which may be useful in developing therapeutic strategies. (Supported by 1 U01 AI25696). 3014 Johns. Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101 and DTC/COP, 1987). The activation of ddAdo proceeds both through a direct pathway (ddAdo + ddAMP - ddATP), catalyzed in its initial step by both dCyd kinase and Ado kinase; and through a phosphotransferase) and adenylosuccinate synthetase/lysae. To gain more substantial evidence for this new mechanism of drug activation, nucleotidases were purified to determine whether they could catalyze the phosphorylation of ddIno. Two nucleotidases from human erythrocytes and thymus were purified 2000- and 5,000-fold, respectively, by ion-exchange and FPLC chromatography. One of these enzymes demonstrated phosphorylating activity for ddIno. This enzyme required high salt and Mg2+ for optimal activity and was stimulated by ATP and the natural occurring diadenosine-5', 5'''-P, P4-tetraphosphate (AP4A). Approximate Km value for ddIno phosphorylation by this enzyme was 4.1 mM in the presence of 10 mM ATP, and 23.6 mM in the absence of ATP. These data indicate the presence of a specific nucleotidase in human erythrocytes and thymocytes capable of phosphorylating the anti-HIV compound, 2',3'dideoxyinosine.

Notes: 3015 21 3DIDEOXYCYTIDINE (ddC) IN THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS the AIDS Clinical Trials Group/NIAID, Bethedsa, Maryland Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of ddC in patients with AIDS or advanced ARC. Methods: Sixty-one patients with AIDS or advanced ARC >100 pg/ml and levels: 0.06, 0.03, 0.01 and 0.005 mg/kg orally every 4 hours. Serum p24 antigen, CD4 cell numbers, and toxicity parameters were monitored. Results: At 0.06 and 0.03, diffuse erythematous rash and aphthous stomatitis occurred in the first weeks on drug which resolved without interruption of therapy. Hematopoietic suppression was notably rare. Peripheral sensory neuropathy occurred in all patients at 0.06 and 0.03 between the 4th and 14th week which improved slowly after discontinuation of ddC. Serum p24 antigen fell significantly (>70% fall) in most patients during therapy. CD4 cell numbers tended to rise transiently on study, however no clear difference in skin test positivity or HIV co-culture positivity was seen. At the 0.01 and 0.005 dose levels, skin rash and aphthous stomatitis were mild or absent. Peripheral neuropathy, which occurred in all patients on 0.01 by week 12-14, was less severe and resolved more quickly than at higher doses. Significant suppression of serum p24 antigen was seen in many patients on the 0.01 dose. Patient accural at the 0.005 dose level is continuing. Conclusions: ddC should be studied further for anti-HIV effects and our plans for the future involve several regimens with alternating courses of ddC and AZT and one of concurrent administration of subeffective dosages of both drugs. 3016 PHOSPHORYLATION OF THE Borys Kierdaszuk, Christina and Staffan Eriksson Medical Nobel Institute, Department of Biochemistry I, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm Objective. 2', 3'-Dideoxycytidine (ddCyd) is a potent inhibitor of HIV replication. It requires phosphorylation by cellular kinases for antiviral activity. We have determined the capacity of pure human deoxycytidine kinase, a key enzyme in this metabolism to phosphorylate ddCyd. Several aspects of the rerulation of this enzyme was also determined. Methods. Cytoplasmic deoxycytidine kinase was purified 6000-fold from leucemic spleen to The active enzyme a phosphorylates both purine and pyrimidine deoxynucleosides but with varying relative efficiency depending on preparation conditions. Results. The Km over Vmax values for ddCyd, x min x mg, respectively. The nucleosides appeared competitive for the same active site and the enzyme was feed-back controlled by dCTP. Conclusion. Cytoplasmic deoxycytidine kinase phosphorylate ddCyd efficiently and the presence of this enzyme in cells is most likely a prerequisite for the antiviral effect of ddCyd. Knowledge about the reculation of this metabolic step is of importance in planning future antiviral therapies. 223 [Page 224](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/222) S 17 ADENALLENE AND CYTALLENE, ACYCLIC NUCLEOSIDE 3 DERIVATIVES LACKING AN OXACYCLOPENTANE: IN VITRO INHIBITORS OF REPLICATION AND CYTOPATHIC EFFECT OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV). S Hayashil, S Phadtare2, J Zemlicka2, M Matsukura1, H MitsuyaI & Broderl. National Cancer Institutel, bethesda, MD; Michigan Cancer Foundation2, Detroit, MI. Objective. While several anti-retroviral compounds are already known (Mitsuya & Broder, Nature 325:773-778,1987), very few, if any, acyclic nucleoside analogues have been reported to exert significant inhibition against HIV. We now report a novel class of acycic nucleoside derivatives which suppress viruses in the HIV family in vitro. Results. Two acyclic CD4+ lines from the infectivity and cytopathic effect of HIV-1; inhibit the expression of p24 gag protein; and suppress the proviral DNA synthesis in CD4+ T-cells exposed to HIV-1 in vitro at concentrations that do not affect functions of normal T-cells in vitro. These compounds also inhibited the in vitro infectivity of another pathogenic human retrovirus, HIV-2. Further in vitro analyses of the anti-HIV-1 activity of certain related acyclic nucleoside derivatives having a four-carbon chain revealed that both the 4'-hydroxyl group and the specific placement of two double bonds in the four-carbon chain are critical for anti-HIV activity. Conclusion. Our observations should provide new structure/activity relationships for acyclic nucleosides, and these novel acyclic nucleosides may be of value in developing a new class of experimental drugs for the therapy of HIV-related diseases. 3018 IN VITRO AND IN VIVO ANTIRETROVIRAL EFFECT PURINE ANALOGUES Institute, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, 2National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA, 3Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, USA, 4Institute of Organic Chemistry recently been shown to be potent and selective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro. We evaluated these compounds for their antiretroviral activity in murine retrovirus [Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV)] vivo. Transformation of C3H fibroblasts by MSV was inhibited by ddAdo, ddDAPR and PMEA at a 50 % effective dose ranging between I to 128 pM. When evaluated in vivo, daily ddAdo treatment (625 mg/kg/day) markedly delayed MSV-induced tumor formation in NMRI mice and resulted in a 37 % increase of survival time of the mice. At 125 mg/kg/day, ddAdo was not effective. When applied at 625 mg/kg/day, ddDAPR caused death of the mice after 3 days while at 125 mg/ kg/day ddDAPR resulted only in a slight increase of life span of the mice. In contrast, daily PMEA treatment (at either 50 mg/kg/day or 20 mg/kg/day) completely prevented MSV-induced tumor formation and resulted in survival of all mice. In this respect, it proved superior to 3'azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) that was partially effective at 25 mg/kg/day. In conclusion, our observations justify that PMEA should be further investigated for its antiretroviral potential in vivo. Notes: 3019 ENHANCEMENT OF THE ANTIVIRAL EFFICACY OF A NEW PURINE NUCLEOSIDE ANALOG (NSC-614846) AGAINST HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) BY COMBINATION WITH RIBAVIRIN OR WITH OTHER COMPOUNDS Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL 35255 USAI and the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA2. Recently, the synthesis and selective antiviral activity of a new purine nucleoside analog (NSC-614846) against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was reported (Vince et al., 2nd Int. Conf. on Antiviral research, Williamsburg, VA, 1988). NSC-614846 exhibited significant activity against HIV in a variety of human OKT4+ cell lines with an MIC50 and selectivity ratio similar to that observed with 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) in parallel assays, in the light of the observation by Baba et al. (Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 31:1613-1617, 1987) that the anti-HIV activity of ddA could be enhanced by combination with ribavirin, we examined the possibility that the combination NSC-614846 + ribavirin might be synergistic or additive in its inhibitory effects against HIV in vitro. Potentiation of anti-HIV efficacy was indeed obtained with combinations of NSC-614846 + ribavirin and NSC-614846 + 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in vitro. Quantitative data obtained with these and other antiviral combinations will be presented as isobolograms and the potential or combination antiviral chemotherapy for the more effective treatment of AIDS will be discussed.

Med., New Haven, CT 2Div. of Biology & Medicine Brown Univ., Providence, RI 3Virology Ref. Lab., VA Med. Cntr., West Haven, CT AMBBAU, AMBAU, and AMBU AZT for their ability to inhibit HIVreplication. Methods. H9 cells were incubated with HIV (strain HTLV III B) for 24 hours, pelleted and resuspended at a concentration of 2x105 cells/ml in medium containing various concentrations of compounds. Each sample was seeded in duplicate in 6-well plates, 5 ml of cell suspension per well. All cells were kept in cultures at 370C for 7 days. Cell viability, reverse transcriptase activity and HIV antigen (P24) content were determined in cultures treated with the pyrimidine nucleoside analogs and compared to untreated cultures. Results. Supernatants of H9 cells treated with AZBdU or HMBBAU at a concentration of 50 pM had reverse transcriptase activity that were reduced by 41% and 53% as compared to controls. In addition, supernatants of H9 cells treated with AZBdU or HMBBAU at a concentration of 50 pM had quantities of HIV antigen that were reduced by 70% and 80% as compared to controls. Conclusion. AZBdU (3'-azido-5-benzyl-2'3'dideoxyuridin) and HMBBAU (hydroxy-methyl-BBAU), although less active than AZT, showed anti-HIV activity at non cytotoxic concentrations. Thus, these two compounds may be good candidates for further investigations. 224 [Page 225](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/223) 3021 ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY OF PYRIMIDINE NUCLEOSIDES AGAINST VIRUS TYPE-1 Chung K.

Results. 3'-Azido substituted 2'-deoxycytidine derivatives exhibited good antiviral activity. Reduction of 3'-azido group of uridines and thymidine to 3'-amino group markedly reduced the activity. 5'-Azido and 5'-amino nucleosides were found to be inactive, confirming the importance of 5'-phosphorylation for activation. Introduction of a 3'-iodo group also markedly reduced the antiviral activity, while 2',3'-unsubstituted uridines gave poor activity.

To obtain glycosylation inhibitors, which are active in virus-infected cells but not in uninfected cells. Methods. We exploited (a) the broad specifities of virusinduced nucleoside kinases and (b) the translocation of precursor sugar nucleotides into the Golgi vesicles as target mechanisms to obtain selective glycosylation virusinfected cells. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV) was used as a model virus. Results. Certain pyrimidine nucleosides added to HSVinfected cells caused a prominent inhbition of galactosylation and sialylation of N- and 0-linked oligosaccharides. No inhbition was observed in uninfected cells or in cells infected with a kinase-decicient virus strain. The nucleoside analogs metabolized to 5'-monophosphates were directly responsible for the inhibition, which resulted from a direct blocking of the translocation of pyrimidine sugar nucleotides into AM Agarwal** *Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, **University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, U. S. A. Objective. A series of nucleoside homo- and heterqdimers (DDAI-AZT,DDA-AZT-CEP,DDA-DDA,AZT-AZT,and DDA-DA) have been synthesized and compared in terms of their in vitro antiviral and cytotoxic properties to their parent monomers. Methods. A rapid and sensitive anti-HIV syncytiuminhibition drug screening assay has been developed to detect potential antiviral compounds. Giant syncytia are counted in a microtiter plate and compared to controls 96 hours after HIV inoculation of MT-2 cells(in triplicate). Active anti-HIV compounds can be prioritized for further testing according to a minimum cytotherapeutic index(CTI) of 5. A compound can be classified as having complete viral inhibition (CTI.5, ED100%/ID5) dose on uninfected cells). Results. The anti-HIV potency of the compounds tested were potential anti-HIV agents. Nucleoside dimers, such as DDA-AZT-CEP, should be actively considered for further evaluation as anti-HIV agents. 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine 2 cyanoethylphosphate 2'-deoxyadenosine 3024 ACTIVITY OF 2',3'-DIDEOXYPYRIMIDINE AGAINST HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TYPE 2.

CtrJDept. of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Gal; Dept. of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, Univ. of Georgia, Athens, Ga, USA2. Objective and Methods. It was recently reported that certain 2',3'dideoxynucleosides were less inhibitory to HIV-2 than HIV-1 in different continuous cell lines (AAC 31:1879, 1987). We now report the antiviral potency of several nucleoside analogues against HIV-2 and the closely related Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (as measured by a reverse transcriptase assay). The median effective concentration The good correlation in activity for most of the compounds between SIV, HIV-1, and HIV-2 was not entirely unexpected since SIV shares 53% and 76% amino acid sequence homology in the RT region with HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively. Of significance, was the finding that AZT was equally effective against all three retroviruses. The discrepancy between this report and the earlier one may reflect differences in virus strain, cell system used, and the method of measuring the antiviral endpoint.

Cantin. City of Hope Medical Center and Beckman Institute, Duarte, CA. Objective. To determine the antiviral activity of modified antisense constructs targeted to the tat-III gene of HIV-1. Method. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligos) were synthesized as methylphosphonates (oligo-MP), groups. Antisense were targeted to the first splice site of tat-III and control sequences were targeted to a herpes simplex IE/4 splice site. These were tested for antiviral potency using both syncytium formation and env-gag antigen synthesis as a measure of HIV-1 replication. Results. Oligo-MP inhibited HIV-1 at 1pM. Control oligo-MP had no activity but sense oligo-MP had some antiviral activity. Oligo-NH2 and oligo-LYS were inhibitory at O.1,AM and were more effective in cells treated prior to infection. Control oligo-NH2 and oligo-LYS, and polylysine alone had some Amino- and polylysine-modified antisense conjugates and oligo-MP are potent inhibitors of HIV1. The method of antiviral activity remains unknown and the presence of low-level activity with control oligos suggests that both specific and non-specific mechanisms could play a role in HIV-1 inhibition. 3026 PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF Subasinghe, Kazuo Shinozuka, and Jack S. Cohen Clinical Pharmacology Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA We have recently shown that phosphorothioate (PS) oligodeoxynucleotide (S-ODN) analogs, unlike their normal (PO) congeners, significant anti-HIV activity (Matsukura et al., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 84, 7706, 1987). We now report the syntheses, melting temperatures (Tm), and nuclease susceptibilities of a series of S-ODNs. These include all-PS duplexes, duplexes with one normal chain and the other chain either all PS, or endcapped with several PS groups at both 3' and 5' ends. The nuclease susceptibilities of the S-ODNs are much less than the normal phosphodiesters, but by contrast duplexes of SdT40 with poly-rA are much more susceptible to RNase H digestion. The Tm's are measures of hybridization; for AT base pairs of S-ODNs Tm's are significantly depressed relative to normals, while GC base pairs show much less Tm depression. The Tm's of S-dT oligomers with poly-rA were reduced relative to the double stranded normal duplexes. These results have significance for the biological properties of these analogs as anti-message inhibitors of gene expression, and provide a rational basis for the SdC/G sequences as potential effective anti-AIDS agents. Notes: 3027 PHOSPHOROTHIOATE OF OLIGODEOXYNUCLEO302 TIDE INHIBIT VIRAL REPLICATION OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV):INHIBITION OF DE NOVO INFECTION IN UNINFECTED CELLS AND REGULATION OF VIRAL EXPRESSION IN CHRONICALLY INFECTED CELLS. Makoto Matsukura*, Kazuo Shinozuka*, Gerald Zon**, *National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; Inc., CA. Objective. Nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate analogs exert potent anti-HIV effect against the de novo infection and cytopathic effect of HIV in uninfected target cells and those effects do not require a specific oraered sequence complementary to the genes of HIV(Matsukura et al., PNAS 84: 7706-7710,1987). In addition to the observation above, we now report that phosphorothioate analogs in an antisense sequence can inhibit viral expression in chronically HIV-infected cells. Results. A 28-mer phosphorothioate antisense analog against art/trs (a regulatory gene essential for efficient HIV expression) showed strong inhibitory effects (approximately 90% inhibition) against p24 gag protein production assessed by an antigen capture ELISA assay, but phosphorothioate analogs in a random sequence or non-sense configurations including homo-oligomer failed to inhibit viral expression under these conditions. An antisense analog of normal (un-modified) oligodeoxynucleotide against art/trs possessing standard phosphodiester linkages, as expected, failed to inhibit the viral expression. Conclusion. Phosphorothioate oligomers can have at least two different mechanisms of inhibiting the life cycle of HIV including suppresison of viral expression in chronically infected cells. These novel agents could be potential antiviral drugs against AIDS and AIDS-related diseases. PROTECTION OF MACROPHAGE FUNCTION AGAINST HU30J -HMAN CF Perno, & S Broder. Clinical Oncology Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. Objective. HIV can infect and harbor macrophages/monocytes and cause various functional abnormalities in such cells. We found that nuclease-resistant S-dC28 protected macrophages against HIV-induced dysfunction in vitro. Methods. Macrophages were prepared by T-cell depletion using sheep red blood cell rosetting, exposed to HIV/HTLVIIIB, and cultured with or without drugs for 5 days. Cells were then washed, irradiated, and co-cultured with indicator autologous tetanus-toxoid-specific clonal helper-inducer T-cells plus antigen for 3 days. Results. Macrophages exposed to HIV failed to serve as antigen-presenting cells for T-cell proliferation, while control macrophages not exposed to the virus generated a high magnitude of antigen-driven proliferation of normal T-cells. Heat-inactivation abrogated the capacity of HIV to cause this macrophage dysfunction. All DNA-chain terminating anti-HIV agents tested, 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine, and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine, failed to protect macrophages from this dysfunction. S-dC28, however, could protect the macrophages against HIV, and enabled them to serve as antigen-presenting cells with the same magnitude of antigen-driven T-cell proliferation as control macrophages. S-dC28 could also block the replication of HIV in macrophages. Furthermore, no syncytia were formed when CD4+ T-cells and HIV-l-harboring H9 (S-dC28) can AND PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES. Gerald Zon, Alex Andrus, Scott Davidson, Tim Geiser Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, California 94404 USA Objective. In view of the known antiviral properties of oligodeoxynucleoside methylphonates, and the recently demonstrated anti-HIV effects of phosphorothioate analogues of DNA, which are nuclease-resistant and of interest as potential anti-AIDS chemotherapeutic agents, we have investigated large scale syntheses of these compounds to enable requisite studies of their possible mechanism(S) of action (e.g., anti-message RNA), pharmacokinetics, in vivo activity, and side effects. Methods. DNA-phosphorothioate analogues were synthesized in a repetitive manner on solid support using a new and automated process involving activation of hydrogen-phosphonate monomers by 1-adamantanecarbonyl chloride and capping, by similar activation, with isopropylphosphite. Sulfurization of the intenucleoside hydrogenphosphonate linkages is done in a single, final step following chain assembly. Results. One gram of a DNA-phosphorothioate 28'mer has been synthesized and purified for pharmacokinetic and pre-clinical evaluation of anti-HIV III activity. Conclusion. The developed methods represent a 104 - 106 scaleup relative to conventional biological amounts of synthetic DNA and are amenable to scale-up to multiple hundreds of grams. 3030 SUCCESSFUL ELIMINATION OF PERSISTENT RETROVIRUS INFECTION BY BONE Department, Colorado State University, Ft Collins, CO *Cancer Biology Department, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston. OBJECTIVE: To determine if bone marrow transplantation (BMT) could be used to eliminate retrovirus from cats with persistent feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection. METHODS: Two studies were performed. First, 12 FeLV-infected, specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats received allogeneic marrow from sibling donors. Seven of the infected cats received hyperimmune serum during hematologic engraftment (74mg globulin/Kg IP every 4 days for 6 weeks). The remaining 5 cats received control serum. In the second study, 7 FeLV-infected SPF cats received allogeneic marrow from donors who had immunized with formalin inactivated FeLV--4 cats received hyperimmune serum plus whole blood from their immune donors and 3 cats received only whole blood from their immune donors. All 19 allogeneic BMTs were performed following five 2 Gy fractions of total body irradiation (TBI) delivered over 3 days by a 6MeV linear accelerator. RESULTS: All 12 FeLV-infected cats in the first study remained FeLVinfected following BMT. A noteworthy finding was all 12 cats (regardless of immune serum treatment) had significantly less plasma-borne FeLV following TBI. Four of 7 cats receiving marrow from immune donors were virus negative by day 8 post-BMT. Two of the four died of secondary infections prior to engraftment. One cat developed a latent infection of the donor marrow which recrudesced at 6 weeks post BMT (during treatment of GVHD). The final cat was determined to be retrovirus-free at 9 weeks post BMT. CONCLUSION: Marrow ablation significantly decreases retrovirus burden in FeLV-infected cats. Adoptive transfer of immunity by BMT and whole blood transfusions from an immune donor might be an effective therapy for persistent retrovirus infections. Notes: 3031 DUAL BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF APURINIC ACID ON HUMAN LYMPHOCYTES: INIDUCTIONI OF INTERFERON-GAMMA AND PROTECTION FROM HUMANIMMUNODEFICIENCY Universitat, Duesbergweg 6, 6500 Mainz, West Germany; and ~ National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; USA. The chemically modified DNA, apurinic acid (APA), is cytotoxic for human lymphocytes at concentrations above 100 pg/ml. At low concentrations (0.05 - 1 pg/ml) APA acts as an inducer of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in lymphocytes in vitro; the maximal titer of 50 units/ml was reached at 0.2 pg/ml. When added to the cells in combination with PHA, APA displays a significant synergistic induction ability; the maximal titer of 940 units/ml was measured with 10 pg/ml of APA and 6.25 pg/ml of PHA. APA was also determined to be an effective inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) replication in H9 cells. At a concentration of 10 pg/ml, APA causes a 49 % inhibition of virus growth, while 20 pg/nl of APA are required to inhibit expression of HIV-1 p17 and p24 gag proteins by 60 %. The mechanism of anti-FHIV-1 activity of APA is likely on the level of viral reverse transcriptase. This enzyme is inhibited by APA in a noncompetitive way with a Ki of 0.39 pM, while the cellular DNA polymerases are 140 to 300-fold less sensitive to APA. These results suggest a potential therapeutic usefulness of APA in the treatment of patients with acquired immunodefiency syndrome. 3032 ENHANCEMENT OF AFFERENT AND EFFERENT RESPONSES TO (CARRISYN). J H Helderman and D. Womble. *U of Texas, Southwestern Med Ctr, Dallas, TX USA Objective. To ascertain the effect of the agent Acemannan (Ace) on alloresponses, a drug with clinical efficacy against viral infections including AIDS. Methods. It is unclear by what mechanism Ace functions as an immune enhancer. To test the hypothesis that enhanced alloresponses can in part explain the salutory effect of Ace, MLC were established with physiologically relevant doses of the drug (2.6x10-7-2.6x10 9M). To test the role of the agent as a stimulator of monocytes (M) to explain the MLC results, the drug was preincubated with M followed by M-T cell co-culture and antigen stimulation. To test the immune relevance of the MLC, the impact of the drug on cytotoxic T cell function was determined. Results. Ace enhanced MLC alloresponse by as much as 60% over basal. Controls-Ace not increase tdR uptake nonspecially or syngeneic response. Preincubation of M by Ace increased T cell lectin response by an equal amount. Ace increased the generation of Tc by 130% (p<0.02) while also increasing the capacity of Tc once generated to lyse targets by 38% (p<0.001). Conclusion. The clinically efficacious anti-AIDS drug Ace enhances lymphocyte response to alloantigens in a dose-dependent, specific manner. This enhancement in part is explained by stimulation of monocyte responses during T cell-monocyte interaction. The important effector consequence of this response is an increase in the generation of cytotoxic T cells in response to alloantigen. The anti-AIDS effect of Ace may flow from such immuno stimulation. 227 [Page 228](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/226) 3033 Anti-HIV and Immune Enhancement Activity of Pontani*, Daisy Sun, and Prem Sarin' Jersey State Department of Health, Trenton, New Jersey, 'Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, and *Waksman Institute of Microbiology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey. Liposomal drug preparations have been shown to effectively facilitate the cellular uptake and reduce the eytotoxicity of a number of drugs. Recently, we have examined the anti-HIV effect of a liposomal preparation of amphotericin B. In assays measuring cell viability, reverse transcriptase activity and virus expression in cultures of H9 cells infected with HIV, the level of drug inhibiting 50% of virus activity (ED50) was between I and 2.5pg/ml. Viability studies to measure toxicity using murine leukocytes showed no toxic effects when the cells were incubated in the presence of 50pg/ml of liposomal amphotericin B. To measure immune function cultures of sheep red blood cell (SRBC) primed murine spleen cells were incubated in the presence of additional SRBC. Liposomal amphotericin B showed increased antibody induction in these cultures when compared to the parent drugs. These results show the feasibility of using a liposomal preparation of amphotericin B which has reduced cytotoxicity but maintains its anti-HIV activity, for the treatment of patients with AIDS.

Albeck**,, B.Sredni** *Central virology laboratory, Sheba Medical Center,**Depts of Life Sciences and Chemistry, Bar Ilan University, Israel AS-101 (ammonium trichloro [dioxyethylene-0,0'-] tellurate is a new synthetic compound with immunomodulating properties and minimal toxicity. It was recently reported that AS-101 induced the expression of IL-2 receptors and the production of IL-2 and colony stimulating factors (CS) in vivo and in vitro. It enhanced the ratio of OKT4 to OKT8-positive cells in cultured mononuclear cells from AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) patients (1). The effect of AS-101 on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) was studied in HUT 78 and PHA-stimulated cord blood lymphocytes infected with HIV. The antiviral activity of the drug was assayed by determinations of the reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in supernatants from infected cells. In chronically HIV infected HUT 78, RT activity was inhibited 62% after 7 days in culture with 5 pg/ml of AS-101. In stimulated cord blood lymphocytes, there was 81% inhibition after 14 days in culture at the same concentration. These results indicate that in addition to its immunomodulatory activity, AS-101 also has antiviral activity.

Tamari,F. Shalit, M. Albeck. Depts. of Life Sciences and Chemistry, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel. AS-101 (ammonium trichloro [dioxyethylene-0,0'-] tellurate) is a new synthetic compound with immunomodulating properties and minimal toxicity. The effects of AS-101 on the activation and function of immunocompetent cells were assessed. We found that AS-101 induces human lymphocytes to proliferate and to produce IL-2 in vitro; it also enhances the production of IL-2, colony-stimulating factor, gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor by mouse spleen cells. Splenocytes of BALB/c mice injected with AS-101 increased their production of IL-2 and CSF in vitro in the presence of mitogen. After incubation with AS-101, mononuclear cells from normal donors became responsive to recombinant IL-2 and bound monoclonal antibody to IL-2 receptors. Splenocytes of mice treated in vivo with AS-101 expressed high levels of IL-2 receptor. AS-101 administered systemically to mice mediated antitumor effects which could be attributed to its immunomodulatory properties. AS-101 also enhanced the ratio of OKT4 to OKT8-positive cells in cultured mononuclear cells from AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) patients. Current phase 1 clinical trials with AIDS and cancer patients show that there is enhancement of immunological parameters; this compares well with animal models. 3038 TOLERANCE AND CLINICAL RESPONSE TO AS-101, A NEW IMMUNOMODULATOR, IN AIDS PATIENTS. G.M. Ruiz-Palacios*, S. de AlarconSegovia-, J. Cruz*, F. and B. Sredni**, *National. Inst. Nutrition, Mexico and **Bar-Ilan University, Israel. Objective. To evaluate tolerance and clinical response to the novel immunomodulator AS-101, an organic tellurate compound, in patients with AIDS. Methods. A pilot trial of escalating IV doses of the drug (from 0.25 to 2 mg/m2) was conducted in 5 patients to evaluate toxicity. In addition, an open trial of 3 dose regimens (2,3 or 5 mg/m2) was carried out in 36 male AIDS patients for 12 weeks, with a subsequent maintenance dose of 3 mg/m2 in all groups, to evaluate the effect of treatment on frequency and severity of opportunistic infections. Results. No side effects were seen with all doses, except for a garlic body odor. The survival for all treated patients at 16 wks was 96%; at 32 wks, 81%; and at 61 wks, 51%. In contrast, the survival reported for all' AIDS patients seen at the Institute from 1983 through 1987 was 59%, 40% and 15%, respectively. The attack rate of opportunistic infections per patient-month for those receiving 2 mg, 3 mg or 5 mg was 0.49, 0.50 and 0.23, respectively. Duration of infection was 12.6, 10.7 and 4.4 days per patient-month, respectively. Attack rate during maintenance dose was 0.25 per patient-month. Conclusions. In this study, AS-101 was safe and well tolerated, without relevant side effects, suggesting that it can modify the clinical outcome of AIDS in doses greater than 3 mg/m2. Further studies of greater doses and combination therapy with antivirals are needed. Notes: 3039 A NEW IMMUNOMODULATING COMPOUND (AS 101) IN THE TREATMENT OF AIDS 3.P. Laporte*, 3. Frottier*, * St Antoine Cooperative Group on AIDS 75012 Paris, France ** Centre de Recherches du Service de Sante des Armees Clamart, France *** Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Can, Israel Objective. To assess the clinical and biological effects of AS 101, a compound inducing in vitro and in vivo the production of IL2 and CSF (Nature 1987, 330: 173-176), on patients with AIDS. Methods. AS 101 has to be infused at the dose of 5 mg/m2 three times a week in adults who could no received AZT, during 3 months. 12 patients (10 men, 2 women) with a median age of 30 (24-61) were treated. 10 patients were in a very severe condition, 2 have undergone toxic side effects with AZT. Results. In 8/12 patients the effects can be evaluated (2 patients died during the first week of treatment, 2 others have a too short follow up). A general clinical improvement was noted in 5/8 patients. 2 cutaneous kaposi sarcomas were improved after the first month. Splenomegaly and lymph nodes involvement disappeared in 1 case. However a relapse of pulmonary pneumocystosis occured in 2 cases after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Biological improvement was observed in 5/8 cases: elevation of CD4 cells (x 2 to 10 times) and of CD4/CD8 cells ratio. In 4 cases simultaneous clinical and biological improvement occured. Severe thrombocytopenia (<50 x 10 /1) disappeared in 2 have.to be.confirmed. 3040 IMMUNE OF Susanna Cunningham-Rundles,* L. Hammershaimb** W.

We report here on effects during a Phase I trial of 25 patients with AIDS receiving single escalating dose from 1 to 50 mg/kg. Median pre drug natural killer, NK activity against K562 tumor target was 16% (range 5.6-51.8%) in contrast to control (N=90) median of 32.5% (range 15.3-78.0%). IFN in vitro did not augment patient response median 19.5%) in contrast to controls (median 48.0%) After CL246, 60%, 10 of 25 patients showed increased NK activity and in 9, this exceeded 100% over baseline; 4 patients regained response to IFN in vitro. To look for IFN induction by CL246 during the study serum IFN a,a andy were analyzed by RIA. IFNywas not foun.If only those patients without IFN at baseline were considered, 33% of cases showed elevateda2 and 25% showed elevateda, most by day 21.Some patients who did not show induction were found to have a serum IFN inhibitor in competition experiments. Lymphocyte subsets and function were also modulated. The data support the hypothesis that CL246 is an immune modulator and interferon inducer in man and may have efficacy in AIDS. 229 [Page 230](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/228) 3041 DOSE RESPONSE STUDY OF DIETHYLDITHIOCARBAMATE (DTC) IN (PTS) WITH ARC/AIDS.

To determine effects of the immunomodulator DTC, on symptoms and immune function in ARC and AIDS. Methods. After stratification for ARC and AIDS, < vs. > 200 CD4+ cells, pts were randomized to or not to receive DTC for 16 weeks followed by a crossover. Pts received 200mg/m2 I.V. weeks, then 800mg/I.V. twice weekly x4 weeks. Results. 14 pts were allocated to receive DTC, 11 pts were controls. Pts with CD4+ cells >200/mm3 had stabilization of CD4+ cell count, less symptoms and regression of lymphadenopathy while on DTC compared to controls. Pts with < 200 CD4+ cells/mm3 all progressed (2 of 7 DTC treated pts died within 16 weeks vs. 4 of 6 controls).

To describe the results of a trial of disulfiram in AIDS/ARC patients of the community physicians participating in the CRI. Methods. The promising results of the clinical trials in France with diethyldithiocarbamate (Imuthiol, Merieux) as an immunomodulating agent led to a decision by many physicians in NYC to treat AIDS/ARC patients with disulfiram, since diethyldithiocarbamate is its major stable metabolite. The CRI recommended a standard protocol and collected data from participating physicians for evaluation. Patients were generally treated with disulfiram 750 mg po Ix/week or 500 mg twice weekly. Results. The pooled data shows a considerable rise in T helper cells and reduction in clinical symptoms. Twenty percent of the patients had abdominal cramps and/or diarrhea, on the days of disulfiram intake, sometimes leading to discontinuation of the medication. Conclusion. Disulfiram may be a promising immunomodulating treatment. Our results suggest that large scale controlled clinical trials with asymptomatic seropositive, ARC and AIDS patients are warranted to test this hypothesis which is based on preliminary findings in an open study. NOTE: The CRI, while collecting data from community physicians who are prescribing disulfiram, does not itself endorse such use.

Clinical studies by our group with MEK in ARC patients have shown reduction or elimination of constitutional symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, and diarrhea. In one year treatment time with MEK, none of the ARC patients have converted to AIDS. While on MEK treatment all have gained body weight. In addition, behavioral improvements included \"antidepressant\" effects with mood elevation. In our clinical studies we have seen increases of 50 to 100% over baseline in the number of cytotoxic T cells with MEK treatment, as measured the markers, CD19. addition, MEK treatment also increased other T cell subsets, natural killer cell activity, as well as mitogen-induced blastogenesis and interleukin-ll production.

Joseph Wybran*, NP Plotnikoff** *Erasme Hospital, Free University of Brussels, ** College of Pharmacology, University of Illinois, Chicago. Objective. Clinical and immunological evaluation of Met Enk therapy. Methods. Fifteen patients (2 PGL, 4 ARC, 1 interstitial pneumonia, 1 tetraplegia, 1 polyneuropathy, 6 AIDS) were treated intravenously with Met Enk from 3 months to 24 months (AIDS with KS). They were followed immunologically and clinically. Results. Out of 9 non AIDS, 7 showed clinical improvement (weight gain, decreased fatigability), one fully recovered from her tetraplegia and one ARC patient is in complete clinical and immunological remission for 23 months (11 kg gain weight, node disappearance, normal T4 numbers and mitogen response). One progressed to AIDS. One died from a non HIV related cause. In the 8 survivors, significant increase in T4 numbers was seen after one month (from 243/mm3 to 350/mm3) and the PHA response became normal after 4 months (from 198,000 cpm to 404,000 cpm) and remained normal. Out of 6 AIDS patients, 4 increased the T4 numbers. Clinically, none of the AIDS patients have shown any opportunistic infection (up to 24 months) and Kaposi lesions appeared to regress. Conclusions. In an open trial, patients receiving Met Enk showed immunological improvement (mainly normalization of the mitogen response in non AIDS) and clinical response (absence of opportunistic infections in AIDS, complete remission in one ARC patient, gain weight, decreased fatigability). 230 [Page 231](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/229) 3045 AUTOBLOOD UV-RADIATION Vladimir llyin, I.Neumyvakin, 7.Mansurova, I.Kondratyev Kirghiz Institute of Rehabilitation & Health Resort Science, Frunze, U.S.S.R. Objective. une of the approaches to HIV infection treatment is immune stimulants. Methods. The immune shifts following seven sessions of autoblood UV-radiation in patients with secondary immune deficiency (chronic genital infection, oronchial asthma, viral hepatitis) were studied. Results. The apparent immunostimulating effect manifesting as the increase of T-total, T-active-, T-autorosetteforming- and B-lymphocytes against the decrease of O-ceils was noted.The T-lymphocyte functional activity was enhanced. Also, the T,(helper) and T (suppressor) counts tended to increase and T y/ Ty ratio returned to normal range. All these shifts were accompanied by signs of clinical improvement. Conclusion. The favouraole immune stimulating effect of autoblood UV-radiation in secondary immune deficiency allows to suggest and expect a similar effect in the initial stages of HIV infection and in seropositive cases. The specific design of the aevice, for UV-radiation developed by the presenting authors promotes and adds to this effect. 3046 AMPLIGEN THERAPY IN ARC/PRE-ARC: IMMUNE/ VIROLOGICAL EFFECTS Chicago, 7DuPont, Wilm., DE Objective. To Ampligen (mismatched dsRNA) as an antiviral/immune modulator in HIV-infected individuals. Method. 39 ARC/pre ARC patients (pts) were treated with 100-200 mg Ampligen (mismatched dsRNA) twice weekly by IV infusion for 3-16 months (mos) (mean = 8.4). Results. 76% of pts had improvement of delayed hypersensitivity (DHR) within 2-12 wks. Mean p24 pre-treatment to 674 after 4-12 mos. Decreases (p<.002) were seen in the ability to co-culture HIV (OD490) after 2-4 mos at 200 mg/dose. An increase in HIV co-culture levels followed a 3-4 mos reduction in dose to 100 mg twice weekly (p<.001). Reinstitution of the 200 mg dose again reduced the ability to co-culture HIV (p<.005). Mean T4 cells increased 4.3% after 4 mos (30 pts), 8.0% after 8 mos (10 pts), and 17% after 12 mos (6 pts). After initiation of Ampligen pts reported improvement in diarrhea (6/8 p =.05), night sweats (12/12, p<.001), decreases lymphadenopathy (11/15, p<.05). Only two pts (mean baseline T4 = 82/ul) advanced to AIDS while receiving continuous Ampligen therapy; another ARC pt off Ampligen for two mos developed KS. Conclusion. Clinical improvement, return of DHR, stabilization of T4 counts, reductions in HIV load, and the absence of toxicity, suggest mismatched dsRNA is a candidate for enlarged clinical trials. Notes: 3047 CORRECTING DEFICIENCIES IN dsRNA PATHWAYS: AN INTEGRATIVE CONCEPT IN AIDS PREVENTION William A. Carter*, R. Suhadolnik**, K. Kariko**, N. D. Gillespie* *Hahnemann University, **Temple University, Philadelphia Objective. To evaluate roles of dsRNA-mediated pathways in cellular immunity and host antiviral state (2-5A/RNase L pathway) as a function of HIV-related disease progression. Methods. In HIV infected patients, various biological processes were studied including 2-5A synthetase, bioactive 2-5A oligomers, RNase L and cell-mediated immune functions (Carter et al. The Lancet June 6, 1987, pp. 1286-1291, and Carter et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA in press, 1988). Results. Levels of 2-5A synthetase (50 -200 nmole ATP incorporated/mg protein) were highly elevated in patients with AIDS and high endogenous concentrations (up to 35nM) of 2-5A oligomers were observed in individuals with LAS, ARC, and AIDS. Despite consistent elevations in precursor molecules within dsRNA-mediated pathways, inactive RNase L (a terminal pathway 2-5Adependent mediator) was frequently found. Mixing experiments indicated the presence of an RNase L inhibitor which prevents activity of bioavailable 2-5A molecules which otherwise would have led to a broad-spectrum antiviral state. Therapy with exogenous mismatched dsRNA (200 mg twice weekly) causes normalization of pathway components including RNase L activity, reduction in HIV-burden and improvement in both cell-mediated immune function and clinical symptons. Conclusion. Mismatched dsRNA may represent a specialized regulator for maintaining functions essential for normal antiviral processes. The absence of such regulation occurs in patients infected with HIV and may result in various lesions in host defense that can lead to death of the host if uncorrected. 3048 A PHASE 3 CONTROLLED TRIAL OF IMREG~-1 IN AIDS/ ARC PATIENTS. AA Gottlieb, and Trial Investigators, Imreg, Inc., New Orleans, LA & Cambridge, MA, USA. Objective. To determine the effectiveness of IMREG~-1, in arresting the clinical progression of AIDS/ARC, a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial was conducted in 8 centers, for 150 ARC and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) patients, in a 2:1 drug/placebo allocation. IMREGO-1, an im-unoregulatory biologic isolated from normal human leukocytes contains two peptides, Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly, which are immunologically active, (and identical to the N-terminal sequences of the enkephalins). IMREGO-1 enhances in vitro production of IL-2, y-interferon, MIF/LIF in response to antigen or mitogen, and accelerates and amplifies delayed hypersensitivity (DH) in normal subjects. In several studies in AIDS/ARC patients, to determine whether weakened cell mediated immunity could be restored compared to historical controls, IMREG~-1 returned DH in over 50% of previously anergic patients and increased production of IL-2. Patients gained weight and the rate of decline of CD4+ cells was slowed. No toxicity was seen. Methods. Eligibility criteria included 100-400 T4+ cells/ pl, anergy and constitutional symptoms or slowly progressing KS, with no other AIDS sequelae. Treatment lasted 6 months. End points are rapid progression in existing KS, (RP KS) or onset of AIDS. Results. Patients included, 20 with KS and 10 females. Baseline mean age by center ranged from 31.6~1.3 (S.E.M.) to 39.4~1.4 yrs; 404~45. At 80% of study completion, 74 patients completed; 19 were dropped, lost or withdrew; 21 reached endpoints of opportunistic infections (12), RP KS (4), dementia, lymphoma and wasting syndrome; 36 continue on study. Conclusion. A placebo controlled trial can be completed in AIDS/ARC patients; results will be presented. 231 [Page 232](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/230) 3049 - - TIC OF II ATORY PEPTIDES PRESENT IN IMREG-1, A LFULKOCYTE-DERIVED )H4UNOSUPPORTIVE DRUG UNDER EVALUATION FOR TREAINENT OF AIDS/ARC SKSinba and AA Gottlieb Imreg, Inc., New Orleans, LA USA Qbjectlyg.

Extracts of human leukocytes were obtained by repeated freezing-thawing and hypotonic lysis. The IMREG-1 fraction was obtained by a two-step HPLC procedure using a Waters C-18 reverse-phase analytical colunri. Additional HPLC procedures were erployed for analysis of IMREG-1. The peak fractions obtained were assayed by: (a) ability to accelerate and intensify delayed hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions to recall antigens, (b) mrodulation in yitfx IL-2 and garrmainterferon using a Zorbax C-18 reverse phase resin resulted in several peaks absorbing at 210 nm. Two fractions, designated ZB-3 and ZB-4 respectively, produced accelerated and arrplified DTH reactions upon intradermal injection with recall antigen. Gas phase amino acid microsequencing procedures, as well as liquid secondary ion mass spectrcrretry showed that ZB-4 is a dipeptide Tyr-Gly, and ZB-3 is a tripeptide Tyr-Glly. Conclusion. We report here the isolation of two naturally occurring ixmunacrodulatory peptides which are present in IMREG-1, an imrunosumportive biologic which enhances cell madiated inrunity. These peptides are identical to the amino terminal residues of the enkephalins, and have not been previously shown to have effects on the imrune system. Other small peptides are present in IMREG-1. These may be required for the action of IMREG-1 in ite.. 3050 LYSIS OF HIV-1 INFECTED CELLS BY PBL FOCUSED WITH MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY HETEROCONJUGATES CONTAINING AN HIy-1 NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY Joyce M Zarling, P. K. Shriver, J. **McClure, L. Grosmaire, J. Ledbetter Oncogen, Genetic Systems, Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. Objective. To determine if antibody heteroconjugates, containing a monoclonal antibody to HIV-1 cross-linked to' monoclonal antibodies to lymphocyte cell surface antigens, can focus peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to kill HIV-infected cells. Methods. Antibody heteroconjugates were produced by crosslinking monoclonal 110.4 (which is directed against gp 120 and neutralizes infectivity of HIV-1) with monoclonal G19-4 (directed against CD3) or monoclonal Fc2.2 (directed against the CD16 Fcy receptor). PBL were tested for their ability to kill HIV-1 infected cells in the presence of the heteroconjugates. Results. Lysis of HIV-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, is mediated by PBL in the presence of either heteroconjugate 110.4 X G19-4 or 110.4 X Fc2.2 but not in the presence of mixtures of the single monoclonals. Preactivation of PBL with anti-CD3 or with interleukin-2 augments the ability of PBL to lyse HIV-infected cells in the presence of 110.4 X Fc2.2 heteroconjugates, respectively. of 110.4 X G19-4 and 110.4 X Fc2.2 is mediated by CD8+ T cells and by CD16+ PBL respectively. PBL from HIV-infected individuals are also active in lysing HIV-infected cells in the presence of the heteroconjugates. Conclusion. Antibody heteroconjugates, which target PBL to lyse HIV-infected cells, may be of prophylactic or therapeutic value for health care workers accidently infected with HIV or babies born of HIV-infected mothers. Notes: 3051 INRF-1 A LOW MOLZECULAR *Imreg, Inc. and **Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, USA ObijggiYe. IMNEG-l, an irnctrnodulator derived fram normal human leukocyte dialysates, has previously been shown to reconstitute or augrent various T cell functions in AIDS/ARC patients, including the restoration of delayed type hypersensitivity responses, enhancernent of IL-2 and gamnrainterferon production, enhancenent of PHA and PWMI-induced proliferative responses, and to reduce the rate of destruction of CD4+ cells in HIV infected patients. In view of the imanoenhancing effects of IMREG-1, we sought to determine whether INREG-1 affected the replication of HIV. frthods. Lyrsphocytes fran normal healthy donors were infected with exogenous HIV and cultured for 9 days in vita (~ tetanus toxoid) in the presence or absence of irmrunododulator. Lyrsphocytes fran AIDS/ARC patients not undergoing treatrrent of any kind were cultured as above, with and without IMREG-1. Additionally, sera were collected fran AIDS/ARC patients undergoing treatment with INREG-1 over periods extending fran 1 to 3 years. HIV core protein (p24) was quantitated in the cultures and sera using an HIV Antigen EIA (Abbott Laboratories). BBsulta. No enhancernent of HIV expression was seen in sanples taken at various tine points fran cultures exposed to INREG-1.

I35 IREG-1 WITH AH Montgcuery*, EN Benes* *Imreg, Inc. and **Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, USA Qbjective In response to antigen, CD4+ cells normally express receptors for IL-2. This is diminished in patients with HIV induced irmrunodeficiency. We sought to determine the effect of IMREG-1, a leukocyte derived irmuncmodulator, on IL-2 receptor expression on subpopulations fran normal individuals and patients with receptors PBNC (peripheral blood nononuclear cells) fran healthy individuals and patients with ARC. A double staining procedure was errployed using phycoerythrin-conjugated anti CD4, anti in conjunction with FITC conjugated anti IL-2 receptor. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytaretry test (FACS). Fesults. IMREG-1 enhanced and/or codified the expression of antigen induced IL-2 receptors in CD4+ cell populations fran healthy donors, as well as patients with ARC. Biweekly treatment of patients with ARC (who expressed few IL-2 receptors in response to antigen before treatrent) resulted in enhanced capacity of the patients' CD4+ cells to express IL-2 receptors upon antigenic challenge. Conclusion. IMREG-1 results in enhanced antigen-induced IL-2 receptor expression on a)4+ cells. This is an a siould manifestation of responsiveness to specific antigen and should be useful in nonitoring a pain'5 irrruine functional status. 232 [Page 233](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/231) 3053 ISOPRINOSINER IN HIV INFECTION: THE MULTINATIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS PROGRAM D. Stephen Robins, M.D.* and Gordon L. Schooley, Ph.D.* *Newport Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. Newport Beach, CA, USA Objective. Following several small-scale, short term studies of Isoprinosine (ISO) in patients with pre-AIDS conditions, a largescale multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial program has been instituted to definitively study long term clinical safety and efficacy of the drug in pre-AIDS HIV infection. Methods. Approximately 2300 HIV seropositive patients are planned for enrollment. In Denmark, Sweden, U.K., and U.S.A., patients are dosed with ISO (3 or 4 g/day) or placebo during the 6 month double-blind phase; all patients are subsequently allowed a minimum of 6 months open-label ISO. In the Australian study, patients receive ISO 3 g/day or placebo for 2 years. Approximately half the patients are immuno-competent while the other half are immunocompromised to varying degrees. Clinical and immunological parameters are being measured to allow correlations between these data. Results. As of January 1988, approximately 1500 patients were enrolled. An overview and comparison of study designs, demographics and longitudinal data management will be presented. 3054 HIV P24 CORE ANTIGEN REACTIVITY IN HIV Newport Beach, CA, USA., **DuPont Biotechnology Systems, Boston, MA, U.S.A. Objective. To determine the relationship of p24 antigenemia to clinical and immunological markers of HIV disease progression in patients treated with Isoprinosine (ISO). Methods. A double-blind placebo-controlled study of ISO is currently being conducted in 550 HIV seropositive immunocompromised homosexual males at 17 centers in the U.S. Patients have T-Helper cell counts of 200 -400/cmm at the time of study enrollment. Patients on active drug receive 4 grams of ISO daily for six months during the double-blind phase of the study, and all patients are then permitted to receive an additional six months of ISO in the open-label phase. HIV p24 core antigen specimens (frozen sera) are collected on day 0, and months 3, 6, 9 and 12 and are assayed using the new DuPont p24 core antigen ELISA test for HIV p24 antigen, at the DuPont labs in Wilmington, DE. Results. The data on HIV p24 antigen will be presented and correlated with clinical and other immunological markers of HIV disease progression. Notes: 3055 CLINICAL AND IMMUNOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ONEYEAR TREATMENT WITH IMUTHIOL IN HIV+ INFECTED HOMOSEXUALS J.M. Lang and Group Imuthiol (dithiocarb), a thymomimetic sulfur compound, has been shown to significantly increase T4 cell numbers and improve clinical condition in HIV-infected patients without AIDS in short-term clinical trials. To extend these data we now present the results after one yeartreatment with Imuthiol (10 mg/kg, once a week, orally) in 26 seropositive homosexuals, in comparison to an untreated group of 18 HIV-positive patients of the same risk group tested in parallel. In the treated group (CDC category II = 1 pt, III = 19 pts, IV = 4 pts, IVC2 = 2 pts) no progression towards AIDS (all patients) or ARC (from category II or III) was observed. General symptoms in IVA patients vanished. The mean T4 cell number increased from 385/cu mm to 483/cu mm (p<.O.01) and a significant (p = 0.05) increase in delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity (DCH) was noted. In the control cohort (CDC category II = 3 pts, III = 13 pts, IVC2 = 2 pts), however, 1 patient progressed to AIDS, 3 category III patients developped IVA symptoms and 1 category III patient fell within IVC2 category. The mean T4 cell number decreased from 431/cu mm to 326/cu mm (p~ 0.05) and DCH tended to diminish. These one-year data confirm that Imuthiol may be safely administered to HIV-infected patients with clinical and immunological benefits and further suggest that Imuthiol is capable of delaying progression of the disease. 3056 LOW DOSE NALTREXONE IN THE TREATMENT OF AIDS Bernard Bihari*, F Drury*, V Ragone*, G Ottomanelli*, J McCoy**, E Klein*** *State University of New York/Health Science Center at Brooklyn, New York, **ImmuQuest Laboratories, Rockville, Maryland, ***St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, New York Objective. To evaluate the results of treatment of AIDS with low doses (1.75 mg qhs) of naltrexone, an opiate antagonist. Methods. Thirty-eight patients with AIDS were treated in a 3 month placebo controlled trial of naltrexone, after which the placebo patients were switched to naltrexone. Laboratory tests included T cell subsets, serum alpha interferon (o, IFN) levels, HIV antigen capture assays and a number of immune functions, including NK activity and lymphoproliferative responses to a T cell mitogen (PHA), a fungal antigen (candida) and two viral antigens (CMV and VCA). Results. The data showed fewer major O.I.s in the treatment group during the placebo controlled period (0/19 vs 5/19) and a significant drop in the markedly elevated levels ofo IFN in the treatment group. While on naltrexoiLe 25 of the 38 patients eventually showed a drop in o.IFN levels from means of 160 to 11.75 i.u., the drop taking from 4 to 12 months to occur. The 13 patients whoseOc IFN did not drop all died within 9 months. At 12 months only 4 of the 25 whose c.IFN dropped had died and only 6 had died at 18 months (p40.01). The latter group also had significantly fewer major O.I.s (p(0.01). Correlations of interferon changes and survival with the immunological and virological data will be presented. Conclusion. Low dose naltrexone may be a useful immunomodulating agent in AIDS related illnesses. 233 [Page 234](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/232) 3057 REACTIVITY OF A MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY WITH DIVERSE HIV-1 ISOLATES M.S.C. Fung, B.V. Lipps, of Medicine, 4Department of Virology and Epidemiology, Baylor College of Medicine, 2The Infectious Disease Unit Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston and Cedars - Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, U.S.A. A neutralizing monoclonal antibody BAT123 developed to HTLV-IIIB, has been examined for reactivity with diverse HIV-1 isolates from patients with AIDS or ARC and asymptomatic infected individuals from Houston, Boston, and Los Angeles. Mononuclear leukocytes from the peripheral blood of these field samples were cocultured with phytoheamagglutininactivated lymphocytes from normal donors, and the production of virus was measured by reverse transcriptase and viral antigen immunochemical assays. Among the 56 blood samples studied, the virus could be detected in 38 samples in 10 to 14 days. When BAT123 at l1g/ml was present, the replication of HIV-1 was inhibited in all of the 38 samples, with approaching 100% inhibition in about half of them. These results indicate that BAT123 reacts broadly with field isolates from various geographical areas and suggest it may be used for therapeutical and preventive treatments. 3058 IMMUNOTHERAPY WITH A POLYANTIGENIC IMMUNOREGULATOR IN PATIENTS WITH HIV INFECTION JULIO I. COLON,* G. ENCARNACION, A.M. MARCHAND, * E. RIOS-OLIVARES, *** M.T. RODRIGUEZ-MALAVE AND M. ORTIZ-SANTINI *Department of Pathology and P.R. Cancer Center, U.P.R. **Emergency Room Medical Center ***Universidad Central del Caribe Objective. To study the effect of immunotherapy with a polyantigenic immunoregulator (PAI), on disease progression in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Methods. Patients included in this open study were classified according to the Walter Reed staging classification Twenty one patients were in stage WR-1; six in WR-2; ten in WR-3; two in WR-4; seven in WR-5 and five in WR-6. Patients received two subcutaneous injections of PAI per week for 12 weeks and one per week thereafter. The immune system and clinical response was monitored at different intervals. Results. Of three patients in stage WR-1 not treated in two t The T helper/suppressor ratio dropped below 0.8 and the other one progressed to stage WR-3. None of the treated patients in stages WR-1, WR-2 and WR-3 showed progressive disease or deterioration of the immune system. Only one patient in stage WR-5 and two in WR-6 died. Conclusion. The administration of PAI prevented the progressive course of patients in stages WRI, WR-2; and WR-3 for at least two years. A delay of progression and death was observed in patients entered in stages WR-5 and WR-6. This report confirmed previous finding of this group that PAI administered to ARC or AIDs patients lead to a sustainedaugmentation of PHA response, normalization of T helper suppressor ratio and dissapearance of clinical symptoms. Notes: 3059 ANTI-GP120 IMMUNOTOXIN Kumamoto, Japan. **Repligen Inc., Cambridge MA, ***NCI, Bethesda MD. Objective. The purpose of these studies was to develope an immunotoxin against HIV infected cells. Method. We have reported a monoclonal antibody (designated 0.5B) that bound to the surface of HTLVIIIB/LAV infected cells and reacted with an external envelope glycoprotein, gpl20. Type specific neutralization of both cell-free and cell-associated infection of HIV was observed in the presence of 0.56. The antibody binding site (0.5B epitope) was mapped to a 24 amino acid segment of gpl20. In order to determine whether an antibody to gpl20 can be used to produce immunotoxins against HIV infected cells, we have conjugated 0.5B antibody with ricin A chain (0.5B-RAC). Result. 0.5B-RAC killed HTLV-IIIB infected H9 cells but did not kill uninfected H9 cells. Because the reactivity of the antibody was type specific we attempted to detect HTLV-IIIB type specific infection. By detecting the competition in binding of 0.58 to a synthetic peptide that contained 0.51 epitope, type specific antibodies were detected in some HIV carriers. In addition, gpl20 bearing cells were detected by cytofluorography with 0.53 in fresh PBMC obtained from an ARC patient with p24 antigenemia. Conclusion. These result taken together may have important implication for possible use of anti-gpl20 immunotoxin as a therapeutic agent against AIDS. 3060 FAILURE OF HIV IMMUNE GLOBULIN TO PROTECT CHIMPANZEES AGAINST EXPERIMENTAL CHALLENGE WITH HIV Alfred M. Prince*, B. Horowitz*, J. Eichberg**, L. Baker*, *The Lindsley F. Kimball Research Institute of the New York Blood Center, New York **The Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, San Antonio ***Institut Pasteur, Paris ****The Central Laboratories of the Netherlands Red Cross, Amsterdam Intravenous immune globulin was prepared from plasma of HIV seropositive donors selected to be among those having the top 12.5% of virus neutralizing antibody titers. The preparation, which we have termed HIVIG, -neutralized 100 TCID50 of HIV at a dilution of 1:2000. During preparation HIVIG was subjected to virus inactivation and removal procedures which resulted in an estimated 25.3 Loglo reduction in HIV infectivity. Two chimpanzees inoculated intravenously with 1cc/kilo of HIVIG, and two with 10cc/kilo, were challenged with 100 TCID50 (32 CID50) of the same strain of HIV (HTLV III) used in in vitro neutralization assays. All animals became infected, with incubation periods prior to the development of viremia which did not differ significantly from that seen in a control animal which received a normal anti-HIV free immunoglobulin. These findings may have implications for understanding the failure of experimental vaccines to protect against HIV challenge in chimpanzee experiments. 234 [Page 235](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/233) 3061 THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES AGAINST HIV BASED ON THE CD4 MOLECULE: MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY THERAPY, Western Foundation, San Antonio, Texas, 3HHMI Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeon, N.Y.C., USA, 41.C.R., SW3 6JB. Recent studies in man and primates suggest that whereas most immunological responses are present in the early stages of HIV infection, the presence of neutralising antibodies are not only poor but tend to be isolate specific (although group specifities have been identified), and that the presence of, albeit relatively weak, neutralising antibodies may be associated with improved clinical outcome. The one conserved feature is the use of the CD4 antigen as the receptor for all known isolates of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV. In particular some anti-CD4 antibodies such as Leu 3a are efficient blockers of infection and conserved amongst all primate species. Moreover, soluble CD4 is an efficient neutralizer of all HIV-1 isolates (data to be presented). We are therefore using Leu 3a as an infusion in ARC patients and available results on this trial will be presented. Furthermore, anti-idiotype antibodies against Leu 3a raised in mice are capable of broad neutralising activity. Studies in rats, rabbits and primates including marmosets, chimpanzees and baboons are currently being performed to see if this phenomenon can be seen across species, and available data will be presented. 3062 PROTECTION OF MACAQUES AGAINST SIMIAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS INFECTION BY INACTIVATED WHOLE VIRUS, M. Daniel, P. Sehgal, N. King, M. Wyand, D. Schmidt, R. Desrosiers New England Regional Primate Research Center, Harvard Medical School, Southborough, MA 01772. USA Objective. To test the efficacy of inactivated whole virus (SIVmac) as a vaccine; to investigate approaches to AIDS vaccine development. Methods. Purified SIVmac was inactivated and multiple intramuscular inoculations were given with the threonyl muramyl dipeptide adjuvant formulation of Syntex. Results. In our first study, macaques that received an inactivated whole virus vaccine became infected when challenged intravenously with undiluted, cell-free, live SIVmac. In our second study a larger amount of inactivated SIV, prepared differently, elicited good immune response including neutralizing antibodies; when challenged with diluted, cell-free, live SIVmac these macaques appeared to be protected from infection. Unvaccinated controls challenged with the same dose became infected and one of two has died to date. Infection was assessed by virus recovery, antibody response and in situ hybridization. Conclusion. The ability of inactivated SIV to protect macaques against live virus challenge and the similarity of SIV and HIV suggest that vaccine protection of humans against cell-free HIV infection is at least theoretically possible. The SIV-macaque system should be used to study in greater detail this and other vaccine approaches. Notes: 3063 INTRAVENOUS TREATMENT WITH GAMMAGLOBULINS IN AIDS OR LAS PATIENTS.

IVIG modula te the Ig idiotype network and/or interact with cellular Fc receptors, Methods: 10 AIDS patients and 10 LAS patients were enrolled. At the moment of the trial all the subjects were off-therapy and in a remission phase of the disease. IVIG were administered as bolus (6gr). All the patients were evaluated before therapy and after 10 days for clinical status, appearance of opportunistic infections, immunology, hematology and side effects. Results:in LAS patients IVIG induced an amelioration of the CD4+ cells / CD8+ cells ratio (from 0.7 to 1). No significant variations of the other parameters examined were observed. In AIDS patients the CD4/CD8 ratio remained unchanged. A decrease in the number of lymphocytes/ mm3 and of the platelets was observed. Conclusions: IVIG are often prescribed in addition to antimicrobials for the treatment of infections in immunocompromised patients. Depending from the stage of the disease (full-blown AIDS or LAS) IVIG may prove to be an effective mean also to ameliorate the immunocompetence 3064 PASSIVE I'MlONElTRALPIZATION OF HIV p24 ANTIGENEMIA IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED AIDS BY INFUSION OF HUMAN PLASMA GG Jackson JT Perkins** DA Paul*** D Mack*** *The London Hospital Medical College, London, **University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois, and ***Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Illinois Obiective. An investigation was made to determine if passive infusion of selected plasma could diminish HIV antigenemia and reestablish anti p24 antibodies and HIV neutralizing capacity in the plasma of patients with advanced AIDS. Methods. Infusions of 55 - 500 ml of plasma from one of two donors with anti p24 titers of 1024 and 4674 and neutralizing capacity >8000, were given to six patients. Results. HIV antigenemia cleared immediately, serum neutralizing activity, anti p24 serum antibody and freedom from HIV antigenemia persisted for a few days to eleven weeks after the infusion. The volume of plasma given determined the duration of the effect with a 15 day half-life. Neither immediate clinical benefit nor adversity was recognized. Conclusion. Passive immunotherapy in AIDS is feasible. Its potential for altering the course of HIV infection as adjunct to the host response, treatment or prevention is unknown. 235 [Page 236](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/234) 3065 CLINICAL/IMMUNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF AIDS AND ARC PATIENTS UNDER SELECTIVE STIMULATION OF B SYSTEM OF IMMUNITY Rem V. Petrov, Rakhim M.Khaitov, Alla M. Borisova, Boris V. Pinegin Institute of Immunology, USSR Ministry of Public Health, Moscow, USSR Patients in whom AIDS and ARC had been diagnosed on the basis of clinical, immunological (OKT4 number,OKT4/OKT8 ratio, reaction to T-cell mitogens etc.) and serological (ELISA and Western blot) assays received treatment with myelopeptides (peptides secreted by bone marrow cells) which selectively stimulate B system of immunity thus promotinq Ig and specific antibody production. As the result of such treatment the content of OKT4 cells increased from 200+ 11.2 to 330+13.3 per 1 1, the OKT4/ OKT8 ratio increased to 0.6-0.8. The most pronounced increase of OKTA number and OKT4/OKT8 ratio was revealed in patients having initially low values of these parameters. The clinical picture of all the patients receiving myelopeptides displayed decrease of fatiquability and weakness, elimination of subfebrile fever, decrease of size of lymph nodes. 306 POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION OF AUTOLOGOUS CD8+ and San Francisco**, CA. Objective. CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8T) can have anti-HIV effector functions. Therefore, the isolation, expansion and re-infusion of purified CD8T could be used to treat AIDS patients. We have developed efficient methods to achieve these goals. Methods. CD8T from HIV- and HIV+ donors were captured onto polystyrene T-150 flasks to which anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody was covalently attached. CD8T were quantitatively recovered and expanded using a cocktail of recombinant cytokines. Results. 14 days of ex vivo expansion (initial, 107 cells) produced a 100-fold increase in the CD8T. These cells expressed potent levels of lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (30-60% lysis, E:TlO:1). The cells showed minimal natural killer activity (5-10% lysis at 10:1) and virtually no inappropriate autoimmune activity against autologous lymphocytes (< 5% lysis at 10:1). The expanded CD8T (mean purity, 97%) were 99% positive for both the ao chains of the T cell receptor and the panT cell antigen (CD3). No detectable levels of the p24 HIV antigen were found in the CD8T cultures. Expanded CD8T also demonstrated anti-viral activity against EBVinfected autologous B cells. Conclusion. These results demonstrate the feasibility of extracorporeal amplification of CD8+ T cells to a therapeutically useful dose that could be used to control the disease caused by HIV-infection. Notes: 3067 FUSIDIC ACID INHIBITS Degr6 The Wilhelmsens institute of Bacteriology, Rikshospitalet, University of Oslo, Norway *Research fellow of the Norwegian Cancer Society It has been reported that treatment of HIV-infected T-cell lines with Na-fusidate reduces virus multiplication, and a possible effect on AIDS patients has also been described. Since macrophage (MO) infection is an important early event during in vivo infection we have studied the effect of Na-fusidate on development of HIVinfection in cultured Mo. Mo were separated from peripheral blood and cultured on glass coverslips or in plastic wells. They were inoculated with HIV after six days of cultivation in vitro. The cultures were incubated for four weeks and the presence of HIV was determined twice weekly by antigen test (Organon) and reverse transcrip-- tase activity in the cell free supernatants and by immunofluorescence in the cells. Parallel cultures were treated with 10, 25, 50 or 100 ug/ ml of Na-fusidate starting simultaneously with virus inoculation. The highest concentrations of the drug, especially 100 ug/ml were toxic, while no toxicity was observed with the lowest concentrations, determined by cell count and morphology. HIV production was strongly suppressed in all Mo cultures and in lymphocytes treated with the drug, even in concentrations not toxic to the cells. The treatment index, however, seems to be rather narrow. 3068 A RAPID AND SENSITIVE ASSAY TO ASSESS EFFICACY OF ANTIRETROVIRALS IN MACROPHAGES (MO) S. Crowe, N. McManus, J. Kirihara, J. Mills, M. McGrath University of California, San Francisco; San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, California 94110 Objective. As mO are a major target and reservoir of HIV in vivo, assessment of efficacy of potential antivirals in this cell population is essential. Our objective: To design a rapid and reliable assay for this purpose. Methods. M1 are cultured in suspension in Teflon jars with varying concentration of antiviral in media. 96 hours after infection, mo are lysed with aprotinin in phosphate lysing buffer, and cell lysates are analyzed by Abbott HTLVIII antigen EIA (C/L p24). Comparisons are made with m* culture supernatants (S/N p24) analyzed by the Abbott assay, and immunocytofluorographic analysis of m0 of p24 antigen expression (% p24). Results. S/N p24 and % p24 are insensitive methods for detecting inhibition of HIV replication of m0. However, cell lysate analysis by Abbott assay is lysate analysis by Abbott HTLVIII antigen EIA is a rapid and sensitive assay for assessing efficacy of antiretrovirals in m0, and provides different information than analysis of supernatant virus antigen. 236 [Page 237](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/235) 3069 FREE AND IN LIPOSOMES Wahl** *National Cancer Institute, **National Institute of Dental Research, Bethesda, MD, U.S.A. Objective. To assess the effect of dideoxycytidine triphosphate (ddCTP) and its metabolites on HIV-1 replication in elutriated human monocytes. The drug was presented either in free form or encapsulated in liposomes. Methods. Elutriated monocytes were infected with a monocyte/macrophage-derived strain of HIV-1 (Ba-L), allowed to settle in plastic tissue culture wells, and then treated on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Samples of supernatant were collected for p24 antigen determination on days 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21. Extruded liposomes, double-labeled with 3H drug and 14C lipid, were formed from egg phosphatidylcholine: phosphatidylserine: cholesterol. Results. The liposomes released < 10% of their ddCTP within 4 days in the presence of cells and culture medium at 370C. ddC itself was released from liposomes much more rapidly. Free ddCTP at 62.5 nM inhibited expression >90%. p24 effect. Microscopy using fluorescent liposomes indicated endocytic uptake. HPLC studies showed progressive dephosphorylation of the free ddCTP but not of liposomal ddCTP. Conclusion. ddCTP, free or in liposomes, inhibits HIV-1 replication in human monocytes at nanomolar concentrations. In the case of free ddCTP, activity is probably mediated by metabolites. 3070 EFFECTS OF SHO-SAIKO-TOH (TJ9) ON T-CELL COLONY FORMATION IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES OF PATIFNT WITH HIV INFECTION Juzo Matsuda, N Saito, T Abe Department of Medicne, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo Objective. We studied the effect of the supernatant of monocytes cultured with TJ9, one of the representative Kampo Medicine (Japanese Herbal Medicine) and becoming recognized as one of the BRM, on the lymphocyte function of hemophiliacs and homosexuals with HIV infection. The T cell colony formation test which reflects the function of helper T lymphocytes, is employed as an index. Methods. Lymphocyte and monocytes were obtained from peripheral blood by centrifugal method. These monocytes were in cubated with TJ9 and its 7 components for 48 hrs, to obtain the cultured sup.(CM). And monocyte depleted lymphocyte and CM was mixed with PHA and methylcellulose in a dish and incubated. After 5 days, the number of colonies was counted under microscope. Concentration of IL-1 in CM was also measured.Results and conclusion. T cell colony formation was enhanced by the addition of CM in various degrees in the patients. Especially stronger effects were found with CM prepared from monocyte cultured with TJ9. This CM was revealed to contain higher a concentration of IL-1. Being based on these findings the open trial of TJ9 to patients with HIV infection has just started in Japan in an effort to prevent them from developing ARC and AIDS. Notes: 3071 HIV NEUTRALIZATION STUDIES USING ANTI-CORE AND ANTI-ENVELOPE PROTEIN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES. P. Yoshihara, A. Goldstein, R. Bestwick Epitope, Inc., Beaverton, OR 97006 USA OBJECTIVE: The ability to inhibit viral replication in permissive cells in vitro is an important parameter in the development of possible therapeutic agents and vaccines for HIV. Our objective was to screen for anti-HIV protein monoclonal antibodies (MAb) which are inhibitory for virus growth in vitro. METHODS: Purified MAb (20 ug/ml) was added to flasks containing the permissive cell line CEM which was subsequently infected with a cell-free virus-positive supernatant. Following a 24 hour period the cells were washed and additional MAb (10 ug/ml) was added to the cells at day 3,5,7,10 and 14 at which time supernatant was collected and assayed for core (p24) protein. RESULTS: Virus growth was significantly inhibited at the day 5,7,10 and 14 time points post-infection using MAbs reactive with some core and envelope protein. More specifically, the anti-core MAb which were inhibitory showed anti-pl8 specificity; in contrast anti-p24 MAb were not found to be inhibitory for viral growth. Mapping results indicate that the two anti-p24 MAb react with epitopes coded by nucleotides carboxy-terminal to position 997. In addition, and anti-gp120,160 reactive with p18 core protein were found to be highly inhibitory for HIV growth in vitro. In contrast, anti-p24 MAb reactive with the carboxy-terminal position of p24 and anti-gp41 MAb were not found to be inhibitory for HIV. Ongoing mapping studies will attempt to define the epitopes on p18 core and gpl20 envelope protein which elicit neutralizing antibody. Med Ctr Torrance CA USA Objective. To evaluate TP-1 in symptomatic HIV-infected men with lymphadenopathy, oral candidiasis or >10% loss of body weight. Methods. Randomized subjects were injected IM either with TP-1 (Serono), 1 mg/kg, or a placebo, daily for 2 weeks and twice weekly for 6 months or until diagnosis of CDC-defined AIDS. Results. There were 27 evaluable subjects, 12 received TP-1. The drug was well tolerated. All surviving patients have been followed for over 1 year.

As used in this study, TP-1 was ineffective in preventing the onset of AIDS. No effect of the drug on CD4 cell numbers was found. An apparently favorable effect of TP-1 on the appearance of p24 antigen in the serum is provocative and merits further study. 237 [Page 238](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/236) 3073 Thymostimulin 16 M.

Previous studies (Clin.Immunol.Immunopathol., in press) showed that thymostimulin treatment was able to improve some clinical and laboratory parameters in patients with AIDS-related complex, with respect to control subjects. On that basis, a multicenter, randomized trial was started in Italy to confirm early results.

BIGA, M. BAKER, J. WALLACH, M.P. MULLEN, M. DAVIDSON, CABRINI MEDICAL CENTER, N.Y. USA.,OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of TP-1 ii decreasing the number of ARC patients who progress to AIDS. METHODS: A prospective randamized placebo-controlled trial in 4 centers, of which data is presented for one center with the largest patient enrollment of 39 (19 TP-1, 20 placebo). Patients were randomized to receive daily i.m. injections of either placebo or 1.0mg/kg of TP-1, for 14 days; they continued at same dose twice weekly for a 6 month period, and this was extended for one or 2 more 26 week periods at patient request. The endpoint was CDC defined AIDS and various parameters, including the T4 subsets were evaluated. RESULTS: 37 male, 2 female; 36 homosexual and 3 IVDAwere studied for a median of 35 weeks (range 7-60), conversion to AIDS was 5 with TP-1 and 2 with placebo during 1st 26 weeks and 4 with TP-1 and 2 with placebo in ensuing extension period; 5 TP-1 patients died vs. 0 with placebo. The average T4 baseline cell count was 389 for placebo vs. 262 for TP-1(P= 0.20), and the placebo patients maintained higher counts. In the multicenter study, with 44 patients in each group, 21% of each group died and 32% and 39% converted to AIDS, respectively. CONCLUSION: TP-1 was not found to be effective in preventing ARC patients from progressing to AIDS in our subset. The multicenter trial found no significant difference. The lower T4 in our TP-1 group substantiates our skewed patient population of ahealthier placebo group. Notes: 3075 Hematology France. HIV INFECTION IN BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT (BMT) RECIPIENTS D. Maraninchi, J.A. Gastaut, P. Mannoni, Stoppa, Y. Carcassonne. Clinic. Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, Before August 1985, 11 recipients of Allogeneic (Allo = 7) or Autologous (Au = 4) BMT received HIV infected blood products or marrow pre, per or post BMT. In these immunocompromised host HIV transfusion was responsible for a high rate of AIDS when compared to other populations of transfusion HIV infected pts, like haemophiliacs: 9 pts developped AIDS 4.5 months (2-9) after BMT and 6 pts died from severe opportunistic infections only 2 pts are alive with isolated thrombocytopenia. These results show that the severe immunodeficiency who is secondary to BMT increases the risk of AIDS after HIV infection; furthermore, in the absence of active antiretroviral therapy, BMT should be avoided in HIV infected pts. 3076 IMMUNOMODULATION WITH METHISOPRINOL IN HIV-IN+ FECTED SUBJECTS.

Meth induces T cell maturation enhances T cell function and is not mitogenic. Meth inhibits 1500 asymptomatic HIV+ subjects are planned to participate. The study was started in Sept 87. patients were randomized in two groups (control group and Meth group) and evaluated every three months for clinical status, disease progression, appearance of opportunistic infections, immunology, hematology and tolerance. Meth was administered by the oral route at a dosage of 4gr/day for 3 months, then for 5 days every 10 days for 6 months; this cycle is expected to be repeated up to three years. Results: The results of a 3 months administration will be presented and compared with untreated patients. Conclusions: Meth would appear as a safe candidate for immune restoration in asymptomatic HIV+ subjects. It can be administered per os and except for a transient increase of blood hyperuricemia is virtually non toxic. Address to: V.

Jackson, *Deborah Paul, *D. Mack. *Abbott Laboratories, N. Chicago, IL, and Univ. of Illinois, Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, IL USA Objective. 70% of AIDS patients are p24 antigenemic, and a reciprocal relationship between serum Ag core and anti-core titers appears to exist. Passive immunotherapy (infusion of plasma with high titered anti-HIV/anticore) was done to study the interrelationship of serum HIV Ag, anti-core and IC formation, and to determine if clinical status would improve. Methods. 6 AIDS patients were infused with plasma having high anti-HIV core Ab titers. Subsequently patients were tested for HIV Ag and Ab's to core and envelope, HIV IC, and non-specific Clq-binding IC. Results. Prior to infusion, 4 of 6 AIDS patients were HIV Ag + with no detectable core Ab. Immediately after infusion Ag was no longer detectable and all patients had detectable or increased core Ab titers though no increase in envelope Ab titers was seen. Non-specific IC were seen in all patients following infusion with peak IC levels 3d-4wk post-infusion. Specific HIV IC's were seen l-6wk post-infusion. HIV Ab in IC was always detected just prior to reappearance of serum Ag and coincided with samples which were reactive for HIV Ag but non-confirming. Conclusion. The balance between serum HIV Ag and anticore was seen by giving high-titered anti-HIV plasma to 6 patients. There was a transient loss of HIV Ag and an increase in anti-core as a result of the infusion. IC were also transiently seen but the patients eventually returned to HIV Ag +, presumably due to continued viral expression. 3078 THE CD4 ANTIGEN IS COMPLEXED IN DETERGENT LYSATES TO ODept. of Pathology and $Medicine, harvard Medical School; *Dept of Internal Medicine, Texas Tech University. The CD4 (T4) antigen is cell surface glycoprotein which is expressed predominately on the surface of helper T cells, and has been implicated in the regulation of T cell activation and in the associative recognition of class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In addition, the CD4 antigen appears to serve as a receptor for the HIV (AIDS) virus. An important question has been whether the CD4 receptor is linked to an intracellular mediator which could regulate the activation of the CD4+ subset. In this paper, we provide preliminary evidence that the CD4 receptor is complexed in detergent lysates to a protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) of 55-60kd which is expressed specifically in T cells. The PTK is the human analogue of the murine pp56LSTRA (pp561ck), and has significant homology with c-src, c-yes and with other members of the src family. The identification of the PTK associated with CD4 receptor was made by use of an antiserum to a synthetic peptide that was deduced from the DNA sequence of PTK. Two dimensional non-equilibrium gel electrophoresis (NEPHGE/SDS-PAGE) revealed the kinase to focus as a heterogenous collection of spots in the pH range of 4.0 to 5.0. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation revealed the phosphorylation of two additional polypeptides at 40kd and 80kd, in addition to the autophosphorylation of the PTK at 50-60kd. The potential importance of the association between the CD4 receptor and the PTK of T cell is discussed in relation to T-cell activation and HIV-infectivity. Notes: 3079 HIV PENETRATION OF CD4 T CELLS OCCURS WITHOUT INTERNALIZATION OF CD4 MOLECULES. S.P. Cort, J.S. McDougal. Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To track HIV and CD4 as HIV penetrates CD4 T cells. Methods. Simultaneous detection of CD4 and HIV that is bound to CD4 on the cell surface of human CD4 T cells was performed and analyzed by flow cytometry as described (J. Immunol. 135:3151, 1985). To detect intracellular CD4 and HIV, cytocentrifuged cell preparations were acid-alcohol stained with preselected fluorescein-conjugated anti-HIV and anti-CD4 reagents. Appropriate specificity controls and experiments to confirm the intracellular (rather than cell-surface) localization of fluorescence staining were performed. Results. Incubation of human CD4 T cells with saturating amounts of HIV at OOC results in specific binding of HIV to CD4. After increasing the temperature to 370C, we detected virus penetration by loss of cell surface HIV and appearance of cytoplasmic HIV. Penetration of HIV was not associated with a change in cell surface CD4 or appearance of increased cytoplasmic CD4. As a control to ensure that we could detect cytoplasmic CD4 had it been internalized, we induced CD4 modulation and internalization with the phorbol ester TPA and were readily able to detect intracellular CD4. Conclusion. HIV binds to CD4 on the cell surface and penetrates the cell, but the internalization process does not appear to involve internalization of CD4. 3080 PROPERTIES OF DOMAINS OF CD4 EXPRESSED YEAST Sadhna Joshi*, Ray Wong*, Al Grolla*, Mississauga, Canada, **Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, ***Karolinska Institute, Stockholm. Objective To investigate the location of the sites of interaction of gpl20 and MHCII with CD4, and to provide material for protein structure determination via 2DNMR spectroscopy or crystallography. Methods The extracellular domain (amino acids 1-367) was expressed in yeast using a yeast expression/vector based on the melibiase promoter and signal sequence. Smaller fragments of the extracellular domain have been produced by the introduction of stop codons using in vitro mutagenesis, and in several cases fusion proteins with a cellulase domain have been generated. Yeast secretion can easily provide sufficient protein for biophysics in relatively pure form. Results The interactions with gpl20 and anti-CD4 antibodies of the whole extracellular domain, smaller fragments of this, and fusion proteins (CD4-cellulase) produced in the yeast system are currently under investigation. 239 [Page 240](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/238) 3081 PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, AND ENZYMIC TREATMENT OF Klein Laboratories, Swedeland, PA; ***Columbia University, New York, NY, USA Objective. To determine the effect of physical, chemical, and enzymic treatments of soluble CD4 on the capacity of CD4 to react with HIV and inhibit HIV binding to CD4 cells. Methods. Purified, soluble CD4, prepared as described (Nature 331:82, 1988), was treated as indicated below by methods we have previously used to assess the effects of these treatments on HIV. Treated CD4 was then tested over a range of concentrations for inhibition of HIV binding to CD4 cells. The binding assay, calculations of inhibition, and controls for adequacy of treatment were as described (J. Immunol. 137:2937, 1986). Results. Reduction (50 mM dithiothreitol) and alkylation (55 mM iodoacetamide) in 8 M urea destroyed the inhibitory activity of CD4, whereas reduction and alkylation in phosphate buffered saline or alkylation in urea did not. Trypsin (50 Vg/ml) digestion destroyed activity. Digestion with glycolytic enzymes, endoglycosidase H (100 mU/ml), endoglycosidase F (2 U/ml), neuraminidase (1 U/ml) did not affect activity. CD4 inhibitory activity was destroyed by heating at 1000C for 10 min and 650C for 30 min but remained intact at 56~C for 30 min. Conclusion. The tertiary protein structure conferred by intrachain disulfide bond(s) that are relatively resistant (inaccessible) to reduction in physiologic buffer is essential for CD4 integrity with respect to interaction with HIV, whereas carbohydrate moieties appear nonessential. 3082 EXPRESSION OF SECRETED DERIVATIVES OF THE RECEPTOR T4:MAPPING THE HIV BINDING SITE.

We recently described a secreted, soluble form of the receptor T4 and demonstrated that this protein, sT4, is an efficient inhibitor of HIV infection in vitro sT4 was overexpressed in mammalian cells throubh DHFR coamolification, isolated to > 95% purity and shown to retain the surface epitopes of native, membrane-bound T4. This soluble T4 protein bound to HIV op 120 and blocked virus bindina to T4+ cells, resultino in a strikino inhibition of HIV infectivity and of syncytium formation by infected cells. We have now exploited the recoanition of virus by sT4 to map the bindino site of HIV on T4. Deletion mutants of sT4 were expressed and assayed binding to pD120 and inhibition ov virus bindina. In this manner, the bindina site was reqionally localized within sT4. To map this site in detail, many point and insertional mutants have been incorporated into sT4 separately or in combination. The analysis of these mutants will be presented. Notes: 3083 A SYNTHETIC (G.J. Cianciolo and R.

RJ Gurley*, K Ikeuchi*, K Anderson**, T Gregory***, D Groopman*. * New England Deaconess Hospital, ** DanaFarber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, and *** Genentech, Inc., So. San Francisco, CA, U.S.A. Objective. To study peripheral blood lymphocyte function in purified CD4+ cells and monocyte-depleted mixed lymphocytes in response to antigen, mitogens, recombinant gpl20 and soluble CD4. Methods. HIV infected subjects or controls were boosted with tetanus toxoid. CD4+ cells were obtained to 95-99% purity by Ficoll centrifugation followed by E-rosetting and anti-CD8 panning. Antigen presenting cells were obtained from the E- population. Mixed lymphocyte populations were obtained following adherence of monocytes. CD4+ lymphocytes or mixed lymphocyte cultures were exposed to combinations of tetanus toxoid, antigen presenting cells, recombinant CD4 protein or gpl20. Cells were also incubated with combinations of3TPA, PHA or Ca ionophore. Proliferation was measured by HTd incorporation. Results. Baseline proliferation was decreased in resting lymphocytes from asymptomatic HIV+ (n=5), and ARC patients (n=3). The stimulation indices for antigen or mitogens did not differ in asymptomatic patients from normal controls. ARC patients, however, did have decreased responses. Gpl20 was not an antigenic stimulus for HIV+ lymphocytes. Recombinant soluble CD4 or gp120 did not interfere with lymphocyte response to tetanus toxoid. Conclusion. There is a functional defect in antigen, but not mitogen, response with advancing HIV infection independent of CD4+ cell number not reproduced by gpl20. Lymphocyte function is sustained in the presence of soluble CD4. 240 [Page 241](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/239) 3085 Pyle**, D Center*. *Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA. **National Cancer Research Institute - Frederick Cancer Research Center, Frederick, MD. Oblective. To determine if binding of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp120) to CD4+ cells stimulates biologic activities Immunoaffinlty chromatography of supernatant from HIV-1-Infected cells. Chemotaxis was measured in modified Boyden chambers. Surface expression of C04 and interleukln-2 receptor (IL2R) and Inositol triphosphate (IP3) levels counting fractions of myo[2-3H] inositollabelled cell lysates. (NWNATs) from healthy over buffer control. NWNATs Incubated with gp120 for 24 hours showed decreased expression of CD4 from 60% to 15% positive cells, and increased expression of IL2R from <10% to 26% positive cells. Intracellular IP3 rose from 108 cpm to 5,105 cpm 10 minute after stimulation with gp120. These responses to gp120 were Inhibited by immunoprecipitatlon with anti-gpl20 and/or pre-incubation with OKT4A and were not observed in cells incubated with OKT4A alone. Conclusion. Binding of gp120 to CD4 stimulates lymphocyte activation from Go to Gla phase of the cell cycle, Induces a motile response, causes decreased expression of CD4, and stimulates the IP3 messenger system. Thus, gpl20 has innate biologic activity potentially relevant to virus infection and normal functions of CD4. 3086 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY ACID METABOLITES AND INTERLEUKIN 1 Larry M. Wahl*,Marta L. Corcoran, Stephen W. Pyle* Larry 0. Arthur**, William L. Farrar* *National Institute of Dental Research, Bethesda, MD, **National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, U.S.A. Objective. To determine the effect of gpl20 on human monocyte (MO) arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites and interleukin 1 (IL 1). Methods. Human M0, purified by counterflow centrifugal elutriation, were cultured in the presence or absence of gpl20 and examined for: the binding of OKT4A and OKT4 monoclonal antibodies by cytofluorometric analysis, AA metabolites by HPLC and radioimmunoassay, and IL 1 by bioassay and mRNA. Results. The addition of purified gpl20 to Mo induced the production of metabolites from the cyclooxygenase (prostacyclin, thromboxane, prostaglandin C4 and B4) pathways of AA metabolism and IL 1. Detectable increases in these products occurred with 50 ng/ml of gpl20, with a peak response between 200-400 ng/ml. Unlike native gpl20, the recombinant, nonglycoslylated gpl20 fragments, PB1-RF and PBl-IIIB, were ineffective in the stimulation of Mo as was p24. Preexposure of Mo to gpl20 blocked binding of OKT4A, but not OKT4, antibodies. Conclusion. These findings demonstrate that gpl20 is directly involved in the transduction of a signal, possibly through the OKT4A epitope on the CD4 receptor, which affects Mo function and as result may influence immune regulation. Notes: 3087 PROLIFERATIVE RESPONSE AGAINST RECOMBINANT VACCINIA F.Ensoli*,A.Cafaro*,V.Fiorelli*,E.Scarselli*, G.P.D'Offizi*,Shiu-Lok *Department of University of Rome, Italy 00185 **Oncogen, 3005 First Av., Seattle USA Objective. In order to study anti-HIV cellular response we have tested the \"in vitro\" proliferative response of PBMC of seropositive patients against a viral envelope protein, gpl20, espressed by recombinant vaccinia virus. Methods. PBMC were cocultured for seven days at 370C in CO2 atmosphere with RPMI alone for spontaneous proliferation and with PWM for the control of general immunocompetence. For evaluating the proliferative response to vacci nia products we used parental non recombinant vaccinia as control. Patients were all seropositive for anti-HIV anti bodies and were classified according to the CDC criteria. Results. So far 26 patients were tested including some with ARC and AIDS. Preliminary results showed a percentage of reactivity comprising from 10% of asymptomatic seropositive to 15% of patients classified as LAS/ARC. Conclusion. This data indicate the presence of specific CMI in a percentage of seropositive individual. Studies are in progress to caracterize its role and significance in the progress of the disease. 3088 AN ASSAY SYSTEM FOR THE INHIBITION OF BINDING OF rGP-120 TO CD4+ CELLS BY SERA HUMAN **NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD ***Genentech, Inc. S. San Francisco, CA. Objective. The present study describes a novel assay system to measure a potentially relevant form of immunity to HIV infection, i.e. the blocking of HIV binding to CD4+ cells. Methods. T system measures the ability of sera to inhibit the binding of I-labeled recombinant gp-120 envelope protein to CD4+ cells. Results. Optimal conditions included a 2 hour incubation at 220C, 4 x 10\" CD4+ cells controls included seronegatives, seronegatives with connective tissue diseases, patients with HTLV-1 disease and patients infected with HIV-2. In studying over 100 sera, the assay was highly sensitive (98%) and specific (100%). The majority of HIV+ sera could inhibit binding at dilutions of 1:100 and 1:1000. No correlation was noted between dilution in this assay and clinical stage of HIV infection. There was no correlation between this assay and neutralizing activity (NA) nor between NA titer and clinical stage. Conclusion. As with neutralizing antibody and other demonstrable forms of immune response to HIV, it is unclear what role antibody blocking of HIV binding to CD4+ cells plays in protective immunity against HIV. However, it may ultimately prove to have some protective value and the assay may be of use in monitoring vaccine trials in that it is simple to perform, sensitive, specific and does not require the handling of live virus to demonstrate a potentially relevant phenomenon, namely the specific binding of virus to its target cells. A-16 241 [Page 242](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/240) 3089 H Chen, C Federle, G Riethmiller Institute for Immunology, University of Munich, Munich, F.R.G. Objective. The highly conserved CD4-interaction site on the HIV-envelope gpl20 appears to be a perfect target for protective antibodies. The induction of those antibodies by vaccination with gpl20 or gpl20 peptides is hampered by the complex structure of this binding site. Immunization with the idiotype of a monoclonal CD4-antibody mimicking the gpl20 anchorage site might obviate this problem. Methods. Antiidiotypic monoclonal antibodies (MAb's) were raised against a number of CD4 -MAb's that were shown to block HIV-infection of cells at low concentrations. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for anti-idiotypic reactivity, binding to HIV-antigens in Western blot analysis and for selective staining of infected cells in the APAAP-method as well as for in vitro inhibition of HIV-infection. Results. One MAb was found to selectively stain HIV-infected H9-cells and to recognize a 120 kd-molecule in the HIV-Western blot. This MAb was raised against the M-T310 MAb which binds to an epitope on the first domain of the CD4 molecule and crossblocks the Leu3a antibody. Conclusion. It is possible to induce monoclonal anti-CD4-idiotype antibodies recognizing an epitope on the HIV-gpl20. 3090 MAPPING OF THE HIV BINDING SITE ON THE CD4 PROTEIN Bradford A. Jameson*, Patricia P. Rao**, Stephen B.H. Kent* *California Institute of Technology, **ORTHO Pharmaceuticals Objective. To define the site of interaction on the CD4 protein responsible for binding to the gpl20 envelope protein of HIV. Methods. A panel of large synthetic peptides were used in a variety of solid and solution phase assays to map the epitopes of a family of anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies. Information on the spatial interactions of the antibodies was achieved through a series of competition binding assays. Finally, the specificity and interaction data was interpreted using the known structure of protein analogs of the CD4 protein and three-dimensional computer modeling. Results. A panel of and MT151 have been mapped to specific locations on the CD4 protein. From the information obtained from the mapping studies, in conjunction with monoclonal antibody cross-competitions, we were able to construct a threedimensional model of the virus binding site on the CD4 protein. Conclusions. A model of the HIV binding structure on the CD4 protein indicates that it should be possible to design effective structural analogs of this region, thus providing potential chemotherapeutic reagents in the fight against AIDS. Notes: 3091 MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF INHIBITION OF HIV-1 BINDING TO CD4 BY MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES TO Ospedale L Sacco (Milano, ITALY) Objective To test the possible implication of gpllO epitopes recognized by different monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in the interaction between gpllO and its CD4 receptor. Methods HIV or France)were preincubated with mAbs(110-1,110-3, recognizing the same peptide 308(thr)-328(Ile), prior to their addition to CD4+ cells. Specific binding was then determined by FACS analysis as compared with controls where mAbs were added to the preformed complexes between CD4+ cells and HIV-1 or gp 110. Results Significant inhibition of HIV binding was noted with 110-3, 110-4, 110-5 but not with 110-1. At the molecular level, the same antibodies decreased the affinity of the interaction between soluble CD4 and gpllO, although they could still label the latter molecule after it had been bound to CD4+ cells. Conclusion Mabs directed to epitopes which are topographically distinct from the binding site to CD4, can nevertheless neutralize HIV binding by steric hindrance. 3092 DETERMINANTS OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF THE 2Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of G6teborg, Guldhedsgatan 10 S-151 85 S6dertalje, Sweden. Objective. A peptide region situated between aa 370 and aa 480 may be involved in the CD4-binding ability of gpl20. The aim of this study is to identify structural determinants of the biologically active conformation of this region. Methods. Probes for antigenic determinants were polyclonal rabbit antibodies against relevant synthetic peptides and mouse monoclonal antibodies against continous and discontinous epitopes, situated in the region defined above. These reagents were tested against gp 120, produced in the presence of glycosylation inhbitors and variants of gpl20 obtained Targets for mutagenisis glycosylation sites and disulfide bridges. Results. Extensive glycosylation inhibition or structural modification of gp 120 resulted in changes in the antigenic reactivity of the region delimited by aa 370 and aa 480. These data suggest that glycosylation and disulfide bridges are of importance for the three-dimensional conformation of this region. Conclusion The obtained methodology will be useful to delineate molecular features determining the biological activity of the CD4-binding region. 242 [Page 243](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/241) Wiqzell H.Department of Immunology, Karolinska Institute, Sweden and Gay mens clinic, South Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. The tropism of HIV for cells is predominantly caused by the select binding of the envelope Gpl20 protein to the cellular protein CD4. Certain antibodies directed against either Gpl20 or CD4 can block this interaction. From this one may argue that some anti-Gpl20 antibodies may look like CD4, that is inhibit a certain monoclonal antibody against CD4 from binding to CD4. In the search for the natural occurrance of such antibodies against Gpl20 in HIV-sero-positive individuals we have found 3 containing IgG antibodies selectively blocking the binding of a particular anti-CD4 monoclonal, T4.2, from binding to CD4. Immunosorbant purified T4.2 reactive human antibodies could also be shown to react with Gpl20 as well, that is in fact display a dual capacity and in fact \"mimic\" parts of the CD4 molecule. We have now extended the search to include two additional anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, OKT4A and Leu3a. Amongst 83 HIV-seropositive sera we have come across 2 which selectively block OKT4A from binding to CD4 without interfering with T4.2 or Leu3a binding. No positive sera for inhibition of Leu3a binding has been found so far, although one goat antiserum against native Gpl20 displayed such a capacity. We have thus been able to define three ditterent although closely situated epitopes on CD4 which behave like being directly involved in Gpl20 binding to CD4. 3094 THE C-TERMINUS OF HIV gpl20 IS NECESSARY FOR ITS INTERACTION WITH CD4, BUT NOT WITH A NEUTRALIZING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY Peter S. Linsley, Jeffery A. Ledbetter, Elaine Kinney Thomas, Bruce M. Travis, Shiu-Lok Hu, Oncogen, Seattle, WA, USA Objective: To determine the regions of HIV gpl20 involved in its binding to CD4 receptor and the effects of anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies on this interaction. Methods: Recombinant vaccinia viruses were constructed that express either full length (v-ED6) or truncated (v-ED4) forms of gpl20 from LAV-1. The truncated form of gpl20 lacks 44 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. Both glycoproteins were purified from serum-free medium of vaccinia virus infected cells by lentil lectin affinity chromatography, followed in some cases by immunoaffinity chromatography. Binding of these glycoproteins to the CD4 receptor was detected directly with radiolabeled gpl20, or gpl20 cells specifically with half-maximal binding achieved at nanomolar concentrations. Radiolabeled vED4 bound to CD4-positive cells 10-20 than vED6. Binding of v-ED6 gpl20 to CD4 did not block binding of monoclonal antibody 110.4, which recognizes a neutralizing epitope located between amino acids 279 -472, or antibody 110.1, which recognizes an epitope within the C-terminal 24 amino acids of gpl20. Conclusion: The C-terminal region of gpl20, which is conserved in numerous isolates of HIV, is necessary for CD4 binding. The neutralization mediated by monoclonal antibody 110.4 may not directly involve blocking of gpl20 binding to CD4. Notes: 3095 LOCALIZATION OF THE HIV-1 gpl20 BINDING SITE WITHIN THE AMINO TERMINAL REGION OF CD4 USING IN VITRO MUTAGENESIS Edward A. Berger, Thomas R. Fuerst, Tamio Mizukami, and Bernard Moss Laboratory of Viral Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA Objective. To localize the binding site for the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein by analyzing soluble recombinant fragments and specific mutant forms of the CD4 molecule. Methods. Vaccinia virus-based mammalian expression systems were used to produce soluble truncated forms of CD4, as well as polypeptides altered by site-directed oligonucleotide mutagenesis. These molecules were tested for functional and immunological properties associated with the HIV-1 binding site. Results. A secreted 180 amino acid fragment representing approximately the amino-terminal half of the extracellular domain of CD4 formed a specific molecular complex with soluble gpl20 of HIV-1. Epitope analysis with a panel of anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies indicated that this CD4 fragment reacted only with those antibodies which are known to block the HIV-CD4 interaction. We have isolated a battery of mutants containing insertions and substitutions within specific domains of the amino terminal region of CD4 in order to more precisely delineate the gpl20 binding site. Conclusion. The HIV-1 gpl20 binding site is contained within the amino terminal region of the CD4 molecule. The results of our structure/function studies have important implications for the understanding of the HIV/CD4 interaction, as well as for the potential therapeutic use of soluble CD4 derivatives. 3096 95 KD AND 2b KD FRAGMENTS OF THE HIV ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN GP 120 BIND TO THE CD-4 RECEPTOR. Anders Nygren*, and**Chemistry I, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. Department of ***Surgery, Duke University Meoical Center, Durham, NC, U.S. Objective. To define the CD-4 Dinding region of GP 1u. Methods. 12b-I-labelled GP 12U derived from HIV(bH 1U) is cleaved to a limited extent with Glu-specific protease from Staphylococcus Aureus. The fragments were tested for CD-4-binding in a simple cellbinuing assay. After SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ano electro-blotting, radiosequence the aifferent fragments was performed. Results.The 95 KD fragment could be demonstratea to lack the N-terminal region of GP 10. The ab KD fragment was deduced to be generated as a small fragment from the C-terminal part of the larger fragment. Combinea the data suggest domainlike subdivisions in GP 1u, uefine at least two intervening segments sensitive to a protease, and show the presence of a functional region in the C-terminal part of the molecule that is apparently intact for receptor binding as a separate segment. 243 [Page 244](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/242) 3097 Production of a glycosvlated peptide binding region of HIV-gpl20.M Gidlund, Lowenadler, M Lake, Engberg, Pohl, L Hansson, A Nygren, K S Matsuda, E P Flodby and H Wigzell. Department of Immunology Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden and KabiGen AB, Stockholm, Sweden. We have produced a fusion protein between tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and an anticipated CD4 binding region from HIV-gp 120. The protein was produced by transfection ot mouse C-127 cells. The expression vector comprised of the entire BPV genome and mouse MT-1 promoter. Leader and signal peptide was derived from t-PA and the CD4 binding domain was cloned in upstream kringle 2 and the proteolytic portion of the t-PA molecule. RNA processing signals derived from SV40. The construct was transfected into C-127 cells. 50 clones were isolated and tested for production of fusion protein. 12 were found to produce at high yield a fibrinolytically active protein with the correct molecular weight for a hybrid molecule. Selective carbohydrate labelling showed that the inserted fragment was metabolically glycosylated. The hybrid molecule was also shown to bind CD4. Our data thus provide direct evidence for the localization of CD4 binding region of Gpl20 to a defined region in the carboxyterminal part of Gpl20. 3098 HIV BINDING TO T 4- LYMPHOCYTES OCCURS AT G 2 - PHASE OF CELL CYCLE J P ZIMMER*, H A LEHR*; R RAMSPERGER* * Bernhard Nocht Institut, Hamburg Objective. In studies of HIV adsorption to CD 4 positive lymphatic cells by indirect immunofluorescent marking, binding occured only in a limited number of cells. We investigated whether this effect was related to a cer - tain stadium of cell division. Methods. HIV adsorption to CD 4 + cells (K 37 line) was assessed by indirect immunofluores - cent staining. HIV binding, FITC-marked, cells were separated from non-virus binding cells by cell sorter. DNA - analysis was performed for total cells, HIV-binding and non binding cells. Results. Maximum virus adsorption and saturation was reached at a concentration of 8,000 ng of purified HIV and HIV binding to 20% of CD 4+ cells (n=5, SD +1.6%, p<O.O01 compared to CD 4 -lymphocytes). We observed normal repartition of G 1, S and G 2 phase in the total population of K 37 cells. G 1 and S were normal compared to controls for the non - HIV binding cells, whereas the G 2 phase was reduced to 25% of normal. Interestingly, 96% of HIV binding cells showed to be at the G 2 phase of cell cycle (n=5, SD +0.8%, p<O.O01). Conclusion. Considering de Laak's work on de - creased membrane fluidity in G 2 phase and mitosis and Shinitzky's work on the influence of membrane fluidity on receptor binding capa - city,the HIV adsorption in G 2 phase could be explained by decreased membrane fluidity. Notes: 3099 AFFINITY AND SPECIFICITY OF THE INTERACTION OF IODINATED gpl60 TO CD4 RECEPTOR Bahraoui*, B Clerget-Raslain** Institut Pasteur Paris, ** H6pital La Piti6-Salpftriere Paris, France. Objective. To obtain a sensitive and quantitative specific binding of 125Igpl60 to CD4+ cells. To estimate the affinity constant of the complex 125Igp160-CD4. Methods. Binding of iodinated vaccinia recombinant gpl60 (Transgene, France) to CD4+ cells. Inhibition the binding by anti-CD4 or anti-gpllO antibodies. Results. 12Igp160 (7.8 10O-M) binds with high affinity to CD4+ cells. This fixation was totally inhibited by native gpl60, at half effect concentration KO.5 = 20nM. In order to investigate at a molecular level the receptor site, monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to CD4 were tested for their ability inhibit 12 Igp160 binding. Leu3a, OKT4A, OKT4D, OKT4B, OKT4C and OKT4 showed only little or no effect on the binding. Polyclonal human IgG anti-HIV1 inhibited 100% of the binding of 125Igpl60 to CD4+ when used at 1 mo/ml. At the same concentration, these antibodies could not neutralize viral infectivity. Monoclonal antibodies (110 -4 Genetic Systems) preincubated with inactivated virus were able to totally inhibit fixation of the virus to CD4+ cells, but displaced only partly the 125Igp160 bindina. The latter result might be explained by a change in 25Igpl60 affinity, itself caused by conformation change of the native molecule induced by fixation of Mab 110-4. Conclusion. Soluble gpl60 made from a vaccinia recombinant binds to CD4 receptor with high affinity. This assay could be used to screen potential ligands endowed with the capacity of competing with the interaction of 15sIgp160 to its receptor.,j k ) INHIBITION OF LYMPHOCYTE PROLIFERATION BY HIV COAT PROTEIN GP120 AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH DISEASE PROGRESSION. M. Vaughn*, T. Chanh**, G. Dreesman**, E Hartle*, R. *Wilford USAF Medical Center, Lackland AFB, Texas, USA and **Southwest Research Foundation, San Antonio, Texas USA. Objective. The suppression of mitogen driven lymphocyte proliferation by HIV infected sera was evaluated as an index of disease activity. Methods. Sera from HIV infected individuals, stratified using several clinical and immunologic parameters, were examined for their ability to support the proliferative response of normal human lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation. Results. It was found that HIV infected sera contained a soluble factor capable of inhibiting the activation of lymphocytes by PHA, ConA, and PWM. This factor, which was quantified by serial dilution, inhibited the expression of IL-2 receptors and altered membrane function as assessed by mitogen capping studies. This factor was removed from HIV sera using a murine monoclonal antibody to viral coat protein GP120. Levels of suppressor factor were positively correlated with the clinical and laboratory criteria defining disease progression and longitudinal evaluation over one year revealed that greater than 95% of the study group increased immunosuppressive activity of their sera. Conclusion. Lymphocyte proliferation inhibition by GP120 appears to provide a reproducible index of disease progression in HIV infection. 244 [Page 245](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/243) 3101 LYMPHOCYTE PROLIFERATIVE RESPONSE TO A 23 MER SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE CORRESPONDING TO AN IMMUNOREACTIVE REGION OF THE HIV-1 TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN Suzy Sprecher-Goldberger', P A Vahlne'\" *Institut Pasteur du Brabant, Brussels, Belgium, \"*Dept of Clinical Virology, University of G6teborg, Sweden Objective. The ability of an immunoreactive 23 mer synthetic peptide to elicit a proliferative response of lymphocytes from HIV-1 seropositives was studied. Methods. Lymphocytes of four asymptomatic HIV-1 seropositive patients were incubated for six days in presence of either PHA, purified HIV-1 (metrizamide centrifuged HTLV-IIIB) or the synthetic peptide (DQQLLGIWGCSGKLICTTAVPWN) wherafter methyl-3H-thymidine was added. After four h the cells were precipitated and washed in TCA, dissolved in ethanol and assayed by liquid scintillation. Triplicate tests never deviated by more than 20% from the means. Results. Lymphocyte stimulation index seronegative seropositive patients control 1 2 10.41 The lymphocyte proliferative response to the HIV-1 gp41 peptide was of the same or higher magnitude as that to the purified whole virus antigen. 3102 TREATMENT OF FOUR AIDS PATIENTS WITH PEPTIDE T; A PILOT STUDY Anders Sbnnerborg*, *Central Microbiological Laboratory, Stockholm County Council, ** Department of Infectious Diseases Roslagstull Hospital and ***Department of Psychiatry, St. Goran's Hospital, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden Objective. To perform a pilot study on patients with AIDS of the effect of Peptide T, which is an octapeptide (D-Ala-Ser-Thr-Thr-Thr-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2), that has sequence homology with the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120. Methods. Four AIDS patients were given 1-2 mg peptide T as intravenous infusion twice daily for four weeks. The effect of the drug was monitored by clinical and immunological parameters, psychiatric ratings, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), HIV isolation and determination of HIV p24 antigen and P2-microglobulin levels. Results.No marked effects on clinical parameters or T cell subsets were observed. HIV was isolated at the same frequency before and after treatment. Three findings, however, suggested that Peptide T may have an effect on the course of the infection; first, p24 antigen serum levels decreased significantly in two patients; second, P -microglobulin CSF levels decreased in two patients; third,all patients displayed significant changes of pathological T1 and T2 relaxation times measured by MRI. Conclusion. Peptide T was given to AIDS patients without causing serious side effects. Some findings suggested that the peptide may have effects on HIV infection, in particular on the brain involvement associated with the disease. Notes: 3103 PHASE I TESTING OF PEPTIDE T IN AIDS PATIENTS ANn CONTROLS T. Peter Rridge*, P. Heseltine**, **IISC, Los Angeles, CA Objective. To test the safety and toxicity in 12 AIDS patients, of Peptide T, an octapeptide homologous to VIP, shown to block the binding of radiolaheled gpl2? in brain tissue and to inhibit the cytotoxic effects of gpl?O on murine hippocampal culture. Methods. Peptide T was given intravenously every 8 hours for 30 days escalating from 0.033 mg/kg to 0.27 mg/kg followed by 3 days of acute intranasal testing to AIDS patients not taking immunomodulatory drugs or AZT. All patients, classified as minimally or moderately cognitively impaired, were tested at baseline, after 8 days at a given dose, and for two months follow-up. Results. No toxicity as measured by routine chemistries, brain imaging studies, a repeatable neuropsychologic battery, and measures of immunocompetence was observed. In contrast to previous studies, decreases in T2 time on MRI while taking Peptide T were not seen, but increased T2 signal did correlate with localized neuropsychologic impairment. Remission of myoclonus and hyperreflexia as well as improved memory function were seen while taking Peptide T. Conclusion. Peptide T is a non-toxic and may be associated with variations in CNS function in AIDS patients being tested with the drug. 3104 CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH PEPTIDE-T IN SIX HIV INFECTED PATIENTS. B Alexius**, S Britton*, Jorup-R6nstr6m**, St GSran Hospital,****Dept Virology Central Microbiology Lab.,Stockholm, Sweden. Objective. A pilot study has prompted a more extensive controlled trial with Peptide T in HIV infected patients. Methods. Six HIV seropositive non-AIDS patients with a T4 cell count <0.340x109/L were enrolled in a placebo controlled double blind study. Three of them were given active substance and three placebo. 500 ml saline with or without 1 mg Peptide T was given during one hour twice daily for four weeks. Resluts. The patients were followed for 3 months, clinically, immunologically and virologically. In addition., brain MRI were examined and psychiatric ratings were performed. The results of this first cohort of six out of eventually 36 patients will be presented. 245 [Page 246](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/244) 3105 Phase I Study of Peptide T and Goodwin**. *University of Southern California, Los Angeles, U.S.A. **National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, U.S.A. ***Porton Medical Laboratories, Encino, U.S.A. Objective. Peptide T (D-ala-1-peptide-T-amide) blocks in vitro binding of gpl20 at the CD4+ receptor site, particularly to CNS receptors, and substantially inhibits the replication of HIV at 2 E-10 molar. We report multiple dose pharmacokinetics and early immune response to Peptide T in AIDS patients. Methods. In this ongoing study, four AIDS patients have received escalating doses of Peptide T (0.1 to 0.8 mg/kg/day) intravenously (IV) for 30 days, followed by intranasal (IN) Peptide T for three days. Results. No adverse effects were observed. Preliminary analysis show T8 cell counts increased by 15%. T4 cell counts, skin test reactivity and mitogen stimulation tests did not change significantly. Mean pharmacokinetic values of the 0.03 mg/kg doses indicate Peptide T behaves in a multi-compartmental fashion; maximum plasma concentrations were 4.55 E-8 molar at 60 mins; beta half-life of 1.2 hrs; volume of central compartment of 0.96 L/kg; total volume of distribution of 4.95 L/kg and kel of 0.58/hr. CSF levels were 0.8 E9 molar 2 hrs after a 0.13 mg/kg dose. Maximum plasma concentrations after a 0.33 mg/kg IN dose were 4.7 E-9. Conclusion. Peptide T was well tolerated. Plasma and CSF concentrations following IV doses and plasma levels after IN doses exceeded concentrations previously shown to have in vitro activity. 3106 INFECTION OF TRANSFORMED RABBIT T-CELL LINES WITH HIV-1 Henrietta Kulaga*, Thomas M. Immunoregulation, #Lab. of Molecular Microbiology, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda Objective. To test the feasibility of using the rabbit as a model for infection with HIV-1. Methods. Rabbit T-cell lines transformed with Herpesvirus ateles (RL-5) or with HTLV1 (446) were infected with high titered HIV stocks and infection was monitored by RT activity, Northern blot analysis, and reactivity with AIDS patient sera in indirect immunofluorescence assays (FA) and Western blot studies. Similar analyses were performed using PBL activated by various mitogens and cell lines of nonlymphoid derivation. Rabbit origin of all cells was verified by analysis of DNA, RNA and cell surface markers. Results. The T-cell lines RL-5 and 446 supported infection with HIV-1. Analyses of viral protein and RNA showed peak levels of days 8-15 following HIV-1 infection. Evidence for infection included positive RT activity in cell free supernatants, detection of viral transcripts in RNA from infected cells and reactivity with AIDS patient serum in FA and Western blot studies. Human indicator cell lines were infectable with cell free supernatants from infected cultures. Attempts to infect rabbit PBL activated with mitogens and other non-transformed rabbit cell cultures were not successful. Conclusion. Rabbit T-cell lines can support productive infection with HIV-1 suggesting that, with proper manipulation, the rabbit may provide a model for AIDS research. Notes: 3107 EXPRESSIONS OF AN INFECTIOUS HIV PROVIRUS IN Oral Medicine, NIDR, ***Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, NICHD, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, +Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and ++Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, D.C. Objective. To produce an in vivo murine model of viral latency. Methods. Transgenic mice were constructed containing: 1) the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) linked to the bacterial gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) or 2) an infectious molecular clone of the HIV provirus. Results. In the first group of experiments, unstimulated macrophages from the HIV LTR-CAT animals failed to express detectable CAT unless they were treated with CSF-1 or CSF-1 plus other cytokines. Furthermore, fractionation of ear skin from these animals revealed the presence of high levels of CAT in Langerhans cells, epidermal cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage. Transgenic mice bearing an infectious provirus were examined for evidence of viremia and histopathology. Tissues from these animals were surveyed by immunohistochemical techniques for expression of viral encoded proteins. Conclusions. Both sets of transgenic animals may serve as potentially valuable systems for the evaluation of drugs or the effects of other infectious agents on integrated copies of HIV proviral DNA. 3108 AN IMMUNE DEFICIENCY-LIKE SYNDROME IN CATS WITH FELINE T-LYMPHOTROPIC LENTIVIRUS(FTLV) INFECTION: A REVIEW OF 530 CASES Takuo Ishida, Washizu, K. Toriyabe, S. Motoyoshi Nippon Veterinary and Zootechnical College, Tokyo, Japan Objective. To establish the epidemiology and clinical features of FTLV infection, a new feline viral disease recently described by Pedersen et al. Methods. FTLV antibodies were detected in cats by immunofluorescence and Western blot assays using FTLV obtained from Dr. N. C. Pedersen and propagated in cat lymphocytes activated with human recombinant IL-2 (Cetus Corp.). Results. In a 6-month survey in Japan, 815 out of 2868 cats (28.4%) were positive for FTLV antibody. Among 530 antibody-positive cats with complete clinical data, male: female ratio was 7:3, and the mean age was 4.9 (male) and 5.7 (female) years. Concurrent feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection was seen in 71 cases (13.4%). Although 54 cats (10.2%) were free from illness, 476 (89.8%) were showing varying degrees of clinical signs. FTLV was isolated from 3/3 healthy and 28/29 clinically-ill cats. The signs included chronic (52.6%), chronic diseases (30.6%), anemia (18.9%), emaciation infection (15.5%), skin diseases (13.6%), chronic diarrhea (12.3%), renal disease (11.1%), of unknown origin (8.7%), lymphadenopathy (8.3%), and leukopenia (4.7%), with multiple signs observed in many cases. Other sporadic cases suggestive of immune deficiency included FeLV-negative lymphoma, skin granuloma bacteria. The mortality during the 6-month period was 15.5%. Conclusion. Observed similarities to HIV infection may make the cat system an excellent animal model for AIDS. 246 [Page 247](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/245) 3109 UNIQUE DIFFERENCES IN VIRAL REPLICATION AND CYTOPATHOLOGY BETWEEN HUMAN AND CHIMPANZEE PERIPHERIAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS Peter L. Nara*, W Hatch**, J Kelliher***, S Carter**, and P Fischinger*+ *Office of the Director, National Cancer Institute, and **Program Resources, Inc., NCI-Frederick Cancer Research Facility, Frederick, MD, USA, ***Primate Research Institute, Alamogordo, NM, USA, +DHHS Public Health Services, Washington, D.C., USA OBJECTIVE. To investigate the in vitro aspects of the inherent resistance of chimpanzees given HIV-1 to develop the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. METHODS. Human (H-) and chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells (C-PBMCs) were infected with HTLV-IIIB and RF and evaluated for viability by trypan blue exclusion, virus production by radioimmunoassay p24 and reverse transcriptase, cytoflurometric analysis and ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS. Virus infected H-PBMCs were found to produce twice as much virus as C-PBMCs. Also, the H-PBMCs underwent significant loss in cell viability, whereas the C-PBMCs did not. Electron micrographs of cells at optimal virus production show that 90% of the H-PBMCs are undergoing cellular degeneration and necrosis with numerous HIV-1 particles present. The ratio of viralproducing to non-producing cells was one in 20 for H-PBMC and one in 140 for C-PBMC. CONCLUSION. It appears that C-PBMCs are inherently more resistant to the replicative and cytopathic effects of HIV-1 than are H-PBMCs and may be related to the current absence of the disease syndrome in this species. 3110 IMMUNOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE OF GIBBON APES (HYLOBATES LAR) TO INFECTION BY Rockville, MD, **National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, ***University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland. Objective. To extend previous observations of HIV-I infection and immune response in chimpanzees to the gibbon ape. Methods. Gibbon apes were inoculated iv with HIV-I (HTLVIII ) and monitored for: (1) infection by cocultivation with activated normal human lymphocytes, (2) antibody response by Western blot, (3) cell immune response by proliferation and cytotoxic assays, and (4) hematological and clinical changes. Results. Infectious HIV-I found in hemitopoietic tissues and antibodies to major viral proteins were identified within two weeks and have persisted for more than one year. T-cell proliferative 'response towards whole virus and towards purified proteins, e.g., p24 and env gpl20 and a selective cytotoxic reactivity against cells expressing HIV-I env or gag proteins were also observed. Hematological, e.g., persistent lymphadenopathy, and elevated levels of eosinophils and segmented neutrophils, and clinical observations were consistent with viral infection. Clinical manifestations viz weight loss and a recurring congestion occurred in some animals. Conclusion. HIV-I is infectious for another species of higher primates. These infected animals exhibit a humoral and cellular immune response, but no evidence indicating a pathogenic consequence has yet developed. Notes: 1 COMPARATIVE NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY RESPONSES IN A HUMAN ACCIDENTALLY INFECTED WITH HTLV-IIIB AND EXPERIMENTALLY INOCULATED CHIMPANZEES. Peter L. Nara*, W Hatch**, Dunlop*, D Waters**, W Blattner***, and P Fischinger*+ *Office of the Director, National Cancer Institute, and **Program Resources, Inc., NCI-Frederick Cancer Research Facility, Frederick, MD, USA, ***NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA, +DHHS Public Health Services, Washington, D.C., USA OBJECTIVE. To compare the neutralizing antibody (NA) responses over a 3-year period in a HTLV-IIIB-infected human and chimpanzees, and evaluate virus isolates from both with type-specific neutralizing antibody and homologous sera. METHODS. Serial serum samples from the human and chimps were tested in a HIV-1 induced syncytial-forming microassay for their ability to neutralize IIIB, RF, and respective viral isolates, as well as evaluate reisolated virus with IIIB-specific typing antisera. RESULTS. Similar neutralizing responses were seen between the human and infected chimpanzees. Although the human NA titers to IIIB were both delayed and lower in titer, the virus isolated from both human and chimp was equally resistent to type-specific IIIB neutralization. The human and chimpanzee NA response toward their own viral isolates was similar. CONCLUSION. A human accidentally infected with HTLV-IIIB exhibited similar NA responses when compared to the IIIB infected chimpanzees. The human NA response data serves to re-emphasize the importance of the chimpanzee model for vaccine efficacy trials. 3112 HIV 2 IN RHESUS Chatel FRANCE. Objective: To establish an animal model of HIV infection Methods: Two different strains of HIV2 (EHO,ROD) have been first in vitroadapted to monkey PBL,and inoculated in rhesus monkeys or cultivated on rhesus PBL before inoculation (5 different viruses were obtained). 10 monkeys were inoculated using the following protocol: 1)IV:10 HIV2 (IC):10 cpm of RT equivalent virus.Follow up 1)Seroconversion:Results depend on the nature of the inoculated virus.7 out of 8 animals (HIV2 ROD deri ved viruses) seroconverted between D13 (cynomolgus monkeys seroconverted later(D150-D180).2) HIV2 was identifiable in PBL culture in 8 animals, 7 after seroconvertion, 1 in a remaining seronegative animal (D134, D150). CD4+ICD8+ ratio did not vary.4) One animal exhibited a leucopenia from D145 on, associated with weight loss.5) Clinic: only transient adenopathies have been noted in 4 animals. Conclusion: Mixed IC and IV inoculation of in vitromonkey cells adapted HIV2 may provide a good model of early phases of HIV infection and seroconversion, and might provide an experimental support in establishing vaccinal strategies. 247 [Page 248](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/246) Jenings,* N. Ire,+ Marx, and J. Salko. *University of CA, Davis, +California Primate Researdc enter, ~Salk Institute, LaJolla, CA. The long latent period between onset of infection and disease in HIV infected humans suggests that imnunization with an HIV immunogen during this interval may boost immunity to the virus, possibly reduce the virus load and prolong the disease free interval (1). Rhesus macaques (Mucaca mulatta) infected with Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) are ideal models for testing this hypothesis. Macaques infected with SIV seroconvert and show persistent infection, but remain healthy for a variable period, months to years, before succumbing to a fatal AIDS-like disease. We have recently inoculated 5 healthy SIV infected rhesus with gamma-irradiated whole SIV and incomplete Freund's adjuvant. One SIV-infected healthy rhesus received only the adjuvant and two uninfected rhesus received the SIVadjuvant immunogen. Preliminary results show that the SIV-adjuvant formulation is non-toxic and causes no decrease in T~ lyphocytes. In the uninfected monkeys, the immunogen induces a strong antibody response, mainly to core antigens as detected by Western blot. In the infected monkeys, the immunogen also appears to boost the antibody to core antigens. Data will be presented on the antibody response, virus level and clinical course of the SIV-infected monkeys. This information will help evaluate this novel immunotherapeutic strategy. 1) J. Salk.

To establish an animal model for AIDS by infection of rhesus monkeys with SIVagm. Methods. Six rhesus Iponkeys 15 to 18 months old were infected i.v. with 2x10~ reverse transcriptase counts of the SIVagm isolates -5, or -7. One animal infected with SMLV (CAPRC) served as a positive, two uninfected animals as negative controls. Virus was isolated by cocultivation of PBL with Molt-4 cells and monitored by RT assay. Seroconversion was determined by ELISA and radioimmunoprecipitation. Results. The two animals infected with TYO-1, one out of two infected with TYO-7 and the one infected with SMLV seroconverted within 4 to 8 weeks p.i.. Antibodies against gp 130 developed 2 to 6 weeks earlier than those to core proteins. TYO-1 and SMLV could be isolated 8 to 10 weeks p.i. from three animals. These three monkeys developed 12 weeks p.i. persistent lymphadenopathy confirmed by histology. Conclusions. SIVagm isolates TYO-1, TYO-7 and SMLV can infect rhesus monkeys and induce symptoms similar to those of HIV-infected humans. Further immunological and virological examination is in progress to determine the relevance of the SIVagm-macaque model for AIDS research. Notes: 3115 EFFECT OF TISSUE-CULTURE-PRODUCED SOLUBLE FACTORS ON THE EVOLUTION OF SAIDS. D. Viza*, J. Vich**, M. MD, U.S.A. Objective/Methods. Twenty-seven Macaca fascicularis received a single injection of SIV. For 9 months, several biological parameters have been monitored: platelets, leucocytes, lymphocytes, T4 and T8 counts, hematocrit, proteins. All parameters, except the total leucocyte number, varied significantly after the viral injection. Six groups of 4 monkeys subsequently received weekly injections of semi-purified soluble material produced by different clones of a human lymphoblastoid cell line which had previously shown anti-HIV activity in vitro. Three animals were used as controls. Results. Significant improvement (P < 0.05) was noticed in 2 of the groups (8 animals) receiving the tissue culture material, thus confirming previous observations suggesting that certain soluble factors secreted by lymphoid cells may play a role in controlling the evolution of the infection. Biochemical characterization of the active moieties is in progress. 3116 S SIV/DELTA-INDUCED IMMUNODEFICIENCY IN THE RHESUS MONKEY: CORRELATION OF VIRUS-SPECIFIC ANTIGENEMIA AND ANTIBODY PRODUCTION WITH CLINICAL DISEASE. Michael Murphey-Corb, Jing-Yu Zhang, Louis N. Martin, R.C. Montelaro*, E.A. Watson and G.B. Baskin. Delta Regional Primate Research Center of Tulane University, Covington, LA and *Louisiana State University Baton Rouge, LA USA. Objective: To determine parameters of SIV/Delta Infection related to disease progression in rhesus monkeys. Methods: Virus-specific antibody production was measured in sera of infected monkeys by Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation. Viral antigenemia was measured by a cross-reactive sandwich ELISA which detects HIV p24. These results were correlated with the development of disease over time after infection. Results: Asymptomatically infected monkeys mounted an antibody response to all the major viral proteins within 30-40 days post infection which has persisted for over 3 years. A similar profile was observed early in infection in animals inoculated with pathogenic virus. Antibody declined, however, in a predictive fashion up to several months prior to the onset of clinical disease. Monkeys with SIV/Delta-associated encephalitis however, displayed little, if any, detectable viral antibody, regardless of the time of survival post-infection. SIV/Delta-specific antigenemia was evident only in immunodeficient monkeys and fluctuated recroprocally with antibody, particularly with respect to antiviral gag determinants. Conclusion: Antigenemic episodes concomitant with a loss of detectable antibody are prognostic for wasting, opportunistic infection and death. This relationship may suggest a protective role for humoral immunity, particularly with respect to CNS infections. 248 [Page 249](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/247) 3117 SPECIFIC M. Murphey-Corb, G. Baskin, S.R.S. Rangan, E. Watson. Delta Regional Primate Research Center, Tulane University, Covington, LA USA. Objective: To identify blood lymphocyte subset alterations associated with antigenemia and rapid death after infection of rhesus monkeys with Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV/Delta). Methods: Whole blood samples were stained with fluorescent antibodies and the percentages of stained lymphocytes were determined by flow cytometry. Serum antigenemia was measured semiquantitatively using cross-reactivity of SIV in commercial kits for the measurement of HIV antigenemia. Results: Monkeys which developed decreased percentages or numbers of doubly-stained 4B4+/OKT4+ (Helper-Inducer) cells tended to die earlier than monkeys in which this subset alteration did not occur. Frequently the total percentage of OKT4+ cells did not decrease after SIV infection, but a decrease occured in the 4B4+/OKT4+ cell subset. The decrease in the percentages of 4B4+/OKT4+ cells was correlated negatively with the level of antigenemia attained during the first month of postinfection. Conclusion: A selective decrease in the percentage of 4B4+/OKT4+ lymphocytes was associated with a high level of antigenemia during the first month after infection with SIV/Delta. These two parameters combined were predictive of an early death. 3118 LIGHT, ELECTRON MICROSCOPICAL AND HISTOCHEMICAL STUDY OF LYMPH NODE CHANGES 2AK St. Georg, Hamburg; Primatenzenter, Gottingen; 4 Institut for Medical Science of University Tokyo Objective. Herchenrder et al. (see abstract) showed that macaques infected with SIVagm (TYO) developed a syndrome similar to human infection with HIV. This is the first model infection in which SIVagm was used. To study the morphogenesis of this syndrome LN from 7 infected and 2 control animals were examined 3 and 6 months after i. v. inoculation. Methods. Paraffin and ultra-thin sections were prepared according to standard methods. Monoclonal antibodies cells) were employed on fresh frozen sections using APAAP technique. Results. An explosive follicular hyperplasia and sinus B-lymphocyte reaction occurred. In follicles increased numbers of CD8 cells and proliferating cells, in pulpa slightly reduced numbers of CD4 lymphocytes were seen. Immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally degenerative changes of FDC and free virions in germinal centers were found. Conclusion. These findings are very similar to those seen in human infection and suggest that this model is an adequate one for studying HIV infection. Supported by grants from Bundesministerium f0r Jugend, Familie, Frauen und SIMIAN RETROVIRUS (SRV-I) ORAL OF EXPERIMENTALLY INFECTED MONKEYS. Schiodt*+, A. Lowenstine**, J.S.Greenspan*. *Oral AIDS Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisc6, CA, **The California Primate Research Center, Davis, CA, +University Hospital, Copenhagen. Objective. Endemic simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS) among rhesus monkeys at the California Primate Center is caused by a type D retrovirus called SAIDS retrovirus type-1 (SRV-1). Experimental infection leads fatal SAIDS in rhesus-monkeys. Necropsy studies show that SRV-1 is expressed in oral epithelium. The purpose of this study was to determine at what time after infection this viral expression takes place. Methods. Four rhesus monkeys were inoculated IV with molecularly cloned SRV-1. Two control monkeys were mock inoculated. Biopsies were taken from cheek pouch, gingiva and salivary glands preinoculation, and I and 4 months postinoculation. Frozen sections were stained with a monoclonal antibody against the transmembrane envelope glycoprotein (gp 20) of SRV-1. Results. No animals had serologic or virologic evidence of SRV-1 infection before inoculation, but after 3 weeks, 3 animals were persistently viremic. All pre-inoculation biopsies were negative for SRV-1. One month post-inoculation, SRVI was expressed in epithelial cells in gingiva of 1 animal, whereas the other time-1 month biopsies were negative. The virus-positive animal was viremic and died 3 months after inoculation because of SAIDS related panlymphopenia. Conclusion. The expression of SRV-1 occurred in clusters of basal and suprabasal cells epithelial cells. It is hypothesized that single cells in the epithelium may become infected from lymphocytes and subsequently infect neighboring epithelial cells. 3120 ^ PROPERTIES OF INFECTIOUS VIRUS DERIVED FROM BIOLOGICALLY-ACTIVE PROVIRAL CLONES OF BOVINE IMMUNODEFICIENCY-LIKE VIRUS (BIV) S Carter*, Boyd*, M M Der Maaten****, M Gonda* *Lab of Cell Mol. Structure, PRI, 21701, USA; **Univ. Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC, USA; ****USDA, NADC, Ames, IA, USA Objective. BIV is a relevant animal model for studying the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis and persistence of lentivirus infection. Methods. We cloned and characterized biologically-active proviruses from BIV-infected cells and used these clones to study the host range and target cell for BIV infection. Results. Proviral clones, by restriction enzyme mapping, are very similar with the exception of a polymorphism of sites in the envelope region; thus, they may represent antigenic variants present in the original stock. When microinjected into cells in vitro, these clones produce cytopathic effects, most notably the induction of syncytia. Using BIV derived from these infectious proviral clones, we investigated host specificity and target cell for BIV infection in vitro. Although cells of human and other animal species were tested, only cells of bovine origin could be infected with BIV. Within the bovine cells tested, only cultures of embryonic cells derived from various organs and adherent leukocytes were permissive to BIV infection. A preliminary characterization of these adherent leukocytes suggests that they are monocyte- or macrophage-like. Conclusions. BIV, like HIV and other lentiviruses, may have a highly mutable envelope gene and use monocytes/ macrophages as target cells for infection. 249 [Page 250](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/248) 3121 SYNTHESIS AND ANTI-HIV ACTIVITY OF VARIOUS 3'-AZIDO-SUBSTITUTED-2',3'-DIDEOXYNUCLEOSIDES A Van Aerschot, P Herdewijn, M Baba, R Pauwels, J Balzarini, E De Clercq Rega Institute, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium Objective. Search for new and better derivatives of azidothymidine (AZT). Methods. A series of pyrimidine and purine 3'-azido2',3'-dideoxynucleosides including base-modified pyrimidines have been synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against HIV in MT-4 cells. Synthesis of the pyrimidine derivatives was carried out by reaction of lithium azide on the mesylated precursors. The purine analogues were synthesized by the action of triphenylphosphine, carbon tetrabromide and lithium azide in DMF. Results. The 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyriboside of the following bases were obtained (each with the selectivity index indicated in parentheses): thymine (5000), 4-hydroxylamino-5-methyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone (61), adenine (2), guanine (59), 2,6-diaminopurine (157). Conclusion. Although various new congeners of AZT exhibited selective anti-HIV activity, the greatest selectivity was noted for AZT itself. 3122 SCREENING CLINIC FOR HIV-RELATED DRUG STUDIES. 122 Vernon Appleby, J Reese, M Fischl and Research Staff, Univ of Miami, Miami, U.S.A. Objectives. Misclassification of patients entering clinical drug trials, particularly missing sublinical signs and symptoms of infections, could adversely effect the outcome of drug trials related to HIV infection. To minimize these effects, a screening program was established. Methods. Persons with documented HIV infection referred for drug studies at our medical center had medical records reviewed, a detailed medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests. Those eligible were referred to research protocol nurses. Patients were re-evaluated with a repeated medical history, physical examination and selected tests. Qualified persons were enrolled. Results. 634 persons were screened over a 16-month period. 101(16%) had been initially misclassified and had signs and symptoms of more advanced disease and 97(15%) had active opportunistic infections. Of the remaining 436,206 had conditions that made them ineligible or refused to participate. 10(5%) were found to have signs and symptoms of more advanced disease on reevaluation. 202 were enrolled into studies. Of these, only 3% developed evidence of progressive disease during the first 8 weeks of study. Discussion. Careful evaluation of patients with HIV infection for enrollment into drug trials is necessary, as signs and symptoms of infections may not be initially recognized. After careful evaluation, a large percentage of patients had more advanced disease, and even on re-evaluation, a number were still identified with more obvious symptoms. With careful review of medical records and repeat evaluations, patients can be successfully classified for drug studies. This should result not only in a more equitable way of evaluating research subjects but decrease the number of persons with subclinical disease on studies. Notes: 3123 RAPID AND AUTOMATED TETRAZOLIUM-BASED COLORIMETRIC ASSAY FOR THE DETECTION OF ANTI-HIV COMPOUNDS R Pauwels, J Balzarini, M Baba, R Snoeck, Schols, P Herdewijn, J E De Institute, University of Leuven, Leuven,Belgium A new assay method has been developed for the detection of anti-HIV agents. The objective was to replace the classical viability staining method (based on trypan blue exclusion) by a less labor-intensive test procedure which would allow significant automatization. Various dilutions of the test compounds were added to the wells of microtiter trays, whereafter mock- or HIVinfected MT-4 cells were added by automated dispensing. Then was added 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), a tetrazolium dye which is reduced in living cells to form a blue formazan. The latter was dissolved by the addition of an isopropylHC1-Triton X-100 mixture. The dye formation was quantitated by a multiwell scanning spectrophotometer interfaced to a computer for data processing. With this assay procedure the absorbance ratio of the mock-infected control to the HIV-infected samples was about 20. This allowed an accurate determination of the 50 % effective doses which gave values comparable to those obtained by the trypan blue exclusion method. The proposed assay procedure permits to significantly increase the number of compounds that could be evaluated for anti-HIV activity. 3124 COULD IMMUNOLOGICAL STRATEGIES FOR CANCER TREATMENT BE ADAPTED FOR AIDS? Alec H. Sehon, Immunology Department, The University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. The proposed therapeutic strategy for AIDS in seropositive asymptomatic individuals is based on the hypothesis that the immunological armamentarium developed for the in vivo destruction of tumour with xenogeneic monoclonal (MoAbs and PoAbs) to tumour associated antigens may be adapted for the annihiliation of cells infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by the use of anti-HIV MoAbs and PoAbs, tagged with appropriate radionuclides or toxins. These antibodies may also destroy these cells by antibodydependent complement-mediated cytolysis. These strategies are predicated on the in vivo accessibility of HIV epitopes on the HIV-infected cells to xenogeneic anti-HIV antibodies. To avoid complications due to the inherent immunogenicity of xenogeneic antibodies (XAbs) and of their immunotoxins (XAbs-IT), which would undermine the effectiveness of the strategy, it is proposed to supplement this regimen by preadministration of tolerogenic derivatives of XAbs or of XAbs-IT for suppression of the patient's immune response to these compounds. These derivatives would be synthesized by coupling XAbs or XAbs-IT to monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG), as achieved in this Laboratory for the conversion of a variety of antigens, including XAbs, to the corresponding tolerogens. This passive immunization regimen is expected to prolong the asymptomatic phase of HIV-infected individuals which may be essential for effective autologous vaccination against HIV. 250 [Page 251](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/249) 3125 COMPUTER MODELLING OF HIV STRUCTURAL AND REGULATORY PROTEINS AS A BASIS FOR NOVEL ANTIVIRAL CHEMOTHERAPY Yechiel Becker Department of Molecular Virology. Faculty of Medicine. Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel Obiective. To provide computer models for analyses of the properties of HIV-coded structural and regulatory proteins. Methods. The secondary structure and hydropathic properties of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV proteins will be analysed by computer programs available in the software developed by the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (UWGCG). The amino acid sequences of the putative virus genes were obtained from the available data banks. The properties of the viral polypeptides were assessed by modelling (determination of the predicted secondary structure by the Robson-Garnier and Chou-Fasman Methods). The hydropathic properties were determined by the method of Kyte and Doolitle. Results. Secondary structure and hydropathy analyses revealed that the envelope polypeptide has a major insertional domain of hydrophobic amino acids and additional hydrophobic domains. This suggests that the evelope polypeptide may have several membranal insertion domains like other similar membrane proteins (e.g. rhodopsin). Computer modelling of the viral p17 polypeptide showed that this protein is involved in the formation of the internal viral core. Modelling of the viral polymerase and regulatory polypeptide provided information on their conformation and putative active domains. Conclusion. Computer modelling of HIV provides predictions on the properties of the viral proteins and allows new approaches for the use of antigenic domains and active domains (membrane insertion, DNA binding) to be developed as targets for antiviral chemotherapy. 3126 TECHNICAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT OF THERAPEUTIC RESEARCH IN AIDS HS Sacks, D Reitman, J Berrier. Clinical Trials Unit, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, N.Y. USA. Objective. To evaluate the quality of clinical trials in AIDS published through 12/87. Methods. We performed a methodologic assessment of therapeutic research related to AIDS. A literature search yielded 100 clinical trials of HIV infection or associated conditions. They were evaluated with a modification of a previously developed scoring system which looks at adequacy of descriptions, design and statistical methods. Results. Over 80% of the papers were case re-- ports or uncontrolled trials. Only 18 controlled trials were found. Only 9 randomized treatment assignment, and 5 were double-blind. 60% did not adequately describe criteria for selection of patients. None described prior estimates of sample size required to demonstrate clinically useful differences, and only 1 negative report considered that a useful difference might have been missed due to inadequate sample size. Sample sizes ranged from 1 to 282. 10% reported confidence intervals around observed effects, life tables, or survival curves. 56% adequately described side effects. Conclusion. Several promising therapeutic agents are under investigation. There is considerable room for improvement in the conduct of therapeutic trials in AIDS and related conditions.

UR, of Jersey State Department of Health, Trenton, N.J. 'Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, and +Waksman Institute of Microbiology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, N.J. Due to the toxic side effects of currently available antiHIV chemotherapeutics a new approach using combinational drug therapy may be more effective. Our.research goal is to reduce the primary drug dose to a tolerable nontoxic level by combining several drugs to potentiate their activity. The polyene macrolide antibiotic amphotericin B and its methyl ester derivative (AME) are potent inhibitors of HIV in vitro, also they potentiate the activity of several compounds currently being used for treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). At noncytotoxic levels levels, AME can be added to cultures in combination with phosphonoformic acid (Foscarnet) and azidothymidine (AZT), and potentiate their anti-HIV activity. Significant potentiation of anti-HIV activity is seen using AME at levels of l-2ug/ml together with AZT at l-5ug/ml and Foscarnet at l0ug/ml. These experiments show the potential advantage of using combinational therapies for treating patients with AIDS or ARC.

Ghazzouli, M. W. T-S. J. Martin Bristol-Myers, Wallingford, CT; Oncogene, Seattle, WA; University of Alabama, AL; Yale University, New Haven, CT Objective: To describe an improved synthesis of d4T and, present data relating to its in vitro biological activity, mode of action and toxicity. Method: A modified synthesis which allows the preparation of d4T on a large scale and in vitro biological activity using CEM cell cultures inoculated with 30 TCID of HIV (LAV). The in vitro cytotoxicity on normal CE0 and on the growth of normal human haematopoietic progenitor cells will be presented. The ability of d4T to inhibit HIV RT using a RNA template primer will be reported. Results: d4T inhibited HIV replication with an ID50 ranging from 1-0.25 uM, cell growth was inhibited with a TCID5 of 40 uM. The comparable results for AZT are given in the Table. The bone marrow toxicity show that the concentration required for 50% inhibition of GM-CFU (granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming units) were 100 uM for d4T as compared to 1 uM for AZT. The Ki's for d4T-TP are in the 0.03-1 uM range while AZT-TP is Table: ID (uM) AZT 1-0.45 0.004-0.02 1 uM d4T is a highly potent and selective antiHIV agent which warrants clinical evaluation. Notes: 3131 CHANGES IN HIV NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY (NA) LEVEL ASSOCIATED WITH AZT TREATMENT IN AIDS S.R.S. Rangan, A. Rege, G. Risi, J. Lertora, Hyslop, Tulane-LSU AIDS Treatment Evaluation Unit, 1430 Tulane Ave., New Orleans, LA 70122, USA Objective: To evaluate the presence and level of HIV NA in AIDS patients undergoing AZT therapy. Methods: HIV replication in PHA-activated blood lymphocytes in 96-well plates was determined by the presence of p24 antigen in culture fluids. NA in heated (56~C, 30 min) plasma of 12 patients was assessed by the reduction in titer of 100 TCID5 of HIV preincubated (370C, 30 min) with test or control samples. Results: HIV inhibitory activity in 1:8 diluted plasmas from 6 patients are as shown: Sample week to AZT % reduction in infectivity 1 2 3 4 5 6 -2 NT 0 0 NT NT 0 - NT 0 0 0 NT 0 + 8 0 0 0 90a 0 90 +16 0 0 0 90a 90 NT +24 100 100a 99 0 0 NT HIV inhibitory titer 16 to 32. NT-not tested. None of the plasma from 3 patients inhibited HIV. In 3 others HIV inhibition was found prior to but not after AZT. HIV inhibition was not due to residual AZT since virus replicated at AZT levels from 0.012 to 0.341 uM/L but not in cultures with 100-fold less AZT. No correlation was found between NA and ability to recover HIV from lymphocytes or p24 antigenemia. Plasma samples are being tested for HIV. Conclusion: In some patients CD4 cell number and skintest reactivity improve after AZT (N Eng J Med, p 185, 1987) AZT might also influence humoral response to HIV in some. 3132 CONTRASTING ANTIRETROVIRAL EFFICACY OF ZIDOVUDINE (AZT) AND PHOSPHONOFORMATE (PFT) IN HIV-INFECTED MACROPHAGES (M0) S. Crowe, J. Kirihara, M. McGrath, J. Mills University of California, San Francisco; San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, California 94110 Objective. Virologic studies to assess the efficacy of antiretrovirals on HIV replication have largely focussed on effects in lymphocyte cultures or T cell lines. M6 are terminally differentiated cells and thus would be expected to behave differently than rapidly dividing lymphocytes. As mO provide a major in vivo reservoir of HIV we wished to compare the efficacy of the antiretrovirals AZT and PFT on this cell populations. Methods. Human blood m0, and a lymphoma cell line (VB) were infected with HIV-DV at a multiplicity of one, for one hour. Virus was washed out and cells were dispensed into Teflon jars/24 well plates containing varying concentrations of antiviral. Results. Examination of cell lysates by HIV p24 antigen capture assay (Abbott) showed that zidovudine (AZT) up to 50 ug/ml fails to inhibit HIV replication (confirming report of Richman et al.) whereas VB cells were sensitive to 0.5 ug/ml. However, phosphonoformate (PFT), an antiviral which does not require phosphorylation, inhibits HIV infection of both m0 and VB cells at 3 ug/ml. Preliminary experiments have not shown synergy between AZT and PFT. Data relating to these experiments and studies on other agents, including interferons, will be presented. Conclusion. Phosphonoformate, at concentrations readily achievable in vivo, inhibits HIV infection of m0, whereas zidovudine, even at concentrations of 50 ug/ml, was inactive in this cell population. 252 [Page 253](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/251) 3133 PHASE I STUDY OF INTERFERON-ALPHA AND AZT IN PATIENTS WITH AIDS-RELATED KAPOSI'S SARCOMA. Margaret Fischl, J Reese, L Dearmas, L Resnick, M Fletcher, R Argawal, M Myers*, Miami, *NIAID, U.S.A. Objectives. To determine the tolerance, safety and MTD of interferon alpha and AZT in patients with AIDS-related KS. Methods. Eligibility: biopsy-proven KS, no active 4/6 patients with gr3 after 3wks. Dosing AZT Cohort I 9mu IM daily 100mg q4hrs Cohort II 9mu IM daily 200mg orally 18mu *Two interferons were used, Roferon and Wellferon Results. 6 patients per interferon were entered at each cohort. Toxicities are as 4wks, 2/5(Roferon) and l/4(Wellferon) had anemia. Neutropenia was not seen. 9% had major tumor regression after 8wks and 56% after 24wks in cohort I; and 18% after 8wks and 63% after 18wks in cohort II. Discussion. 9mu of interferon and 600mg of AZT was relatively well tolerated even long-term; when combined with 1200mg of AZT, unacceptable toxicity occurred. In cohort III, anemia is prominent but not dose-limiting. Tumor responses have been high. Immunologic and virologic results have been disappointing. AZT clearance may be prolonged. 3134 A PHASE I STUDY OF COMBINATION ZIDOVUDINE AND ACYCLOVIR IN ASYMPTOMATIC, HIV-INFECTED MEN-- SAFETY AND SF, CA; ***Burroughs Wellcome,Research Triangle, NC. Objective. In a Phase I study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerance of combination zidovudine (AZT) and acyclovir (ACV). Methods. Twenty HIV-infected, asymptomatic homosexual men were enrolled for 10 weeks in an on-going open labelled study evaluating low-dose AZT (100 mg. 5 times/day) and high-dose ACV (either 400 mg. or 800 mg. 5 times/day). Results. AZT was well absorbed; serum levels were not affected by concurrent administration of ACV. All subjects developed mild decreases in hemoglobin (mean Hgb= 15.0 gm/dl at entry and 14.3 at week 10), or neutrophil count (mean PMN=3071/mcl at entry and 2417 at week 10). No renal, hepatic or metabolic toxicity occurred. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) became abnormal (nl<268 U/I) in 6 subjects during therapy; 3 men had persistently elevated levels at week 10. The most common symptoms (usually transient) were epigastric distress/nausea (17), headache (7), and myalgias/\"flu-like\" symptoms (7). Of 10 subjects on 100 AZT/400 ACV, 1 was withdrawn at week 7 when diagnosed with lymphoma; 9 required no dose modification. Of 10 subjects on 100 AZT/800 ACV, 2 required temporary dose reduction from 5 to 3 times/day (for decreased Hgb or PMN) and 2 permanent reduction (for myalgia or nausea). No subject required drug discontinuation. Conclusion. AZT/ACV was fairly well tolerated during the first 10 weeks of combination therapy, but all subjects developed decreased Hgb or PMN (typically mild), increased CPK and/or symptomatic complaints (usually transient). Notes: 3135 A PHASE I STUDY EVALUATING COMBINATION ASYMPTOMATIC O'Malley*, S Nusinoff-Lehrman***.*Dept of Public Health, SF, CA. **Univ. of California, SF, CA. ***Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Triangle Park, NC, USA. Objective. A phase I study was conducted to evaluate the short-term virologic and immunologic effects of combination zidovudine (AZT) and acyclovir (ACV) therapy in 20 asymptomatic, HIV-antibody positive homosexual men. Methods. During the first 10 weeks of an open labelled trial, patients received low-dose AZT (100 mg. 5 times/ day) and high-dose ACV (400 mg. or 800 mg. 5 times/day). Viral cultures, antigen assays, skin testing for delayed hypersensitivity, and T-cell subsets were measured at baseline and week 10. Results. HIV was detected from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 17 of 20 subjects at entry. Repeat cultures were persistently positive after 10 weeks of therapy in 15 of 17. Antigen was detectable in serum of 2 of 10 subjects at entry and was persistently detected in these two individuals after 10 weeks. Mean T4 count was 483/mcl at entry and 482/mcl after 10 weeks. Three subjects who were anergic to 4 skin test antigens on entry developed a positive response to at least one antigen by week 10; no patient was anergic at week 10. Conclusion. Despite achieving peak blood levels of AZT and ACV which produce in vitro antiviral synergy, no antiviral effect was apparent by the techniques used. During the first 10 weeks, T4 counts were generally stable; 3 anergic subjects developed improved skin test reactivity. Further study will be needed to determine the long-term effect of combination therapy on immunologic function. 3136 PHARMACOKINETICS OF ZIDOVUDINE (ZDV) AND ACYCLOVIR (ACV) DURING CONCURRENT DRUG ADMINISTRATION IN ASYMPTOMATIC MEN WITH HIV INFECTION. Paulo de Miranda*, S Weller* Maha*, AR and Blum* *Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Triangle Park, NC, **Dept. of Public Health, San Francisco, ***Univ. Calif., San Francisco Obiective. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of ZDV and ACV administered concurrently. Methods. Twenty HIV seropositive homosexual or bisexual asymptomatic men received 100 mg doses of ZDV alone for one week and then received either 400 mg (n=10) or 800 mg (n=10) ACV in addition to ZDV for nine more weeks. The drugs were administered q 4 hr 5x daily. A steady-state pharmacokinetic evaluation was made on Day 7 (ZDV alone) and on Day 21 (ZDV + ACV). Plasma ZDV and ACV levels were measured separate for ZDV administered alone, with 400 mg and 800 mg ACV, respectively. The corresponding ZDV peak plasma levels (Cmax) were 0.60~0.31, 0.57~0.26 and 0.60 ~0.24 mcg/ml. Apparent total body clearance of ZDV was constant across the three treatments. AUC and Cmax for ACV were 1.78~0.88 hremcg/ml and 0.71~0.22 following dose schedule and 3.51~1.14 hremcg/ml and 1.21~0.37 mcg/ml after the 800 mg dose schedule suggesting dose proportional increases in ACV plasma levels. The ACV levels were similar to those seen when the drug is administered alone. Conclusion. The pharmacokinetics of ZDV and ACV are unchanged during their concurrent administration. 253 [Page 254](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/252) 3137 PRELIMINARY VII 3 EFFECTS OF COMI Ann C Collier, R Coombs, F Giano Tartaglione, L Corey, University of Objective To characterize the virolc concomitant ZDV and ACV vs ZD) patients with AIDS-related complex Methods Open label phase I study o 100 or 250 mg q4h) and ACV (800i Results To date, 24 homosexual 87% CLINICAL BINATION ZIDOVUDINE(ZDV) ACV) THERAPY FOR HIV la, P Kidd, B Nikora, T Washington, Seattle, WA, USA )gic and clinical effects of V alone in p24 antigen positive c(ARC). )f 6 oral dose regimens of ZDV (50, ng q4h) or ZDV alone for 12 wks. n, mean age 35.3, mean T4 studied; 15 have completed >12 wks RBaeline Week 12 P Log Plasma HIV Titer-1,mean 1.22 ACV/50mg(N=6),100(N=3) 7/9 1/7 0.04 All patients have tolerated medication well and only 1 subject required a transfusion.

The concomitant administration of ACV affords additive antiviral effect without a discernible change in toxicity. Further evaluation of low dose ZDV with and without concomitant ACV in early stages of HIV infection is warranted. 3138 PHARMACOKINETICS(PK) OF ZIDOVUDINE (ZDV) AND CONCOMITANT ACYCLOVIR(ACV) IN SYMPTOMATIC HIV INFECTED PATIENTS T Tartaglione, KE Opheim, AC Collier, F Gianola, J Unadkat, L Corey University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA Objective. To evaluate single/multiple dose PK in HIV infected patients treated with ZDV and ACV. Methods. In an ongoing study, 23 CDC III/IVA patients were randomized to receive either ZDV alone or in combination with ACV(800 mg PO q 4h) for 12 weeks. ZDV was given orally as 50, 100, or 250 mg doses q 4h. Single and multiple dose IV and PO PK studies were performed during days 1-8. During IV studies ZDV and ACV were given as 60% and 20% of the PO study doses, respectively. ZDV and ACV cone. were performed by HPLC analysis. PK parameters were estimated using non-compartmental methods. Results. A two compartment model best described the ZDV data. Oral bioavailability ranged from 50 to 80%.

Notes: 3139 PHARMACOKINETICS AND LONG-TERM THERAPY OF AIDS AND ARC WITH AZT AND ACYCLOVIR Robert Yarchoan*, A Broder* *NCI, Bethesda, MD, ** Wellcome Research Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA Objective. Based on the observation that acyclovir (ACV) potentiates the anti-HIV activity of AZT in vitro (H Mitsuya and S Broder, Nature 325, 773, 1987), we administered an oral regimen of AZT and ACV to 10 patients (pts) with severe HIV infection. Methods. 5 pts with AIDS and 5 with poor-prognosis AIDSrelated complex (ARC) were administered 100 mg AZT and 800 mg ACV orally every 4 hrs. Results. The pharmacokinetics of the two drugs were independent of each other; mean peak plasma levels were 1.65 pAM AZT and 7.4 AM ACV. Two pts withdrew from the protocol at wk 1 because of opportunistic infections. A 3rd pt withdrew at wk 17 because of hemolytic anemia and died with HIV-induced dementia at wk 54. 7 pts have now received AZT/ACV for 12 to 55 wks (median 48 wks); 3 had their dose reduced because of hematologic toxicity. No neurologic toxicity was seen. Most pts improved symptomatically and gained a mean of 2.6 kg during the 1st 10 wks. The pts' T4+ cells increased from 153+44 /mm3 at entry to 287+71 at wk 10 (p<0.01); by 40 wks, however, the mean T4 count returned to baseline. Two of 3 anergic pts developed skin test reactivity, and both pts with HIV p24 antigen detectable at entry became negative on therapy. Conclusion. A regimen of AZT and ACV can be tolerated for at least 1 yr and can induce clinical and laboratory improvements in pts with AIDS or ARC. Until further controlled studies are done, however, one cannot conclude that this regimen is superior to AZT alone. 3140 HIV RNA ACCUMULATION IS INHIBITED BY POLY(I): POLY(C12,U) poly(I):poly(C 2,U) (Ampligen) interferes with successful infection by HIV and where in the viral life-cycle this might occur. Methods. The presence of HIV RNA was detected using a liquid hybridization technique and RNA probes complementary to HIV genes. Levels of RNA were determined in HIV-infected C3 cells from the point of virus-challenge through several days of culture. Ampligen (25 pg/ml) was used as a pre-treatment 18 hours prior to virus-challenge, then continuously. HIV RNA was again measured. Similarly, C3 cells were treated with Ampligen but were cultured additionally with 3'deoxy-3'azidothymidine (AZT). AZT was added at 0 days (virus-challenge), at 1 day or at 2 days of culture. Assessments via the liquid hybridization protocol of any changes in HIV RNA levels were again made. Results. HIV RNA was detected in C3 cells within 2 days of infection and became maximal at 4 days (greater than 1200 molecules per cell). In those cells pre-treated and subsequently cultured with Ampligen, virtually no HIV RNA was detected; a small increase was seen at 6 days post-challenge. The Ampligen/AZT combination resulted in inhibition such that even at 6 days, no HIV RNA was detected. Interestingly, this inhibition was observed even when AZT was not added until 2 days post virus-challenge. Conclusion. The inhibition of HIV RNA accumulation by Ampligen is rapid and occurs at an early point in the viral life-cycle. 254 [Page 255](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/253) 3141 EFFECTS OF 3'-AZIDO-2,3'-DIDEOXYTHYMIDINE (AZT), DEXTRAN SULFATE (DS) HIVINDUCED SYNCYTIUM FORMATION Omar Bagasra*, Harold W Lischner** *Univ of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey - School of Osteopathic Medecine, Camden NJ 08103, **Temple Univ School of Medicine and St Christopher's Hospital for Children, Philadelphia, PA 19133, USA Objective. To compare the anti-HIV activity of AZT, dsRNA and DS in an in vitro system in which HIV infection occurs by cell-to-cell contact, as presumably occurs in vivo, rather than by attachment of cell-free virus to target cell surface, as in most published assays of the inhibitory effects of these drugs. Methods. Serially diluted drugs were added to coculultures of SUP-T1, Molt-4, A3.01 or U937 target cells. Syncytia were counted daily for 1 week and p24 antigen assayed in culture supernates on the 3rd day. Results. AZT essentially completely inhibited virus replication as measured by p24 production at 25 to 100 nM but had no effect on syncytium formation. dsRNA had no inhibitory effect on either parameter. DS5000 completely inhibited both at concentrations of 1-13 ug/ ml. No synergism was noted, but dsRNA partially inhibited the anti-HIV activity of both AZT and DS in some experiments. Both AZT and DS were effective at lower concentrations against HIV infection of the monocyte cell line, U937, than against HIV infection of the lymphocyte cell lines. Conclusion. In a system more nearly duplicating conditions in vivo, dsRNA has no demonstrable anti-HIV activity and may enhance the replication of HIV in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of AZT or DS. 3142 MEGALOBLASTIC CHANGES IN THE BONE MARROW OF AIDS PATIENTS TREATED WITH AZT. R.N.I.Pietersz, Objective. To study the influence of azidothymidine (AZT) on the erythropoiesis of AIDS patients. Patients and methods. In 23 male patients, classified as having AIDS, serial bone marrow aspirations were performed before and one month after starting treatment with AZT (6 x 200 mg). Results. Before treatment 2/23 (9%) of the patients already had megaloblastic changes of the erythroid precursors and the other 21 patients had a normoblastic erythropoiesis. After one month 11/21 (52%) of the patients with normoblastic erythropoiesis exhibited moderate megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow whereas the other 10 remained normoblastic. One of the 2 patients with initial megaloblastic erythropiesis, remained megaloblastic, the other.became normoblastic. The mean Hb in the normoblastic group did not change whereas the mean Hb in the megaloblastic group had decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after one month. Vitamine B12 and folic acid levels were normal in both groups before and after one month treatment with AZT. There was no correlation between development of megaloblastosis and the (previous) use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In the following 6 months 5/23 (22%) patients needed a total of 19 units of packed cells, 4 of these patients exhibited megaloblastosis in the bone marrow. Conclusion. Megaloblastic changes are common in the bone marrow of AZT-treated AIDS patients, and are not necessarily due to folic acid or vitamine B12 deficiency. Notes: Ph. Turk, A.J. Puech Pharmacologie clinique, CHU Pitid-Salpetriere, PARIS (France). Objective. To investigate the effects of zidovudine on the behavioural tests used to study psychotropic agents, in particular those tests which are predictive of antidepressant activity. The rationale was that during clinical trials some results suggested that zidovudine treatment leads to a neuropsychiatric improvement in AIDS patients. Methods. Male NMRI mice weighting 20-25 g were used for all tests, except for \"behavioural despair\" test, for which we used Male CD (Charles River). The following tests have been performed: Gross behaviour, Motor activity, Four-plates test, Behavioral despair test. Interactions with reserpine (measure of the rectal temperature and palpebral ptosis) and with apomorphine (antagonism of hypothermia and behavioral response to apomorphine). Statistical analyses were performed using the \"Student's t\" test. Results. Behavioural studies: the observation of gross behaviour of mice was not significantly modified by zidovudine, nor was the motor activity. Zidovudine did not modify the number of punished crossings in the Fourplates test. During the behavioural despair test, zidovudine increases significantly the period of immobility. Interaction studies: zidovudine did not modify the reserpine induced ptosis but reserpine induced hypothermia was slightly antagonized. No antagonism appeared in the interaction with apomorphine. Conclusion.The pharmacological profile of zidovudine would not support the hypothesis of an antidepressant activity. 3144 ZIDOVUDINE IN A SIMPLIFIED DOSAGE SCHEDULE REDUCES CSF HIV ANTIGEN LEVELS IN AIDS/ARC PATIENTS AND ASYMPTOMATIC SUBJECTS. Jan de and ***Internal Medicine, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Objective. Involvement of the nervous system is one of the features of AIDS. Persistence of HIV antigen (HIV-Ag) in CSF reflects local HIV expression and is strongly correlated with progressive encephalopathy in both children and adults. Zidovudine inhibits HIV replication in vitro, decreases serum HIV-Ag levels and crosses the BBB well. Methods. We studied HIV-Ag levels in sequential CSF samples of 6 AIDS/ARC patients (CDC group IV) and 7 longterm HIV-Ag-seropositive men without symptoms (CDC group II) or with PGL only (CDC group III). CSF was collected before treatment with zidovudine, 250 mg 6-hourly, and thereafter at monthly intervals in the CSF HIV-Ag-positive patients (follow-up 12 weeks). Results. HIV-Ag was detected in CSF in 3 AIDS patients (range 70-156 pg/ml) and one asymptometic subject (76 pg/ ml) before treatment with zidovudine. The highest level of HIV-Ag was found in the patient with an AIDS-related encephalopathy. All CSF HIV-Ag-positive men became CSF HIV-Ag-negative within 12 weeks of zidovudine treatment. One initially CSF HIV-Ag-negative AIDS patient became strongly positive (369 pg/ml) during a 3 weeks interruption of the zidovudine because of a relapse of cryptococcal meningitis. A decline of CSF HIV-Ag level occurred after retreatment with zidovudine: after 11 weeks he was again HIV-Ag-negative. Conclusion. Zidovudine, 250 mg 6-hourly, reduces CSF HIVAg levels AIDS/ARC patients and asymptomatic subjects. 255 [Page 256](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/254) 3145 EFFECTS OF ZIDOVUDINE (AZT) CHILDREN Mechthild Vocks*, U Cammann**, S Sauer*** U of AZT in children are not yet available. Therefore we examined the clinical, immunological and virological status of children treated with AZT. Methods. Ten children (6 month to 7 years), who were HIVinfected in utero, and 7 haemophilic adolescents (12 to 18 years) have been treated for maximal 8 months with AZT by oral administration in a dosage of 3,5 mg/kg at 6 -hourly intervals. In all of them AIDS was diagnosed. Results. Impairment of neurological symptoms were found in 6 children, of wasting syndrom in 2 children and of severe diarrhea in 1 adolescent, the other one died after 3 weeks of AZT treatment. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia was unchanged. Burkitts lymphoma impaired from concomitant cytostatic therapy. In 5 short-time treated children clinical symptoms did not change. Some children demonstrated increase in T4-helper cells, in vitro lymphocyts proliferation after mitogenic and antigenic stimulation remained unchanged. The follow-up of HIV p24 antigen and virus culture has not yet been examined in all cases. Two children developed adverse reations with insomnia, therefore therapy has been discontinued in 1 child. Anaemia and neutropenia did not occur. Conclusion. AZT seems to have a positive effect on clinical symptoms in children with AIDS. (This study is supported by the BMJFFG and BMA) 3146 CONTINUOUS INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF AZT TO CHILDREN WITH SYMPTOMATIC HIV INFECTION P.A. Pizzo*, J. Eddy*, J. Falloon*, *National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, **Burroughs Wellcome Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, N.C., USA Objective. To determine the kinetics, tolerance and efficacy of AZT when administered by continuous intravenous infusion at dose levels that exceed the theoretical inhibitory concentration of HIV infection. Methods. In this Phase I study, AZT was delivered with a portable programmable Pancretec infusion pump via an indwelling venous catheter to children with symptomatic HIV infection on an'outpatient basis. Four dosage levels were studied: Level 1 - 0.5 mg/kg/hr or 36( mg/m2/d; Level 2 - 0.9 mg/kg/hr or 650 mg/m2/d; Level 3 - 1.4 mg/kg/hr or 1000 mg/m2/d; Level 4 - 1.8 mg/kg/hr or 1300 mg/m2/d. Pretreatment evaluation included a comprehensive physicu routine chemistries and blood counts, lymphocyte subsets, immunoglobulin levels, HIV culture and diagnostic imaging. All parameters were evaluated serially. Results. 21 pts ranging in age from 14 mos-12 years were enrolled. Sources of HIV acquisition were transfusion (11 pts), hemophilia (2 pts), transplacental (8 pts). Steady state plasma levels in pts entered the different dose levels included: Level 1 - (3 pts), 1.9 gM; Level 2 (6 pts), 3.0.M; Level 3 (7 pts); 3.3 tM; Level 4 (5 pts), 5.0.tM. The stead state CSF to plasma ratio in 8 pts was 28 ~ 7%. Doses above 1.4 mg/kg/hr were associated with the early onset of neutropenia. Pts demonstrated improvement in appetite and weight, decreased lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, decreased immunoglobuli levels and increased number and percentages of CD4 positive cells. 13/21 pts with abnormal neuropsychological function prior to therap! showed improvement on therapy. Conclusion. Continuous intravenous infusions of AZT at doses between 0.5-1.4 mg/kg/hr in children with HIV infection were tolerable and associated with clinical, immunological and neuropsychological improvements. Notes: 3147 ZIDOVUDINE BURGARD, M. CANIGLIA, P. TURK, DUHAMEL, M. TARDIEU, C. GRISCELLI PARIS - FRANCE Fifty-two children have been treated with ZIDOVUDINE. In a first time, 8 children, aged 4 months to 12 years old with AIDS were treated intravenously (100 mg/m2 every 6 h) for 14 days followed by oral form at the same dosage for a total of 8 months. Seven of the 8 showed specific neurological impairment. In 2 children a dramatic improvement of their clinical status occured including neurological progress in one in 3 the improvement was dissociate or transient and in the other 3, no modification was observed. A marked increase of total lymphocyte and CD4 (+) cells counts occurred in 4 children but was transient without modification on in vitro antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation. P24 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serum antigens were detected in 7 children out of 8, then transiently disappeared in all children during intravenous therapy but reappeared progressively during oral regimen in all but one. Progressive modification of HIV serology was noted in 5 children at different stade of the disease were treated orally (100 mg/m2 every 6 h). The clinical and biological aletrations observed after at least 6 months of therapy will be presented. 3148 SYNERGY OF AZIDOTHYMIDINE AND AN ACYCLIC ADENOSINE ANALOGUE AGAINST HIV REPLICATION M S Smith*, E L Brian*, E DeClercq**, and J S Pagano*. Lineberger Cancer Research Center*, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N.C., USA, and Division of Microbiology**, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium. Objective. To test acyclic adenosine derivatives for inhibition of HIV replication, and for synergism with azidothymidine. Methods. The T-cell line C3 was infected with HIV and incubated in drug. Virus titer was determined by reverse transcriptase assay of medium at 6 days pi: doses which caused 50% or 90% reduction were calculated from doseresponse curves. Synergism was calculated by the method of combination indices. Results. The replication of human immunodeficiency virus was inhibited by azidothymidine and by some pM 4M PMEA 1 29 (S)-HPMPDAP 2.3 36 A synergistic effect was found with the combination of PMEA and AZT with combination indices of 0.22 to 0.62. Conclusion. If PMEA shows low toxicity in vivo, combinations of it with low doses of AZT may have an effect in treatment of AIDS, while reducing toxicity due to AZT. 256 [Page 257](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/255) 3149 LONG-TERM TREATMENT OF AIDS AND AIDS-RELATED COMPLEX (ARC) WITH AN ALTERNATING WEEKLY REGIMEN OF AZT AND 2',3'-DIDEOXYCYTIDINE (DDC) Robert Yarchoan, JM Pluda, RV McAtee, CE Myers, S Broder. COP, NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA Objective. The use of AZT is often limited by hematologic toxicity. Another dideoxynucleoside, ddC, can cause painful peripheral neuropathy after 6 to 11 wks of high-dose therapy. We hypothesized that an alternating regimen of the drugs may be less toxic than either used alone. Methods. 13 patients (pts) with AIDS or ARC were given an alternating regimen of AZT (200 mg orally every 4 hrs for 7 days) alternating with high-dose ddC (0.03 mg/kg orally every 4 hrs [9 pts] or 8 hrs [4 ptsj for 7 days). Results. 4 pts withdrew for sepsis (wk 1), thrombocytopenia (wk 5), oral ulcers (wk 4), or arthralgias (wk 10). 1 pt who had had mild neuropathy from prior high-dose ddC developed mild, transient neuropathy after 13 wks which was managed with lower doses of ddC. 8 pts are still receiving therapy, and the 5 pts on the every 4 hr ddC regimen have now completed 14 to 31 wks (median 27 wks) without developing neuropathy or hematologic toxicity. The pts had a mean rise of 41 T4+ cells/mm3 at wk 6 wk 22 (N.S.). 3 of 6 anergic pts developed positive skin tests at wk 12, and 3 of 7 pts tested had an increased in vitro proliferative response to antigens. The 3 pts with HIV p24 antigen detectable at entry had reduced virus. The pts also improved symptomatically and gained a mean of 1.4 kg. Conclusion. Alternating AZT and ddC induces clinical and laboratory improvements in pts with AIDS or ARC, can be tolerated for at least 6 months, and appears to reduce the toxicity of each drug. Further studies with weekly rest periods using each drug alone may be worth pursuing. 3150 CELLULAR METABLISM OF ANTIRETROVIRAL NUCLEOSIDE ANALOGS IN CULTURED HUMAN T-LYMPHOBLASTS: EFFECTS OF COMBINATIONS '-DIDEOXYCYTIDINE, I, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm Objective. 2', 3'-Dideoxycytidine (ddCyd) is a potent of HIV phosphorylated by cellular deoxycytidine kinase which is feed-back controlled by dCTP. We have examined if alterations in intracellular dCTP alters capacity of Subtoxic concentrations of thymidine (Thd) was used to decrease the dCTP pool. The effects of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), alone or in combination with ddCyd on cell growth, DNA precursor pools and accumulation of ddCTP were also studied. Methods. Inhibition of cell growth by the nucleosides, alone or in combinations, were determined after 72 h. Intracellular nucleoside triphosphate pools were measured in extracts by HPLC. Results. The combination of ddCyd and Thdwas synergistic on growth inhibition, while the combination of ddCyd and AZT was additive to subsynergistic. CEMcells accumulated ddCTP efficiently without any significant change upon addition of Thd or AZT. ddCyd treatment gave no alteration in DNA precursor pools. Addition of Thd reduced the dCTP pool, while addition of AZT slightly increased dCTP with no change in the other pools. Conclusion. Deoxycytidine kinase seems not to be rate limiting in the accumulation of ddCTP in vivo. Growth inhibition by the combination of ddCyd and Thd seems correlated to the ratio between ddCTP and dCTP. No direct metabolic interference between AZT and ddCyd was evident. Notes: 3151 315 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INHIBITION IS SUSTAINED BY ALTERNATING ZIDOVUDINE (AZT) AND 2', 3'-DIDEOXYCYTIDINE (DDC) BUT NOT BY AZT ALONE. Stpben a,. Se.ctor, D. Ripley, K. Hsia. Dept. of Pediatrics, U.C. San Diego, La Jolla, CA. Objective. To determine in itLro if HIV inhibition is increased by alternating AZT/DDC treatment compared to AZT alone. ehods CEM cells were infected with HIV (LAV strain; moi=.01), incubated 2-h and treated with AZT.1, 1 or 3 uM, DDC.01 or.1 uM, or alternating AZT/DDC. Media was changed every 3 days, replaced with antiviral, and virus produced assayed by p24 antigen (p24). HIV DNA was dstected by slot blot hybridization using a P-labeled HIV DNA probe. Results. Cells treated with no antiviral, AZT.1, 1 and 3 uM or DDC.01 uM produced >100 ng/ml of p24 at 6, 9, 12, 12 and 9 days, respectively; DDC.1 uM inhibited p24 production (<10 ng/ml) for >12 days. Virus inhibition was prolonged when the 3 AZT doses alternated every 3 days with DDC.01 uM and was sustained when alternated with DDC.1 uM. HIV DNA synthesis was inhibited by all drug concentrations with the alternating regimens having the least HIV DNA in infected cells. No cell toxicity was observed with any treatment regimen. Conclusions. Because of toxicities of both AZT and DDC, alternating regimens of both drugs are being evaluated in clinical trials. These data indicate that such regimens might not only decrease toxicity of the 2 drugs, but might improve efficacy. 3152 THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT DOSAGE REGIMENS OF ZIDOVUDINE/ACYCLOVIR *Microbiology, Ullevaal Hospital, Oslo Objective. To evaluate the effect of a three times daily dose regimen of zidovudine(ZDV) and acyclovir(ACV) on HIV-antigenaemia in CDC group IV HIV infections, compared to six times daily dose regimens. Methods. 24+ patients were treated with one of three oral dose regimens: ZDV 200 mg and ACV 500 mg every four hours (regimen I); ZDV 400 mg and ACV 1000 mg every eight hours for four weeks, followed by ZDV 200 mg and ACV 1000 mg every eight hours(regimen II); patients with anaemia, leucopenia or T4-lymphocytes below 0.1 x 10 /L received ZDV 100 mg and ACV 500 mg every four hours(regimen III). Results. Reduction of antigenaemia were observed within two weeks in all antigenaemic patients in all three treatment groups. These are the mean amounts of antigen in pg/ml(patients with and without initial antigenaemia): Dosage regimen I II III No. of patients 7 9 5 Pretreatment Two weeks Four weeks 393 82 53 517 118 161 954 280 166 Expanded results will be presented at the conference. Conclusion. A total daily dose of 1200 mg ZDV and 3000 mg ACV is as effective in initiating a prompt reduction of HIV-antigenaemia when divided in three doses as compared to six doses. Also, a low-dose regimen of 600 mg ZDV and 3000 mg ACV may initiate a prompt reduction of HIV-antigenaemia.

Canadian AZT Trial, Universities of McGill* Toronto** and British ColumbiV,* Montreal General Hospital, Canada Objective.To assess the effect of AZT treatment on the immune system of asymptomatic HIV infected individuals. Methods.Seventy two patients with asymptomatic HIV disease (CDC classification II,III,IV C2) and initial CD4 counts > 270/mm3 were enrolled in an AZT dose finding and toxicity study. Therapy consisted of 600 mg. daily for 18 weeks incrementally increased to 1200 mg. daily at 27 weeks. Patients were clinically evaluated every 3 weeks and immunologically every 6 weeks with T cell subsets, lymphocyte responses to mitogens, quantitative immunoglobulins, and delayed type hypersensitivity skin testing to four recall antigens. Results.Three pretreatment values were compared to results obtained during the 36 weeks of treatment. There were no CDC group associated changes with time. Overall there were significant changes (F<0.01) with time for the suppressor (CD8) and helper (CD4) cells and CD4/CD8 ratio. There was an early, linear decreasing trend for both CD8 and CD4 absolute numbers followed by an increase in these cell populations at 18 weeks and a return to pretreatment values for the CD4/CD8 ratio by 36 weeks. 63/70 (90%) of the patients were not reactive (at least one positive skin test) on DHS testing at entry, 15/63 (24%) became transiently reactive, and became repeatedly reactive with treatment. Conclusion.AZT treatment in asymptomatic HIV infected men led to an increase in DHS skin test reactivity and stabilization of T cell subsets over a 36 week period. 3154 ACTIVITY OF REDUCED AZT REGIMEN Collaborative AZT Study Group D6partement de Pharmacologie Clinique Hopital Claude Bernard, Paris. France Objective. To analyse the effects of AZT in patients (pts) treated with 200 mg X3/d. (half dose regimen: HD) for hematological reasons or 200 mg X6/d. (full dose regimen: FD). Methods. Among 235 pts. with follow up 28 wks. on AZT for AIDS (206) or ARC (29). therapy was initiated in 170 with the FD regimen and in 65 with the HD regimen because of Hb<9g/dl and/or PMN count <1000/mm3. There was no significant difference between HD and FD pts neither in number of OI/pt nor in the date of first OI. Differences in baseline (day 0) PBL and CD4 cell counts are shown in the table. Results: AZT had to be stopped in 39 FD pts and 18 HD pts. 87 and 41 pts completed 8 wks of the FD and HD regimens respectively and were then evaluated. N PBL DavO HD (+3.3 1.4 kg) and in Karnofskv score (+3.0 vs 3.6%) was not different in HD and FD pts. Number of 01 occurring before wk8 did not differ (p>0.05). The table shows that the increase at wk8 in PBL and T4 cell counts was proportionally higher in HD pts (p<0.01) than in FD pts (NS). Conclusion: No difference in AZT activity was demonstrated between these two regimens. It may suggest that reduced regimens should be evaluated, in order to limit the number of interruptions of the treatment. Notes: 3155 REIORTING OF SYMPTCMS EXPERIENBED IN A C3NIROLLED ZIDDVLDINE.

Objectives: To corrpare reporting of syrptmns in patients participating in a controlled clinical trial of zidovudine in trial documentation (CT) and by patient self-reporting (SR) with performance status (PS) reported as Karnofsky scores. Method: Forty-nine patients with AIDS or ARC were evaluated for syrptoms during time on study. CT included scaled assessment of severity of syrrptoms (0-3) at each clinic visit for each patient. Syrptoms assessed were: fatigue, diarrhoea, headache, night sweats, loss of appetite, malaise. SR carprised each patient corpleting 10 an. linear self-assessment scales (LASA) for severity of the same syrptons at each visit. Results: Forty-two cases in which treatrrent arm was known showed trends over time for lessening of severity of syrrptans reported (both CT and SR) in the active drug recipients (AICR), while scores for all syrrptoms (CT and SR) remained relatively constant in the placebo recipients (PR). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that significant predictors of performance status in ACR data (p <.01) were fatigue and malaise in SR variables and fatigue and loss of appetite in CT variables. In PR data significant predictors of performance status (p <.01) were night sweats and malaise in the SR variables, and night sweats, malaise and loss of appetite in the CT variables. Conclusions: Both patient SR and CT reporting of syrrptoms were similar in either ACR and PR. The differences illustrate the utility of a LASA-based patient SR instrument to augment CT assessments. 3156 COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTS OF THERAPY WITH SURAMIN 3'AZIDOTHYMIDINE(AZT) AND DIETHYLTHIOCARBAMATE(DTC) ON HIV REPLICATION S Escaich*, Retornaz*, Gutbraut*, M Sepetjan**, J Caraux***, C Trepo* * INSERM U 271, ** Hygiene laboratory University of Medicine and *** Institut M6rieux, Lyon, France Objective. Three different molecules have been used to treat HIV infected patients: Suramin, DTC,(an immunostimulant) and AZT. Further study of their action led us to compare their inhibition effect on HIV replication in peripheral lymphocytes (PL). Methods.PL from treated patients were cultivated and viral replication measured in vitro by reverse transcriptase activity and P24 antigen levels was assayed in serum. Results. a)4 of 8 patients undergoing suramin treatment (for 2-4 months) showed total inhibition of HIV replication which reapeared (as initially) when therapy was discontinued.B)14 patients were treated(4months) by DTC in a randomized assay. HIV was isolated from all the PL cultures. Reactivity for P24 antigen remained the same before, during, and after therapy. No correlation was observed between increased T4 levels of good responders and HIV replication in vitro during treatment. c)AZT administration to 15 patients was followed by inhibition of viral replication in PL cultures with progressive decrease of P24 antigenemia for all and remained so until the present time. Conclusions.These results confirm that: suramin known as an antiretroviral agent can indeed inhibit HIV replication in vivo. DTC which can give good immunological and clinical results has no detectable effect on viral replication. Finally, AZT appears very efficient on inhibition of HIV replication in vivo. 258 [Page 259](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/257) 31.5 7 FOLLOW UP STUDIES ON SEUEN AZT TREATED AIDS PATIENTS: UIUOLOGIC, ELECTRON MICROSCOPIC AND CLINICAL FINDINGS U. Nbjera*, Santa-Maria*, Garcia-Saiz* *Instituto dv Salad Carlos III. Madrid. Spain. **~ Applications Laboratory Electron Optics, Philips, Eindhooen. Holland. OBJECTIRES: The aim of the study is to attempt to correlate the clinical and airologic parameters in seoen AIDS patients under AZT treatment during a follow op period of one year. The patients haoe been selected following the CDC criteria (lUIS). METHODS: Specific antibodies for ALA base been measured by ELA, If and Western-Blot assays. HUH p24 antigen has been measared by ELA. Airal isolation has been attempted by co-culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (P1MG). Aliguots of these P1MG base been studied by scanning-transmission electron microscopy (STEM) for the localization of ALA antigens after immunolabelling. RESULTS: Two of the seven initial patients base died during the stady. Three PBMC specimens from each of the other floe patients base been prepared and studied as abuse indicated. The seven cases were initially HIA p24 antigen positive, with a mean T4/TH salae of 0.34. Two of them base developed opportunistic infections daring the period of study. Fluctuating levels of ALA p24 antigen base been observed in one case. ALA has been isolated in four cases. When the number of PBMC was sufficient to perform STEM studies ALA p24, gp4l and p17 antigens base been detected at any time along the follow up period. The pattern of the antigens' distribution varies depending on the evolution. CONCLUSIONS: It appears there is a correlation between the clinical improvement, the freguency of positive isolates, the morphological appearance of the PBMC and the amount of ALA antigen detected in them by STEM. The two patients whose PBMC initially showed greater morphological alterations and poorer antigen detection by STEM died during the follow up study. 31~58 INFLUENCE OF THE LIPOSOMES ON THE REPRODUCTION OF HUMAN IMMiUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS/HIV/IN CELL CULTURE Slepushkin, V. A., Gorchakova, T. A. Rudneva, I. A., Karamov, E. V., Bukrinskaya, A. C. D. I. Ivanovsky Institute of Virology, Moscow, USSR Oblective. As it was shown earlier, liposomes and ganglio~sides enhance experimental infection induced by influenza and parainfluenza viruses. This effect is probably due to the increased uptake of the virus particles by cells. In this work the effect of liposomes on HIV reproduction in lympho-blastoid cell line was studied. Methods. Reverse-phase eva~noration vesicles/REV/made from egg phosphatidilcholine and cholesterol! 2:1 accumulation of HIV antigens in 14 lymphoblastoid cells, EVK-2. Results. The most effective was concentration of REV 0,1 mg of lipids in 1 ml of cell culture fluid, which stimulated the production of virus antigens more than two times on the third day after liposome inlection, as it was tested in enzyme-linked irmmunosorbent assay/ELISA. Surprisingly, the accumulation of HIV antigens in culture fluid was not enhanced by liposomes but even was reduced to some extent. Conclusion. The mechanisms of such liposome action on virus production are under investigation.

BR Saltzman, GH Friedland, RS Klein, J Vileno, Freeman, P Gutelle, et. al. Montefiore Med.Ctr., A.Einstein Coll.Med., Bronx, NY, USA Objective: Quantification of temporal trends and differences in demography and clinical manifestations of AIDS in a predominantly heterosexual population from a single New York City medical center. Methods: Identification of all patients with AIDS. Standardized interview for risk behaviors. Data collected retrospectively pre-1985 and prospectively thereafter. In addition to presenting AIDS diagnosis, patients followed throughout course of illness. Ongoing collection of the results of diagnostic tests, procedures, microbiologic and pathologic specimens, including autopsy. Results: Of 526 AIDS patients seen from 6/81-9/87, 25% (132) female; 47% risk; 51% Hispanic, 35% Black, 14% White. Distributions by gender, risk and race differ from New York City and US reported AIDS cases (p 0.01). Differences in the relative frequencies of clinical manifestations of AIDS were significant comparing gender, risk or Homosexual males had more KS than heterosexual males (23% vs. 3%, p 0.05). Hispanic patients had more toxoplasmosis (5% vs. 1% others, p 0.05). There were no differences in the incidence rates over time by gender, risk, race, age or clinical manifestations of AIDS in this population. Conclusion: During the entire course of illness, clinical manifestations of AIDS differ significantly by gender, risk and race. 4002 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV INFECTION IN MALE SOLDIERS REPORTING NO IDENTIFIABLE RISK (NIR) Philip Renzullo, J McNeil, J Bunin, J Brundage Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, DC Objective. To investigate risk factors for HIV infection among soldiers who do not initially admit risk behavior. Methods. Approximately 20% of HIV-Ab positive male soldiers are considered at no identifiable risk (NIR) because they report no homosexuality/bisexuality, IV drug use, hemophilia, blood transfusions, or sexual activity with persons at known risk for HIV infection. A case-control methodology was employed, with cases and randomly selected HIV-Ab negative controls matched on key demographic variables. Subjects consent to a voluntary, anonymous and confidential survey of medical history, drug use and behaviors associated with HIV infection. Interviewers are blinded to HIV-Ab status. Results. Cases(n=22) do not differ from controls(n=40) in the number of lifetime female sex partners. Cases differ significantly from controls in the number of lifetime male sex partners, and number of homosexual/ bisexual and HIV positive acquaintances. Sixty percent of cases reported at least one traditional high risk behavior associated with HIV infection. Other risk was associated with being unmarried (Odds Ratio(OR)=3.03), history of needle stick injuries (OR=2.07) and history of prostitute contact while overseas (OR=2.00). Conclusions. Preliminary results suggest that NIR's in the military report risk factors similar to civilian NIR's and can be reclassified into traditional risk groups at about the same rate. Study designs which properly safeguard confidentiality can provide a more complete understanding of HIV risk in male soldiers. Notes: 4003 NON BLOOD HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV INFECTION. S. Garcia*, A. de la Laoa**, J. Romero*. * Carlos III, Ministerio de Sanidad, Madrid, Spain. Objective: In order to have a better knowledge of risk factors associated to HIV transmission among heterosexuals exposed by sexual contact to the infection, we analyse their sexual practices and social characteristics. Methods: From January to November 1.987, 217 heterosexual partners of - high risk groups for AIDS were seen under anonymous conditions at a pu blic STD clinic in Madrid (85 women and 132 men, non drug users and non blood products recipients). HIV antibodies were demonstrated by ELISA - and imunofluorescence confirmatory assays. Statistical analysis were ba sed on X and exact Fisher's tests. Results: Sixteen (7,4%) patients showed HIV antibodies. Only 34% had uni versity studies, but 65% were permanentely employed, 90%had medical insu rance and 96% lived in their own homes. Promiscuity of more than 5 se xual partners in the last year was recognized by 36 seronegative individuals and none of the HIV infected ones. Anal sexual intercourse and use of condoms were infrequent practices (19% and 12%, respectively).Further more, no statistical differences could be established between seropositT ve and seronegative subjects in terms of age, sex, socioeconomic status and sexual practices described (p>0,05). The only significant risk fac - tor for HIV transmission was sexual intercourse with known HIV positive partner: 8 of 16 infected patients in opposite to 32 of 201 non infected ones (odds ratio: 5,2; XM-H; p<0,001). Conclusion: Non blood heterosexual transmission is becoming a threat - ning problem in our clinic located in the main and more cosmopolitan-city of Spain, specially among steady sexual partners of HIV infected sub jects and independently of their sexual practices. 4004 RISK FACTORS FOR HIV INFECTION IN HETEROSEXUAL PARTNERS OF HIV INFECTED AFRICANS AND EUROPEANS Marie Laoat, H Taeleant, L Bonneuxt, P Cornett$, 6 Vercauterent, P PiotS; $ Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium and 1I Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Brussels Objectives: To define the rate of HIV infection and associated risk factors among sex partners of HIV infected heterosexuals without other risk factors. Methods:77 heterosexual partners (P) (62 woeen and 15 men) of 74 index cases (IC) (59 men and 15 women) were identified in Antwerp, and were examined for clinical, behavioural and virological variables. There were 39 African and 38 European index cases, Results: The overall infection rate was 53.2 % (58 % among female P and 33.3 % among male P; p =.15). In 3 of the 5 infected male P HIV was isolated in the absence of HIV antibody, as compared to 0 of 36 female P (p * 0.01). Variables in the IC significantly associated with HIV infection in the P included CDC clinical stage IV (75 % infection rate vs 44 X for stages II + III, p =.013); a low concentration of OKT4+ cells (255/ml vs 4051/1 for IC from non infected contacts, p =.008; 67.7 % infection rate when OKT4 conc. ( 300/el vs 35 % when OKT4 ) 300, p x.03); a low OKT4/OKT8 ratio (.37 for IC of HIV+ P vs.76, p z.004); > 6 sex partners during the previous 5 yr (p =.04). However, HIV infection in the P was not associated with the mean number of sex acts since the presumed or documented date of HIV infection in the IC (411 vs 316 for HIV+ vs HIV- P), the duration of exposure to the IC (39 vs 41 months, respectively), the types of sexual practices, or sex during menses. Other parameters of the IC not associated with HIV infection among the P were titer of HIV antibodies, a history of various sexually transmitted diseases, a positive serology for syphilis or hepatitis B, and various haematological markers. Conclusions: This study confirms a high transmission rate of HIV infection among female heterosexual partners from European and African descent. A more advanced clinical stage and a low concentration of OKT4+ lyaphocytes appear to markedly enhance the infectiousness through sexual intercourse of HIV infected persons. This was independent of the duration of exposure or the number of sex acts. 260 [Page 261](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/259) 4005 RISK FACTORS FOR HIV AMONG HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES IN CENTRAL AFRICA, *M. Carael, Ph. Vandeperre**, Ph. Lepage, S. Allen, D. Nzaramba and N. Clumeck***, *Institute for Sociology, Brussels, **AIDS Project, Kigali and ***St. Pierre University Hospital, Brussels. Methods. From Feb to June 1986, at the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali (Rwanda), mothers presenting themselves or their last child with signs suggesting HIV infection were enrolled for the study. The fathers were also convoked in view of completing the serological status of 150 couples with at least one HIV seropositive member (S+) who were matched for age to 150 couples both HIV seronegative (S-). Results. Among 138 couples with at least one HIV S+ partner and for whom we got complete serological data, 124 (89.9%) were both antibodies positive. Among women, polygamous unions were most frequent among S+ couples than among S- ones. An increase in the number of previous unions was also associated with HIV antibodies. In husbands, HIV seropositivity was associated with the reported frequency of sexual contacts with prostitutes in the past 2 years. 80/124 (64.5%) HIV S+ males recognised at least one STD during the past 2 years. Conclusion. In most of the S+ couples, the husband wasthe first to be HIV infected. The high rate of transmission of HIV from male to female could be attributed to repeated contacts with HIV in symptomless male and/or concommittant exposure to HIV together with other STD during sexual contacts with prostitutes. 4006 HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV IN ZAMBIA S Hira*, D Wadhawan*, B Nkowane*, J Kamanga*, P Perine** *University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia,**Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, U.S.A. Objective. To determine the extent of HIV infection among spouses of patients with AIDS and its-related complex (ARC) and possible relationship between infectivity of the index case and severity of clinical disease. Methods. The study was conducted at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia and 228 spouses were enrolled into the study; they were spouses of 31 patients with AIDS, 188 patients with ARC and 9 asymptomatic, HIV seropositive persons. The discordant couples were followed for one year to detect transmission of infection. Results. Sixty-one percent (92/150) of the female spouses of index male patients with HIV infection were also infected with HIV compared to 73% (57/78) of men whose wife was the index case. There was a trend among spouses of patients with AIDS to have clinical disease whilst spouses of patients with ARC were more likely to be asymptomatic. Also, there was a trend towards increasing infectivity of the index case with late stage ARC or AIDS. Conclusion. The data is consistent with the hypothesis that the potential for transmission of HIV increases with the severity of immunodeficiency which reflects a loss of the ability of the host to immunoregulate viral replication. Notes: 4AA A \"J 1 7 THE IMPORTANCE OF ANAL INTERCOURSE IN TRANSMISSION OF HIV TO WOMEN - HOSPITAL UNIVERSITARIO GAFFREE E GUINLE - UNIVERSIDADE DO RIO DE IMUNOLOGIA (FIOCRUZ) To evaluate male to female transmission of HIV. METHODS: Among 370 HIV.seropositive patients treated at our Hospital, 103 (27.8%) were bisexual men. We followed-up 75 women partners of these bisexual men to study male to female HIV transmission. Analysing their sexual life, social and demographic characteristics. We excluded women who had any history of intravenous drug abuse or blood transfusion. The results were analysed statistically by chi-square and Woolf's method.

At their first visit all of them were free of clinical symptoms. 4 patients have been examined twice. 2 of them developped lymphadenopathy 9 respective 11 months after their first visit. None had decreased CD4+ counts but three had T4:T8 ratios lower than 1 due to increased numbers of CD8+ counts. Virus isolations were performed in 8 of the 9 male partners (1 hemophiliac had infected two subsequent female partners). 4 were positive. No virus could be isolated from the blood of the man who had infected two women. Of 34 examined anti HIV negative female partners one had lymphadenopathy. 3 other had reversed T4:T8 ratios due to elevated CD8+ counts. Virusisolations will bei attempted in these patients. Conclusion. The rate of heterosexual HIV-transmission in hemophiliacs seems to be comparably low. Serological results should be controlled by further immunological and virological tests. ta= 9.41 p < 0.001 RO = 5.1(1.82 - 14.3) CONCLUSION: 1 - In our study we observed a number of bisexual men infected by the HIV importance of anal intercourse for male to transmission. significant and the female HIV 2 - The evidences do point the need of educational programs stressing the dangers of receptive anal intercourse for women partner of bisexual men. 261 [Page 262](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/260) 4009 HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV TO FEMALE PARTNERS *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, U.S.A. Objective. To present recent data on 1) heterosexual HIV transmission to women exposed to either asymptomatically HIV-infected or symptomatic (e.g., AIDS) hemophilic men and analyze associated sex practices; 2) AIDS patients (female partners or offspring) heterosexually linked to men with hemophilia. Methods. Data sources for analyses were 1) serosurveys using sex practices questionnaires (1984-1987); 2) U.S. AIDS surveillance data through 14 Jan 1988. Results. 1) Of 35 female partners of HIV-symptomatic hemophilic men, 11% had been infected when first tested compared with 1 (5%) of 21 female partners of asymptomatically infected men. Two seroconversions subsequently occurred among the 4 retested partners. Of all vaginal sex exposures, 75% did not involve condom use. Over 60% of all women engaged in both oral/genital sex and vaginal intercourse. None of the seropositive women and only 12% of seronegative women followed the preventive strategy of consistent avoidance of oral/genital sex, together with consistent condom use. 2) Of 16 women acquiring AIDS through heterosexual contact with hemophilic men, 50% were diagnosed in 1987. One woman's last exposure was 5 years earlier. The infected male partners of 70% were still asymptomatic. Of 5 children with AIDS born to partners of hemophilic men, 4 occurred in 1987. Conclusion. Silent HIV transmission followed unaltered sex practices; the necessity of education for risk reduction is shown by the rapid rise in AIDS incidence. 4010 THE FREQUENCY OF HUMAN IMMUNO-DEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTION IN HETEROSEXUAL WOMEN IN CENTRAL LONDON. L Howard, D Hawkins, R Marwood, A Lawrence, B G Gazzard. St Stephen's Hospital, London, England. Objective. To estimate the seroprevelance of HIV infection in women in a sexually transmitted disease clinic (STD) and a group of pregnant women in central London. Methods. The frequency of HIV antibody positivity was reviewed in a group of heterosexual women presenting to the STD clinic perceived to be at risk. In addition, all bloods from patients attending the antenatal clinic were anonymously tested for HIV antibody over a nine month period in 1986. In a prospective study all pregnant women presenting to the antenatal clinic since March 1987 have been counselled and offered the HIV antibody test. Results. Although only 1 HIV antibody positive woman was seen in 1985, by 1987 the figure had risen to 23 in the STD clinic. 9 were African and the others had boyfriends in high risk groups. Of 1,253 blood samples of antenatal patients tested anonymously for HIV antibody only one was positive. In the prospective study, 150 of 853 women in the antenatal clinic declined to be tested because they considered they were at no risk. One patient of the 703 who underwent testing was positive for HIV antibody. A further two HIV positive pregnant patients have presented to the clinic over the same period. Conclusion. The frequency of HIV antibody positivity appears to be increasing in sexually active women. The number of patients who are pregnant and HIV antibody positive is reassuringly small. At present all such patients would have been identified by screening only those patients in high risk categories. Notes: 4011 HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION INFECTION DIAGNOSED IN SWEDEN: Margareta Bottiger, Gunilla Eriksson, Bacteriological Laboratory, Stockholm. OF HIV National Objective. To describe heterosexual spread of HIV infection known in Sweden. Methods. Information collected through HIV-reported cases. Results: Up to 1988 a total number of 180 persons, 108 men and 72 women were reported as HIV-infected by heterosexual intercourse. Of these 92 were Swedes and 88 of foreign origin. Of the 49 Swedish men the following information was obtained: 6 had sex contact with a drug abusing woman, 9 gave a history of contact with prostitutes in Sweden or abroad (one in Bangkok in 1986), 25 had had sex contact with a foreigner and finally 9 were infected by their sex partner in Sweden previously unknown to be infected. One man with prostitute contact in Haiti in 1979 infected 4 women who in their turn spread the infection to 2 men and 2 (3) children. Of the 43 women 17 had a history of contact with drug abusers, 1 with a bisexual man and 4 with a hemophiliac. Twelve were infected abroad (8 in Africa) and 9 in Sweden by a man without known risk factor at the time of exposure. Of the foreigners 84 of 88 derived from Africa. Conclusion. Heterosexual spread occurs in Sweden. Sexual contact abroad was the most common riskfactor. Number two was contact with i.v. drug users. 4012 AN EXTENSION OF THE NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE OF AIDS CASES IN THE UK AIMED AT DETECTING HETEROSEXUAL SPREAD. Hilary E Tillett, N S Galbraith Public Health Laboratory Service, Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, Colindale, LONDON, UK. Objective. To assess the feasibility of additional questions to the AIDS report form about the HIV status of any heterosexual partners. Background. Surveillance of AIDS in the United Kingdom from 1982-7 has shown a predominance (86%) of cases among homo/bisexual men. Although the proportion of cases among UK residents stated to be heterosexuals has not increased substantially, the numbers have risen from 4 in 1982/3 to 70 in 1987. Previous publications suggest that the infectiousness of index cases may increase as their immune systems deteriorate. Therefore the heterosexual partners of AIDS cases reported to the surveillance scheme could be used for monitoring heterosexual spread. Infections could be detected at an earlier stage than those reported as AIDS cases to the main surveillance. Method. A small pilot study was done in 1987/8 to see whether doctors reporting AIDS in a heterosexual patient were prepared to answer questions on whether their patient had known sexual partner(s) at the time of diagnosis, whether their patients had been HIV tested and with what result. Results. There was good response to this feasibility study and it is planned to continue the extended surveillance. The information received and its limitations will be discussed. 262 [Page 263](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/261) 4013 PATTERN OF HIV HETEROSEXUAL INFECTION IN BRUSSELS. N Clumeck, P Magrez, D Roth, S De Wit, P Hermans, M Schoumacher Division of Infectious Diseases, St Pierre University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium. As of January 1988, 566 patients (P) with HIV infection were seen at St Pierre Hospital, Brussels - there were 363 M and 203 F (sex ratio: 1.8). Risk factors for infection were: homo or bisexuality 217 P (37%); IV drug use 76 P (13%); blood transfusion or haemophilia 23 P (4%) and heterosexual contacts with HIV infected people or in Africa 250 P (44%). Among the group of heterosexuals without any other risk factor, 209 (M/F: 1.1) were black Africans from Central African countries and 41 (M/F: 2.4, mean age: 36y) were Caucasians. Most of the white heterosexual men lived or travelled regularly to Central Africa. 50% were married and 70% recognized multiple contacts with prostitutes or free women in Africa. In the contrary, all the white females (70% single or divorced) lived exclusively in Belgium where 83% of them had sexual contacts with Africans or with Belgians coming back from Africa. Their mean number of partner was 3/year. This study shows that, in contrast with other parts of Europe or USA, where the highest risk of heterosexual transmission is linked to the pool of IV drug users or bisexual men, in Belgium the risk for women is mostly linked to the pool of male promiscuous travelling to Africa. For Belgian heterosexual males the risk is related to sexual activity in Central Africa. In Belgium, prevention and information campaigns should also focus on heterosexual people with particular emphasis on those linked directly or indirectly to Africa. 4014 HIV SEROPREVALENCE IN HETEROSEXUAL MEN AND WOMEN, DENVER METRO STD CLINIC, 1985-1987. Franklyn N. Judson*, J Douglas*, D Cohn *Denver Public Health, Denver, Colorado, USA Objective. To monitor the course of the HIV epidemic through seroprevalence surveys in an urban STD clinic. Methods. Each year, 1985-87, sera of consecutive, unselected STD clinic patients in defined risk behavior (RB) groups were tested for HIV antibody (ELISA, WB confirmed). HIV positive patients without a stated risk for HIV infection were reinterviewed to assure correct RB categorization. Results. No. HIV Positive/No. Tested (%) RB Group 1985 1986 1987 Total Gay Men 60/117(51) 60/123(48) men women at high risk of STD only 4 (0.3%) were HIV positive (2 men with histories suggestive of IVDU or homosexual contact and 2 women with IVDU sexual contact). The 3 positive female prostitutes were IVDU. Conclusions. By 1987, at least 10 years after the first HIV infection in Denver, there is no evidence that the HIV epidemic is advancing beyond gay men,IVDU, and their sexual contacts. Accurate epidemiology requires correct RB categorization using confidential reinterviews. Notes: 4015 HETEROSEXUOL TRANSMISSION OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS IN MIDDLE GEORGIA. Harold P. Katner, Mercer University School of Medicine Macon, Georgia, USA. Objectives. To review risk factors involved in the heterosexual transmission of HIV in a rural area of Georgia. Methods. All oatients with HIV infection, whether asymotomatic or suffering from an HIV related illness were carefully questioned as to risk factors and numbers of individuals theyexoosed. Results. From August of 1985 till Jan. of 1988, 10 individuals were seen in Middle Georgia area who acquired HIV by heterosexual contact, 6 were males and 4 females. As of this writing, 6 fit the current definition of AIDS with the remainder being asymptomatic infected individuals and one with AIDS related comolex. Six of these individuals probably acquired the infection outside of the state but exoosed over 300 individuals in this area. All infected individuals were blacks. Risk factors identified in the males included chancroid, heroes, syohilis, and multiple contacts with female orostitutes. One oatient with AIDS admitted to using IV drugs but beginning only 2 months prior to the onset of symptons. Risk factors in the females included heroes and receotive anal intercourse. Conclusion. These cases document the introduction of HIV into the heterosexual population of Middle Georgia. Educational programs have been started in schools and churches but the numbers of individuals oroviding these programs are limited. With the majority of these cases being identified in the oast 6 months, a 128% increase in syphilis in this area during the oast year, and an increasing teenage pregnancy rate, soeaks for the urgency of an effective educational program. 4016 PREVALENCE OF HIV INFECTION IN HETEROSEXUAL PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES Ida Onorato*, and HIV Data Analysis Team*,** *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta GA, and **Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, Washington D.C., USA Objective. To determine the prevalence of HIV infection in heterosexuals in the United States and to assess risk factors for seropositivity. Methods. We reviewed all available published and unpublished surveys and studies of HIV infection in heterosexuals, with and without acknowledged risk factors for HIV infection. Results. Heterosexuals without other risk factors showed a low seroprevalence of HIV infection, as determined from surveys of military applicants, blood donors, and childbearing women. Heterosexuals whose sexual behavior may increase their risk of infection had seroprevalences as high as 3% in Sexually Transmitted Disease clinic attendees and 5% in prostitutes who deny intravenous (IV) drug use. Ten percent to 60% of heterosexual partners of HIV-infected persons and 0-11% of partners of high-risk persons of unknown HIV status were seropositive. The highest seroprevalences (65%) were observed in heterosexual IV-drug users. Seroprevalence varied widely by geographic region and race/ethnicity and was highest in minority groups in northeastern cities. Conclusion. Heterosexuals at greatest risk for HIV infection continue to be IV-drug users and their sex partners. Seroprevalence studies in heterosexually active populations are planned to detect transmission of infection beyond these risk groups. 263 [Page 264](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/262) 4017 EPIDEMIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF HETEROSEXUALLY ACQUIRED AIDS--UNITED STATES Mary Chamberland, L Conley, T Dondero Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To review epidemiologic and temporal trend data for heterosexual transmission (HT) cases of AIDS. Methods. AIDS patients reported to CDC are classified as HT cases if they (1) report heterosexual contact with a person with HIV infection or at increased risk for HIV infection (US-born) or (2) were born in countries where HT is a major route of transmission (non-US-born). Results. As of January 4, 1988, 1115 US-born HT AIDS patients and 861 non-US-born HT AIDS patients (99% of whom were of Haitian origin) had been reported. While HT cases continue to make up 4% of all AIDS cases, the proportion of US-born patients increased from 15% of all HT cases in 1982 to 68% in 1987. Of the US-born patients, 72% were black or Hispanic, and 79% were women. US-born women with heterosexually acquired AIDS increased from 17% of all women with AIDS in 1982 to 25% in 1987, with a corresponding rise from 0.1% to 0.7% for men. Source partners for (3%), and persons with an unreported risk (12%). For black and Hispanic women, the cumulative incidence rates for AIDS acquired by heterosexual contact with IVDA or bisexual men were more than 20 and 4 times higher, respectively, than for white women. Conclusion. Continued AIDS surveillance supplemented with focused seroprevalence studies are needed to monitor the extent and evolution of HT. 4018 HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV INFECTION IN MILAN Galli, M Cernuschi, C Pastecchia, A Lazzarin; Clinic of Infectious Diseases, University of Milan, Italy Objective. To evaluate the risk of HIV heterosexual transmission, through the analysis of the motivation of sub-. jects requesting tests. Methods. Our study includes the subjects requesting a scre ening test for HIV up to XII/87 after heterosexual intercourses with partners actually or presumed infected. Screening has been performed by 2 ELISA methods. Positive samples were confirmed by Western Blot. Results. Heterosexuals exposure duration requesting test 6 months occasional Tot Nr pos TotNr pos TotNr 460 10(2.1%) Conclusion. According to literature data, in our sample females seem to be more easily infected during long term relationships with HIV infected subjects (p<O.01). No dif ferences between two sexes have been evidenced about risk rate of infection following occasional intercourses. Notes: 4019 RATE OF HETEROSEXUAL HIV TRANSMISSION AND ASSOCIATED HIV-ANTIGEN JJ Eyster, *NCI for the Hemophilia AIDS Study Group, Bethesda MD Objective. To quantify the incidence and identify risk factors of heterosexual transmission of HIV. Methods. Using standardized semiannual evaluations of 124 HIV+ adult hemophiliacs (H) and their steady female (F) sexual partners, we calculated annual conditional probabilities of HIV infection (in % ~SE) among F from first episode of vaginal intercourse after estimated date of HIV seroconversion of their H partner. Logistic regression was used to adjust markers of risks of transmission for duration of exposure. Results. Annual conditional probabilities of infection Year: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Rate:.8% 0% 1% 4% 6% 22(~8)% 29(~13)% 17 F were or became infected (HIV+). HIV+ was not associated with frequency of vaginal intercourse, intercourse during menstrual periods, anal intercourse, oral sex, hysterectomy, contraceptive practices or genital disease. Only 1 HIV+ F always used condoms during the past year. HIV+ F did use more tampons (median 8.5) than HIV- F (median 3) in the past year. Heterosexual transmission to F was associated with very low T4 or T8 cells or with +HIV-Ag (Abbott) in the H (RR~5,p<0.05 for each). Although low T4% was still related to HIV transmission (R=-16,p=O.05) after adjustment for duration of exposure, +HIV-Ag and duration of exposure were independently and strongly related to transmission (R=22,p=0.01 for each). Conclusion. T-cell and HIV antigen testing help to identify those individuals who are most infectious and should be integral to intervention strategies. 4020 HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV IN CALIFORNIA: RESULTS FROM A HETEROSEXUAL PARTNER'S STUDY Nancy L Marquis*, J Wiley*, W Winkelstein* *University of California, Berkeley Objective. To examine the efficiency of heterosexual transmission of HIV and associated risk factors. Methods. I!e enrolled the opposite sex partners of individuals infected with HIV or diagnosed with AIDS or ARC throughout California. Participants were interviewed about their sexual practices and medical history; laboratory tests for HIV and other co-factors were conducted, as were physical examinations. Results. Of 132 female partners of infected men that we enrolled, 52% were the partners of bisexual men, 24% were the partners of hemophiliacs, 12% were the partners of IV drug users, and the rest were mixed. Overall infection rate was 24% (95% confidence interval=18%-32%). In multivariate analysis, only the practice of anal intercourse (p=.003) and nonwhite race (p=.015) were significantly associated with infection. Frequency of exposure and disease status of the index case were not associated with infection. We have also enrolled male partners of infected women. In spite of repeated unprotected sexual intercourse (median number of sexual contacts = 399) none of the twenty male partners was infected (95% confidence interval=0%-17%). Conclusion. Risk factors have been identified that increase the chance of male-to-female transmission, but their predictive value is limited. Individual differences in ability to transmit and acquire HIV remain unexplained. This phenomemon complicates assessment of the efficacies of female-to-male transmission. 264 [Page 265](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/263) 4021 NATURAL HISTORY OF HETEROSEXUAL INFECTION IN SWEDISH COHORT Christer Franzen,J.Albert,G.Biberfeld, G.Lidin-Janson,G-B Lowhagen National Bacteriological Laboratory,Stockholm,Sweden Objective. To study the natural history of HIV infection in a homogenous group of 3 men,5 women and 2 babies,all members of the same \"cluster\" of heterosexual(and vertical) transmission. Epidemiology. A Swedish man attracted HIV in Haiti in 1980.Up to 1983 he transmitted HIV to 5 of 7 female sexual partners,of which 2 infected a new male partner.Two women infected their newborn babies.There is no evidence of risk behaviour other than vaginal intercourse.A concomitant genital herpes infection in the index case may have facilitated the transmission of HIV. 7/8 adult patients had an acute HIV infection in close connection with the transmission,permitting nearly exact dating of disease progression in relation to time. Methods. Clinical examinations were done at 3-4-months intervals.Analysis of HIV antibodies(ELISA,Western Blotting),p24 antigen,T-lymphocyte subsets and virus isolations were performed by standard methods. Results. One female patient died from AIDS(oesophageal candidiasis and CMV retinitis) within 5 years from infection.Two patients have developped ARC.All but one of the adult cases have a low T 4-cell count and/or a low T4/T8 ratio within 4 years from infection. One child with positive HIV isolation and positive HIV serology(> 18 mths from birth) is still healthy at 2 yrs and 4 mths of age. 4022 HETEROSEXUAL HIV TRANSMISSION AMONG THE MIDDLE CLASS Jordan B. Glaser, T. J. Strange D. Rosati The Staten Island Hospital, New York (NY) Purpose: To assess patterns of heterosexual HIV spread among the middle class. Methods: Office record review and standard questionaire Results: From July 1. 1984 through October 31, 1987, thirty nine (35 women, 4 men) heterosexual contacts of HIV infected individuals were evaluated by a private ID practice in a predominately white middle class borough of NY City. 35/39 were white, with mean household income of $41,200. Source cases were predominately (28 men, 4 women) blue collar intravenous drug users (1VDUs). After excluding contacts who presented with HIV infection, 6/27 women and 1/3 men who agreed to be tested were HIV Ab+. Condoms were not regularly utilized in IVDU relationships even though (i) 23/32 contacts became aware of their partner's risk behavior prior to the Dx of HIV and (ii) 23/32 IVDUs had attended a methadone program. Conclusions: Heterosexual HIV spread is occurring among the middle class. The predominant sources are IVDUs who do not fit the stereotype of being minorities and lower class. Methadone programs should be better utilized to provide HIV-related education since they provide access to many of these IVDUs. Further clinical and laboratory results will be presented in the definite paper. Notes: 4023 INCREASE IN HETEROSEXUAL CONTACT AS A RISK FACTOR IN MOTHERS OF HIV INFECTED CHILDREN Andrew Wiznia*, J Kashkin*, S Paterson*, A Rubinstein* *Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY Objective. To analyze risk factors in mothers of HIV infected children. Methods. A retrospective study of maternal histories for risk factors for HIV infection was performed utilizing HIV infected children as the index cases. Information from 194 children was assessed with exclusion of 71 due to unreliable histories. Results. 95% of HIV infected children followed by us born between 1978 and 1985 were offspring of IVDA mothers. However, 33% of HIV infected infants born in 1985-1987 had mothers in whom the only risk factor for HIV was heterosexual contact with a male at risk for HIV infection. Table.

There has been a dramatic increase in HIV infected infants born to mothers whose only known HIV risk factor was heterosexual contact with an infected male, oftentimes unknown to the woman. 4024 HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV: A EUROPEAN COMMUNITY MULTICENTRE STUDY. I. De Vincenzi* for the European Community study group on heterosexual transmission of HIV. * WHO Coll. Centre on AIDS, hop. Claude Bernard, Paris. OBJECTIVE: To determine rates and risk factors of heterosexual transmission of HIV. METHODS: Between March and December 87, 131 couples were recruited. Data for HIV(+) patients (Index Case=IC) and their heterosexual partners (HP) are collected every 6 months. Multivariate analysis was performed on the 104 female HP, the number of male HP(27) being insufficient. RESULTS: Of the 27 male HP, 1 (3.7%) was HIV(+). In this study, crude rates of female-to-male and male-to-female transmission are not yet comparable because of the small number of male HP and the differences in length of relationships (median: 12 months vs 35), condom use (33% vs 12%), IC's clinical status (10.5% had T4 counts (49% < 400 vs 21%). Of the 104 female HP, 29 (27.9%) were HIV(+). History of STD in the past 5 years independently of extra-marital sex [45% of HIV(+)HP vs HIV(+)HP vs 25.2%;p=0.01] were significantly linked to seropositivity. Other sexual practices were difficult to individualise. Associations with IC's clinical and biological status were also found: 38.5% of IC with HIV(+)HP had ARC or AIDS vs 20% (p=0.07) and T4/T8 ratio was lower for IC with HIV(+)HP (p=0.05). Length of relationship and frequency of sexual contacts were not significantly associated with infection. CONCLUSION: After a median relationship of 35 months, 27.9% of the female HP were HIV(+). Sexual behaviour, IC and HP related factors were independently linked to sexual transmission. 265 [Page 266](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/264) 4025 HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION OF Dept.of Infect.Diseases,L.Sacco Hosp.,Milano,Italy Objective.To evaluate the efficiency of heterosexual transmission of HIV,we have studied 250 persons whose only risk factor were sexual intercourse with people at high risk for AIDS. Male to female transmission. A)71 female sexual partners (for an over 6 months' period) of men infected with HIV were studied.Most of their male partners (89%)were i.v. drug users.There was not significant difference regarding sexual practices of this women. 27 of these 71 women(38%) were infected. B)Only one of 82(1,2%) women who had occasional sexual intercourse with men at high-risk for AIDS, became seropositive for HIV. Female to male transmission. A)Of the 13 men sexual partners(for an over 6 months' period)of women seropositive for HIV, 2 were infected(15%). 9 female partners were i.v. drug users, 4 were infected from previous sexual intercourse with high-risk men. B)None of 48 men who had casual sexual intercourse with women at high-risk,were infected. C) 3 of 32 men(9,3%),who report heterosexual contact with several prostitutes or with multiple partners, were infected. Conclusion. l)The risk of transmission of HIV from occasional heterosexual contact is very low;the risk increases in prolonged sexual relationship or with multiple sex partners. 2)The sexual transmission from male to female is most frequent than from female to male. 3)In Milan area the high prevalence of HIV infection between i.v. drug users appears the most important factor in spreading the HIV infection by heterosexual contact. 4026 HIV Transmission by Artificial Insemination Michael L. Rekart Objective. To report on the transmission of HIV from an infected artificial insemination donor to two (2) recipients in 1985. Methods. Forty (40) sperm donors to artificial, insemination programs were tested for HIV antibodies by ELISA and Western Blot in 1985. Women who had been artificially inseminated by donors who tested positive were offered testing, evaluation and counsel I ing. Results. One (1) sperm donor was confirmed positive for HIV antibodies. Thirty (30) women who had been artificially inseminated by this donor over the preceding four (4) years were notified and twenty-four (24) consented to testing. Two (2) of these sperm recipients were found to be HIV positive. One (1) was unmarried with only occasional heterosexual intercourse and no other possible risks for HIV infection. The other positive recipient was in a mutually monogamous marriage, had no other risk factors, and was three (3) months pregnant at the time of testing. A normal infant was eventually delivered at term with HIV negative cord blood. Further infant testing and spousal testing was refused. Both positive Al recipients and the infant are well two (2) years later. Conclusion. This report confirms the transmission of HIV through artificial insemination; an extremely high efficiency of transmission via this route is suggested by this and another study. Mandatory HIV testing of Al donors on a regular basis is essential. Notes: 4027 CONSEQUENCES OF HIV INFECTION IN PREGNANCY RESULTS FROM THE EUROPEAN COLLABORATIVE STUDY. PROF. CATHERINE PECKHAM for the European Collaborative Study. Institute of Child Health, London. Collaborating centres include Padua, Berlin, Edinburgh, Madrid, Valencia and Amsterdam. Objective This prospective study aims to determine the prevalence of HIV infection in infants born to HIV positive mothers, to examine risk factors for vertical transmission, to establish the maternal history of HIV infection in children and to identify precursors of AIDS/ ARC onset in infected infants. Methodn Children born to mothers known to be HIV positive at or before the delivery are enrolled in the study, and examined at three-monthly intervals with labor:atory testing by standard protocol. Results 156 children had been enrolled by 31.12.87. Most mothers were intravenous drug abusers. The mean age at the child's birth was 26.8 years, and most were living with a partner. 10% of mothers had AIDS/ARC prior to delivery. 97 of the 156 children had been followed for at least 6 months and 70 for over 1 year. 8 had developed AIDS/ARC, 5 other children had substantial signs or symptoms, and 143 were clinically normal when last seen. Of the 55 followed for at least 15 months, 43 (78%) have lost maternal antibody. The median age at antibody loss was 9 months. 28/96 (29%) of those tested for virus and/or antigen have a positive result. The situation in May 1988, when 91 children will have reached 15 months will be presented. Their clinical outcome will be discussed and estimates of vertical transmission rate,presented along with factors related to risks of infection. 4028 PERINATAL HIV INFECTION: EVALUATION OF THE RISK FOR THE MOTHER AND CHILD. A.Terragna*, A. Genova, Italy. We have prospectively followed up 64 children born to HIV seropositive mothers for a mean of 14.4+10.1 month to estimate the risk of perinatal infection and the risk of subsequently developing disease. All the mothers were in stage 1 and 2 according to the Walter Reed classification. 12 of the mothers were followed-up for 12 months after delivery. There was no significant disease progression compared to a matched control group not undergoing pregnancy. The children were born by vaginal delivery, artificially fed and did not receive blood or blood product infusions. All the newborns had HIV antibodies (HIVAb)at birth, and in 25 they subsequently disappeared (age range of antibody disappearance:5-14 months). Serum HIVAb were absent in 63% of those aged 12 months or more. Of the 39 presently seropositive children 23 are asymptomatic, 4 have LAS, 9 ARC and 3 have AIDS (of whom 2 patients died at 5 and 8 months). 75% (9/12) of the children who are still seropositive beyond the 12th month of age are symptomatic. The risk of HIV infection transmission in this group of children born by vaginal delivery to HIV seropositive mothers in WR1/WR2 stage is 37%, and the risk of developing HIV-related disease is 75% of those contracting the infection. 266 [Page 267](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/265) 4029 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FEATURES OF HIV INFECTION ON MOTHERS AND THEIR INFANTS IN FRENCH GUIANA A study on 55 children born by 44 women. R.PRADINAUD*, D.SAINTE-MARIE*, P.VIENNE**, J.SUZANON*** * Centre Hospitalier de D6partementale de la Sant6 *** Service Dpartemental de la Protection Maternelle et Infantile. Guiana, the french overseas Department in South America is less than 100 000 inhabitants with 20 % Haitian immigrants. 103 AIDS-cases have been diagnosed between 1982 and 1987. 86 % of them through heterosexual transmission. The first case with HIV antibodies was identified in May 1979 on a pregnant Haitian woman whose serum was stored at the Pasteur Institute in Cayenne. - 44 women were pregnant during their HIV infection: 5 with clinical and biological confirmed AIDS, 7 developped AIDS after their time of pregnancy, 10 out of these 12 died. They had a low socioeconomical status, generally unmarried. 43 were black (40 Haitians, 3 Guianese). 1 was an Amerindian girl with psychiatric disorders. Their age ranked between 151 and 51 averaging around 32;. 55 children were born by these 44 mothers: 12 developped AIDS (6 died in the first fifteen months of their lives), 14 are HIV (+), 3 were born-dead, 4 never tested, 22 have presented a negativation of the ELISA and Western-Blot tests between 71and 10 months. 2 presented associated congenital syphilis. Skin prurigo is the main clinical dermatological disease generally detected and mistaken for scabies. 4030 SEROSURVEY OF AN OBSTETRICAL POPULATION IN A VOLUNTARY HOSPITAL IN NEW YORK CITY R Sjerling*, HS Sacks,** L Mayer** and R Berkowitz,* Departments of Obstetrics/ Gynecology* and Medicine,** Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, N.Y. USA Objective, 1. To identify the risk of HIV infection in parturients receiving clinic care at a private hospital in NYC. 2. To assess the success of a voluntary screen ing program in identifying at risk individuals. Methods. From 11/9/87-1/4/88 an IRB-approved anonymous serosurvey for HIV was performed on umbilical cord blood obtained from all clinic deliveries.. Specimens were analyzed by ELISA with positive tests confirmed by Western blot (WB). The number identified by serosurvey was compared to the number identified by screening based on risk assessment. Results. 231 specimens obtained, 223 suitable for testing. 7/223 (3.1%) strongly positive by ELISA. 5/7 already confirmed by WB, 2 WB's pending. 3/7 (42%) of positives were women <20 years of age; this represents 3/33 (9.1%) of women <20. No positives were identified by a voluntary screening program based on risk behavior as assessed by interview. Conclusion. 1. >3% anti-HIV+ rate in parturients in our population. 2. >9% of tested women <20 were anti-HIV+. 3. Failure of voluntary screening program to identify cases. Notes: 4031 RJ BIGGAR, 'oTorneil I HELPER AND SUPPRESSOR LYMPHOCYTE CHANGES IN HIV-INFECTED MOTHERS AND THEIR INFANTS S Pahwa*, S Landesman**, JJ Goedert (NCI-USA, Med College, NYC; **Downstate Med Center, NYC) METHODS: Since 1986, we have enrolled HIV + pregnant women and controls in a prospective study to examine T-cell phenotypes at regular intervals in pregnancy and following delivery. Infants were followed regularly after delivery. In HIV + infants, infection status was considered indeterminate until either AIDS was diagnosed or HIV-antibody persisted for more than 15 months. RESULTS: Among HIV - pregnant women, the nadir of the T-helper counts (784/mm3) and proportions (29.8%) was at 7 months gestation. Near delivery, Th levels increased and stayed higher (,1000/mm3; 40%) for at least the first 9 months postpartum. Among HIV + women, the pattern of Th and Ts changes was similar but 10 to 20% lower until delivery. Near delivery, values rose, but soon after delivery, the Th levels fell to about 40 percent (Th: 500 cells/mm3; 25%) lower than those in HIV - women. The absolute lymphocyte counts in infants of HIV - mothers were very high (6000-7000/mm3). Th counts were~2500/mm3 and Ts counts 1000 to 1500/mm3; the Th/Ts ratio was 2.0. From the age of four months, the proportion of Th cells (.'25%) and the Th/Ts ratio (-1.0) were low in babies who were truly HIV-infected, whereas among infants who seroreverted, the pattern was similar to the values among babies born to HIV - women. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women follow a distinct pattern indicating immunosuppression during pregnancy. HIV + women parallel HIV - women but at a lower level. Among infants born to HIV + women, the Th percent and the Th/Ts ratio help to assess who is truly HIV-infected. 4032 THE EFFECTS OF PREGNANCY ON THE PROGRESSION OF H.I.V. INFECTION. *MacCaLLum Hospital; =BLood Transfusion Service, +M.R.C. Cytogenetics Unit; EDINBURGH, Scotland. Objective. To assess the effect of pregnancy on the progression of H.I.V. infection. Methods. An epidemic of H.I.V. began in Edinburgh amongst heterosexual intravenous drug misusers (I.D.M.) in August, 1983 and reached 50% seropositivity by 1985. Voluntary self-referred counselling and screening for H.I.V. antibody commenced in October, 1985 and all those found to be positive were offered medical follow-up. All patients have been seen at 3/12 intervals when clinical status, and immunological parameters have been assessed. Results. Two hundred and eighteen H.I.V. positive patients have been examined - 88 female (76 I.D.M., 8 heterosexual, 1 B.T.S. and 1 other). These patients have been divided into groups as follows:- Group 1 - no pregnancies; Group 2 - pregnancies before seroconversion; Group 3 - pregnancies after seroconversion; Group 4 - pregnancies before and after seroconversion. Three patients have developed A.I.D.S., 2 from Group 1 and 1 from Group 3. There is no statistically significant difference between the groups as far as clinical progression and deteriorating immunological status (T4,IgG and IgA) are concerned. If, however, we then Looked at drug abuse independently there was a difference between those who continued to inject and those who had stopped. Conclusions. At present, we have been unable to demonstrate any adverse effect of pregnancy on the clinical and immunological parameters in this group and the most important factor continues to be active I.D.M. 267 [Page 268](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/266) 4033 DOES Board, Edinburoh, UK. Objective To comoare the eoidemiolooical features and preonancy outcome in women tested for the same risk activities who are HIV serooositive and seroneoative. Methods HIV infection in oreonancy in Edinburoh has so far been found only in women who have been intravenous druo users or whose partner is known to be HIV seropositive from druo abuse. The oreonancies from all women in the Edinburoh area with these risk activities and known HIV status have been studied. Results These women had 181 oreonancies durino which their HIV status was known. They tended to be youno, unmarried and to smoke heavily. They tended to live in areas of the city with multiole deorivation, with both themselves and their oartner unemoloyed. A ouarter of pregnancies were terminated, and thons!'iomen continuino tended to book late and to default from clinics. Premature delivery and intrauterine nrowth retardation were almost three times, and los birth weioht almost four times more common than in the total Edinburnh population. However, there were no substantial differences in any of these features between the 78 pregnancies where the woman was HIV seropositive and the 103 pregnancies where the woman wips seroneoative. The HIV seropositive group did have a lower weioht oain in pregnancy, (p<O.001) and a lower white cell count (p<0.01), and these may be significant early indicators of clinical infection. Conclusion HIV seropositivity per se does not appear to affect pregnancy outcome in women who are symptomatically well. 4034 HIV IN PREGNANT WOMEN IN SAN FRANCISCO: AND PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDIES LB Hauer, BJ Sweet, Dept. of Ob-Gyn, S.F., San Francisco General Hospital Obective: 1)determine HIV seroprevalence in pregnant women in S.F.; correlate seropositivity with self-perceived risk and demographics, 2)study prospectively a cohort of pregnant HIV seropositives and high risk seronegatives. Methods: All pregnant women at an inner city hospital were anonymously tested for HIV beginning Jan. 1988; blood samples were coded to risk assessment/demographic questionnaires. Women with! 1 HIV risk factor were referred for voluntary enrollment into the prospective cohort study. HIV Ab testing was performed at entry and each trimester. HIV seropositives and selected seronegatives were followed each trimester with HIV antigen studies, cultures, immunology, and fetal testing. Participants were referred to companion studies for intra and post-partum and infant followup. Results: A preliminary risk assessment questionnaire completed by antenatal patients in the nine months prior to initiation of these studies showed > 1 risk factor for HIV in 20%, most often self or partner IV drug use or a bisexual male partner. New York studies of HIV seroprevalence in pregnant women showed a rate of 2%; only 58% of positives indicated a possible risk factor for HIV. Various studies of maternal/fetal outcome point to different trends in different parts of the U.S. and the world. Until now, no studies of this type have been done in the S.F. area. Pregnant women here may differ from those in New York or elsewhere, since a bisexual male partner is almost as common a risk factor as self or partner IVDU. Conclusion: Complete data from the seroprevalence and prospective cohort parts of this study will be presented.

Methods:During 1982-83 sera were collected and frozen from 1000 pregnant women studied at random in the country's rural and urban areas. A subsample from Maputo city has been analyzed for HIV antibodies. In 1988, another random sample (n=500) of pregnant women was drawn up and serum collected for HIV screening by ELISA (Virosnostika and ELAVIA) and confirmatory study by WB(BIO-RAD,LAVBLOT II). Results:Non evidence of HIV 1 and HIV 2 antibodies was found in the sample picked up in 1982-83. Laboratory testing of the second sample is currently in progress. Results will be presented and evolution of HIV circulation among Maputo's pregnant women in between the elapsed period will be discussed. 4036 SEROPREVALENCE OF HIV-1 INFECTION IN AN OBSTETRICAL POPULATION Neal A. Halseyl, T ownsendI, J Coberly1, G Baltimore, MD; 2NCI, 3NCHS, Bethesda, MD Objective: To examine trends in the seroprevalence of HIV-1 infection in an obstetrical population at an urban tertiary care medical facility. Methods: Two sequential serosurveys of an obstetrical population at an urban tertiary care medical facility were performed. In both surveys, the investigators were masked as to individual patients' identities. In the first survey, 673 consecutive women who delivered from May through September, 1985 were bled at the time of delivery. In the second, 1245 women attending a prenatal obstetrical clinic from October, 1986 through October, 1987 were bled at a third trimester visit. Results: Five (0.74%) of the 673 women in the first survey and 16 (1.28%) of the 1245 women in the second survey were positive by ELISA and Western blot. Conclusions: The populations sampled are similar but not identical. Categorical demographic data comparing the two populations and the infected and non-infected patients are currently being analyzed. It appears, however, that the seroprevalence of HIV-1 infection in the population of pregnant women under care at this center may have increased as much as 0.5% from 1985 to 1987. 268 [Page 269](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/267) 4037 SEROPREVALENCE OF HIV-1 AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN AT TIME OF BIRTH AND ABORTION IN N.Y.C.-1987 MARIA ROSARIO ARANETA, PA THOMAS, S CEDENO, LL RAMIREZ, A RUIZ, S SCHULTZ, NYC Dept. of Health, New York,NY,USA OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of HIV-1 infection in pregnant women at time of birth and abortion in NYC. METHOD Blood from a population based sample of women giving birth or aborting in 1987 was obtained. 3425 anonymous, discarded, maternal and cord blood samples were collected from 20 obstetric and 16 abortion facilities and analyzed for HIV-1 antibodies by ELISA and Western Blot. Demographic information was determined. RESULTS The citywide seroprevalence was 1.37%. Rates did not differ by outcome of pregnancy:induced abortions 1.41% (21/1491); live births, 1.34% (26/1934) (p=0.86). Rates highest among women aged 25-29 years (2.00%), Hispanics (2.22%), Bronx residents (2.04%) and Medicaid recipients (2.79%). Rates were lowest in women <19 years of age (0.81%), Whites (0.36%), Staten Island residents and ABORTIONS(%) BIRTHS(%) White 0.36 1.05 0.00 3.69 2.25 Health Insurance 0.40 0.52 0.38 CONCLUSION In pregnant women, HIV-1 infection is highest in low income and minority women. Prevention strategies targeted to such populations and planning for the care of potentially infected infants should be implemented. 4038 THE SEROPREVALENCE OF HIV-1 INFECTION AMONG WOMEN ATTENDING MATERNAL INFANT CARE (MIC) CLINICS IN NEW YORK CITY (NYC). Isaac B. Weisfuse* S. Back*, D. O'Hare**, M. Benedicto**, N. Nicholas**, A. Punsalang*. *AIDS and HIV Surveillance Unit, NYC Dept. of Health, **Maternity Infant Care/Family Planning Projects MHRA Inc. New York, USA. Objective. To determine the prevalence of HIV-1 infection among women attending MIC clinics, that will serve as a baseline for comparison to future surveys. Methods. A blinded serosurvey was conducted among new female registrants seeking maternity services at the 9 MIC clinics, located in every borough except Staten Island. These clinics predominantly serve minority women of low socioeconomic status. HIV-1 testing by ELISA and Western Blot was performed on serum specinens initially submitted for RPR testing between December 1986-March 1987. Anonymity was preserved by removal of identifying information prior to HIV-1 testing. Results. Results on 1,497 of 3,330 specimens collected showed that 22 (1.5%) were HIV-1 positive and 16 (1.1%) inconclusive. Rates from the 9 clinics varied from 0% (two clinics) to 2.7%, indicating geographic variation in distribution of infection. For the age group 19 and under, the rate was 2.2%, for women 20-24 years old, 1%; 25-29 year olds, 1.7%; and for women over age 30, 1.3%. Conclusion. Women attending MIC clinics have a 1.5% prevalence of HIV-1 infection. MIC clinics provide a crucial site for counseling and testing services and AIDS educational campaigns. Notes: 4039 The effect of pregnancy on the natural course of the HIV infection AXEL SCHAEFER(1),I. Grosch-Woerner(l), W. Friedmann(1), R. Kunze(4), M. Mielke(2), E. Dept. of (1) Gynecology and Pediatrics, (2)Microbiology and (3)Pathology, Free University Berlin, (4)Robert Koch Inst. Berlin We studied the immunological course of pregnancy and the postpartal period over 6 month in 35 HIV-infected women at different clinical stages of HIV infection For comparison we also followed the course in pregnancies of 40 healthy HIV neg. women and observed 32 HIV infected woman without being pregnant over a 1,5 years in none of the HIV pos. mothers we observed a clinical progression during pregnancy. 3 (9%) expressed signs of a clinical aggravation during the postpartal observation. 7 (20%) lost over 20 % of the entrance CD4/8 Ratio and 3 (9%) showed a CD4-cell depletion over 20%. In comparison to the control-groups we found an increase of short time CD4-cell depletion over 20 % in the HIV pos. women during pregnancy. If a stimulation of lymphocytes was detectable at the beginning of pregnancy we could observe a postpartal recovery of the pregnancy induced immunosupression especially with ConA. As a significant event we saw also a relative loss of CDll-receptor-expression. Depending on the immunological staging we found an increase of low birth weight, vasculopathy of placenta and clinical complications. Conclusion: The influence of pregnancy on HIV infection shows a minor rank as expected. It should be assessed as a phase of slight enhancement in the developement of symptoms. 4040 ANTI-HIV SCREENING OF PREGNANT WOMEN EA Tj0tta*, I Orstavik* *Dept. of virology, National Inst. of Public Health, Oslo Objective. Routine anti-HIV screening of pregnant women started 1. September 1987 following recommendations from the Norwegian Ministry of Health. Methods. Approximately 55% of the country's pregnant women live in South-Eastern Norway, which includes the Oslo area. The routine is based on voluntary participation, but women who do not want to be tested must actively refuse. Abbott's 2nd generation test has been used for this anti-HIV screening. Positive samples were retested in duplicates and those repeatedly positive were also tested in Western blot (DuPont) and Wellcome's anti-HIV ELISA. In addition a second sample was requested from these individuals. Results. After 4 months 12511 sera have been screened. Only one confirmed EIV-Dositive was found (0.008%). This woman was a known HIV-antibodv positive (IVDA). In addition 35 sera (0.28%) were primary test positive. 15 of these (0.12%) were repeatedly positive, 6 twice and 9 all three times. All values were low (<2.5 x cut-off). Wellcozyme and Western blot assays were negative except for unspecific bands (p24, p55) found in 2 sera. The second serum samples showed unchanged results. Sera from 23 women (0.26%) who did not want to participate, were tested anonymously, all with negative results. Conclusions. EIV-antibody is extremely rare among pregnant Norwegian women. This indicates a low incidence of heterosexual transmission of HIV. Screening false positive results do not represent a heavy workload and \"true\" false positives were not encountered. 269 [Page 270](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/268) 4041 THE INFLUENCE OF PREGNANCY ON THE EVOLUTION 4 OF HIV INFECTION. A. BERREBI J. PUEL, J. TRICOIRE ****Association Le Patriarche - SAINT-CEZERT Objective. The clinical and biological evolution of 23 patients during their pregnancy and the two years following delivery is compared with a matched population of 23 non-pregnant patients, in order to determinewhether gestation aggravates the evolution of HIV infection. Methods. In these two groups, the following parameters 'ere chosen for their prognostic value: the clinical stage according to the classification of the Atlanta C.D.C., leucocytosis, percentage of lymphotytes, the OKT4/OKT8 OKT4's, sedimentation rate, and serum P24 antigen concentration. 4 periods were chosen: pregnancy, delivery, the first and the second year after delivery. Results. We have not found any statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the clinical stage, percentage of lymphocytes, the OKT4/OKT8 ratio and sedimentation on rate. A difference exists for the number of OKT4's (P<0,01) and the number of leucocytes (P<0,001) with a rise at the control group. Antigen P24 is present in 25'% of cases at delivery and disappears afterwards. Conclusion. Pregnancy does not seem to influence the evolttion of HIV infection. OKT4 concentrations are higher at delivery, probably due to the physiological hyper-leucocytosis. The higher levels of P24 antigens at the time of delivery does not seem to have a pejorative value. 4042 PREVALENCE OF ANTIBODY TO HTLV-I AMONG 1415 FEMALE PROSTITUTES IN THE UNITED STATES Rima F Khabbaz*, WW Darrow M Lairmore*, D Deppe*, J J French, ** **~ **k* J Potterat, T Leonard, R Reich, T Hartley*, *CDC, Atlanta, *Collaborating Group on HIV in Women. Objective. To determine the seroprevalence of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) in female prostitutes from 8 cities in the United States and to assess risk factors for HTLV-I seropositivity. Methods. Sera from 1415 women were screened by ELISA for antibody to HTLV-I; all positives were confirmed by immunoblotting and radioimmunoprecipitation. Results. Eighty women (6%) had antibody to HTLV-I. Prevalence varied from 24.2% (Newark), to 8.4% (Other, New Jersey), 7.2% (San Francisco), 6.5% (Los Angeles), 4.2% (Atlanta), 3% (Miami), 2.3% (Colorado Springs), and 0 in Las Vegas (p<.001). Rates were higher for HIV infected (12% of 169) than for HIV-uninfected women (5% of 1185, p<.001). The following risk factors were significant in logistic regression analysis: No. positive/No, tested (%) Crude Risk factor: Present Absent O.R. 95% 12/595 (2.0) 4.6 2.4-8.5 Other significant risk factors were older age and >14 years of sexual activity. Women with HTLV-I antibody who had no history of IV-drug use were either black (8) or Hispanic (3); 3 had sex partners who had used drugs and 3 had sex partners from Asia, Africa, or the Carribean. Conclusion. Prostitutes in 7/8 U.S. cities had antibody to HTLV-I; in more than 2/3 of these women seropositivity was associated with IV-drug use. Notes: 4043 PREVALENCE OF HIV-1 INFECTION IN A Minas Gerais, Brazil; ** Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, USA Objective.To determine the prevalence of HIV-1 infection in an STD clinic in two different periods. Methods. A 20% probability sample was drawn from the STD clientele for two months in 1985 & 86. The serum was tested for from medicalrecords and patients were interviewed for risk factors.Informed consent was obtained and confidentiality was assured. Results. RISK FACTORS 1985 1986 SEROLOGY 1985 1986 Number 5% Conclusion. Despite the absence of HIV-1 infection in this STD clinic, the high proportion of bisexuals among AIDS cases in Brazil and in Belo Horizonte raises the necessity of an ongoing surveillance in order to monitor the spread of HIV-1 in the general population. Prevention strategies should be established before larger populations are infected. 4044 HIV-INFECTION AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES (STD) AMONG ADDICTED PROSTITUTES IN AMSTERDAM; THE POTENTIAL OF HIV-TRANSMISSION Johanna AR van den Iloek*, HJA van Hlaastrecht*, B Scheeringa-Troost*, J Goudsmit**, RA Coutinho* * Municipal Health Service, ** Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Objective. To study the potential of HIV-transmission among addicted prostitutes. Methods. Study participants are (voluntarily) recruited since December 1985 from attenders of a STD-clinic for addicted prostitutes. Only women with a history of recent prostitution are enrolled, Results. As of November 1987, 117 women are enrolled; mean age 27 years (16-41 years), 46% are Dutch and 40% German. A history of intravenous (IV) drug use is reported by 96 (82%). Street-prostitutes are the most common (70%). The women had an average of 84 (~ 66) commercial sexual contacts per month, practised mainly vaginal and oro-genital intercouse and reported frequent use of condoms (90% of vaginal and 65% of oro-genital contacts). Infected with HIV are 35/117 (30%), 34/35 IV drug users. Duration of prostitution and frequency of gonorrhoea were independently associated with HIVinfection. 281 Consultations for STD took place in 104/117 women in the 6 months preceding intake. Gonorrhoea was difference in the susceptibility for STD was found between infected and non-infected prostitutes. Conclusion. Although addicted prostitutes reported to practise mainly safe sex, a high proportion was found to have one ore more STD's, indicating that this group may play an important role in IIV-transmission. 270 [Page 271](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/269) 4045 STD'S INCLUDING HIV INFECTION IN TEENAGE PROSTITUTES. Stanley E. Read, Clyde Cave, Eudice Goldberg, University of Toronto, The Hospital for Sick Children, Divisions of Infectious Diseases and Adolescent Medicine, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Young males and females from the street subculture are often transiently involved in prostitution and are at high risk for infection with sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV-1. Fifty adolescent street prostitutes were administered a questionnaire to identify their utilization of existing health services and their perception of specific health risks. Forty-four were female and six were male. Physical examination and laboratory tests were performed to identify disease states, and infection with chlamydia, CMV, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, syphilis, trichomonas, and HIV. Despite 27 of the subjects perceiving that street life and prostitution affected their health, and 32 having seen their regular physician within the preceeding year only 7 had informed their physician about their street life and prostitution. Twenty-six subjects did not identify themselves as being at increased risk for contracting gonorrhea, and as many as 17 felt they were at a reduced risk for any other type of STD. Twenty had positive cultures for gonorrhea, 23 cultured positive for chlamydia and 13 for trichomonas. There was one asymptomatic hepatitis antigen carrier. Twenty-six subjects felt that their risk of developing AIDS was the same as or less than other adolescents their age; 3 subjects tested positive for HIV-1 antibody Since physician/street-kid encounters are likely to be once only, a rational first-visit protocol may consist of immediate treatment for STD's and counselling related to safer sex. 4046 Survey of Streetwalkers in New York City for Anti-HIV-1 Antibodies JOYCE I. WALLACE', J. MANN', and S. BEATRICE\", 'Foundation for Research on Sexually Transmitted Diseases, NY, NY and \"New York City Department of Health, NY, NY Objective. To determine the seroprevalence of HIV 1 in New York City streetwalkers. Methods. In 1985, 1986, and 1987 prostitutes working on the streets of (Manhattan) New York City were queried as to their ages, number of years worked, and risk behavior- ie. history of transfusions, IV drug use, or lovers who were known to be IV drug abusers. Recruitment became easier with growing awareness of AIDS. Blood was drawn on-site, and was tested by ELISA with Western Blot confirmation for anti-HIV-1 antibodies. Results. In 1985, 4 of 22 (19%) were positive. In 1986, 4 of 43 (9%) were positive. In 1987, 4 of 67 (6%) were positive. A total of 118 different women were examined, of whom 12 (10%) were found to be infected. Of the 16 (14%) who admitted to IV drug abuse, 5 (31%) were positive. In 1982, a similar survey of T4/T8 cells among women who worked the brothels and the streets of New York City, showed a rate of 19% immune deficiency. Conclusion. Although there has not been an increase in the rate of infection, there remain infected prostitutes (6-10%) working the streets of Manhattan (New York City). Notes: 4047 PROSTITUTES AS AIDS EDUCATORS Kenneth Charles Locking* *The Australian Prostitutes Collective,**Sydney, ***Incorporated in NSW. AUSTRALIA. Objective. To inform the conference of the Australian Prostitutes awareness and knowledge of Sexual Health Care pertaining to preventing transmission/contracting the AIDS Virus. Method. To break down the historical myth of Prostitutes being disease carriers. Australian Prostitutes awareness of Sexual Health compared to Non-Prostitute sexually active people. The Prostitutes livelihood depends on maintaining sexual health care. There in the ideal situation to deliver educational information on AIDS and safe sexual practice. Prostitution extends further than just selling sex. The prostitute, as confidant, therapist and educator. Result.International recognition of the potential for Professional Prostitutes as AIDS Educators. Governments implement AIDS education/information throughout the existing sex industry within their communities. Prostitutes, especially in less developed countries will acquire a broarder base knowledge of the danger of contracting/transmitting the AIDS Virus. With their new found knowledge, the threat of death and safe sexual practice without exception, Prostitutes will ultimately pass on their knowledge of AIDS to their clients and others. Conclusion. It's time to cast aside archaic moral judgements placed on prostitutes. We should endeavour to utilise the resources of our modern industrialised societies and promote AIDS Education. In Australia we have achieved considerable success in harnessing the spread of the AIDS Virus. Our success is partly due to the fact that we educate Prostitutes to be AIDS Educators. 4048 THE EFFECTIVNESS OF EDUCATION IN PREVENTING HIV INFECTION IN GREEK REGISTERED PROSTITUTES George Panaevangelou,A. Roumeliotou,G. PaPoitsakis,G.Kallinikos,E.Trichopoulou,Th.Stefanou AIDS Reference Centre,Athens School of Hygiene,Greece 1934 screening for anti-HIV showed that 3.4% (12/350) of registered Greek prostittites had been already infected.Since then repeated educational campaigns and screening every 3 months was implemented.Their effectiveness in limiting the spread of HIV was evaluated. Methods: Registered Greek prostitutes are under strick control being obliged to report twice a week in a special STD clinic.Epidemiological information regarding their sexual behaviour clinical examination and blood samples are collected every 3 months.Educational material and detailed information are provided by personal interview simultaneously.Anti-HIV are detected by ELISA and confirmed by W.blot. Results: Two new seroconversions were detected in 1986. Since then further infections have not been detected.The median number of sexual nartners did not change significantly(frcm 48 to 42 per day).However the use of condam was considerably increased(from 66% to 97.9%). As a result no new cases of gonococcal infections or syphilis were detected since 1986. Prostitutes also avoided to accept clients from endemic areas. Conclusion: A considerable reduction of HIV infection as well as other sexually transmitted diseases were observed since 1986. This should be attributed to avoidness to accept clients from endemic areas and mainly to almost universal use of condom as a result of an intensive educational campaign. 271 [Page 272](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/270) 40A9 SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AND HIIV INFECTION RISK AMONG 354 SEX INDUSTRY WOMEN IN A PARTICIPANT BASED RESEARCH AND PREVENTION PROGRAM Judith B. Cohen*, LE Poole*, CA Lyons*, GJ Lockett*,**, P Alexander**, CB Wofsy* * University of California San Francisco ** California Prostitutes' Education Project Objective: As part of a study of 1,000 sexually active women at risk for IIIV infection in the San Francisco Bay Area, 354 Sex Industry (SI) women have volunteered for interview, phlebotomy and preventive education. Methods: Recruitment included self and peer referral and street solicitation of working women by study staff who include former prostitutes. Study activities took place in the community, in medical, women's, and drug treatment clinics, and in neighborhood motel rooms in areas of active street prostitution. Results: The most frequent source of customers was via street prostitution (60%), most others obtained customers from telephone contacts; e.g. for escort or massage services. Although identification was not required, study staff were able to provide results and additional prevention counseling to 90% of non-street SI and 44% of street SI women, including all but one of the 20 IIIV Ab+ women. IIIV antibody prevalence was 6%, not significantly different from the 5% IIIV infection rate among the 646 non-SI women. IIIV seropositivity was associated with IV drug use and with nonwhite race. Most SI women reported using condoms with customers, but they were unlikely to use them with steady, non-paying partners. Conclusions: For prevention efforts in this population, women who have been sex workers are uniquely effective in their ability to identify, recruit and communicate with their peers. 4050 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND CONDOM USE IN LONDON PROSTITUTES Helen Ward, S Day, J Wadsworth, JRW Harris. St Mary's Hospital, London. Objective To determine the effectiveness of condom use in the prevention of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases in women with multiple sexual partners. Methods A cohort of women prostitutes was recruited in the 18 months to November 1987. These women attend the Praed Street Clinic at intervals of two weeks to three months for screening for sexually transmitted infections. Information is collected at each visit on sexual behaviour and condom use. Results Information is available on 91 women for a total of 703 woman-months of follow-up. Episodes of infection with N. Gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis and T. vaginalis are presented in relation to length of follow up and condom use. Each woman is categorised according to whether condoms are used 100% of the time for penetration with all partners (A), use with all clients but not with boyfriends/husbands (B), or less than 100% use with clients (C). condom use number total follow episodes of women up (months) infection A 13 115 4 B 42 295 34 C 36 293 30 The analysis of observed frequency of infection against a distribution based on follow-up time shows a significantly lower rate of infection between the 100% condom users and the other women. (p <0.05-) Conclusion Condom use has been widely advocated in the prevention of spread of HIV and other STDs. This has been backed up by evidence of lack of transmission in vitro. This study adds clinical support to this recommendation. Notes: 4051 PREVALENCE OF HIV ANTIBODIES IN TRANSEXUAL AND FEMALE PROSTITUTES. B. MODAN,* R. GOLDSCHMIDT,* A. GOTLIEB-STEMATSKY,** *Departments of Epidemiology, **Microbiology and ***Infectious Diseases Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Aviv University Medical School, Tel Hashomer, Israel. Prostitution is frequently quoted as a potentially modifiable risk factor in the heterosexual transmission of AIDS. An investigation of HIV prevalence in an unselected group of female and (male) transexual prostitutes, estimated to constitute 80% of the prostitute population in the Tel-Aviv Municipal Area, was conducted over a one year period. The subjects were approached at different hours of the day, once every two months, on site. HIV antibodies were screened by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot. All prostitutes present on location were examined at each visit, and questioned regarding their age, biological sex, children, length of occupation, and drug addiction history. Of the 182 prostitutes tested thus far, all 115 females who were not drug abusers, were seronegative, while 2 of the 40 females who used I.V. drugs were seropositive (5%). In contrast, 13.8% of the 29 male transexuals acting as female prostitutes were seropositive (including 3/26 non drug abusers - 11.5%) (p<O.01). The discrepancy between male and female prostitutes working together suggests that female prostitutes who are not drug abusers do not constitute a major high risk group for HIV transmission, while transexual prostitutes pose a major public health problem. 4052 HIV AND LONDON PROSTITUTES Sophie Day, H Ward, J R W Harris. St Mary's Hospital, London, W2 Objective. To discover whether HIV infection in prostitutes is defined by the organisation of work rather than the simple sale of sex. Method. A cohort of 130 self-defined prostitutes has been recruited from women attending the Praed Street Clinic, St Mary's Hospital, London since 1986. This prospective study involves medical examination, discussion of risk factors for HIV and STDs and a series of loosely structured interviews concerning sexual and other lifestyles from an anthropological perspective. The results are compared with those on cohorts of prostitutes in other parts of the world. Results. 3/130 women tested are HIV1 seropositive. Two are injecting drug users and the third has an HIV infected regular non-paying male sexual partner. Women use condoms at work but not at home. Conclusion. 1) The prevalence of HIV infection in London prostitutes is 2.3%. 2) Identified risks are shared needles and unprotected sex with regular partners (including pimps) who may themselves have recognised risk factors. 3) It is not yet established whether clients in London are still uninfected with HIV or whether condoms prevent transmission. 4) The use of the term \"prostitute\" as a risk factor for HIV is misleading. The term connotes sex for money and there is no evidence that this activity is a risk in London. The term \"prostitute\" does not carry the same HIV risk in London as it does in other places, where sex with clients, possibly unprotected, is an established risk. The local processes of prostitution must form the basis for comparison and not just the sale of sex. 272 [Page 273](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/271) 4053 NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HIV-1 SEROPOSITIVITY AND PROSTITUTE CONTACT IN NEW YORK CITY Mary Ann Chiasson*, RL Stoneburner*, AR Lifson**, D Hildebrandt*, City Dept of Health, NY,NY, **CDC, Atlanta, GA OBJECTIVE To examine the association between female prostitute contact and HIV-1 seropositivity among male patients attending a single STD clinic in New York City. METHODS Volunteers were enrolled in an HIV seroprevalence study from 12/86 through 12/87. HIV antibody status was determined and information on demographics, sexual activity, and IV drug use (IVDU) was collected by an interviewer using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS Data from 961 of the 1200 participants have been analyzed. Of the 671 males, 287 (43%) reported at least 1 sexual contact with a female prostitute since 1978. Of these 287 men, 94 (33%) reported more than 10 contacts and 39 (14%) more than 50 contacts. Penilevaginal intercourse was reported by 236 (82%). Fellatio was the only type of contact for 44 men. Forty-six (16%) used condoms during at least 90% of their prostitute contacts. Vaginal Intercourse With a Prostitute By Male HIV Risk* No. HIV+/No. Tested (%) Risk Pro+ Pro- O.R __ Sex Part.

S. PROSTITUTES WITH NO EVIDENCE OF INTRAVENOUS (IV)-DRUG ABUSE William Ward Darrow*, W Bigler** D Deppe*, J French, P Gill, C Schable*, RK Sikes**, C Wofsy Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A. ** Multicenter Collaborative Group on HIV in Women Objective. To ascertain HIV seroprevalence and risk factors in prostitutes with no evidence of IV-drug use. Methods. Women in 8 U.S. cities who had engaged in prostitution since 1978 were interviewed. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for HIV antibody by EIA and Western blot, for hepatitis B by RIP, and for syphilis by RPR, MHA-TP, and FTA-ABS. Analysis was restricted to those who denied IV-drug use and had no needle marks. Results. Thirty (5%) of 640 women with no evidence of IV-drug use were HIV-antibody positive. Twenty-two (8%) of 287 prostitutes in Miami were HIV-positive (odds ratio=3.6; 95% confidence interval=1.6-8.2). HIV was associated with anal CI=0.3-1.8), oral contraceptive use (unadjusted OR=1.0; 95% CI=0.4-2.2), or any specific sex practice with clients. However, after controlling for research site (Miami) and hepatitis B in logistic regression, HIV was associated with large numbers (250) of nonpaying sex partners (adjusted OR=3.2; 95% CI=1.3-7.5). Conclusion. HIV infection in prostitutes with no evidence of IV-drug abuse was associated with a seromarker for hepatitis B, recent infection with syphilis, and sexual activities with nonpaying partners. Notes: 4055 HIV-1 Exposure Among Clients of Prostitutes JOYCE I. WALLACE*, J. MANN*, and S. BEATRICE**, *Foundation for Research on Sexually Transmitted Diseases, NY, NY, and **New York City Department of Health, NY, NY Prostitutes are thought to spread HIV-1 in the heterosexual community. In order to see if this is the case, we examined 373 men who used the services of female prostitutes in the past ten years. Men volunteered after seeing an advertisement in a New York City weekly newspaper, seeing the ad at their union headquarters, hearing about the study on TV and radio, or by referral from various hotlines. Men who admitted to drug use or sex with other men were tested, but their results were eliminated from the study. Of 340 men who were included in the study, the average age was 33, with an average of 15 years of education. The average total number of sexual exposures to prostitutes was 94, with a median of 23. The most common sexual practice was fellatio. The average number of STD's was one. Condom use was reported for only 32% of these exposures, and they were never used by 45% of the men. Of the 340 subjects, 6 tested positive for anti-HIV-1 antibodies by ELISA and Western Blot. Upon later requestioning, 3 of these men admitted other risk behavior. The 3 remaining infected men continuously denied other risk behavior and were still positive on retesting. These three men averaged 575 sexual exposures to prostitutes, 2 STD's, and none had used condoms. 4056 HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV IN STABLE PARTNERS OF HIV AB POSITIVE SUBJECTS. P.Costigliola, E.Ricchi, G.Marinacci, F.Chiodo. Istituto Malattie Infettive - UniversitA Bologna, Objective. To assess prevalence and incidence of HIV heterosexual transmission in stable partners of HIV infected people. Methods. We examined 147 heterosexual stable partners (44 males and 103 females, i.v. drug use and other risk factors excluded) of HIV Ab positive subjects. 33 HIV Ab ne gative partners are followed every six months for a minimal period of 12 months (max 24). HIV serology was carried out by ELISA (WB confirmed if positive). A sample of 58 partners were interviewed about sexual habits,e.g. \"safe-sex\" and sexual intercourse behavior. Results. 26 partners were found HIV Ab positive at first examination and during the follow-up period 5/33 underwent HIV serun-convertions. first examination follow-up # HIV+ # HIV+ males 44 7 15.9% 8 - females 103 19 18.4% 25 5 Total 147 26 17.6% 33 5 15.1% Conclusion. The heterosexual partners of HIV Ab positi ve patients represent one \"emerging\" at risk population in the history of HIV infection. Frequency and typeof sexual relation (e.g. receptive anal and vanigal intercourses) seems to be the most important factor in sexual contagion of HIV. Serun-convertions are due to incostant use Cbjecit. T determine the potntial for te heerosexual transmission of HIV infecticn, includirg any AIDS risk facta s) of 124 patients with AIDS or ARC.

Sero(-) HP used barrier onxtra~ptives significantly often than those who were sero(+) (05), but 52% of HP who did nrt use them remained sero(-). Qnclusin. Male and female regular HP of pts with AIDS are at substantial risk for HIV infection and related disease. Anal interoarse is a major ris factor, but is not sential. Barrier cntrarpties seem to offer sme protecticn. The data is Eonsistent with a heterogseity anong individals for HIV transnissibility or siEptibility. 4058 TRANSMISSION OF HIV TO HETEROSEXUAL PARTNERS OF INFECTED MEN AND WOMEN. AM Johnson, A Petherick, S Davidson, L Howard, L Osborne, C Sonnex, R Robertson, S Tchamouroff, M Hooker, K McLean, R Brettle, MW Adler, MRC Epidemiology Coordinating Centre on AIDS, Middlesex Hospital, London, City Clinic and Drug Addiction Study, Edinburgh. Qbjective To measure the frequency and risk factors for transmission of HIV to heterosexual partners of infected individuals. Method Heterosexual partners of HIV seropositive (+ve) index cases are recruited, interviewed, tested for HIV antibody and followed up every 6 months. Interview includes details of other risk factors, sexual practices, contraception use etc. Results Risk factors in 40 male index cases were IVDU (52%), bisexual (32%), others (16%). 20% of index cases CDC stage IV HIV disease, 80% asymptomatic infection. 10/41 of their female partners without other risks for HIV. infection were HIV +ve. Mean length of relationship was 34.6 months (range 1-120). HIV +ves did not differ significantly from HIV -ves in length of relationship or frequency of vaginal intercourse. 3/10 HIV +ve women and 5/31 HIV -ve wcren intercourse (p=.92 NS). Two HIV +ve women seroconverted after one reported act of unprotected intercourse. 1/8 male partners of 8 index IVDU HIV +ve females was seropositive. Conclusion Transmission rates in this multicentre UK study are comparable with studies in USA. No clear pattern of time dependent or behavioural risk for transmission has emerged. Infectivity of the index case may be more important in determining transmission. Notes: 4059 MARRIED COUPLES IN ZAIRE WITH DISCORDANT HIV SEROLOGY. Nzila*, R Ryder*/**, Kinshasa, Zaire, **CDC, Atlanta, ***NIH, Bethesda. Objective. To quantity and evaluate the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in married couples. Methods. Group I consisted of 100 consecutive married couples in which one member presented at Mama Yemo Hospital with AIDS. Group II consisted of 157 (5%) of the 3162 healthy married couples at a large Kinshasa textile factory in which at least one partner was HIV(+). Results. Couple Rubrics by (2 times/wk), ejaculations/ seance (2), condom use (2% ever used), and history of STD were similar in all 3 couple rubrics. Conclusion. The high rate of HIV discordance in healthy sexually active couples practicing unprotected vaginal sex suggests a low heterosexual infectivity rate. AIDS in an HIV(+) partner was the most frequently identified risk factor for transmission in discordant couples. Extramarital sex (males) and premarital sex (females) may play an important role in heterosexually acquired HIV infection in Africa. V4060 SEROPREVALENCE AND RISKS OF HIV INFECTIONS IN SPOUSES OF PERSONS INFECTED WITH HIV. Margaret Fischl, T Fayne, S Flanagan, M Ledan, R Stevens, M Fletcher, L LaVoie, E Trapido, Miami, U.S.A. Objectives. To determine the seroprevalence of HIV infection among spouses of persons infected with HIV and to identify risk factors associated with transmission. Methods. Spouses of persons (index cases) with a broad spectrum of HIV infection were enrolled. Spouses with risk factors for HIV were excluded. Couples were examined, interviewed, and tested for HIV and other STDs. Results. 184 subjects have been enrolled, representing 92 couples. 24% had antibody to HIV at entry. Antibody correlated directly with stage of disease in the index case. Index case: Asymptomatic LAS ARC AIDS Seropositive Spouses (%) 13% 33% Antibody also correlated with presence in the index case (HIV+, 42%; HIV-, 21%). difference between male (26% HIV+) and female (21% HIV+) spouses was noted. Risk infection also correlated with genital herpes (P<0.001), gonorrhea (P<0.01), and GYN surgery (P<0.02). No correlation was noted with the number of contacts, surrogate markers for possible trauma or blood exposure during sexual contact, or type of sexual activity. Antibody correlated inversely with circumcision (P<0.04, OR=9.6) and condom use (P<0.04,OR=3.0), especially use of condoms all the time in the preceding year(P<0.01,OR=9.5). Discussion. Risk of the heterosexual acquisition of HIV appears to be relatively equal for men and women in a monogamous relationship and increases with advancing disease and development of p24 antigen in the index case. Other STDs or integrity of epithial membranes may be an important co-factor for transmission. Consistent use of condoms may decrease the risk of transmission. 274 [Page 275](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/273) 4061 INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS FOR FEMALE TO MALE TRANSMISSION OF HIV DW Cameron*,**,***, LJ Institute,****Nairobi City Commission, Nairobi; *****Institute for Tropical Medicine, Antwerp Objective. To detect incidence of HIV transmission and cofactors in men with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Methods. Of 429 men with STDs acquired from a prostitute cohort with 85% HIV prevalence, 370 seronegative men were regularly followed-up to mean 11*SD 15 (range 0-82) weeks from prostitute contact. Results. Beyond 2 weeks, 23/291 (7.9%) men seroconverted (SC) at 9~8 (2-31) weeks. 130 men with prostitute contact and none in follow-up, 7/100 (7%) SC at 4.711.7 (2.6-6.9) The incidence of female to male transmission of HIV after a single sexual exposure was 8%. UC may increase susceptibility of men to HIV. GUD may increase infectivity of women. Control of GUD could reduce HIV transmission. 4062 ANOMALIES OF INFECTIVITY IN THE HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV Nancy Padian*, J Wiley*, S Glass*, L Marquis*, W Winkelstein* *University of California, Berkeley Objective. To examine apparent anomalies in the transmission of HIV. Methods. We selected female partners if infected men who had become infected with HIV after fewer than 100 exposures (median=20, N=7) and female partners of infected men who remained uninfected after 1000 or more sexual contacts (median=1354, N=15). In addition, we examined an efficient transmitter who has infected four out of five of his female partners. Results. None of the women who became infected after a few contacts ever used condoms, whereas more than half of the high risk seronegative women reported condom use with their infected partner. The infected women reported more sexually transmitted diseases (mean=3.2) than the high risk seronegatives (mean=0.8), although their rate was not higher than that of the whole sample. There were no differences in the rate of anal intercourse or disease progression in the male partners. The efficient male transmitter remained seropositive, asymptomatic and antigen negative even after he infected his female partners. None of his four infected female partners transmitted HIV to their new male partners despite numerous unprotected contacts. Conclusion. Although the sample is small, there is clear evidence that some people can transmit or acquire HIV with only a few contacts and that for others transmission is difficult to impossible despite repeated contacts. It needs to be determined whether this is peculiar to our sample or relevant to the population at large. Notes: 4063 THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV INFECTION IN ACTIVE DUTY ARMY WOMEN Janice R. Bunin, J McNeil, P Renzullo, J Brundage. Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington DC Objective. To describe risk factors for HIV infection in active duty Army women. Methods. Since the Department of Defense began screening all active duty Army personnel for HIV in 1985, 54 of 79,023 female soldiers (0.68/1000) have tested positive for HIV-Ab. All HIV-Ab positive women are eligible to participate in an anonymous case-control study designed to investigate risk factors for HIV infection. HIV negative controls are randomly selected and matched to cases on age, ethnicity, length of service, rank and geographic location. Controls must have tested negative for HIV-Ab no earlier than 6 months before or any time after their matched case tested positive. Volunteers participate in a confidential survey of medical history, drug use, sexual behaviors, contraceptive use and other behaviors associated with HIV infection. Interviewers are blinded to subject HIV-Ab status. Results. HIV prevalence in Army women is approximately half that in Army men. Demographically, cases are significantly more likely to be black, married and of enlisted rank than uninfected women. Preliminary study results will be presented. Conclusion. Active duty Army women are a unique female population, in which traditional groups at high risk for HIV infection such as prostitutes and IV drug users are probably underrepresented. Study results will further clarify the relative importance of heterosexual transmission of HIV infection in this population. A40 4 CANADIAN COLLABORATIVE STUDY OF WOMEN ATTENDING SEXUALLY 2,3,4,8 Provincial STD Control: Edmonton, Alta., Ont.; 5Cadham Prov. Labs., Winnipeg, Man.; 67 Dept. of Public Health, Toronto, Ont. Objective: to determine prevalence of HIV infection and behavioural risk factors in female STD clinic clientele. Methods: Systematic sampling procedures were used to recruit an unbiased sample in a cross-sectional study. Informed consent was obtained and anonymiity of serology and risk factor information was guaranteed. Counselling was a fundamental component of the study. Results: Preliminary results from four of the six clinics are presented. As of Jan. 1, 1988, 707 women had been enrolled into the study (70% response rate). Study participants did not differ from clinic populations on demographic or risk factor variables. One woman (0.14%; 95% C.I. = 0% -0.42%) was HIV antibody positive. Prevalences of behavioural variables were: history of IV drug use (12%); previous STD (80%); sex partners in past 12 months (median 7, range: 0-300); use of condoms (64%), with only 4% reporting consistent use with both steady and occasional partners. 68% reported intent to change their sexual behaviour because of AIDS. Conclusions: Prevalence studies must be designed to measure nonparticipation and assess its impact on generalizability. Although HIV infection is uncommon among female STD clinic patients, behavioural risk factors are prevalent and must be used to target education needs. 275 [Page 276](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/274) 4065 WOMEN WITH AIDS: A Continuing Study 1987 Kloser, P., Grigoriu, A., Kapila, R. Department of Infectious Diseases University of Medicine and Dentistry at Newark Newark, New Jersey Objective. To describe the epidemiology and natural history of HIV infection in women in Newark, New Jersey. Methods. To date we have seen 354 women meeting CDC criteria groups II through IV. From 1980-1985 we saw 53 women with HIV infection and in 1986 we described 132. In 1987 we now describe 169 women with HIV infection. Results. The women represent the population of the area surrounding the hospital with 154 (91%) Black, 8(5%) White, 7(4%) Hispanic. Most of the women 107(63.7%) were 30-39 with the age range 16-77. Of the women, 106 (62.7%) were IVDA, 26(15.3%) heterosexual exposure to IVDA and 37(21.8%) unknown risk. The most common opportunistic infection remains pneumocystis There were 10 pregnancies, 6 carried to term, 2 premature deliveries, and 2 first trimester miscarriages. There was 1 premature delivery complicated with bleeding and 2 cases of endometritis post-partum. Gynecologic There were 20 deaths in 1987 due to AIDS with an average of 14.5 weeks from diagnosis to death. Conclusion. The number of women with HIV related disease continues to grow alarmingly. We need to continue to study the natural history of this disease in women including gynecologic and obstetrical complications. 4066 HIV INFECTION IN WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES Craig N. Shapiro*, S Schulz*, N Lee*, and the HIV Data Analysis Team*,** *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA **National Institute of Drug Abuse, Washington, DC, USA Objective. To review and compile available data characterizing the prevalence of HIV infection among various populations of U.S. women. Methods. We compiled HIV seroprevalence rates using nationwide data from female blood donors and military recruits. We also reviewed all seroprevalence information published in journals and conference proceedings. During October-November 1987, we asked State and local health departments, medical centers, and medical schools to provide information from any seroprevalence studies on women conducted in their areas. Results. Studies which have not targeted women at high risk for HIV infection have found seroprevalence rates ranging from 0.0 to 2.6%. Studies conducted in urban, inner city areas, and in the northeastern U.S. have reported the highest rates, whereas studies outside of these areas have usually yielded rates less than 0.5%. This geographic variation is consistently observed, regardless of study population. Moreover, the seroprevalence rates generally parallel the incidence rates of AIDS cases among women in a given geographic region. Unfortunately, only limited data are available providing age- and race-specific seroprevalence rates. Conclusion. Studies of HIV seroprevalence in U.S. women should be substantially expanded. This information is useful in predicting future trends in the AIDS epidemic, in monitoring heterosexual and perinatal transmission of HIV, and in targeting education and prevention efforts. Notes: 4067 SEROPREVALENCE OF HIV ANTIBODY IN A SEXUALLY ACTIVE HETEROSEXUAL POPULATION. Margaret Fischl. E Trapido, R Stevens, T Fayne S Flanagan, L Resnick, L LaVoie. Miami, Florida, U.S.A. Objectives. To determine the seroprevalence of antibody to HIV among sexually active persons. Methods. Consecutive persons visiting 15 health and STD centers located throughout Miami and students from several college campuses were approached. Persons who were sexually active or had a history of an STD were recruited. Persons who had a risk factor for HIV or who were prostitutes were excluded. Participants were examined, interviewed, and tested for HIV and STDs. Results. A total of 1000 persons will be enrolled. Todate, 346 persons have been screened. Of those eligible, 77% were men and 23% were women. Age distribution in and 12%, other. The mean number of sexual partners in the past 5 years was 14.9 and 6.3 in the preceding year. 40% reported sexual contact with prostitutes. 76% had a regular sexual partner. 11% used condoms in the preceding year. 73% never used condoms. 98% had antibody 5% were seropositive to HIV by ELISA and Western blot. Discussion. The initial population screened represents individuals predominantly from an inner city population. Todate, 5% of persons tested were seropositive for HIV. The only potential risk factor identified was multiple sexual partners. These preliminary data point out that heterosexual transmission of HIV is already occurring at least in a sexually active inner city population, reporting a high incidence of AIDS. 4068 Analysis of transmission rates in heterosexual transmitted HIV infection S. Staszewski. Helm, W. Stille,A. Medicine, Frankfurt University Clinics, *Paul-Ehrlich Instit., Frankfurt, **Center of Hygiene, Frankfurt University Clinics Between Jan., 1985 and Dec.,1987, the number of heterosexually infected women, seen in our AIDS outpatient clinic, increased from 4 to 44. During the same time, the number of heterosexually infected men increased from 2 to 22. 86% of the women were infected by their steady sexual partners. In comparison, 91% of infected men were promisuous. 52% got infected in endemic countries (Africa-Haiti). When examining 143 stable heterosexual relationships in which at least 1 partner was infected, we found the following transmission rates: 27(40%) of 68 female partners of HIV-infected men and 12(32%) of 38 male partners of HIV-infected women were seropositive. We found a significant difference in transmission rates in a comparison of persons having monogamous relationships with infected partners, and persons having additional multiple sexual contacts with members of risk groups (besides a relationship to an infected person). In monogamous relationships, transmission rates amounted to 33% from man to woman, and 9% from woman to man. In contrast 67% of male, and 88% of female persons with frequent contacts to members of risk groups were found infected. Median length of relationship to the time of infection was 23 month in the couples with heterosexual transmission, and 39 month in couples with no transmission up to now. Persons having infected their partners had less CD4 lymphocytes (median 128) at the time of first examination than persons not having infected their partners (median 378). Conclusion: This means that infection rates significantly correlate with the number of sexual partners from risk groups. A correlation between length of relationship and frequency of sexual contacts could not be stated. We suspect that immunodeficiency develops faster in those people having infected their partners than in those people not having infected their partners up to now. 276 [Page 277](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/275) 4069 Department Dermatology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping, Sweden Objective.

There is a low incidence of HIV-infection in this material compared to big cities as Stockholm and Copenhagen. However, the material is small and more need to be tested to evaluate this further. The number of partners and the use of safe sex in this material will be compared to materials from big cities. In the cohort of 45 patient one was HIV-positive at the beginning of the study. No one has converted to HIV-positive during the study. 4070 COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION TO REDUCE HIGH-RISK PATTERNS AMONG GAY MEN: OUTCOME EVALUATION Jeffrey A. Kelly, J. S. St. Lawrence, H. V. Hood, & T. L. Brasfield, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson Objective: Some gay men, especially in low AIDS prevalence areas, have not yet meaningfully reduced risky behavior. This project experimentally evaluated a 12 -session community-based AIDS prevention group program for men who engage in high-risk conduct. Methods: 105 gay men reporting frequent high-risk behavior (unprotected intercourse with multiple partners) were recruited. Following individual assessments including 4-week risk behavior self-monitoring, measurement of risk behavior over the past 4 months, tests of AIDS risk knowledge, and role plays to assess skill handling high-risk sexual coercions, subjects were randomly divided into experimental and waiting list control groups. Experimental subjects attended 12 weekly group sessions that covered risk education and training in self-management, assertiveness, steady relationship development, and health consciousness. All subjects were reassessed after the experimental program and before control subjects received it. Results: Results showed substantial (all p<.05) reductions for experimental subjects compared to control members in high-risk practices, increased risk knowledge, and greater sexual assertion skill during role plays. Change was maintained at 6-month followup. Concordance of change among multiple risk measures (self-monitoring, self-report, knowledge and behavioral skill) was especially significant. Conclusion: Persons may be effectively assisted in risk reduction through community behavioral group intervention. Notes: 4071 FROM PARIS MIDDLE CLASSES TO SMALL TOWNS AND BLUE COLLAR WORKERS: SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS OF AIDS EPIDEMIC AMONG FRENCH To descibe the sociodemographic trends (age, profession, residence) of the AIDS epidemic among French homosexual men, still the most important AIDS case group (66%). Methods: Indepth analysis of the national surveillance data for four time intervals (cases diagnosed up to July 1984, and then yearly from August 1984 to July 1987). Results: As compared to the general male population, we observed a persistent over-representation of Paris City and of the higher middle class (professionals), and an under-representation of the blue collar. Significant trends from 1984 to 1987 are: -Paris City and foreigners decrease, Paris suburbs and middle size towns (20,000 - 100,000 inhabitants) remain stable, while small and big provincial towns (< 20,000; 2100,000) increase (p<0,001); -age disrtibution remains stable; -higher middle class (professionals) decrease, blue collar and unemployed increase, other social classes remain stable (p<0,05). Conclusion: These trends in AIDS surveillance data reveal the social diffusion of HIV by homosexual contact with several years of delay. The increasing incidence of AIDS in small towns and among lower social srata should prompt prevention campaigns adapted to these people. IU72 CHANGES IN AIDS-RELATED HIGH RISK BEHAVIOR AMONG HETEROSEXUAL MEN J. Guydish and T. Coates University of California, San Francisco, CA Objective. Investigation of AIDS-related high risk sexual behavior in heterosexual men, with descriptive and predictive components. Describe changes in heterosexuals compared to gay and bisexual groups. Methods. The San Francisco Men's Health Study is a longitudinal prospective investigation of behavior, psychosocial, and health status variables in a cohort of 1,034 men. Single men ages 25-54 were selected from a high incidence area for AIDS using cluster and random sampling procedures, and evaluated with repeated measures at 6 month intervals. Participants were gay (n=661), bisexual (n=169), and heterosexual (n=204). Self reported sexual behavior was analyzed to assess risk reduction across time and orientation groups. Results. Risk reduction was less among heterosexuals than in either the bisexual or gay groups, but heterosexuals demonstrated significant behavior change over time: (1) a decrease in the mean number of sexual partners (1985=2.84, 1987=1.7, t=2.2, p=.05); (2) a decrease in the number of partners with whom they had vaginal intercourse with ejaculation (1085=2.24, 1987=1.6, t=2.86, p=.01); (3) a decrease (nonsignificant trends) in the number of vaginal and anal intercourse partners. A multivariate model to predict risk reduction will be developed using age, education, ethnicity, social support, and relationship status. Conclusion. Within this sample, who are sensitive to AIDS-related issues for geographic and study participation reasons, sexual risk behavior decreased significantly over time. 277 [Page 278](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/276) 4073 EFFECT OF KNOWLEDGE OF HIV STATUS UPON SEXUAL ACTIVITY AMONG HOMOSEXUAL MEN, Stefan Wiktor, R Biggar, M Melbye, P Ebbesen, J Goedert, NCI, Bethesda MD, *Inst. Canc. Res. Aarhus,Denmark Objective. To study the effect that knowledge of HIV status has on the sexual behavior of homosexual men. Methods. In 1987, we questioned 135 homosexual men in our prospective cohort regarding their sexual practices and knowledge of their HIV status over the previous 12 months Results. 61 men knew they were HIV+, 52 knew they were HIV- and 22 did not know their status. 64% of men participated in rectal intercourse. No difference by knowledge of HIV status were observed in the proportion engaging in rectal intercourse, in the median number of sex partners, or in the proportion who were sexually active. 25% of the HIV+ men performed unprotected insertive anal intercourse, and 26% of the HIVexperienced unprotected receptive anal intercourse. One of the HIV seroconverters \"always\" used a condom during the time he seroconverted. 84% of all rectal sex acts were with partners of unknown status,and only 23% of the men always asked about their potential partner's HIV status; however, when they did ask, both HIV+ and HIVmen were less likely to choose a partner of opposite HIV status (p<.005). Similar data will be presented on 130 homosexual men from Denmark. Conclusion. Knowledge of HIV status without knowledge of partner's status had little effect upon continuing risky sexual activity; however, men were unlikely to knowingly have intercourse with a partner of opposite HIV status. As intercourse continues for most men and condoms provide incomplete protection, inquiring about the HIV status of partners may reduce the risk of new infections. 4074 DETERNIMANTS OF HIGH gISK BEHAVIOR AI RECIDIVISM N GAY MEN. Jill G. Joseph,,,B Montgomery, RC Kessler, DG Ostrow, CB Wortmen; University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; University of Illinois, Champagne, IL. Objective: To describe personal characteristics or environmental circumstances which predict continuous highest risk sexual behavior or its resumption. Methods: Data were obtained semiannual ly from 1,103 gay men describing receptive sexual behaviors and a wide range of psychosocial factors across a period of three years. Behavioral data were validated by use of seroconversion data. Psychometric properties of all multi-itemidices were investigated. Multivariate regression analysis was used to describe the relationship of psychosocial factors to the continuation of highest risk sexual behavior or its resumption. Results: Approximately 12% of the cohort were at consistently highest risk, with another 25-35% resuming it at least once during the observation period. Particular coping strategies, psychological distress, and the absence of supportive norms predict high risk behaviors. Further, those who were younger, non-white, and less educated were at greater risk, Discussion: Educational and behavioral intervention need to incorporate components targeted to known determinants of high risk behavior. The special needs of particular socioeconomic subgroups should be considered carefully. Notes: 4075 COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES NETWORK MAINTAINING REDUCED-RISK FOR IN GAY MEN. David J. Martin, Harbor-UCLA Torrance, CA, USA AS A METHOD FOR HIV INFECTION Medical Center, Objective. Recently a gay community center began an innovative AIDS program that provides risk-reduction information in the context of alternative nonsexual social activities. The purpose of the program is to increase social support for non-sexual socializing and reducedrisk sexual behavior, to provide nonsexual alternatives to high-risk sexual activities, to provide alternatives to bars and other settings conducive to high-risk sexual activities, and to guild individual feelings of competence in negotiating and engaging in safer sex practices. Methods. The program consists of a Health and Social Activities Referral Network, a lecture and seminar series on various topics of interest to the community, and Video Night on Saturdays as an alternative weekend evening activitiy. Program announcements, lecture and seminar outlines, and applications forms all include continued AIDS risk-reduction information embedded in the program material, insuring continued exposure to this information. In addition, all seminars and lectures include a component of AIDS risk-reduction information in their presentation. Results. Participants in the Video Night program reported that they were attending instead of visiting bars. A stable group forms a corps of attendees, with overall attendance increasing over time. Conclusions. The provision of alternative non-sexual social and recreational opportunities may form the basis for maintenance of reduced risk among gay men. 4076 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT AIDS RISK AND ACTUAL RISK BEHAVIOUR IN A SAMPLE OF HOMOSEXUAL MEN Miller Mx, Goldberg Dxx, Wright Rx, Ogg Dx x Scottish Aids Monitor, xx Communicable Diseases (Scotland) Unit Objective. To assess knowledge of risk activity and resultant sexual behaviour in a group of homosexual men from Glasgow and the West of Scotland. Methods. A questionnaire survey was carried out by 20 volunteer workers from Scottish Aids Monitor. Approximately 500 homosexual men visiting 6 gay bars and 2 discos in Glasgow over 2 nights (August 1987) were asked to anonymously complete a questionnaire enquiring about sexual activity. Four hundred and twenty agreed to take part and were considered to be a representative sample of homosexual men from Glasgow and the West of Scotland. Results. Significant results revealed a high knowledge of risk of infection through unprotected anal intercourse with only 16/346 (4.6%) considering this activity to be safe or possibly safe. However a substantial minority 51/262 (19.5%) had had unprotected anal intercourse in the preceding 6 months. Of this group similarly only 4% considered the activity to be safe or possibly safe. Conclusion. In spite of a high level of knowledge about risk activity, a significant minority of homosexual men continue to practice unsafe sex. 278 [Page 279](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/277) 4077 GAY MALE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR CHANGE IN A LOW-INCIDENCE AREA FOR AIDS, Carolyn Beeker*, H Howe*, M Zielinski* *New York State Health Department, Albany NY Objective. To measure HIV seroprevalence and sexual behavior change over a 4-year period in gay/bisexual volunteers from a low-incidence area for AIDS. Methods. In personal interviews with 363 men, ages 18-72, baseline data were collected on specific sexual practices, partner totals and settings for sex for the year prior to AIDS and the 12-month period before study enrollment. Results. Measured as median number of sexual partners, domestic sexual activity remained constant while extradomestic sex declined by 60 percent since learning about AIDS. The proportion of men abstaining dromarely engaging in anal intercourse increased from 52 to 65 percent. Despite agreement that unprotected anal sex is highly risky and that condoms substantially reduce exposure risk, only 17 percent of those reporting anal sex used condoms regularly. Baseline seroprevalence among cohort members was 14 percent. Conclusion. Despite their proximity to an AIDS epicenter (New York City), a substantial proportion of these low-incidence area men report unprotected anal intercourse. Interventions must be targeted to areas where perceived risk for infection is low and sexually active persons are slow to adopt health-protective sexual innovations. 4078 The AIDS Community Demonstration Projects: Multi-City Prevention Research Kevin R. O'Reilly Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA., USA Objective: To develop and evaluate interventions to decrease the frequency of risk-taking behavior and the incidence of HIV infection in communities. Methods: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has funded six AIDS Community Demonstration Projects in seven sites across the United States. These are flexible, community-based laboratories which conduct research on prevention of HIV infection through changing behavior. Interventions aimed at the community and the individual have been devised to modify risk-taking behavior. Although all projects have expanded to include all locally relevant risk groups, comprehensive data is as yet available only on gay men. While the interventions for homosexual men vary between sites, the provision of HIV antibody testing and counseling and the evaluation of activities is standard: cohorts of up to 1200 men per site are being recruited and followed every six months to monitor changes in seroprevalence, AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and sexual and drug-taking behavior. Evaluation of interventions by comparing sites is therefore possible. Results: Data for gay men indicate continuing reductions in numbers of sexual partners and dramatic declines in the prevalence of receptive anal intercourse (average reduction 74%). However, changes are not complete nor maintained uniformly. Changes in knowledge, attitudes and beliefs that may be determinants of those behaviors are also documented in all sites. Conclusions: While gay men have changed behavior, more change and consistency are needed. Various methods to achieve these goals are being evaluated. Notes: 4079 SUBSTANCE USE AND SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AMONG GAY/ BISEXUAL MEN AT AN ALTERNATIVE TEST SITE Nancy H. Corby*, F. Rhodes**, R. Wolitski**, *Department of Public Health, Long Beach, CA, USA **Psychology Department, California State University, Long Beach, CA, USA Objective. To examine the relationship between alcohol/ drug use and sexual behaviors, including condom use, among gay/bisexual men at an Alternative Test Site. Methods. Questionnaires regarding alcohol/drug use, smoking and sexual activity were completed by 1,259 gay/ bisexual first-time clients presenting for HIV-antibody testing. Results. Significant relationships between alcohol/drug use and sexual behavior were present. Drug use was related to: number of sex partners (e<.0001), receptive anal/oral contact (e<.001), and oral sex (p<.05). Average number of drinks per day was associated with: number of sex partners (R<.002), receptive anal/oral contact (a<.02), and oral sex (e<.0001). Those men reporting no drug or alcohol use were less likely to have engaged in anal receptive intercourse during the past year (e<.0001). Smokers were less likely to use condoms during either insertive or receptive anal intercourse (g<.05). Amphetamine (e<.05) and alcohol consumption were also related to lack of condom use during insertive anal intercourse. Serostatus was related to smoking and drug use during the past year (p<.01). Conclusion. The relationship between alcohol/drug use and sexual behavior suggests a need to address substance abuse issues as part of risk-reduction programs. Smoking may be influenced by mediating variables such as inattention to health-related messages, that foster increased seropositivity. 4080 INTRAVENOUS DRUG USE, THE CO;BINATION OF DRUGS AND SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND HIV INFECTION AMONG GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN: THE SAN FRANCISCO MEN'S HEALTH STUDY R. Stall* and D.G. Ostrow** *Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, San Francisco **AIDS Psychobiology Program, Ann Arbor Objective. To describe the social characteristics, prevalence of HIV antibody; and prevalence of risky behaviors amounq four groups of gay men given to different patterns of combining drug use with sexual behavior. Methods. Data are drawn from the San Francisco Men's Health Study, a longitudinal study of a cohort of single men aged 25-54 who live in the 19 census:tracts of San Francisco where AIDS has been most incident. Measures of sexual behavior, drug use patterns and the combination of drug use with sexual activity are all based on self-report data. Results. Age cohort, educational status and early history of homosexual behavior signifiantly differented oroups of gay men with different histories of drug use and drug use in combination with sexual behavior. Gay men who used needles and combined druas with sex are highly likely to have HIV antibody, seroconversion over time appears to be related to combining drug use with sexual activity. Gay needle users manifested a high rate of decline in risky sexual behaviors over a six-month follow-up period. As needle use is rare among this cohort of gay men, it seems that the group from which HIV infection is most likely to spread are those men who combine drugs with sex but who do not use needles. Conclusion. Gay IVDU's can be motivated to modify high risk behaviors, making prevention of HIV exposure both within and outside of this group possible. 279 [Page 280](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/278) O4 81 ANONYMOUS PARTICIPATION IN A LONGITUDINAL S COHORT STUDY OF GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN. Robert Wood, John Leonard, Leigh Krueger; Seattle-King County Department of Public Health, Seattle, Washington, USA Objective. To offer the option of anonymous participation to gay and bisexual men in a 4-yr. study of attitudes, behavior, and HIV status. We sought to develop a system that protects participants' anonymity without adversely affecting the return rate for 6-month follow up interviews or the efficiency and accuracy of data collection. Method. The system included the following components: l)an anonymous record keeping system based on a 7-letter code constructed by the enrollee; 2)the \"Be a Star\" system of assigning a common identifier to all anonymous enrollees in a given month and repeating this identifier at 6-month intervals (the names of 6 celebrities were chosen as identifiers); 3)a targeted multimedia outreach campaigr. promoting enrollment and prompting return of anonymous participants (e.g. the theme for June and December--Mae West months: \"Why Don't Ya Come Up and See Us Sometime?\"). Results. Of 388 men enrolled between Sept. 1986 and March 1987, 68% chose the anonymous option (N=127) over the confidential (N=261). After 1 year, no statistically significant difference was found in follow up return rate between confidential enrolless (who receive direct prompting via mail) and unprompted anonymous participants. Conclusion. Seattle-area gay and bisexual men clearly prefer anonymity to guarantees of confidentiality when providing information on their sexual behavior, attitudes, and HIV status. Protecting anonymity of subjects in this population does not adversely affect the conduct of longitudinal research and may make the study sample more representative of bisexual and \"closeted\" men. 4082 MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL CORRELATES OF HIV ANTIBODY TESTING IN A COHORT OF GAY MEN David G. Ostrow*, J Joseph*, J Soucey**, M Eller**, R Kessler*, J Chmiel*** *University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, **Howard Brown Memorial Clinic, ***Northwestern University, Chicago Objective. To assess the effects of learning HIV antibody (Ab) status among a cohort of homosexual men at risk for' AIDS. Methods. Of 500 men undergoing three semi-annual medical/ immunological evaluations as part of the Chicago MACS, 155 requested their HIV Ab results as of June, 1987. Detailed mental health and sexual behavior assessments were performed before and an average of 9 months after test disclosure; men receiving results (D groups) were contrasted with men of similar serostatus who did not receive their test results (ND groups). Results. All four groups of men (D+, D-, ND+, and ND-) showed reductions in HIV transmitting behaviors over the one-year study period. There were no differential effects of lelarning HIV Ab status on behavior in HIV+ or HIVmen. In contrast, men in the D+ group showed significant increases in depression, anxiety, and somaticization scores. D- men showed smaller decreases in anxiety and depression levels, but were indistinguishable from NDmen at 9 months after disclosure. Conclusion. The mental health effects of HIV antibody testing need to be considered in evaluating testing and counseling programs. While no beneficial behavioral effects of HIV Ab status disclosure were found in this study, longer follow-up is necessary to determine the potential long-term effects of HIV Ab testing on behavior and mental health of persons at risk for AIDS. Notes: 4083 A PSVCHO-SOCIAL DESCRIPTION OF SOME GAY MEN WITH A HIGH-RISK BEHRUIOR Annick Prieur, Dep. of Criminology, University of Oslo. Obj ctive To understand the reasons for continued highrisk behavior. Methods In-depth interviews with 63 gay men, most of whom were recruited in a gay bar in Oslo automn 1987. Their hiv-status was either negative or not tested. 17 were identified as having the most risky behavior at present (defined as anal intercourse without condom with at least two different partners last year, when none or only one of them had a valid test behind them). These are compared to the 46 who led a safer life. The proportion of risk-takers cannot be generalized to any population. But the differences between the two groups are so salient that we believe they have a more general value. Results The were no differences in level of information. But those with high-risk behavior are less frequently socially open homosexuals (188 to 465), as well as members of any gay organizat ion (41 to 61 ). Their loverelationships had been fewer, shorter and looser, but they had had a higher number of sexual contacts than the others (35X more than 1000 partners during life-time, compared to 75). Fewer were tested (41X had a test with any validity for the last year, compared to 801). Most of the interviewed had experienced anxiety, but the highrisk-takers dealt with it differently: just cut it off. But most important: most high-risk-takers had a loose social network, whithout close friends or lovers (35X satisfied with their social life, compared to 835). Keywords in interpreting the findings: the impact of social integration, comparition of gay identities (a social identity and a sexualized identity, typical for those coming-out or in closet) and how the emotional meaning of the sexual acts hinders safe-sex in a love-relationsship. Conclusion Any improvement of gay men's social situation will probably have AI DS-prevention as a side-effect! TRANSVESTITE AND MALE PROSTITUTES - A UNIQUE AIDS RISK GROUP? ZT Handzel*, Z Bentwich*, R Burstein*, Science, Rehovot; ***Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashcmer; Israel Objective. To examine the relation between receptive anal sexual activity, antibodies to HIV, CMV and EBV and imrnune impairments. Methods. Sera of 14 transvestite and male homosexual prostitutes, who reported practicing frequent passive anal intercourse, were screened by ELISA for antibodies to HIV and by indirect immiunofluorescence for antibodies to CMV and EBV. HIV seropositivity was confirmed by Western blotting. Six subjects reported using estrogen containing preparations. Results. Serum antibodies were detected to HIV in one, CMV in 13/14 and EBV in all subjects; the mean geometric titers for CMV (25.8) and EBV (86.6) were much higher than those from age-matched control populations. All T-lymphocyte values were within normal range and two individuals showed increased levels of serum circulating immune complexes. Conclusion. In this unique setting, frequent anal intercourse and exposure to CMV and EBV, as such, do not appear to be sufficient to cause iimune impairment or to predispose to HIV infection. The results may reflect the generally low prevalence of HIV infection in Israel, and cofactors, such as female hormones or \"protective\" sexual practices, could be operative in this AIDS risk group. 280 [Page 281](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/279) 4085 RISK FACTORS FOR HIV HOMOSEXUAL TRANSMISSION IN A SEROEPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEY IN J*. * General Directorate of Epidemiology. Ministry of Health, MEXICO * Centers for Disease Control, USA Objective. To relate sexual practices with risk of HIV infection in homosexual and bisexual men in Mexico City. Methods. A total of 573 men who participated in homosexual practices were included in this cross sectional -conventionalsurvey from November 1985 to August 1987. A confidential and anonymous interview was completed and a blood sample taken in those who voluntarily accepted to participate in the study; Results. Fifty-seven percent of the total sample had bisexual behavior. Only 1.5% were IV drug users. The prevalence of seropositivity over the whole period was 27%: 5% in 1985, 25% in 1986 and 31% in 1987. A stable heterosexual union had a protective effect OR=0.28 (95% CL=0.15, 0.49; p<0.01) however in married individuals the prevalence was 24%. Practices associated significantly with risk of HIV infection are: BDIE O S RATIO 95% C.L. SIGNIFICANCE p< 0.01 Casual sex met in gay bars 2.29 1.39, 3.79 p< 0.01 Homosexual contacts with foreigners (USA citizens) 1.7 1.14, 2.52 p< 0.01 Conclusions. These findings about male bisexual prevalent practices show that there is a high risk for HIV transmission into the heterosexual population in Mexico. 4086 BEHAVIORS ASSOCIATED WITH INCIDENT HIV INFECTION AMONG HOMOSEXUAL MEN IN SAN FRANCISCO, 1984-1987. Ruth M Greenblatt*, D Osmond**, A Moss**, M Samuel***, Shabosky***, W Winkelstein***. *Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar, **San Francisco General Hospital, ***University of California at Berkeley Objective. To determine risk factors for HIV infection in sequential time periods, 1984-1987. Methods. 545 homosexual men recruited by probability sampling from an area of San Francisco where the AIDS epidemic had been most severe have been periodically examined since 1983. 37 have become infected by the HIV. They were divided equally by date of seroconversion into three time periods and compared to randomly selected seronegative study subjects in a \"nested\" case-control study. Previously identified risk factors were studied. Results. Numbers of male sexual partners and receptive anal intercourse were the only statistically significant practices associated with incidence of HIV infection. However, both practices declined substantially over the three time periods, odds ratios (ORs) 25 to 2 and 14 to 3, respectively. ORs for receptive oral intercourse increased over the three time periods, 2 to 5, but did not reach statistical significance. In San Francisco, the annual HIV seroconversion rate is currently about 2%. Conclusions. The established risk factors for HIV infection, numbers of sexual partners and receptive anal intercourse, continue to be the most important practices associated with HIV infection in the San Francisco homosexual population. However, as the overall incidence of infection declines to a very low level, the relative importance of other possible routes of infection such as receptive oral intercourse may become greater. Notes: 4087 INCIDENCE OF HIV INFECTION AND SEXUAL PRACTICES IN GAY MEN IN A LOW ENDEMIC AREA Christian Goilav, H Prinsen, P Piot. Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium. Objectives: To define the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection, and sexual behaviour in a cohort of gay men in a low endemic area for HIV infection. Materials and results: Of a total of 526 gay men screened for hepatitis B markers in Belgium in 1985, 314 were enrolled in a study on the efficacy of a recombinant hepatitis B vaccin. The overall prevalence rate for HIV antibody was 3.6 1 (19/526), whereas it was only 1.4 1 (5/369) among those lacking hepatitis B markers. The annual incidences of HIV infection are 0.7 1 (2/276) and 0 7. (0/156) during the first and second years of observation. The prevalence of a serological test for syphilis at enrollment was 3.2 1. Three (1.1 X) of the men developed serological evidence of syphilis in the first year of follow-up. The annual incidences of urethritis were 4.6, 11.6 and 6.2 1 for 1984, 1985 and 1986, respectively, whereas the annual incidences of pubic lice were 20.2, 24.0 and 33 1, in the respective years. Penirectal intercourse was a frequent form of sexual activity and its proportion did not change between 184 and 1986 (60 % in 1984 and 64 X in 1986 reported at least one episode per year). The mean number of partners per year was 14.4 and 12.2 for 1984 and 1986, respectively. The use of condoms is summarized in table I (7 users). 1984 1985 1986 never used 95 84 67 sometimes 4 10 18 always 1 6 15 Conclusions: Our data Indicate that HIV infection has been spreading very slowly in this population of gay men, that unsafe sexual practices are still common, but that condom use has drasticaly increased. Pubic lice may be a more sensitive indicator of sexual activity than syphilis or urethritis. 4088 AN EATING DISORDER DIAGNOSTIC SURVEY OF GAY MALE AIDS PATIENTS B. O'Brien, M.S., R.D.* and P. Fishman, Ed.D., R.D.** *St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center, New York City, **Hunter College, School of Health Sciences, Nutrition Program, CUNY, New York City, New York, USA Objective. To validate the observation that many members of the healthy gay male population maintain body weights below ideal standards. Weight loss due to chronic diarrhea and other gastrointestinal dysfunction requires reliance upon specific dietary supplements, such as Sustacal. However, low body weight in some cases may be correlated wiih one or more characteristics associated with eating disorders. Method. Data were gathered on pre/post dietary intakes using a modified Diagnostic Survey Eating Disorders (DSED) questionnaire. Results. None of the sample showed anorexic or bulemic behaviors. However, 10 of 12 gave positive responses on one or more variables which could predict overpreoccupation with weight and body image. Conclusion. Results of this study support the research question and indicate the need for further research in this area. A larger sample is needed to fully establish a connection between thinness and eating disorder characteristics in the gay male population. 281 [Page 282](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/280) 4089 PREVALENCE OF SERUM POSITIVITY FOR HIV IN PLASMA AND BLOOD DONORS Jose Luis Dominguez; Catalina Morales; Ma.

Burnet Clinical Research Unit, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, and AIDS Service, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia. Objective. To determine whether autonomic damage is an early event in HIV-infection. Methods. We studied 20 homosexual men with early HIV disease (group II) by a domprehensive battery of five single non-invasive tests. None of our patienteryd clinical symptoms or signs of autonomic or peripheral neuropathy, and non had glycosuria or laboratory indices of alcohol abuse. Results. Ewing and Clarke (Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 15:855-88) classify autonomic neuropathy into five categories, according to severity. On this classification 14 of our patients had normal tests, 3 had early autonomic involvement, 1 had definite involvement, and 2 had an atypical pattern of abnormal tests. These were signs of probable autonomic dysfunction in 6 patients (30%). Conclusion. The risks of autonomic neuropathy have been previously described in diabetes and in AIDS (Lancet 1987; ii:16-18). Although we do not know how long our patients have been infected none has symptoms or signs of HIV-related disease. Damage to the autonomic nervous system may occur early in HIV infection. Further studies will be presented to assess the natural history of autonomic dysfunction in this group, and to compare them with subjects with more advanced disease (group III, IVa) and seronegative homosexual volunteers. Notes: 4091 CLINICAL AND HEMATOLOGIC MARKERS OF EARLY HIV INFECTION Michael A. Polis, R Kaslow, R Fox, M Deloria, 3 Dudley, K MacDonell, D Lyter, S Su for the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, Bethesda, USA Objective. To determine clinical/hematologic markers of early HIV infection in homosexual men. Methods. Semiannually collected clinical data were available on 186 men (CV) whose ELISA (E) and immunoblot (I) were interpreted as changing from (-) to (+) in a 6 month period. Four persistently El- men (SN) were matched to each CV by city, visit number and closest visit day. Results. At the last El- visit (Vx) and first EI+ visit (Vy), the %SN OR 0 1 0.9 10 1 8.8*** Night sweats 5 2 2.3 10 2 7.1*** Lymphadenopathy 6 6 1.2 24 5 5.8*** Fatigue 8 7 1.1 13 5 2.6*** Headache 4 3 1.2 6 2 2.8** Lymphadenopathy (PE) 19 15 1.4 34 9 6.0*** Neutrophils < 2000 5 4 1.4 10 3 3.1*** CD4 < 400 4 2 1.7 7 2 3.5** CD8 > 900 20 13 1.7* 37 14 3.5*** Hemoglobin <15 gm% 34 26 1.4* 43 28 2.0*** 2 or more markers 41 *p = Odds Ratio, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel analysis) Conclusion. In addition to symptoms and signs previously reported with early EI+ HIV infection, low neutrophils and CD4, hemoglobin <15 gm%, and high CD8 may be seen just before or after the first detection of HIV antibody. Further, high CD8 and low hemoglobin may be markers for very early El- HIV infection in a high risk population. 4092 PREEXISTING IMMUNE IMPAIRMENTS IN MALE HOMOSEXUALS (MHS) - PREDISPOSING FACTORS FOR HIV INFECTION Z Bentwich, R Burstein, Y. Berner, ZT Handzel R. Ben Ari Institute of Clinical Immunology, Kaplan Hospital, Rehovot, Israel Background. We previously reported that immune impairments were present in 40% of a cohort of asymptomatic male homosexuals (MHS) in Israel, regardless of HIV antibody status (J Clin Immunol 7:376-380, 1987). Objective. To determine in MHS the role of these preexisting immune impairments on susceptibility to HIV infection. Methods. HIV serology and immune profiles were determined in a cohort of 154 MHS during 3-4 years of follow-up. Results. Persistence of lymphoid population impairments among seronegative and significantly more marked impairments among seropositive MHS. Seroconversion rate was found to be significantly correlated with preexisting lowered blood T-helper cell number - 5/21 vs. 8/133 (p = 0.009). Conclusion. The findings suggest that preexisting immune impairments in MHS may be caused by their sexual habits, contribute to their susceptibility to HIV infection and account for their being a high risk group for AIDS. 282 [Page 283](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/281) 4093 INCIDENCE OF AIDS IN HOMOSEXUAL MEN DEVELOPING HIV INFECTION J Phair, A Munoz, L Kingsley, R Fox, R Kaslow, B Visscher, L Jacobsen For the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), Chicago, Illinois, USA Objective. To describe progression to AIDS among individuals developing HIV infection while enrolled in a prospective study of men at risk. Methods. 227 men in the MACS developed HIV antibody (Western Blot confirmed) between 2 consecutive 6 mo. visits; the time of infection was defined as the midpoint between these 2 visits. Results. 9 cases of AIDS, 8 manifest by an 01, occurred by 12/31/87. The incidence rate by 6 month intervals in person mo. since infection is as follows: 0-6 mo 0/1326 = 70/10,000 Using the product time limit estimator of the distribution of AIDS-free time, 92.3% were free of AIDS at 3.0 years. Within 12 months of dete tion of antibody, median CD4 numbers fell from 1013/mmj (range 416-1877) to 319/mm (range 42-880). This decline over 12 mo. was significantly (p 0.001) faster than in 53 men known to have survived 36 o. AIDS-free, 1021/mm3 (range 542-2575) to 619/mm (range 178-1538). Conclusion. AIDS is unlikely to develop in the first year of infection and rapid progression to AIDS is associated with a marked fall in CD4 cell number. 4094 FURTHER STUDIES ON SEQUENTIAL SERUM SAMPLES FROM 34 HIV SEROPOSITIVE GAY MALES. Rjurik Golubjatnikov and John R. Pfister, State Laboratory of Hygiene, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA. Objectives and Methods. We performed Western Blot (BioRad), ELISA (Organon Teknika), and HIV antigen (Abbott) assays on sequential sera from 32 gay males to confirm our previouslyreported (1985) ELISA (Abbott) seroreversions, to characterize serologic events resulting from HIV infections, and to explore possible prognostic markers. The mean number of sera per subject was 13; serosurveillance ranged from 152 to 371 weeks. Results. Sera from 6 subjects were ELISA reactive on the first sample. The remaining 26 subjects sereoconverted with ELISA (SC-ELISA) during serosurveillance. All of the initial seroreactive samples had gpl60 bands on WB; other bands present, in order of diminishing frequency, were p24, gpl20, p55, p32, p65 and gp41. In 2 subjects, seroreversion (SR) was confirmed with a second ELISA and WB; however, SR did not result in AGA reactivity. Two additional subjects had transient reductions in ELISA and WB reactivity. Other previous Abbott SR-ELISA could not be confirmed due to inadequate sample volume or had p55 and p18 WB bands only and non-reactive ELISA. Two subjects died of AIDS; post SC-ELISA sera of these individuals had reduced p24 bands and persistent high B-2 microglobulin (f2M) and IgA levels. Apparently healthy HIV-infected subjects retained p24 bands over time, and had normal or infrequent raised IgA or 82M levels. Two subjects were AGA reactive prior to SC-ELISA, 3 had AGA reactivity pre-and post-SC-ELISA, and 6 had AGA reactivity only after SC-ELISA. The sera of the remaining 15 (57.7%) subjects were all AGA non-reactive. Conclusions. Studies with WB and a second ELISA confirm seroconversions in ELISA-reactive gay males. Our findings suggest that f2M, IgA, and WB p 24 band are useful prognostic markers in HIV infections. Notes: 4095 NATURAL HISTORY OF HIV INFECTION IN HOMOSEXUAL MEN WITH LYMPHADENOPATHY SYNDROME; RELATIONSHIP WITH T-HELPER CELL COUNT Jonathan E. Kaplan, T. Spira, D. Fishbein, P. Pinsky Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To determine the natural history of HIV infection in a group of homosexual men with HIV-associated lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS) in relation to T-helper cell count. Methods. Seventy-five.homosexual men with LAS, subsequently shown to be seropositive for HIV antibody, were enrolled in a prospective study in Atlanta in 1982-1983. At enrollment, and at 3- to 6-month follow-up visits, these men have undergone clinical and immunologic evaluation. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the 4-year cumulative incidence rates of AIDS after visits at which various levels of T-helper cell counts were first noted. Results. Twenty men had a T-helper cell count <200/mm recorded on at least 1 occasion. Thirty-two had at least 1 value between 200 and 299, 44 between 300 and 399, and 67 >400. In these 4 groups, respectively, the 1-year cumulative incidence rates for AIDS were 31%, 10%, 41%, 25%, and 18%. Conclusion. Cumulative incidence rates for AIDS can be related directly to the T-helper cell count, with a 4-year cumulative incidence reaching 84% for persons with T-helper cell counts <200/mm3. Such rates are important for estimating prognosis in the individual patient, as well as for determining suitable candidates for drug trials. 4096 THE NATURAL HISTORY OF HIV INFECTION IN A COHORT OF HOMOSEXUAL AND BISEXUAL MEN: A DECADE OF FOLLOW-UP. Nancy D *Dept. of Public Health, San Francisco, CA, and **Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA. Objective. To determine the natural history of HIV infection in a cohort of homosexual and bisexual men. Methods. We evaluated clinical manifestations of HIV infection in a 20% weighted random sample of 6,709 homosexual and bisexual men originally recruited between 1978-1980 for studies of hepatitis B. Using Kaplan-Meier methods, we analyzed cumulative risk of AIDS by duration of HIV infection in the random sample group and in men from the same cohort who participated in hepatitis B vaccine trials. Results. Of the 746 men in the random sample, 71 had known dates of seroconversion before AIDS follow-up studies began in Oct. 1983. These 71 men have been followed for a mean of 86 months since their estimated date of seroconversion: 30 (42%) developed AIDS with an average T4-helper cell count (T4) of 84 per mm3; 13 (19%) candidiasis leukoplakia alone and 8 (11%) were asymptomatic on last examination (T4=839). Combining data on these 71 men with 110 men from the vaccine trial with known seroconversion dates, we estimated 4% of the HIV-infected men in the cohort will develop AIDS after 36 months of infection, 9% after 48 months, 14% after 60 months, 22% after 72 months, 34% after 84 months, 38% after 96 months, and 42% after 108 months (95%c.i., 30-54%). Conclusion. The risks of AIDS and other clinical manifestations of HIV infection continues to increase as duration of infection increases. 283 [Page 284](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/282) 4097 RESISTANCE TO EFFECTS OF HIV INFECTION IN A SUBPOPULATION OF HOMOSEXUAL MEN MT Schechter, Michael Weaver, KJP Craib, B Willoughby, P Sestak, B Douglas, et al. The Vancouver Lymphadenopathy-AIDS Study, St Paul's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, CANADA Objective. To investigate resistance to the effects of HIV infection in a cohort of seropositive homosexual men. Methods. Symptoms, signs, and lab data were obtained from the most recent available visit occurring between 11/85 and 10/87 for all HIV+ men in our cohort. Men were stratified according to presence of generalized lymphadenopathy (GL), presence of any symptoms (fever, fatigue, arthralgia, SOB, diarrhea, sweats, cough, weight loss, thrush, zoster), and CD4 count<600. The goal was to determine the proportion of men demonstrating none of these findings. Results. A total of 342 seropositive subjects were eligible for the analysis (240 I IV+ at entry, 9G seroconverters). A total of 290 (85%) had follow-up data available as described in the table below. AIDS GL Sympt CD4<600 No (%) Duration (mos) YES 58 (20.0) NO YES 85 (29.3) 42.0 (3-56) NO YES YES NO 28 (9.7) 39.5 (8-56) NO NO YES NO 15 (5.2) 43.0(16-50) NO YES NO NO 61 (21.0) 39.0 (3-55) NO NO NO NO 43 (14.8) 43.0 (2-56) Conclusion. A total of 14.8% had no sequellae after a median 43 months of follow-up and another 21.0% had only GL. Thus, 36% show no serious sequellae thus far. Acknowledging that it is still early in the natural history, these subjects at least hold out the hope that some individuals nmight resist the effects of HIV infection. 4098 PROGRESSION TO AIDS IN A COHORT OF HOMOSEXUAL MEN: RESULTS AT 5 YEARS MT Schechter, Kevin JP Craib, B Willoughby, P Sestak, MS Weaver, B Douglas, et al. The Vancouver Lymphadenopathy-AIDS Study, St Paul's Hospital, University of British Columbia,Vancouver, CANADA. Objective. To determine the rate of progression to AIDS in a cohort of seropositive homosexual men. Methods. We identified all seropositive subjects in our prospective study who completed at least two visits during the period November 1982 to October 1987. This group was divided into seropositives at entry (SP) and those who seroconverted under observation (SC). AIDS was diagnosed in this cohort according to CDC criteria. Methods of survival analysis were used to calculate progression rates to AIDS. Results. A total of 342 seropositive subjects were included in the survival analysis (246 SP; 96 SC). The median lengths of observation while seropositive were 50.0 mos (range=l60) for SP and 32.5 mos (range=4-56) for SC. A total of 58 cases of AIDS were observed (51 SP;7 SC). Product limit estimates of cumulative progression were 26.9% (~3.3) for SP at 60 months and 12.5% (~4.7) for SC at 56 months. The annual AIDS attack rates for the first 5 years in SP were 1.6%, 3.5%. 6.9%. 6.7% for the first 4 years in SC respectively. Low CD4/CD8 ratio, low Hgb, and elevated IgA predicted AIDS in both SP and SC. Conclusion. These progression rates agree with results from other studies. Differences in progression between SP and SC as well as the rise in annual attack rates in both groups highlight the importance of duration of infection. - Unfortunately, no evidence suggesting a slowdown in progression is indicated in these data. Notes: 4099 EVIDENCE FOR INCREASING RISK OF DEVELOPING AIDS IN MEN WITH HIV-ASSOCIATED LYMPHADENOPATHY SYNDROME--A 6-YEAR FOLLOW-UP Jonathan E. Kaplan, T. Spira, D. Fishbein, P. Pinsky. Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To determine the risk of developing AIDS over a 6-year period in a group of homosexual men with HIV-associated lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS). Methods. Seventy-five homosexual men with LAS, subsequently shown to be seropositive for HIV antibody, were enrolled in a prospective study in Atlanta in 1982-1983. At enrollment, and at 3- to 6-month intervals, the men have undergone clinical and immunologic evaluation. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the incidence rates of AIDS over a 6-year period. Results. As of November 30, 1987, 22 of the 75 men had developed AIDS, 2 each in the first 3 years after onset of LAS, and 6, 7, and 3 in years 4, 5, and 6, respectively. The 6-year cumulative incidence rate for AIDS was 38%; yearly incidence rates in years 4-6 (10%, 13%, 11%, were (6%, 3%, 3%, respectively) (p=.02). Of 18 men with constitutional symptoms and a low T-helper cell count (<408/mm3) noted at the first visit, 12 (67%) have developed AIDS vs. 10 (18%) of the remaining 57 men. The 6-year cumulative incidence rates for AIDS in these 2 groups were 80% and 22%, respectively (p <0.001). Conclusion. LAS patients are at continuing risk for developing AIDS, with an increased risk in years 4-6 after onset of LAS, compared with years 1-3. Those with constitutional symptoms and a low T-helper count at their first visit are at highest risk for developing AIDS. 4100 THE VENHALSAN, STOCKHOLM COHORT AFTER 4.4 YEARS A CLINICAL AND IMMUNOLOGICAL UPDATE Anders Karlsson*, L Morfeldt-Minsson**, of Dermatovenereology, Sbdersjukhuset, **Roslagstulls Hospital, ***The National Bacteriological Lab., Stockholm, Sweden Sera from 998 asymptomatic gay men, drawn during the period Nov 1982 to Dec 1983, was analyzed for serum antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) by ELISA. Positive reactions were confirmed by Western blotting. Their clinical status after 4.4 years is presented. Repeated determination of T cell subsets and immunoglobulines were done in most men and the immunological progression will be presented. Results: HIV antibodies were found in 123 (12.3%) of the 998 men and on clinical evaluation 36 (29.3%) of these 123 men were found to have lymph node enlargement fulfilling the criteria for CDC group III. Of the seropositive men it was possible to evaluate 115 men after a mean time for the men still living of 53 months. Of these 115 men, 32 (27.8%) had developed AIDS (CDC group IV c-1 and d). Sixteen of the men with AIDS had died. Of the men without AIDS it was possible to clinically evaluate 71. Of those, 21 (29.6%) remained asymptomatic (CDC group II), 28 (39.4%) had CDC group III lymph node enlargement while 20 (28.2%) had developed CDC group IV c-2 symptoms. Two men (2.8%) had died of other diseases (Malignant melanoma and Myeloma). Fifty men had T cell subsets determined repeatedly during the whole follow up period. There was a decrease in CD4+ cells in all patient groups. The decrease in CD4+ cells was 8 x 10 cells/l per6month among the men with CDC group IV disease while it was 5 x 10 cells/1 per month among the men with stable disease (CDC group II and III). Conclusion: The morbidity and mortality among HIV infected individuals in Sweden continues to increase. The decrease in CD4+ cells in all patient groups gives reason for concern. The differences in decrease points to a slower progression in certain individuals. 284 [Page 285](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/283) 4101 A PROSPECTIVE MULTICENTER COHORT STUDY IN HOMOSEXUAL MEN IN THE FRG Bernhard Schwartlinder for Members of the Study Group Nationales AIDS Zentrum am Bundesgesundheitsamt, Berlin, FRG In 1984 a prospective cohort study was started in 7 centers. A total of 776 men were recruited. At time of enrollment 426 (55 %) were HIV infected. Ten percent of the infected exhibited no clinical signs, 68 % presented with LAS, 10 % with ARC and 4 % with AIDS. Another 60 men developed AIDS since enrollment. Seven seroconversions were documented until the end of 1987. Enrolled men are examined twice a year. The number of CD4 lymphocytes, the amount of circulating immune complexes and the titer of free HIV-antigens correlated significanty with the progress of the HIV infection. A detailed analysis shows that the course of the infection may vary widely from patient to patient. 4102 FOLLOW UP OF HIV-INFECTED HOMOSEXUALS WITH LYMPHADENOPATHY SYNDROME (LAS) T Harrer, E Meyer, JR Kalden: Institute for clinical immunology of the University Erlangen-Ndrnberg, D-8520-Erlangen, D-1-Berlin, FRG Objective: To determine the progress from LAS to AIDS in a cohort of homosexual men. Methods: Between 1982 and 1984 22 homosexuals were examined clinically and immunologically, inclusive a lymphnode biopsy. Epidemiological factors, clinical Symptoms and immunological parameters were correlated to the clinical outcome. Results: 10 patients (46 %) developed full blown AIDS within a median time of 35 months (24-36 months). Following parameters were associated with disease progression: higher serum levels of g-IFN, higher relative and absolute numbers or CD8-Suppressor cells ii the blood % reduced number of CD4-helper cells in the lymphnodes 4nd a lower CD4/CD8-ratio in blood and the lymphnodes. Despite of the significant differences these parameters varied in a wide range. Conclusion: There is a high incidence of disease progression in patients with HIV-induced LAS. Because of the-variability of parameters significantly correlated to the disease progression neither a single or a group of different symptoms likely to predict the emergence of AIDS in an individual patient, could be established. Notes: 4103 LOW INFECTION RATE AMONG MALE HOMOSEXUALS (MHS) IN ISRAEL - A FOUR YEAR LONGITUDINAL STUDY Z Bentwich, R Burstein, M Meir, R. Levinstein, ZT Handzel R. Ben Ari Institute of Clinical Immunology, Kaplan Hospital, Rehovot, Israel Objective. To study the natural course and cofactors for HIV infection in Israel which is a low incidence country for AIDS. Methods. Detailed questionnaire, complete physical examination and laboratory investigation, including serology of HIV and other viruses as well as an immunological profile. Results. We have studied by now over 800 MHS, 243 of whom have been followed for over 4 years. The prevalence of serum antibodies to HIV among three consecutive cohorts of 243, 432 and 175 MHS each, was 7.8%, 5.3% and 6.5%, respectively, the overall prevalence being 6.3%. Seroconversion rate for the first cohort did not exceed 8%, being stable at about 2% annually. Conclusion. This relatively low annual rate of seroconversion in our cohort may be correlated with the very slow increase in the total number of AIDS cases in Israel. Since sexual habits in the cohort have not changed profoundly as a result of the AIDS epidemic, additional reasons for this interesting epidemiologic behaviour should be sought and will be discussed. 4104 SEROEPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV IN A COHORT OF ITALIAN HOMOSEXUAL MEN, 1983-1987. F. Titti*, P. Verani*, Regione Lazio, Objective. a) to elucidate seroimmunological features of homosex population, b) to follow spreading of HIV infection, c) to make correlation between serological status and changes in sexual behaviours, d) to study the prevalence of HBV and/or CMV infection and other sexually-transmitted diseases and their relationship with HIV serological status. Methods. EIA, IFA, W.B. assays for HIV and RIA tests for HBV serology were used. Results. The study group is composed by 616 individuals of a gay cultural club in Rome. The prevalence of HIV antibodies was 10.9% (1983), 13.3% (1984), 12.9% (1985), 19.8% (1986) and 14.5% LAS and 2% had symptoms suggestive of HIV infection. Among 30 seropositive subjects followed by 4 years, 2 developed AIDS (6.6%), and 8 ARC (26.6%). The prevalence of HBV infection in 482 studied subjects was 77.1%. A significant correlation was found between HIV and HBV infection. No direct relationship was seen between the level of T4-T8 cells, CMV infection and HIV serological status. Conclusion. The data account for a trend of increase of HIV circulation. Seropositivity was not associated with any specific sexual practice. 285 [Page 286](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/284) 4105 HIV F.Chiodo*. *Ist.Mal.Infet.,^Ist.Microb.-Universit e Bologna, Italy Objective. To evaluate the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection in a cohort of Italian hcmo-bisexual men(85-87). Methods. We studied 696 homo-bisexual men (i.v.drug users excluded) from Northern Italy that refer to HIV screening program. All were interviewed about sexual habits(# partners/year, \"safe sex\", sexual intercourse behaviour). HIV serology was performed by ELISA and WB confirmed. Results. HIV Ab prevalence during Jan 1985-Dec 1987 is re ported in TABLE I.

Objective. To evaluate the main risk factors related to HIV infection in a group of homosexuals in the Venetian Region. Methods.Serological evaluation on 202 and analysis of col lected data concerning life-style and sexual behaviour. Results. 12 of the 202 subjects (5.9%) were positive.Seroprevalence was different in two separately enrolled groups:15.6% in subjects applying for diagnostic purposes, 4.1% of volunteers in the epidemiological survey. The principally recognized risk factors were sexual promi - scuity, the number of promiscuous intercourses / month, and anal-genital sex. Conclusion. In our country seroprevalence of HIV infection among homosexuals is very low because they lead a re served life and have a reduced number of risk factors. We also found 13 HIV serur-converted homo-bisexuals among 320 which have repeated periodically HIV serology (every six months for a period of 12-36). IDuring this period the interviewed homo-bisexual men have reported a significant reduction in promiscuity and a better observance of\"safe-sex\" recommended rules. Conclusion. The slow HIV diffusion among Italian homro-bi sexuals should be explained by effectivenees of sexual pro filaxis measures in situation of low HIV Ab prevalence. Notes: 4107 RISK FACTORS FOR AIDS OR AIDS RELATED COMPLEX AMONG HOMO/BISEXUAL MEN IN MINAS Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health,USA Objective. To determine the risk factors for AIDS / ARC among homo/bisexual men in the State of Minas Gerais and to describe the bisexual behaviour of this population, Methods. Of the 261 individuals who came to the AIDS State Referral Clinic(UFMG) between Feb,1986 and June, 1987, 199 reported homo/bisexual activity.The 45 AIDS / ARC cases were compared to the 133 seronegative controls, using logistic regression methods.The blood samples were tested by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot. Results. The following risks were significant for AIDS/ ARC: sex with men from USA during previous 5 yrs., sex with someone in whom AIDS developed, number of male partners (>100)during lifetime, age (>30 yrs old) and ethnic group (white)(Odds Ratios= 5.5, 4.3, 3.9,3.5 and 2.7,respectively). 38% 45% of controls (p>0.05) reported bisexual activity.The median numbers of partners of cases were 3 females and 30 males and for the controls 3 females and 10 males during previous 2 yrs.. ConclusionsA)the risk factors for AIDS/ARC were similar to observed in Europa or USA; B)the small number of female partners of bisexual men compared to the number of male partners can explain,at least in part,why the epidemic has increased more rapidly among men then among women in Minas Gerais. 4108 THE INFLUENCE OF DRUG USE AND LOVER STATUS ON GAY MALE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR PATTERNS,1981-1987. John L. Martin*, Laura Dean*, Marc Garcia*, William Hall^ Columbia University School of Public Health, New York, NY 19032, USA. Objectives. (i) To determine the rate and type of sexual behavior changes occurring among gay men due to the AIDS epidemic. (ii) To specify factors that promote higherrisk sexual behavior. Methods. A cohort of (approx.)700 NYC gay men were interviewed annually since 1985 about their yearly sexual activity, drug use, social, and psychological functioning. Reliable historical data were also collected back to 1981. Results. Findings show that large numbers of gay men have reduced all types of sexual contact: e.g. The use of bathhouses for sex has decreased from 50% (1981) to 16% (1985) to 10% (1986) to 8% (1987). The men who engaged in receptive anal intercourse at least once during the year decreased from 81% (1981) to 70% (1985) to 50% (1986) to 45% (1987). The average proportion of times condoms were used during intercourse increased from <2% (1981) to 10%(1985) to 60% (1986) to 70% (1987). In 1987 25% of the sample engaged in unprotected anal intercourse at least once. Two factors consistently related to not using a condom are (i) drug use during sex (OR~ 3.0, p<.001) and (ii) being coupled with a lover in a primary relationship (ORi 2.5, p <.01). Conclusions. (i) Sexual behavior declines among gay men are pervasive and probably account for the low current annual rate of HIV seroconversion (0.4%) in this cohort in 1987. (ii) The disinhibiting effects of drug use and having a lover on adherence to safer sex guidelines should be incorporated into risk-prevention efforts. 286 [Page 287](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/285) 4109 TRAVELLING OUTSIDE ITALY AND RISK OF HIV INFECTION AMONG HOMOSEXUAL MEN FROM NORTHEASTERN ITALY. Diego Serrain, E.Vaccher,PL.Bul lian,U.Tirel i, S.Franceschit. Epidemiologj Unit and Medical Oncology-Aviano Cancer Center-Italy Objective.To study the major ways of HIV spread among ho_ mosexual men in an area where AIDS and HIV seroprevalence are prominent in intravenous drug addicts (IVDA). Methods.Prevalence and determinants of HIV infection have been studied;information was elicited by means of a que stionnaire and blood samples for HIV antibodies were col_ lected from 112 homosexual men aged 20-52. Results. homosexuals did as regards sociodemographic characteristics and sexual habits (i.e.,mean number of sexual partners,receptive intercourses, use of condoms). Seropositive homosexuals,however, had travel led outside Italy in cities (mainly in northern Europe and U.S.) where HIV is endemic in the gay community more frequent than seronegatives, and this fact turned out to be the most important determinant of HIV infection (RR:2.40; 95% C.I. 0.94-6.12). Conclusion. This study confirms the still low prevalence of HIV antibodies in italian homosexuals compared to homo_ sexuals in other western countries. In this situation,it is not surprising that the major way of spread of the HIV virus is of geographical nature, i.e. homosexual contacts in areas at high risk of infection. 4110 THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF AIDS IN HOMOSEXUAL AND BISEXUAL MEN IN SAN FRANCISCO George W. Rutherford, JL Barnhart, GF Lemp; Department of Public Health, San Francisco, California, U.S.A. Objective. To evaluate demographic trends in AIDS ccses in homosexual and bisexual men in San Francisco. Methods. We reviewed AIDS cases among homosexual and bisexual men reported in San Francisco through December 31, 1987, with regard to race, age, sexual orientation (homosexual or bisexual), and residence. Results. As of December 31, 1987, 4,089 cases of AIDS and 2,448 deaths from AIDS had been reported among homosexual and bisexual men in San Francisco comprising 96.8% of all San Francisco AIDS cases. The incidence of AIDS in the estimated 25,800 HIV-infected gay men in the city is 15.8%. Prior to 1986, homosexual and bisexual men with AIDS tended to be white (88.3%), 40 years old (67.4%), and exclusively homosexual (94.5%) and to live in 19 contiguous census tracts corresponding to the central gay community (49.7%). Since January 1, 1986, however, the number of AIDS cases diagnosed in homosexual and bisexual men has risen significantly more rapidly in non-white men (118% vs. 49%, p=.0001), men 40 years p=.0001), bisexual men (105% vs. 54%, p=0.4), and men living outside the 19 contiguous census tracts (69% vs. 44%, p=.02). Conclusion. We conclude that the epidemiology of AIDS in homosexual and bisexual men in San Francisco is gradually changing with cases occurring more frequently in nonwhite, older, and bisexual men and men living outside the central gay neighborhood. Notes: 4111 HIGI RISK SEXUAL PRCTICES AND CENCM USPCE foDSEXUAL MEN ANITBCDY STATUS. Brett Tindall*, David A. Cooper*. *N-VRC AIDS Epidemiology Unit, Sydney, Australia. Objectives: To determine the frequency of high risk sexual behaviours and condom usage in a group of homosexual men in Sydney, 1987 according to the antibody status of the subject and his sexual partner. Methods: 310 homosexual men enrolled in a prospective study of HIV infection corrpleted a self-adcninistered questionnaire examining sexual behaviour in the previous six months. Results: 162 (52%) subjects were seropositive. Seropositive and seronegatives had a similar mean number of sexual partners (8 and 7 respectively, NS). 23 seronegatives had had sex with a known seropositive. Fewer seronegatives reported unprotected receptive anal intercourse with a seropositive partner (0%) compared with a seronegative partner (39%, P <.001). 32 seropositives had had sex with a known seronegative. None of these had insertive anal intercourse to the point of ejaculation with such a partner ccrrpared with 6% who had done so with a concordant partner (NS). Condom breakage was reported by approxirately 4% of subjects on 4% of occasions. Conclusion: Seronegatives in this sarple are taking precautions to avoid infection with HIV when they know their partner is seropositive. Seropositives are taking precautions to avoid infecting seronegatives. 4112 INFECTIVITY OF HIV IN HOMOSEXUAL PARTNERS V. R. Seage III**, K. Mayer***, C. Horsburgh****. *Harvard School of Public Health, **Boston Department of Health, ***Fenway Community Health Center, Boston, MA, ****Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA. Objective: Estimation of the risk of transmission of HIV per sexual contact from a study of homosexual partners in Boston. Methods: 132 index cases and 155 of their homosexual partners were enrolled. Information on HIV infection status and sexual behavior within and outside the primary relationship was collected. A binomial model was fit to data obtained in the first visit to estimate per contact risk of HIV transmission. Results: Of the 155 couples, 35 of them were both HIV +; 58 were discordant; 62 were both HIV -; 24 of these men had AIDS; 31 had ARC, and 255 were asymptomatic. Assuming a constant risk of transmission per sexual contact between infected and uninfected partners, the estimated risk is low: about 5 to 10 per 1000 receptive anal contacts. Conclusion: The average risk of HIV transmission per sexual contact appears to be low, which may be due to variability in infectivity. To model this variability over time and across individuals, more complex models must be fit to longitudinal studies of sexual partners. 287 [Page 288](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/286) 4113 TRANSMISSION OF HIV IN MALE SEXUAL CONTACTS OF MEN WITH ARC OR AIDS. Randall A Coates, S Read, M Fanning, F Shepherd, L Calzavara, K Johnson, C Soskolne, M Klein. Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, M5S 1A8. Healthy male sexual contacts of men with either AIDS or an AIDS-related condition (ARC) were recruited into a prospective study between July, 1984 and July, 1985. At recruitment, 144 sexual contacts had antibodies to HIV. One hundred two (102) were seronegative at induction and three months following recruitment. No association between HIV seropositivity and total number of sexual partners could be demonstrated. In univariate and multivariate analyses, receptive and insertive anal intercourse with the primary cases, and activities either indicating or potentially causing anorectal mucosa injury (rectal douching, perianal bleeding, receipt of objects in ano, and receptive fisting) were strongly associated with HIV seropositivity. In the final multiple logistic regression model two significant interaction effects were observed: the interaction between receptive anal intercourse and insertive anal intercourse and that between receptive anal intercourse and the anorectal mucosa injury index. These two interaction terms had negative regression coefficients suggesting that change in one sexual activity would not decrementally reduce risk of HIV infection without a comparable modification in the other activity. No significant association could be demonstrated between oral-genital and oral-anal sexual contact and odds ratios for these sexual activities declined to levels below 1.0 when adjusted for frequency of receptive anal intercourse. 4114 NATURAL HISTORY OF HIV INFECTION IN HOMOSEXUAL MALES MONITORED BY IMMUNOLOGICAL AND VIROLOGICAL PARAMETERS. Frank de Wolf*,**, J Lange*,***,P Coutinho**, J van der Noordaa*, J Goudsmit*. *Dept. of Virology and ***Dept. of Internal Medicine, University of Amsterdam, **Municipal Health Service Amsterdam, ****Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. Objective. The risk of developing AIDS was assessed in relationship to changes in CD4+ cell numbers, persistence of HIV core antigen (HIV-Ag) and absence of HIV core antibody (HIV core-Ab). Methods. 238 asymptomatic HIV-Ab seropositive and 68 seroconverted homosexual men were studied over a period of 30 months. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected and blood was sampled every 3 months. Results. AIDS was diagnosed in 29 men during follow-up. The AIDS end-point attack rate was 35.7% in the HIV coreAb negative group, 43.9% in the HIV-Ag positive group,and 51.9% in the group with low CD4+ cell numbers. These attack rates differed significantly from the AIDS attack rates in the HIV core-Ab positives (6.8%), HIV-Ag negatives (6.9%),and in those with normal CD4+ cell numbers (6.1%). Disease progression to AIDS was strongly associated with preceding HIV-Ag positivity and HIV core-Ab negativity and less so with low CD4+ cell numbers. Conclusion. Absence of HIV core-Ab, presence of HIV-Ag, and low CD4+ cell numbers place asymptomatic HIV-Ab seropositive homosexuals at high risk to develop AIDS. Early identification of those at high risk is feasible through serial testing for HIV core-Ab and HIV-Ag status and determination of CD4+ cell count numbers. The high predictive value of HIV-Ag indicates the crucial role of active virus infection in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Notes: 4115 PERSONAL COUNSELLING AND THE USE OF CONDOMS DURING ANAL INTERCOURSE IN A COHORT OF HOMOSEXUAL MEN IN FINLAND. Sirkka-Liisa Valle, M.D.,Ph.D. Dpt of Dermatology, University Central Hospital and Aurora Municipal Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. At a start of a prospective follow-up study on HIV infection,235 homosexual men were seen during 1983-1984 in Finland. 94% of the men were prospectively examined at 3-to-8-month intervals during a period of 5-to-40 months (mean 22.7 mo) up until June 1986. Every participant was seen 2-to-5 times during the study and explicit practical advice for avoidance of direct mucosal contact was given at each visit. The HIV seroprevalence rose from an initial 9.4% (22/235) to 14% (31/221) during the follow-up. All 9 HIV seroconversions occurred in individuals practicing unprotected sex. Prior to the study, 9.3% of the men did not have anal sex ad only 6% of the group consistently used condoms, whereas 83% did not use them at all. At the end of the follow-up, 42.5% had given up anal sex and 28.5% consistently used condoms. However, 24.4% still practiced anal unprotected anal sex. In the end,11/24(45.8%) of those men who had not used condoms previously, had ceased having anal sex 4-to-8 months after having learnt of their HIV seropositivity,while 7/24(29.2%) used condoms.However,4/24(16.6%) were still practising unprotected insertive anal sex despiteHIV infection,thus predicting further spread of the virus among gay men. 4116 HIV-1 SEROPREVALENCE IN MALE AND FEMALE PROSTITUTES IN NEW YORK CITY Mary Ann Chiasson*, AR City Dept. of Health, NY, **CDC, Atlanta, GA. OBJECTIVE To determine the HIV-1 seroprevalence and risk factors for infection in prostitutes attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic in New York City. METHODS Volunteers were enrolled from 12/86 through 12/87. HIV-1 antibody status was determined and information on demographics, sexual activity, and IV drug use (IVDU) was collected by an interviewer using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS Data from 961 of the 1200 participants was analyzed. 150 (84 males and 66 females) reported receiving money or drugs for sex at least once since 1978. Of the male prostitutes, 52 (62%) received money for sex from females (Mw/F) and 32 (38%) from males (Mw/M). All of the females had contact with males (Fw/M). More than 10 contacts were reported by 21 (40%) of Mw/F, 15 (47%) of Mw/M, and 48 (%) HIV+/Tot (%) HIV+/Tot (%) Gay/Bisexual 17/32 (53) 3/8 (38) - IVDU - 1/8 (12) 8/18 (44) Sex part IVDU - 0/9 (0) 5/23 (22) No risk - 1/27 (4) 1/25 (4) TOTAL 17/32 (53) 5/52 (10) 14/66 (21) CONCLUSIONS HIV seropositivity in male prostitutes is related primarily to homosexuality and IVDU while in females it is related to IVDU and being the sex partner of an IVDU. 288 [Page 289](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/287) 4117 DETECTION OF HIV INFECTION IN MALE PROSTITUTES. Tirelli, E. Vaccher, S. grant of the Friuli Venezia-Giulia Region. Objective: To determine the prevalence of HIV infection among male prostitutes of the Friuli Venezia-Giulia Region, north-east Italy. Methods: 27 male prostitutes, 16 of whom transvestites, were studied between September '85 and March '87. Four of the 27 male prostitutes were intravenous drug abusers (ivda), and these were examined separately. The controls were 75 homosexual men concomitantly studied. The male prostitutes and controls were clinically examined, tested for HIV antibody with ELISA (confirmed by Western Blot) and they completed a questionnaire on their sexual behaviour. Results: MALE PROSTITUTES CONTROLS 4118 HELPER AND SUPPRESSOR LYMPHOCYTE CHANGES IN A COHORT OF HOMOSEXUAL MEN FOLLOWED 5 YEARS. R BIGGAR, J Goedert, D Mann, R Grossman*, M Melbye, W Blattner [NCI-USA; *priv.practice] In 1982 we initiated a prospective study of a cohort of homosexual men in New York City and Washington, D.C. We review the changes in T-helper (Th) and T-suppressor (Ts) lymphocytes among 114 HIV negative, 86 HIV + and 46 seroconverting men between 1982 and 1987. METHODS: 114 men were HIV-negative at the onset and remained negative throughout their follow-up (60 continuing in the study through 1987). Among these 'normals', Th and Ts values increased steadily during the years of the study, prob -ably due to improvements in the assay. Values among HIV + and seroconverting men therefore were adjusted to become a percentage of the median value for the same test done on normals during the same year. Time to event was calculated actuarially, censoring subjects at the time of last follow-up. Seroconversion was the mid -point between the dates of negative and positive sera. RESULTS: Among 86 initially HIV + men, 55.8% developed AIDS by the end of 1987. Of the 48 subjects who had not developed AIDS by 1987, 49.5% had Th levels less than 50% ( 300/mm3) of normal on at least one occasion, and 64.5% a Th/Ts ratio of less than 50% ( 0.7). AIDS risk increased and Th levels and ratios declined steadily through 1987. Among 46 men who seroconverted during the study, T-cells were generally normal prior to sero -conversion. All had inverted ratios with 3 years and and 7 were known to have developed AIDS (28-58 months). CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppression as measured by T-cell phenotypes does not predispose to HIV infection. In most HIV-infected persons, progressive immunosuppression and rising AIDS incidence will continue over many HOMOSEX.MEN TRANSVESTITES HOMOSEX.MEN N04 N07 24 27 27 33(26-67) Median partners/mos. not available 50 100 10 Active anal 0 0 1/75(1%) Conclusion: Male prostitutes should be considered a high risk group for HIV infection and their clients should be strongly advised to abandon this sexual habit or at least to use condoms regularly. Notes: 4119 Poverty and HIV Seropositivity: The Poor Are More Likely to Be Infected. Krueger, L.*, Wood, R.*, Diehr, P.**, Maxwell, C.*, Seattle King Co. Dept. of Public Health*; University of Washington**, Seattle, WA, USA. Objective: We examined the hypothesis that those who fall below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level ($866/mo) are more likely to be HIV seropositive even after controlling for other risk related factors. Methods: We used data from clients visiting an AIDS counseling and testing clinic. We obtained demographic and risk information from all clients during their visit. Clinic health providers drew blood samples from clients during a counseling session. ELISA and Western Blot tests were used to identify HIV seropositives. Results: We gathered data on 2699 clients between June 1986 and December 1987. Of our total sample, 18% were HIV seropositive and 51% overall were defined as poor. 20% of the poor were seropositive compared to 16% of those above 200% of the poverty level (p=.01). Non-white clients had a seropositive rate of 26% compared to white clients with a rate of 17% (p=.001). Conclusion: We analyzed poverty as an independent predictor of HIV infection and found through logistic regression that poverty was a significant predictor of HIV seropositivity even after controlling for gender, risk (i.e., sexual preference and IV drug use), race and age. An odds ratio of 1.5 confirmed that poor clients are more likely to be seropositive after controlling for all variables mentioned above. 4120 THE OCCURRENCE OF STD'S IN A COHORT OF HOMOSEXUAL MEN PRIOR TO AND AFTER REPEATED PERSONAL COUNSELLING. Sirkka-Liisa Valle,M.D,Ph.D.,Dpt. of Dermatology, University Central Hospital and Aurora Municipal Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. The occurrence of syphilis, gonorrhea (gc),nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), scabies, pubic lice and hepatitis B was initially determined by collecting historical data from a cohort of235 homosexual men in 1983-1984. Later,221/235(94) of the men were followed during a period of 5-40 months (mean 22.7 mo), and given explicit personal counselling for avoidance of STD's at each consecutive 2-to-5 visits. The incidence rates of various STD's, except for HBV,were calculated using historical data against the total number of months of homo-/bisexual activity, whereas HBV antibody results were used instead of historical data for the HBV incidence. The incidence rate ratios of syphilis, gc, pubic lice,scabies and HBV decreased during the follow-up, whereas the ratio of NGU increased. However,13/221 men acquired gonorrhea, 13 more men had gc, 11 had pubic lice and 6 seroconverted with HBV during the study. There were as many new infections of gc, NGU and pubic lice during the first 12 months as there were during the last 12 months of the study despitecloselyargued risk-reduction advice, which has to be taken as a sign of \"false security\" still present in the Finnish male homosexual community in 1986.

Lifson*, San Francisco, CA; **Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA. Objective. To analyze the changing incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in a cohort of homosexual and bisexual men with AIDS, and to evaluate these men for biologic and behavioral cofactors possibly associated with KS. Methods. 6,709 homosexual and bisexual men were recruited between 1978 and 1980 for hepatitis B studies. Cases of AIDS were identified through surveillance data or followup examinations. 158 men who developed AIDS consented to in-depth interviews about sexual and drug use behaviors. Results. As of January 1, 1988, 898 men were known to have developed AIDS: 364 (41%) had KS reported as either their initial (34%) or subsequent (6%) diagnosis. The proportion of men with KS as an initial diagnosis has significantly decreased over time (77% in 1981 to 26% in 1987; p(.001). This decline could not be attributed to differences in age at diagnosis of AIDS, race/ethnicity or time from date of seroconversion to date of diagnosis (mean for KS=59 mo.). Compared to non-KS AIDS patients, men with KS were not significantly more likely to report a history of intravenous (IV) or non-IV drug use (e.g., inhaled nitrites), sexually transmitted or enteric diseases (e.g., amebiasis), a larger number of male or female sexual partners or specific sexual practices (e.g., anal intercourse). Conclusion. A decline occurred in the proportion of AIDS patients with KS which was not due toa shorter incubation time for KS. Although cofactors for KS may exist, our data does not support a role for many previously hypothesized environmental and infectious agents. 4122 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF KAPOSI'S SARCOMA IN SWEDEN PRIOR TO AIDS M Dictor,* N Bends6e***, Depts. of *Pathology and ***Dermatology, **Southern Swedish Cancer Registry, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden Objective. determine incidence rates in classical Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) prior to 1982. Methods. 529 cases of KS (diagnostic accuracy 90%) were reported to the Swedish Cancer Registry between 1958 and 1982. Incidence rates were determined and a Poisson model used for rate ratios and age-specific incidence over 5-yr periods. Medical histories in a regional group of 44 KS cases were reviewed. Results. The incidence rate generally increased over the time period, with a mean of 0.27 cases/ 100,000/year. The 5-yr incidence rate ratio (relative to the earliest period) reached 2.06 for males and 3.76 for females and peaked between 1971 and 1974. A transient increase of the disease in younger age groups (P=0.05) occurred up to 1968-72. The age-adjusted male:female ratio did not change significantly from 2.9 during the period of study. Only 2 of the regional patients (excluding 3 with lymphoma) were receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs prior to diagnosis. Conclusion. Immunodeficency due to drug therapy is unlikely to account for the epidemiologic changes in classical KS. Epidemiologic trends for AIDS-related KS, suggest an infectious cause other than HIV. Notes: 4123 Correlation between exposure to AIDS risk factors, mode of presentation in AIDS, and subsequent prognosis. Messiah A. Rozenbaum W, Vittecoq D, Brunet JB. U Kaposi's sarcoma is a mode of presentation in AIDS which is more frequent among homo/bisexual men than in other risk groups and which has a better prognosis. The hypothesis of specific co-factors for AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma has been proposed. To investigate this possibility, we compared 25 cases with Kaposi's sarcoma alone (KS) to 25 cases having opportunistic infections (OI) without KS, among homo/bisexual men initially enrolled for the purpose of a case-control study described elsewhere (1, 2). Cases with KS alone were more likely than cases with OI to have higher educational level and to have had homosexual encounters in Europe (Relative Risk = 1,75). In contrast, OI cases were more likely to have ever inhalated nitrites (RR = 5,90), to have had syphilis twice or more (RR = 2,26), to have had repeted blenorrhoea (RR = 1,93), and to have over 20 occasional sex partners per year (RR = 2,07). OI and KS cases did not differ for age, geographical origin, socio-economical level, history of infectious mononucleosis, history of herpes infection, and for homosexual encounters in either Mediterranean area, North America, Latin America, intertropical Africa, or Asia. In a multivariate analysis, the factors which best discriminated the groups were the educational level, the nitrite inhalations, the history of several syphilis, and the homosexual encounters in Europe. These data do not support the hypothetised association between nitrite inhalations and Kaposi's sarcoma. They show that cases with opportunistic infections have been exposed to AIDS-related risk factors (e. g. history of venereal diseases and promiscuity) at higher rates than cases with Kaposi's sarcoma alone, which has a better prognosis. This suggests that the prognosis of AIDS could be associated with the level of exposure to AIDS risk factors. 1. Messiah A, Mary J-Y, Brunet J-B, et al.

To determine whether the incidence of KS is declining over time among participants in MACS. Methods. Incidence of KS and non-KS AIDS was observed at six-month intervals in a sample of 1827 HIV-1 seropositive gay men. Diagnoses were ascertained according to CDC surveillance The overall incidence of AIDS is approximately constant. However, the contribution of KS after 3/85 systematically decreased over time. Analysis of the possible explanatory variables of this association suggest that 2 years prior to diagnosis, KS cases tended to engage in more frequent anal receptive intercourse, suggesting a direct route of transmission. Conclusion. These data confirm the decline of KS in HIV-1 infected gay men. Further investigation of the role of anal receptive intercourse and other possible explanatory variables will be pursued. 290 [Page 291](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/289) 4125 NATURAL HISTORY AND CORRELATES OF LYMPHADENOPATHY DURING PROGRESSION OF HIV INFECTION J. Allen McCutchan, D Jacobson, P Spechko, C Kennedy, S Bozzette, I Abramson, A Bartok, S Spector, D Richman University of California, San Diego, CA Objective. To investigate the course and imnunological correlates of lymphadenopathy in HIV seropositive (HIV AB+) and seronegative (HIV AB-) homosexual men. Methods. Lymph node volume (INV) was the sum of the largest node at 12 sites measured by a single observer semi-annually for three years. A repeated measures analysis of covariance was used to model INV as a function of time, clinical status, and 4 viral and imnune indicators in HIV AB+ and HIV AB- subjects separately. Results. Significant predictors in the model include: HIV AB+ (n = 107) HIV AB- (n = 88) Predictor Coeff. p Value Coeff. p Value 1) Association of decreased LNV with time in study, fewer CD4 cells, and AIDS or ARC implies that progressive nodal involution occurs during HIV infection. 2) A background decrease in INV in both HIV AB+ and HIV AB- gay men could reflect self-recruitment of men with transient adenopathy at entry or decreasing exposure to other infectious agents of adenopathy. 3) Adenopathy is associated with thrcmbocytopenia and may have a related pathogenesis. 4126 MORTALITY FROM PERINATALLY-ACQUIRED HIV INFECTION IN AFRICAN CHILDREN. Nsa*, R Ryder*/**, To quantify and characterize mortality in African children born at 2 Kinshasa hospitals to HIV(+) mothers during the first year of life. Methods. Through screening 8264 consecutive women delivering at 2 large maternities in Kinshasa (Hospital A serving the poor and Hospital B serving the well off), 479 case children (CA) born to HIV(+) women and 573 control children (CO) born to HIV(-) women have been identified and now followed for one year. Results. At Hospital A 75 (22%) of 339 CA have died compared with 11 (3%) of 339 CO (P<.01). At Hospital B 6 (4%) of 140 CA have died compared with 7 (3%) of 234 CO (P=NS). 26% of 41 CA dying appeared to have died of prematurity in their first week of life; low birth weight (mean=1486 Gms), low apgar scores and respiratory difficulty since birth were particularly prominent characteristics in these early deaths. 12% of the fatalities in CA occurred between the age of 8 and 28 days. 48 (62%) of the addition fatalities in CA occurred after the first month of life from persistent diarrhea (38%), pneumonia (34%), septicemia (17%) and meningitis (11%). These 4 dxs were made less commonly in CA not dying in the 1st yr and were uncommon in CO. Conclusion. Large differences in HIV-associated infant death rates were found in 2 hospitals in the same African city. Children dying in the first month of life often died of prematurity; those dying later generally died of illnesses commonly associated with AIDS. Notes: 4127 mEJIZMLM IN %\",.TREN H A.

R W Ryder*/**, W Nsa*, Trop. Med., Antwerp, Belgium, *****NIH, Bethesda. Objective. To define the natural history and clinical sequelae of perinatal HIV infection in African children. Methods. In 1986-87 479 HIV (+) pregnant women (339 at Hosp A and 140 at Hosp B) were identified and the children (case children=CA) subsequently born to these women followed. CA with a (+) cord blood culture and/or a (+) IgM Western blot at 0 or 3 months were defined as being perinatally infected. CA and 574 matched control infants (CO) born to HIV(-) women have now been followed for one year. Results. Overall, 248 (73%) of Hosp A CA and 46 (33%) of Hosp B CA had laboratory evidence of HIV infection for a combined infection rate of 294/479 or 61%. At Hosp A, 75 (22%) of 339 CA have died compared with 11 (3%) of 339 CO (p=.001). At Hosp B, 6 (4%) of 140 CA have died compared with 7 (3%) of 235 CO (p=NS). The clinical features distinguishing CA with laboratory evidence of HIV infection from CO were chronic fever (13% vs 3%), lymphadenopathy (19% vs 7%) and failure to thrive (32% vs 22%); no differences in the incidence of chronic diarrhea, dermatitis, oral thrush or pneumonia were noted. Conclusion. HIV(+) women are highly infectious to their offspring with infection rates of 73% and 33% documented in 2 separate Kinshasa hospitals. In this study, children with perinatally-acquired HIV infection did poorly, with high rates of mortality and AIDS-associated symptoms noted in the first year of life. 291 [Page 292](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/290) 4129 ESTIMATION OF THE AIDS-FREE TIMES Detels,H J BF Polk, for the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS),Bethesda,MD,USA. Objective. Estimation of the percentages of individuals who develop AIDS in t units of time after seroconversion to HIV-1 in a sample of gay men. Methods. Using the follow-up data on 227MACS participants who seroconverted from 4/84 to 12/87, a regression model for the estimation of times since seroconversion to HIV-1 was generated. Using the covariate information at entry, the fitted regression model was used to estimate the unknown times since infection for the cohort of 1523 seroprevalent individuals with available data. Estimation of the distribution of the AIDS-free times took the truncation and censoring mechanisms into account. The precision of the estimation was assessed using bootstrap methods. Results. The table below shows the estimates for the percentages of AIDS-free individuals. Months since seroconversion 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60 %AIDSfree 99.8 99.5 98.5 96.1 93.1 89.8 86.8 84.2 81.7 79.5 Using time of entry into the study as the time of seroconversion produces an underestimate of the % AIDS-free. Adding estimated truncation times but not incorporating the truncation mechanism into the estimation produces an overestimate of the % AIDS-free. Conclusion. The data suggest that (i) AIDS is very unlikely (<.5%) to develop before 12 months, (ii) approximately 80% are AIDS-free after 60 months, (iii) an increasin incidene rate f AIDS is present. etween 1 an 0 onths and v te incidene rae is approximately constant between 30 and 60 months. 4130 ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF HIV-INFECTED PEOPLE USING AIDS-NOTIFICATIONS Giesecke 3, Scalia-Tomba G Dept. of Env. Health and Infect. Dis. Control, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. With time, more and more knowledge is accumulating on the incubation time to AIDS, for different modes of transmission. A method of obtaining confidence limits for the numbers of HIV-infected people, based on goodness-offit statistics, using the numbers of known AIDS-cases and incubation time probabilities, is discussed. Calculations based on this method, as well as a sensitivity analysis of the method to variations in incubation time distribution, are in progress and will be presented.

To estimate and compare prevalence and incidence of AIDS-related manifestations in previously and newly seropositive homosexual men seen semiannually. Methods. A clinical index 1) based on HIV-induced symptoms, signs and hematologic abnormalities, 2) readily applicable by clinicians and 3) quantitatively correlated with 1-year AIDS incidence was used to score participants at each visit. A high index score or AIDS represented clinically significant immunodeficiency (CSID). A CD4 count <400 was considered separately as a less routinely available measure. Results. Prevalence of CSID or CD4<400 rose 18% in 1573 seropositive men (+) in 2.5 yrs and 17% in 218 seroconverters (-/+) in 2 yrs. In initially healthy men (score= 0, CD4>700) (Table), prevalence of CSID alone and prevalence of CSID or CD4<400 increased similarly for the 334 (+) and 91 (-/+). % with CSID alone and % with CSID or low CD4 count at: Mos 0 6 12 18 24 30 [+], CSID after 0 T 1 3 4 7 \", CSID or CD4<400 entry 0 7 5 9 15 18 [-/+], CSID after 0 0 2 4 4 \", CSID or CD4<400 1st + 0 6 17 14 14 Life table incidences 2-yr) also rose steadily.

MJ Reid, MD, DW Goetz, RA Zajac, MD, RN Boswell, MD, Lackland AFB, Texas. We prospectively studied 157 HIV + USAF personnel identified by ELISA screening and confirmed by Western blot. They were initially evaluated, and re-evaluated at least once. The following variables were analyzed in relation to change in CD4 bearing lymphocytes/month and progression in Walter Reed Stage: age, race, sex, Walter Reed Stage (WR), IgM, IgA, and anergy panel. Data were screened by simple regression, stratified and compared by appropriate methods. 153 (97.5%) subjects were male, 4 (2.5%) were female. 84 (53.5%) were white, 63 (40.1%) were black, 8 (5.1%) were hispanic, and 2 (1.3%) were oriental. At entry, mean age was 28.6 yrs with 63% between 20 and 30. 108 (68.8%) were WR1, 26 (16.6%) were WR2, and 3 (1.9%) were WR6. Mean follow-up period was 12.2 mos (range 2 -35), mean change in CD4 cells/mo was -0.072 (range + 67.58 to - 94.75). Factors significantly related to change in CD4 cells/mo by regression analysis included: IgA p=0.0129, CD4/CD8 ratio p=0.0459, and age p=0.0176. Factors related to progression of WR stage by comparison of group means included IgA p=0.0024, and CD4/CD8 ratio p=0.006. Other factors significantly related to progression of disease included SGOT, anergy status, and race. Of these values, a high serum IgA was most consistently related to progression of immunodeficiency. 292 [Page 293](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/291) 4133 Correlation of Clinical Complications with T-cell changes due to HIY infection in the 2 Edinburgh Haemophiliac Cohort. R Infirmary of Edinburgh MRC Clinical and Population Cytogenetics Unit, Edinburgh We are conducting a longitudinal study of a cohort of 32 haemophiliacs transfused in 1984 with a single batch of factor VIII contaminated with HIV. Eighteen patients developed anti-HIV antibodies and 14 remain seronegative. In the seropositive group, one patient has died from AIDS, and one has developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Five patients have developed constitional symptoms (CDC Group IVA) and one has had oral candidiasis (CDC Group IV C-2). Ten patients remain asymptomatic, but 2 of these have PGL and one has thrombocytopenia. All 14 seronegative patients remain well. There was no significant difference in pre-exposure mean CD4+ lymphocyte counts between the seropositive group mean CD4 = 0.72 x 10 /1, and the seronegative group, mean CD4 = 0.77 x 10 /1. Since exposure, the CD4+ lymphocyte counts have declined progressively in the sero positive group, but remained stable in the seronegative group. The decline was more marked in the symptomatic seropositive subgroup, mean CD4 = 0.14 x 10 /1 compared with the asymptomatic seropositive subgroup, mean CD4 = 0.42 x 10 /1; this difference was significant. There is substantial clinical and laboratory evidence of progressive HIV infection in this cohort, with particularly rapid progression occuring in a subgroup of seropositive patients. 4134 HIV Serological Studies and Correlation with clini al progression in the Edinburgh Haemophiliac Dept. of Haematology, Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Eighteen haemophiliac patients were infected with a single HIV-contaminated batch of factor VIII in early 1984. Since the time of exposure was precisely known, detection of p24 antigen and IgM-specific antibody during the period before IgG-specific seroconversion could be studied. Sequential samples over 4 years of follow-up have been tested for total HIV-specific antibody levels, anti-envelope anti-core antibody levels and p24 antigen levels. There was an inverse relationship between anti-core reactivity, determined by immunoblotting and specific ELISA and clinical progression to ARC or AIDS in 4 patients. Loss of anti-core reactivity occured 1-2 years before the development of illness. Reappearance of p24 antigen proved a later and less reliable indication of progression. Notes: 4135 AIS INCIEE R, GinestA C, Melis R, Clotet B, Foz M. Service of de \"Germans Trias i Pujol\". Universitat Autdoma de Barcelona. Barcelona.Spain. Objective. IDA is the first cause of AIDS in Spain. In order to know the natural history and the AIDS mortality in IDA's with a high prevalence of HIV infection (77.5% in 1987), we have analysed the AIDS-incidence and mortality in a group of 553 heroin abusers attending a General Hospital. Patients and Methods. Between 1984 and 1987 a total of 553 IDA's were registered: 38% attended for acute infectious disease, 10C% for complications of opiate overdoses, 5% due to injuries or accidents and 47% attend an outpatient detaxification program. 451 were males and 102 females with an average age of 23.2 years (range 16-36) and a time of addiction of 42.9 months (range 0-124 m). Results. Follow-up was possible in 56.6% of cases (mean time 17.8 months; range 6-51 m). By the last 3 years, there were 19 deaths (3.4%): 12 drug overdose, 5 AIDS, and 2 acute (non-AIDS) infectious disease. AIDS has been documented in 24 more cases (4.3%) of the IDA's studied. Conclusion. Although opiate overdose is still the first reason of death in IDA's, AIDS is emerging as the second cause, having in 1987 the same magnitude as overdose deaths, and clearly over acute infectious diseases, injuries or accidental causes. 4136 PREVENTION OF THE SPREAD OF HIV: HEALTH EDUCATION AND POLICY DEVELOPNENT WITH THE HELP OF INTERACTIVE MODELCONSTRUCTION AND SIMULATION Hans Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, The Netherlands, **University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands, ***University of Utrecht, The Netherlands Several national organizations contributing to AIDS policy making in The Netherlands have decided to participate in a process to construct a system dynamics model of AIDS (including biological, epidemiological, sociopsychological, political and economical components) and to simulate this model accordingly. During this process participants explicate a number of assumptions related to the selec-- tion of preventive measures and study the short and long term effects of these measures on the spread of HIV, on the growth of the AIDS population, on health care costs, etc. An outline of the procedure and methods through which the participants actively construct the model and engage in simulation will be presented. An adjusted version of the model and procedure of participation for health care workers, interest groups, and the like, will be proposed. 293 [Page 294](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/292) 4137 PREDICTING PROGRESSION TO AIDS; IMPLICATIONS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL COHORT STUDY FOR EARLY INTERVENTION, AR Moss D Osmond P Bacchetti R Chaisson W Krampf E Ross. UCSF & SFGH, San Francisco, Ca Objectives We examined predictors of AIDS & ARC in 288 asymptomatic AB+ men in order to define groups at high risk of progression. Methods 288 HIV AB+ men recruited 1983-4 were seen yearly for clinical & laboratory followup. Two & three-year predictors of AIDS & ARC were defined. Results 3-year actuarial prog rates were 22% to AIDS, 41% to AIDS or ARC. Beta-2 microglobulin (B2), hematocrit, HIV p24 antigen and % and no. of T4 lymphs (T4) independently predicted AIDS. B2 was most powerful. The 2 year prog rate from ARC to AIDS was 44%. B2, p24 and T4 independently predicted progression from ARC. All three variables were comparable. 3-YEAR PROG.

Objective. To examine possible cofactors for progression of human immunodeficiency virus infection in a cohort of homosexual and bisexual men. Methods. One hundred eighty-one homosexual and bisexual men with known HIV seroconversion dates, originally recruited for studies of hepatitis B in 1978-1980, were evaluated for cofactors for progression of HIV infection to AIDS and AIDS mortality using both Cox proportional hazard stepwise analyses and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results. Cox proportional hazard stepwise analysis showed no association with progression to AIDS or AIDS mortality for age at seroconversion, year of seroconversion, history of needle sharing, race/ethnicity, and frequency of receptive anal intercourse following seroconversion. ANOVA analysis comparing incubation from infection to diagnosis of AIDS with survival from diagnosis to death revealed that survival was shorter for those with shorter incubation periods although this difference was not statistically significant (p.1). MONTHS OF INCUBATION WITH HIV MEAN SURVIVAL 0-35 36-59 60-83 84-119 IN MONTHS (N=39): 4.5 12.9 7.1 7.3 Conclusion. Age at seroconversion, year of seroconversion, race/ethnicity, history of needle sharing, and frequency of receptive anal intercourse following seroconversion were not associated with disease progression or mortality. Any two 52 62% p24 6 80% Conclusions B2 & p24 were independent and comparable or better predictors of AIDS than T4 and were comparable predictors of progression from ARC. Thus large groups at high risk can be defined by using B2 and p24 in addition to T4 and/or ARC, improving power in trials. Individual risk can be predicted better than with T4 alone, improving decision making about entering treatment. Notes: 4139 RISK OF DEVELOPING AIDS IN HIV-INFECTED COHORTS OF HEMOPHILIC AND HOMOSEXUAL MEN Janine M Ragni**, W Darrow*, N Hessol*** *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, U.S.A., **University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A., ***Department of Public Health, San Francisco, CA. U.S.A. Objective. To assess whether the incubation period for and/or incidence of AIDS differ for 2 cohorts infected with HIV through different routes and/or having different cofactors for disease outcome. Methods. We analyzed data for 2 HIV-infected cohorts--77 hemophilic men in Pennsylvania and 112 homosexual and bisexual men in San Francisco--who met the following criteria: 1) year of HIV seroconversion was known for all members of the cohorts, and 2) all persons developing AIDS through December 1986 were identified. Results. By 1986, 13% of the infected hemophilic men and 24% of the infected homosexual men had developed AIDS. However, seroconversion patterns differed significantly for the 2 groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no significant difference in incubation period for AIDS. When year of infection was taken into account, the conditional odds ratios for developing AIDS did not differ for the 2 groups (OR 1.4, for homosexual vs. hemophilic cohorts, 95% confidence interval 0.5-3.8). Conclusion. These results suggest that at this early point in the AIDS epidemic the relative length of HIV infection may be of primary importance in comparing HIV disease outcome for different populations. 4140 OUTCOMES OF HIV INFECTION IN A COHORT OF MALE SEXUAL CONTACTS OF MEN WITH AIDS OR ARC. Randall A Coates, S Read, F Shepherd, M Fanning, C Soskolne, K Johnson, L Calzavara, M Klein, V Farewell, D McFadden. Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada M5S 1A8. 249 male sexual contacts of men with AIDS or ARC (primary cases) were recruited between July 1984 and July 1985. On enrolment, 144 were seropositive and have now been followed for a mean 55.6 months since the midpoint date of the relationship with their corresponding primary cases. 14 seroconversions (13.6 %) have occurred in those who were seronegative at recruitment. According to the CDC classification of HIV infections, we have observed the following clinical events in the 158 seropositive members of the cohort: 0 Group I; 26 Group II (17 normal immune function; 9 abnormal); 105 Group III (42 normal immune function, 63 abnormal); 27 Group IV ( 0 IVA, 0 IV B, 17 IVC1, 2 IVC2, 8 IVD). We have not observed any symptomatic acute infections in this cohort nor have we observed any neurologic disease in the absence of a major opportunistic disease. Three years following recruitment the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the cumulat: c iriidence of persistent generalized lymp..denopathy in scropositives is 87.5%. Using recruit.nent date as the zero point on the time scale, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 3 year cumulative incidence of AIDS is 21.9 %. If the zero point on the time scale is taker. as the date of the first sexual contact with the primary case (a surrogate measure of date of HIV infection) we observe the following Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative incidence of AIDS: 5.2 % at 3 years, 9.4 % at 4 years, 16.4 % at 5 years, 23.6 % at 6 and 7 years, 35.5 % at 8 years, and 41.4 % at 9 years. 294 [Page 295](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/293) 4141 CHARACTERISTICS OF HIV INFECTED MEN WITHOUT CLINICAL OR LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES AFTER THREE YEARS OF FOLLOWUP. Dennis Osmond, P Bacchetti, RE Chaisson, W Krampf, AR Moss. Depts Epidemiology and Medicine, SF General Hosp/UCSF, San Francisco, CA, USA. Objective: To study characteristics of Ab+ men showing no clinical or laboratory abnormalities after three or more years of followup. Methods: A nested case-control study form a cohort of 288 Ab+ men followed 3 yrs. Controls (N=ll): At 3+ yrs, CD4? 700/ml and no lab or clinical abnormalities. Cases (N=13): Baseline CD4 7 700 and no lab/clinical abnormalities during followup. Results: Only 6% (11/191) of Ab+ men were without clinical or lab abnormalities after 3 yrs. They differed from cases in that 8/11 had been regular sexual partner of an AIDS case vs. 3/13 cases (p=.02). Controls were more likely to be 7 35 yrs (p=.04)--contrary to the rest of the cohort where age>35 was a cofactor for progression. No differences in number of sexual partners, drug use, reported medical history, MHA, VDRL, Hep B, or CMV serology were seen. Early contact with an AIDS case, frequency of receptive anal intercourse, and a somewhat higher than average number of partners suggest they are not among the most recently infected. AIDS case partners linked to 8 controls had a longer than average survival (20+ months). Conclusion: Only 6% of infected persons were free of HIVrelated abnormalities after 3 yrs of followup. These subjects are not characterized by evidence for recent infection nor by differences in medical history, drug use, or number of sexual partners. Having been the sexual partner of an AIDS case early in the epidemic may be a surrogate for early awareness of \"safe sex\". 4142 THE CONNECTION OF INCUBATION PERIOD AND PROGRESSION TO DISEASE IN HIV CARRIERS MICHAEL G KOCH1, Davidsen P2, v Welck UP, GonzAlez JJ' 546 00 Karlsborg, Sweden; e Instit. of Informatics, University N - 5007 Bergen, Norway; 3 ACS, D-8000 Munich 2, WestGermany; ' AID, N - 4890 Grimstad, Norway. Comparing about 50 different clinical followup studies from various regions in the world, we tried to define the progression rates of HIV infected persons to AIDS. The main problem is that different patient groups never are fully equivalent concerning important variables as their distribution into age and risk categories. Although a point of time may be knownp when they were infected, it is usually unknownp when exactly they got the infection. Considering just this variable, the co-factor TIME seems to be most dominant, explaining all apparently inconsistent results referred by different authors. The shape of the probability distribution of incubation periods seems to be influenced by a continuous malignification of the dominating virus strain in the host, a feature we do know as enhancement of pathogenicity by repeated host passages, here speeded up to an intraindividual event by the rapid antigenic drift of lentiviruses and their tendencially changing receptor tropism. Notes: 4143 Natural History of HIV Infection in Spouses of AIDS Patients in Haiti. WARREN D. JOHNSON, JR.*, N.Y., N.Y.*, GHESKIO, Port-au-Prince, Haiti**. Objective. To determine the outcome of HIV infection. Methods. 744 spouses/regular sex partners (M=144, F=600) of AIDS patients have been followed at our clinic in Port-auPrince, Haiti since September 1983. Results. Seropositivity for HIV (wv, gpl20) was 51% (n-303) for females and 54% (n-79) for males at the time of their initial visit. Six percent of seropositive (SP) males and 12% of SP females had either AIDS or ARC on study entry. The SP asymptomatic female spouses were followed for a mean period of 11 months and SP male spouses for a mean of 9 months (range 2-50 months for both groups). The proportion of those followed who developed either AIDS or ARC was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier survival method. The percentages of initially asymptomatic SP females with either AIDS or ARC at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 38 months of follow-up were 5, 9, 12, 24, and 43%, respectively. The percentages of SP males with either AIDS or ARC at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months were 1, 7, 30, 39 and 39%, respectively. To date, 39/341 initially asymptomatic SP spouses have developed either AIDS or ARC over the study period. 9/39 (23%) of these SP spouses died, all within 24 months of the initial HIV testing. Conclusion. Asymptomatic SP spouses have developed either AIDS or ARC at an average rate of greater than 1% per month over a calculated 3 year follow-up period. 4144 AIDS RATES, MARKERS AND COFACTORS JJ Goedert*, ME Eyster, RM Friedman, MH Gail* *NCI for the Hemophilia AIDS Study Group, Bethesda MD Objective. To quantify the effects of cofactors and markers on AIDS incidence rates. Methods. We calculated annual conditional probabilities of AIDS (in %, averaged for yrs 8&9a) based on standardized semiannual evaluations of 577 HIV+ hemophiliacs with estimated dates of seroconversion. These conditional probabilities estimate the annual incidence rates per 100 person-years. Time-dependent covariate analysis was used for significance and independence of markers or cofactors. Results. AIDS Annual conditional probabilities of AIDS Age No. Cases Year: 1 2 3 4 5 \"6 substantially lower among children than adults (p=.005) but was unrelated to race, type/severity of hemophilia, or amount of plasma concentrate. T4 counts<150/ul and especially alpha interferon (IFN) >11 IU independently distinguished those at highest risk of AIDS up to 2 years before diagnosis: AIDS observed/expected (p-value) before diagnosis Marker interferon measurements in HIV infected individuals should be used in planning and evaluating treatment and intervention strategies against AIDS. The lower AIDS rate in children may be a clue to host control of HIV relevant to vaccine development. 295 [Page 296](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/294) 4145 PROGRESSION OF LABORATORY VALUES, AIDS MORBIDITY, AND AIDS MORTALITY IN A 6-YEAR COHORT WITH PGL. Robin Edison, DW Feigal, D Kirn, DA Abrams. San Francisco General Hospital, Univ of California, SF, USA Objective. To describe 6-year AIDS morbidity and mortality follow-up and laboratory changes in a cohort of 200 patients with HIV-related persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL). Methods. 200 homosexual men with PGL have been prospectively followed since November,1981 at 6-month intervals through January,1988. Temporal differences in laboratory values were assessed comparing annual laboratory results. Results. 75 men have developed AIDS, and 51 have died.

ALFRED J. SAAH, R.DETELS, B.F.POLK for the Cohort Study (MACS), NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. Ob.iective: To determine the factors that predict the risk of AIDS over time in a prevalent cohort of HIV-1 seropositive gay men followed for 3.5 years. Methods: Demographic, clinical and laboratory variables from 1821 MACS participants were studied with univariate and multivariate techniques, using a stratified analysis in a proportional hazards regression model. In order to control for the time since infection, strata were defined by the entry CD4 number (a known marker of disease progression), and the rate of change in the number of CD4 cells within the first six months of observation. Results: The estimates of the relative hazards from the multivariate analysis for those variables that made independent significant contributions to the final model were:. Hct Platelets ESR LDH Albumin 202 192 196 196 13 17 19 25 24 34 150 178 186 185 199 178 4.5 4.3 4.3 4.1 4.2 4.0 Relative Hazard -F Age log CD8 log2 IgA ARC symptoms HIV-1 antibody DuPont ratio 1.2 for +10 yrs 1.8 for 2x increase 1.4 for 2x increase 1.5 for > 2 1.5 for -1 ratio unit.101 <.001 <.001.092*.004 Conclusion. The cumulative incidence of AIDS and death although low at 3 yrs then steadily increases to at least the 7th year following onset of PGL. Laboratory changes, although statistically significant, occur more slowly for the group with most values still in the normal range. Clinical trials of drugs with laboratory change outcomes would need group sample sizes of approximately 200 per treatment to detect these effects. * one-sided Conclusion: After adjusting for number at entry and change in CD4 cells, the above variables have independent predictive information regarding the development of AIDS. Notes: 4147 HIV-Markers as Prognostic Criteria for the Course of HIV-Infection. 355 sera collected from 120 HIV-infected persons (about 80% homosexual men and 20% i.v.drug abusers) during a four year period (average observation period 16.6 months) were analyzed for HIV-antigen and for presence and titers of various antibodies (anti-core, anti-env, neutralizing, and others). The results were correlated with the clinical course of the patients, both according to clinical and immunological (Walter Reed) stages. At the beginning of the study period 15 patients had AIDS. At the end of the study period 31 patients had progressed to more advanced clinical stages and 30 had AIDS. Almost 100% of healthy HIV-infected persons exhibited the full spectrum of antibody reactivity. With the onset of LAS, ARC, and AIDS the median antibody titers as well as the overall percentage of positive persons decreased progressively. Most prominent was the decline of anti-core and neutralizing antibodies. In parallel, HIV-antigenemia increased. Some of the patients with unchanged clinical stages showed decreasing anti-core titers suggesting that the decrease of anti-core titers precedes clinical deterioration. The data indicate that the combined use of a variety of quantitative anti-body and of HIV-antigen determinations in HIV-infected persons prognostic value. THREE-YEAR **University of Helsinki, ***Academy of Sciences, Finland Objective. To determine those immunological parameters worth following in HIV infection. Methods. Clinical, serological and immunological follow-up of 235 high-risk persons was carried out every three to twelve months. Lymphocyte subpopulations, lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2 production in response to mitogens (PHA, PWM) and to one antigen (PPD) were determined. Results. Initially 23 persons were HIV seropositive, during the follow-up nine seroconversions occurred. Most, but not all, seropositives showed clinical progression. The persons seroconverting during the study did not differ immunologically from the non-infected group before seroconversion. At seroconversion the of CD8+ lymphocytes increased, whereas that of CD4+ lymphocytes decreased only later. A prominent and permanent decline in antigen-induced responses was typically seen immediately after seroconversion. Additionally those HIV+ persons showing clinical progression had a lower antigen-response than those who remained asymptomatic (p<0.01). The number of CD4+ lymphocytes was prognostic only concerning progression from ARC towards AIDS. Conclusion. The progress of HIV infection can be somewiat predicted by monitoring cell-mediated immunity. In addition to clinical and serological (anti-p24, HIV-ag) parameters this should be taken into account while selecting HIV infected persons to therapeutic trials. 296 [Page 297](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/295) 4149 PROGRESSION OF HIV1 DISEASE IN A POPULATION OF SEROPOSITIVE ACTIVE DUTY NAVY AND MARINE CORPS PERSONNEL. Douglas L. Mayers.*,K Wagner*,D Wilson* *U.S. Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland Objective. To determine the rate of HIVI disease progression in screened seropositive active duty military personnel. Methods. We have evaluated 490 HIV1 seropositive personnel with serial evaluations. 100 patients have been followed for >12 months.Each evaluation was individually olassified using a modified Walter Reed classifioation shown below. Results. Progression Data for 12 - 24 Months Follow Up Initial Evaluation Stage-TotaliStage at Final Evaluation Stage Definition Ptsl 1 2 3 4 5 6 - ---- -------- ------------------------- 1 Antibody + Only 18I 4 8 4 0 1 1 2 Lymphadenopathy 551 2 40 10 2 1 0 3 T4(400, Normal DS 171 0 4 10 1 2 0 4 T4(400, Partial DES 71 0 0 4 0 1 2 8 T4(400, Anergy or Thrush 11 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 AIDS 41 0 0 0 0 0 4 Conolusion. At 12 to 24 months followup, 58X of patients remain at the same stage, 32% progress to a higher stage and 10% show regression (within the confines of the staging system). During this interval the patients' T4 cells declined from a mean of 541 to 482 (p <.001, paired t-test). T4 counts also declined an average of 10% in those patients with apparent regression (based on loss of adenopathy or improved DH8 results). Apparent regression should be regarded with caution in the face of declining T4 counts. 4150 EPIDEMIOLOGY-PROGRESSION OF HIV DISEASE BY WALTER REED (WR) STAGE IN THE USAF R. Carr, A. Mumm, R. Zajac, D. Marshall, W. Wolfe, M. Reid, R. Boswell, Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center, Lackland AFB, Texas and Epidemiology Division, Brooks AFB, Texas, USA. Objective. To present data on the progression of disease in patients identified early in the disease course. Methods. Patients underwent mandatory HIV screening, were staged by WR stage, and re-evaluated and re-staged every year. Results. Over 650 HIV+ patients have been identified. >200 have been re-evaluated (mean 1.14 yr). Progression by WR stage was seen in 26% of WR-1, but when pseudo-progression from conversion from WR-1 to WR-2 was factored out, overall progression was 13%. In the patients re-evaluated at 18-24 months, progression was 30%. Additional demographic data and hypothetheses will be presented. Conclusion. Progression by WR stage is additive over time and occurs in approximately 15% of patients per year. Notes: 4151 U.S. Air Force (USAF) HIV Natural History Study. Robert Zajac, S. Abbadessa, R. Jaso, R. Houk, M. Reid, G. Melcher, R. G. Dreesman, A. Mumm, R. Carr, USAF Medical Center, Lackland AFB, TX., U.S.A. Objective: To describe the U.S. Air Force experience in evaluation and staging of over 700 HIV (+) individuals, identified by mandatory force-wide screening and referral of dependents and retirees, and to correlate clinical parameters with presence of advanced Walter Reed (WR) stage or CD4 depletion. Methods: All HIV (+) active duty (AD) USAF members worldwide identified as HIV (+) are referred to WHMC for immunologic evaluation and W.R. Staging. Clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data are entered into a VAX computer databank. Multivariate regression analysis was employed to identify independent correlates of advanced HIV disease. Results: Forcewide screening is 85% complete. 650 individuals have been evaluated. WR-1, 59% (30% were: and proteinuria. All significant p <.05. Conclusions: These parameters which correlate with advanced HIV disease will be useful markers to follow in natural history and early stage therapeutic studies. 4152 FREQUENCY OF OPPORTUNISTIC DISEASES IN AIDS PATIENTS, BY RACE/ETHNICITY AND HIV TRANSMISSION CATEGORIES--UNITED STATES KG Castro, RM Selik, TJ Dondero, JW Curran Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To compare the frequency of opportunistic diseases in AIDS patients, by race/ethnicity. Methods. AIDS cases reported to CDC through 14 January 1988 were stratified by HIV transmission category and analyzed by chi square tests for associations between opportunistic diseases and race/ethnicity. Results. In the 50,389 adults with AIDS, Pneumocystis carinii penumonia was the most common disease (63.2%), and its frequency did not differ signicantly by race/ethnicity or transmission category. In homosexual men who were not intravenous-drug abusers (IVDA), Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) was 2.2 times as whites (16.4%) as in blacks (7.6%). In heterosexual IVDA, the frequency of KS (2.0%) did not differ by race/ethnicity. The frequency of other opportunistic infections was influenced by race/ethnicity independently from the presumed HIV transmission category--tuberculosis, esophageal candidiasis, and extrapulmonary cryptococcosis were twice as common in black as in white AIDS patients (p<.001 in each case); intestinal isosporiasis and toxoplasmosis were at least twice as common in Hispanic as in white AIDS patients (p<.001 in each case). In homosexual men who were not IVDA, Mycobacterium avium infection was more common in black (6.4%) than in white (4.9%) and Hispanic (3.1%) AIDS patients (p<.001 in each case). Conclusion. Knowledge of disease patterns by race/ethnicity should help clinicians anticipate and diagnose HIV-associated conditions. 297 [Page 298](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/296) 4153 TRENDS AND PREDICTIONS ESTIMATED FROM EUROPEAN AIDS SURVEILLANCE DATA: EVALUATION AND UPDATE A.M. Downs*, R.A. Ancelle Park*, J.C. Jager**, J-B. Brunet* * WHO Collaborating Centre on AIDS, Paris, ** National Institute of Public Health, Bilthoven, Netherlands. Objective. To evaluate, on the basis of recent AIDS surveillance data, previous predictions made by this Centre, and to provide updated trends and predictions. Methods. Since Dec. 1985, European surveillance data have been analysed every 6 months to monitor doubling times and to provide regularly updated short-term predictions. The method adopted includes an adjustment of reported data to allow for reporting delays, followed by fitting with an exponential model and should yield over- rather than under- predictions if doubling times are increasing. Adjusted Dec. 1985 data will be compared directly with that actually reported at 31 Dec. 1987. Predictions made in Dec. 1985 will be compared with adjusted Dec. 1987 data. Results. Preliminary results are based on June 1987 data. For the European Community as a whole, data were under adjusted by about 8% and predictions are estimated to be within 10%. There is however a large between- country variation: 18 month- ahead predictions are estimated to range from 25% under (France) to 200% over (Italy). With one exception, currently adjusted case numbers lie within predicted 95% confidence intervals. Conclusion. In 5 out of 8 countries, 18-month ahead predictions are estimated to be within +/- 25%. However, unpredictable changes in reporting patterns, combined with evolutions in doubling times, can make the predictions less reliable. We do not believe it is reasonable to extrapolate more than 2 years ahead. 4154 EUROPEAN AIDS SURVEILLANCE: DYNAMICS OF THE EPIDEMIC R Ancelle-Park, AM Downs, I. de Vincenzi, JB Brunet WHO Collaborating Centre on AIDS, Paris, France Objective. To determine the variations and trends of the AIDS epidemic in Europe. Methods. Cumulative quarterly surveillance data from 28 European countries are collected. Variations of trends between December 1984 and December 1987 are analysed and presented for Europe as a whole and by country. Results. By December 1987 over 10,000 cases had been reported to the Centre. A yearly two-fold increase of reported cases has been observed since December 1984. Comparisons between 1984 and 1987 reveal variations in disease category: a decrease in the percentage of Kaposi's sarcoma (36% vs 24%); age: an increase in the percentage of cases < 30 yr (20% vs 31%); number of female cases: a slight increase (8% vs 11%). These variations are directly related to the high increase in cases reported as being heterosexual IV drug abusers (IVDA) (1% vs 18%). Children with IVDA mothers now account for most of mother-to-child transmission. Epidemiological patterns in southern countries (Italy, Spain) show a predominance of IVDA whereas in most northern countries this group is barely represented. Conclusion. All European countries are faced with the AIDS epidemic. Analysis over time shows large variations both in global trends and in national characteristics. The spread of AIDS among European IVDA play the major role in these variations. Notes: 4155 HIV ANTIBODY TESTING IN A DANISH PROVINCIAL AREA Lars Willumsen, P 0 Schouenborg, I G Sorensen Microbiology Laboratory, Vejle Hospital Objective. To analyze the results of a decentralized offer of HIV antibody testing in 1986 in a part of Jutland representing about 600.000 inhabitants. Methods. Serum or plasma was sent to the laboratory specifically requesting HIV antibody measurement. Abbott HTLV III EIA was used for screening. Confirmatory tests including Western blot analysis were performed at Statens Seruminstitut. Results. Specimens were from 792 patients: Men Women Number (percentage) 484(61) 308(39) Mean age yr (interval) 31.3(16-61) 30.6(20-8o) General practitioners prescribed 85% and hospital departments 15% of the tests. Fifteen tests were positive and lo were confirmed. Out of these were 9 prescribed by general practitioners. All lo positive patients were men with an average age of 29.o years(21-41) and belonging to the known risk groups: 3 homosexuals, 3 drug addicts, 1 homosexual drug addict, 2 Africans, and 1 heterosexual with an African contact. Seven patients were healthy, one had AIDS, one ARC, and one died from opportunistic infections ascribed to concomitant acute myeloid leucaemia. Conclusion. A sample of 792 patients from a provincial area of Denmark, selected mainly by general practitioners, contained lo HIV antibody positive men belonging to the risk groups. 4156 A THREE YEAR FOLLOW-UP OF HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS IN A MIDDLE-SIZED CITY IN BELGIUM: THE NEED FOR A SPECIFIC CONSULTATION. Ph. Henrivaux, Y. Fairon, J. Bury, E. Firre, G. Fillet and H. Van Cauwenberge. Dpt. of Internal Medicine, University of LIEGE, BELGIUM. OBJECTIVE. Liege is a middle-sized city with no important mixing of black populations.Until recently,the need for a specific consultation remained unclear and the medical practitioners seemed to be not concerned enough. METHODS. We analyse the three-year follow-up of our consultation. RESULTS. Fifty-two percent of the patients who are asking medical advice,were discovered to have a positive HIV serology (HIV+).At least one of the classical risk factors characterized 90 % of the consultants vs 98 % of the HIV+.(homo- or bisexuals:30 vs 32 %,intravenous drug addicts:12.6 vs 16.2 %,African people:23 vs 22 %,...). At the first visit,42 % of the patients are asymptomatic HIV+ and 18 % revealed a full-blown AIDS.Oral and/or digestive candidosis and Pneumocystis Carinii pneumonia were the most common infections observed.The proportion of the African people among the new HIV+ cases decreased from 8Q % in 1983-1984 to 20 % in 1986-1987. CONCLUSION. These informations confirm that European people 'ishow directly affected by the HIV infection (European people represents 71 % of all our HIV+ cases). Among these European HIV+ patients,46 % are homo- or bisexuals,attesting that they are more frequently involved.Altough these data concern a less dense popula-ted region,they are comparable to those observed in larger cities and argue for the need for each medical practitioner to pay more attention in his daily practice. 298 [Page 299](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/297) 4157 ANALYSIS OF THE TRENDS OF SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF AIDS CASES REPORTED IN FRANCE A Laporte, B Hubert, A Messiah, JB Brunet Direction G6n6rale de la Sant6, Paris, France Objective. To assess the dynamics of the development of the AIDS epidemic in France. Methods. 3073 cases reported between March 1982 and December 1987 are analysed over time by demographic characteristics and risks groups. Results. Global trends show: a broadening of the distribution by age (increase in the 20-29 yr group since 1985 and in the over 60 yr group since 1984); by geographical distribution (increase of cases reported outside Paris region from 10 to 42%); by occupation (increase of employees, workers and retired). Separate analysis of trends by risk group shows weak variations of demographic characteristics for male homosexuals, no variations for others (drug addicts, transfused cases). Continuous increase of the relative percentage of AIDS cases among IVDA (0 among cases diagnosed before 1984, 16% among cases diagnosed in 1987) concentrated in the south of France (55% of IVDA cases) and in transfusion related cases (0 before 1983, 10% in 1987) plays the major role in the modification of global trends. Conclusion. The AIDS epidemic in France is the sum of several relatively independent epidemics, which reflect the unequal distribution of risk factors in the general population. A detailed analysis of each epidemic is necessary for the conception of prevention programmes. 4158 HIV ANTIBODY PREVALENCE BY RISK GROUP IN 4158 DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE UK E Miller, P A Kaye Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre. Objective. To record the source of requests for HIV screening, the numbers tested and proportion seropositive in risk groups in different parts of the UK. Methods. Clinicians requesting HIV screening from 10 Public Health Laboratories in England provided clinical and epidemiological information on their patients. Three laboratories were in London and seven outside the capital. Results. From Oct. 86-Sept. 87 information on 35,000 patients was collected. 44% of the requests came from genito-urinary clinics, 28% from family doctors and the remainder from other clinic and hospital sources. Table - Selected Risk Group No.Tested No. + % + Male homo/bisexual 4319 284 6.6 Male heterosex. partner of HIV+ person 44 1 2.3 Female heterosex. partner of HIV+ person 120 9 7.5 Lived in Africa 648 36 5.6 Intravenous drug abuser 2712 57 2.1 Transfusion/transplant recipient 1205 8 0.7 Multiple heterosexual partners 4788 11 0.23 Heterosexual partner in a risk group 3296 6 0.18 No known risk 9232 3 0.03 Regional differences were found in antibody prevalance in risk groups inside and outside London; homo/bisex. 14.6% and 3.4% respectively; multiple sexual partners 0.4% and 0.2%. Antibody prevalance was higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic patients; for example 39% of homo/bisex. with lymphadenopathy were seropositive compared to 5% without symptoms. Conclusion. Analysis of laboratory data provides valuable information on the spread of HIV infection in risk groups in different regions of the UK. Notes: 4159 THE EPIDEMIC OF AIDS & HIV INFECTION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (UK) TO 31 DECEMBER 1987 0 N Gill*, G A Ellam*, N S Galbraith*, J A N Emslie** * Laboratory Service,AIDS Co-ordinating **Communicable Diseases(Scotland)Unit,Ruchill,GlasgowG20 Objective Surveillance of the emerging UK AIDS/HIV epidemic Methods Two major data sources are used: voluntary confidential clinical reports of newly diagnosed AIDS cases and reports from over 100 laboratories of HIV antibody positive (AB+ve) tests. Results By end 1987,1227 AIDS cases(including 697 deaths) and 8016 HIV AB+ve tests were reported. Three quarters of the AIDS cases occurred in the South East of England around London,where the cumulative incidence(6.8 per 105) was over 10 times that elsewhere.The rate of HIV AB+ve tests in the South East(31 per 10 )and Scotland (28 per 10 ) was only five times greater than elsewhere. The trend in distribution amongst transmission categories of AIDS cases since 1984 has remained unchanged, over 80% were homo/bisexual men and only 3% IVDA. In contrast, the proportion of HIV AB+ve tests involving IVDA has increased steadily(currently 15%) and from haemophiliac/blood recipients has declined markedly. At present the ratio of AIDS cases to HIV AB+ve tests is 3.5 in homo/bisexual males compared with 35 in IVDA. Five of the AIDS cases and at least 16 HIV AB+ve tests were in persons infected in the UK in whom neither they nor their partners had recognised risk factors. Conclusion Substantially more AIDS cases will occur shortly amongst IVDA in the UK. There is evidence that heterosexual transmission beyond direct contact with persons in the current major risk groups is already taking place. 4160 REGIONAL SURVEILLANCE OF AIDS CASES AND HIV SEROPOSITIVITY AS AN INDICATOR OF TARGET POPULATIONS FOR RISKREDUCTION EDUCATION AND HEALTH-CARE PLANNING John.Emslie, D Goldberg, C Guthrie, D Reid. Communicable Diseases (Scotland) Unit, Ruchill Hospital, Glasgow, Scotland. Scotland accounts for only 9% of the 56 34 million population of the United Kingdom. By the end of 1987, Scotland had contri contributed 39 cases of AIDS to the total of 1227 registered for the UK., ie 3.2%. As for the UK overall (1032 cases, or 84.1%) homosexual/bisexual males predominated in the Scottish total (26 cases, or 66.7%). Female cases are proportionately greater in Scotland (5/39, 12.8%) than in the UK as a whole '(41/1227,3.3%) but the greatest difference relates to IV drug misusers - UK 19/1227 (1.5%) but Scotland 4/39 (10.3%). The potential of the problem is seen more starkly among HIV-seropositive persons who have yet to develop AIDS. IV drug misusers in Scotland constitute 57.3% (792/ 1381) of such persons compared with 7.3% (483/6635) elsewhere in the UK. Related to this, Scotland (64 cases) has more offspring of seropositive parents than has the rest of the UK (23 cases) and of these 64 at least 26 (40.6%) are known to have IV drug-misusing parents. If educational outreach and appropriate health care provision is to be attempted, let alone succeed, identification of specific risk-groups on regional, or even sub-regional, basis is necessary as a basis for cost-effective planning. 299 [Page 300](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/298) 4161 AIDS IN THE FRG: ANALYSIS OF PREVALENCE ACCORDING TO RISK GROUPS AND PLACE OF RESIDENCE Christiane Schneider, R. Bunikowski, J. L'age-Stehr, B. Schwartlinder, M.A. Koch Nationales AIDS Zentrum am Bundesgesundheitsamt, Berlin, FRG First AIDS cases in FRG were reported in 1982 in 6 homosexual men. At the end of 1987 a total of 1669 cases has been reported. Homosexual men contribute to more then 75 % to the total. Drug addicts make up 8 % and hemophiliacs 6 %. The unveven geographic distribution of groups at risk for HIV infection is reflected in different prevalence of AIDS in large cities (135/Million) and other areas (9/Million) of the FRG. The contribution of the different risk groups to the total of AIDS cases has not changed significantly during the time of observation. From an analysis of AIDS cases it can not be deduced that a significant spread of HIV into the general 4162 PREVALENCE OF ANTI-HIV-2 ANTIBODIES IN PORTUGAL Francisca Avillez*, A Pista*, A Benito-Garcia*, L Ayres* *National Institute of Health, Lisbon, Portugal Objective. HIV-2 is endemic in certain regions of West Africa with which Portugal maintains close relations at present,as it has done in the past. It was thought convenient to test for anti-HIV-2 antibodies in groups at risk and in other groups considered important. Methods. A total of 1114 sera were studied from the following groups:homosexuals/bisexuals, IV drug users, transfused individuals,prostitutes,heterosexual contacts of HIV-2 positive individuals, patients with ARC/AIDS and individuals from West Africa.Elisa(ELAVIA) and Western Blot were the techniques employed. Results. HIV-2 positive cases were detected in all, groups,except in tle IV drug users. The greatest incidence of latent HIV-2 infection was found in individuals from West Africa(Cape Verde Islands and Guinea-Bissau) and in prostitutes. Conclusions.Because of the great number of individuals of West African origin working in Portugal and because of continuing contacts with West African countries we are establishing surveillance programmes to determine the exact extension of the problem. population via heterosexual transmission has taken place. Notes: 4163 IMMUNOLOGICAL STUDIES OF TWO POPULATIONS AT RISK OF HIV INFECTION: DRUG ADDICTS AND HEMOFILIACS. 3. Castro e Melo, E. Santos, M. Campos, C Vasconcelos Serviqo de Imunologia, Hospital de St. Antdnio, PORTO, PORTUGAL. Objective. To provide a better characterization of immunological changes due to HIV infection in two risk groups. Methods. I Subjects: (1)- Hemofiliacs (HF)- Fifty Portuguese males with a high factor deficiency treated mainly with home-made factor preparations, 8 seropositive for HIV (HIV+). (2)-Drug addicts (DA) - 110 individuals, comprising 24 Portuguese with 2 HIV and 86 nonPortuguese with 58 HIV+. Studies: Clinical and immunological data obtained by current procedures. Results. Most of the HIV+ subjects (HF and DA) showed the following changes: high serum IgG and IgM, low numbers of T4 and B cells, normal numbers of T8 cells and a decreased response in delayed hypersensitivity skin tests (DHST); most were in Walter-Reed (WR) stages 1-2 (ca 10% in WR 3 to 5). Statistical studies suggest that the decrease in T4 cells is followed more closely by B cells than by T8 cells. The non-infected (HIV-) subjects showed as dominant changes: high serum levels of IgM, high numbers of T4, T8 and B cells, reduced DHST and, for the HF, high IgG. Among the HIV-DA, both those with and'without evidence of HBV infection had the same immunological profile. The Portuguese HIV-showed a much lower incidence of the changes described. Conclusions. The low rate of infection by HIV in the HF is due to the scarce use of comercial concentrate, whereas in the Portuguese DA is probably due to a peculiar epidemiology (sugested by the lesser changes in the HIV-). The immunological alterations that occur in HIV+ subjects (HF and DA) represent the known effects of HIV infection overimposed on the peculiar immunological profile of HIV- HF and DA and, therefore, are better characterized (and used for follow-up of the infection) as changes with time of the latter profile than by reference to normal values. In this respect, DHST is of little value. 4164 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL, CLINICAL AND IMMUNOLO6ICAL EXPERIENCE WITH HIV INFECTION IN DIFFERENT RISK POPULATIONS IN THE NORTHERN OF SPAIN V. CArcaba, JA Carton, V Asensi, A Fernindez-Le6n, JA Haradona, Hedicina, Oviedo, Spain OBJETIVE: To describe five-year-hospital experience in the management of HIV infection in Spain. METHODS: The study was performed between 1983-1987 in the population at risk dependent of our teaching hospital. Prevalence was analyzed by anti-HIV-ELISA test and confirmed by IF or Nestern-blot techniques. A randomized subgroup of each colective was immunologically tested using monoclonal antibodies.

Homosexuals could be infected by drug-addicts through heavily infected subjets joining both risk groups. Antibody prevalence and disease severity were inversaly related to number of T-helper cells and T4/T8 ratio. Spanish hospitals must be ready for attendance of the ever-growing number of expected HIV infected patients, generated by this overwhelming epidesy. 300 [Page 301](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/299) 4165 INCIDENCE OF AIDS IN SPANISH HIV INFECTED PATIENTS JM Gatell, D Podzamczer, B Clotet, I Oca~a, C Estany, M Figuerola, DMariscal and BARCELONA AIDS STUDY GROUP Hospitals Clinic, Bellvitge, Tarrasa, Germans Trias, Gerona and Vail d'Hebron. Barcelona. Spain. Objective: To describe the incidence of AIDS (CDC criteria of August 1987) among persons infected with the HIV in Barcelona (Spain). Methods: A total of 1830 people who were at high risk for AIDS, had enrolled in cohort studies of homosexual men, parenteral drug users and hemophiliacs before december 1986. A total of 716 were either HIV seropositive at enrollment or seroconverted subsequently, and could be followed-up. 478 of the 716 were drug addicts. Results: The AIDS developed in 66 (9.2%) during a median follow-up period of 18 months (range 12 to 60 months). Using actuarial survival calculations, the 5-year incidence of AIDS among all HIV seropositive subjects was 32% (range 8% to 56%). Among the homosexuals, drug addicts and hemophiliacs cohorts the incidence was 11%, 18% and 33% respectively (P=0.03). Comparing the survival functions the risk of developing AIDS was significantly greater among those presenting with, or developing during the follow-up period, an ARC (73% at 4-years; range 64% to 93%; P<0.00001). Conversely, the risk was not significantly higher among those developing an Herpes Zoster. Conclusion: The risk of AIDS development after 5 years of HIV infection was 32% and the progression rate among drug addicts was significantly lower. 4166 HIV INFECTION IN LAS PALMAS. J Gomez, J Diaz, R Perez, O Suarez-Janariz, Z Gonzalez-Lama. Hospital Insular, Las Palmas de G. Canaria, Spain. Objetive. We wish report here the cases of AIDS and the prevalence of anti-HIV in Las Palmas ( Canary Islands, Spain) from 1985 (ith case report) until January 1988. Methods. Antibodies to HIV have been studied with ELISA test from comercial kits (Abbott). AIDS and ARC patients were outpatients and hospitalized patients defined as by CDC guide rules. Results. We found 49 positive sera anti-HIV in 277 homose xual bisexual men (17.7%), 43 positives in 215 IV drug user(20%), 39 positives in 60 hemophiliacs (65%), 2 positives in 34 transfusion recipients(5.9%), 7 positives in 198 heterosexual contacts(3.5%), 6 positives in 561 blood donors (1%), 3 positives from 4 children were born to a mother who has anti-HIV(75%), and 7 positives in 350 persons in prison(2%). We have detected 12 ARC patients and 17 AIDS patients. All ARC patients are men(7 homosexuals and 5 IV durg users); 11 are.between the ages 20 and 40 years old and 1 is 62 years old. Among 17 AIDS patients (16 adults and 1 child), 94% are between the ages of 20 and 45 years old; 82% are men(86% homosexual/bisexual and 14% IV drug users); 8 of these (7 adults and 1 child) 17 AIDS patients have died(47%). Pneumocystis pneumonia have been diagnosed in 29% of the patients with AIDS. Kaposi's sarcoma have been found in 42% of these patients. Conclusion.In Las Palmas (Canary Islands, Spain) the distribution of cases of AIDS by patient category are similar to HIV infection in developing countries. Notes: 4167 lomo, T.

Osterwalder/R. Engel/N. Billo/A. Janett/H. Vorkauf/ B. Somaini; Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, Berne Investigations on the frequency and distribution of risk behaviour, transmission, HIV morbidity and mortality constitute the basis of our preventive programme. The most important, intervention-oriented, results are presented in a survey. Risk Behaviour: Frequent partner changes, casual partners and sexual contacts at an early age are not rare but the use of condoms is. Approx. 0.2% of the population are i.v. drug addicted. AIDS Cases: 355 cases had been reported by 31.12.1987. There was an increase of 250% (39 persons) from 1986 to 1987 among i.v. drug addicts, 230% (15 persons) among heterosexuals and 100% (73 persons) among homosexuals. We expect a total of 3,500 cases of AIDS by 1991. HIV Infected: The estimated number of 20-30,000 infected persons comprises several, in part over-lapping smaller epidemics with their own dynamics: approximately 50% of the i.v. drug addicted, 15% of the homosexual and some 0.003-1.0% of the heterosexual population (0.1-0,5% of the women in childbearing age). The virus has spread rapidly in an extremely short time, the first positive sera were detected in 1979. 4170 THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV INFECTION IN SICILY:OUR EXPERIENCE. AIDS in Sicily,parti cularly the number and distribution of cases among risk groups. Methods.Seroepidemiological analysis were carried out by us on 1000 individuals.We investigated anti-HIV1 Ab by Elisa technique.Positive specimens were confirmed by Western blotting. Results.Up to 31st December 1987 532 subjects were found to be HIV seropositive both by Elisa and Western blotting. 30 patients had full-blown AIDS,Z20 had LAS/ARC. The highest anti-HIV prevalence was found in drug abusers e.v. of whom 468/684 (68,42%),were positive. From 1985 to 1987 the HIV-seropositives growwnfrom 197 to 532. Conclusion.Althoug a delay in the onset of the Sicilian epidemic,we conclude that the number of infected individuals has fastly increased. Thus,we believe it is possible that AIDS becomes one of the most important diseases in Sicily. Notes: 4171 SEROEPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV INFECTION University Verona - Italy. Objective. To evaluate the present status of HIV infection among IVDU in the Venetian Regions. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 1047 IVDU residing in various towns and a perspective study was conducted on a small group (67 subjects) between 1983 and 1987. Results. 35.7% of IVDU were positive. The prevalence was similar in both male and female groups. A wide range was noted in the observed areas (7.4% in Udine;22.2% in Trieste;31% in Verona;32.8% in in in Pordenone). The annual seroconversion ra te was 12.2% in the 1983-85 period and 4.3% in the 1985 -87 period. No ARC or AIDS cases were recorded among this group. The seroprevalence in a needle-sharing IVDU group was 68% in contrast with no positivity found in those who adopt a non promiscuous use of syringes. Conclusion.In our country awide range of HIV infection prevalence among IVDU was recorded.Between 1983-1987 in a small group,perspectively studied,we noted a decrease of the annual seroconversion rate,possibly in relation to behavioural changes. The most striking risk factor linked to seropositivity was needle-sharing. 4172 LABORATORY BASED SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM FOR HIV INFECTIONS Carlo A Perucci*, P Chierchini*, N Orchi* * Epidemiology Unit, Latium Region, Rome, Italy Objective. - To estimate the prevalence of HIV infections among NHS patients. - To evaluate the screening and diagnostical activities of NHS laboratories. Methods. A surveillance system for HIV infection has been implemented since July 1985 in Latium Region (5.000.000 inhabitants). NHS laboratories anonimously report individual records.of a-HIV cases, with social and demographic risk characteristics. A record-linkage provides controls for repeated testing. Data about quantity and characteristics of screening and confirmatory tests employed are also collected. Preliminary results. An average of 250.000 tests for year were estimated. Data of 4710 seropositive cases were available. The distribution of social and demographic risk factors and an estimate of direct costs of HIV diagnostical pro cess are presented. 302 [Page 303](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/301) 4173 SEROPREVALENCE OF HIV INFECTION IN THE THE VENETIAN REGIONS.

The purpose of our work was to evaluate the spreading of HIV infection by sex in Milan,Italy. Methods. Outpatients of our STD Clinic were investigated for sexual behaviour, history of previous STD and signs and symptoms of AIDS from June 1985 to December 1987. Serology for HIV was performed in all patients. All patients were controlled every 3 months. Results. The Table lists the prevalence of HIV-positive subjects in different behavioural categories. 1985 1986 (not DA) 5/0 27/0 65/0 Among prevalence was related to promiscui ty and to syphilitic and gonococcal infections. A retrospective study of a group of highly promiscuous homosexuals revealed an increase of seropositivity from 6.5% of '83 to 24.7% of '87,with a year rate of seroconversion of about 4%.Heterosexual transmission of HIV was found in 1.8% of subjects with occasional sexual contacts with sero positives and in 9.8% of regular partners of seropositives. Conclusion. In Milan,HIV infection by sex spreading among promiscuous homosexuals,while heterosexual transmission is confined to IVD contacts.

Notes: 4175 EPIDEMIOLOGIC PATTERNS OF INFECTION WITH HIV IN SARDINIA. A MULTICENTRE STUDY P. Farci, G. Orgiana, M. E Lai, A. Mandas, D. De A. T. Chessa, A. I - University of Cagliari. Objective: To assess the epidemiology of HIV infection in Sardinia, an island with an ethnically homogeneous population. Methods: Sera from: in 1978-87; 784 polytransfused thalassemia major patients, 618 of whom in pediatric age; 32 hemophiliacs; 178 chronic hemodialyzed patients; 189 psychiatric patients; and 35,825 volunteer blood donors, collected in 1985-87, were tested for anti-HIV by ELISA and Western blot, and the characteristics of anti-HIV positive patients were analyzed. Results: Among PDA, the prevalence rose from 0.7% in 1981 to 62% in 1986-87. Anti-HIV was found in 4% of pediatric 5% of adult thalassemic patients, 33% of hemophiliacs, 0.11% of blood donors, 0.5% of psychiatric patients and none of chronic hemodialyzed patients. We did not observe increased prevalence among polytransfused subjects in 1986-87 with respect to 1985 due to screening of blood donations for anti-HIV since October 1985. Conclusions: The first identified case of HIV infection in Sardinia among PDA was in 1981, but the current seroprevalence of 62% denotes its epidemic spread. All anti-HIV positive blood donors were PDA, suggesting that HIV infection in Sardinia is mainly confined to PDA and polytransfused subjects. 4176 OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS IN AIDS. CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT 600 CASES. Giampiero Carosio, F Castellio, A Matteellio, Regione Lombardia The distribution and clinical features of opportunistic infections in 600 AIDS patients (as notified to the Hygiene Service of the Region Lombardy -Italy by the different Infectious Departements) are reviewed. The data have been elaborated by statistical means in order to detect significant patterns of Opportunistic Infections with respect to risk groups (drug addicts, homo- and bi-sexuals, haemophyliacs, transfused, contacts to immunological status. Oesophageal candidiasis resulted the main opportunistic infection in drug addicts (65% of cases), but not in homosexuals (27%), in which sarcoma meningoencephalitis (23%). The results are discussed at the light of the peculiar epidemiological characteristics of AIDS in Italy (62% of AIDS cases in drug addicts). 303 [Page 304](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/302) 4177 PROPHYLACTIC AND SEROLOGICAL SCREENING OF REGION/POLAND.?iotr Bororn, E.Bobrowska, A.Kaczmarska, W.Rembergowa, Diseases, Blood Donors Center/Bialystok. Objective:The aim of this study is to estimate in selected potentially risk population, possible presence of Anti-HIV-Antibodies in serum. Methods: The analysed material included: 20189 / and wemen/, 10 hemophiliacs, 49 haemodialized patients, 30 i.v. drug abusers 250 chronic alcoholics and 298 patients with clinical severe symptoms of infectious diseases who were examined to differentiate for AIDS /total 20826 people/. The serum samples for Anti-HIV-Antibodies were to ELISA method /ABBOTT/USA/. Results: Anti-FIV-Antibodies in serum were not found in any of the subjects from the examined groups. Conclusion: HIV- infection was not found in the analysed population af the north eastern province of Poland. 4178 CLINICAL ASPECTS OF PATIENTS WITH AIDS AND ARC F Varnai Chair of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Postgraduate Medical School, Budapest, Hungary 25 patients with AIDS and ARC were treated in our Institute between September 1986 and January 1988, 9 of them developed full-blown AIDS. Regular control is of great importance in the care of patients /physical examination, psychological follow-up, certain serological tests, e.g. CMV, toxoplasma, etc., immunological tests and the bacteriological and parasitological examination of the sputum and stool/. Three patients died /the causes of death were: B lymphoma, HIV encephalopathy in one case, extended generalised toxoplasmosis in the third/. Besides the antiviral treatment in early stages of ARC the author attaches great importance to the early diagnosis of certain common and opportunistic infections and to targeted chemotherapy in the slowing down of the progression of the underlying disease as well as the profilactic treatment for opportunistic protosoal diseases.

Svirtlih, S.Zerjav, Dj.Jevtovic, M.Pelemis Institute for Infectious Diseases, Belgrade Objective. To present the results of the first screening for HIV antibodies and follow-up of the patients in a high risk group in Yugoslavia Methods. 50 sera samples from 40 drug abusers were collected in the Institute for Infectious Diseases in Belgrade during the period 1979 -1983. Testing of sera were performed in 2 laboratories in Paris and Lyon by ELISA and positive ones retested by Western blot method. During the follow-up period testings were performed by the same methods. The testings for HBV markers were performed in 38 patients by RIA in the Institute. Results. The results of the testing in 1983 revealed that 5 samples(lo%) were positive. Two serum samples(from 2 patients) were taken in 1981, being the first proved carriers of HIV infection in Yugoslavia. After 4 years, 19 patients from the same group were retested by the same method and 8(42%) were found positive. Only one patient from this group developed full-up AIDS and died in this period. In 38 sera viral markers for HBV infection were present in 23 (63%). Conclusion.From these results the authors conclude that drug abusers in Belgrade are at especially high risk for contracting HIV infection. 4182 PREVALENCE OF HIV-1 ANTIBODIES IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA M.Br5ikovX,L.Syr5dekxJ. ejdaxx D.KopeckdX,K.Voj tchovsk'x x Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology,Prague xx Postgraduate Medical Institute,Prague Objective.Study of the spread of HIV-1 infection in Czechoslovakia.

The three Bulgarians were tested for HIV-antibodies after their last coming back to Bulgaria(Sept.-Nov.1987).All sera were \"reactive\" in Abbott recombinant HTLV III EIA and expressed complete patterns of antibodies to HIV1 in DuPont HIV-1 Western blot.None of men denied sexual contacts in Central Africa and because of their long stay there, all 3 sera were examined additionally in Elavia LAV-2 Western Blot. All sera showed antibodies to at least gp140(two of them to gp105 too) and some antibo dies to the internal HIV-2 proteins - mainly p26 and p68. Conclusion. Double infection with HIV-1 and HIV-2 could be found not only in patients with AIDS, but in healthy seropositives, too. 4184 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE FIRST CASE OF AIDS DETECTED IN THE USSR Vadim V. Pokrovsky,Z.K.Suvorova, V.I.Pokrovsky Central Institute of Epidemiology,USSR,Moskow The penetration and spread of HIV has been detected in the USSR.The infection was brought by a homosexual man who got infected in East Africa in 1982.In the USSR he infected 5 of his 22 bisexual partners.One of bisexuals gave the virus to 2 of 6 female partners and to 5 of 6 recipients of his blood.One of his seropositive female partners gave birth to a girl,who was seropositive at the age of 4 months and negative at 8 months.The second seronositive bisexual infected 1 of his 5 female partners.Non of 11 female partners of 3 other seropositive bisexuals are seropositive. A-20 305 [Page 306](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/304) 4185 A TREND ANALYSIS OF THE FIRST 50,000 AIDS CASES REPORTED IN THE UNITED STATES E. Thomas Starcher, T Dondero, M Noa, J Efird, J Curran Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To describe temporal, geographic, patient characteristic, and disease trends for AIDS cases reported to CDC from June 1981 through December 1987. Methods. Data from AIDS cases reported to CDC were divided into quartiles of 12,500 based on date of report and analyzed for trends over time. Results. The first 12,500 AIDS cases (quartile 1) were reported to CDC from June 1981 through August 1985 (51 months) and the last 12,500 cases (quartile 4) from June through December 1987 (7 months). The proportion of cases reported from New York (NY) decreased from 36% to 19%; the proportion from New Jersey (NJ), Florida (FL), and California (CA) remained constant at 36%, and the proportion from all other areas increased from 28% to 46%. More cases were reported from CA in quartile 4 than from NY. The proportion of all reported AIDS patients who are women increased significantly from 7% to 9% (p<0.001). The proportion of homosexual or bisexual AIDS patients decreased from 74% to 69%, and the proportion of adult patients with Kaposi's sarcoma alone decreased from 19% to 9%. The proportion of AIDS cases by race remained unchanged. The proportion of AIDS patients aged 30-39 decreased from 48% to 46% (p=0.02) and that for patients over 60 years of age increased (p<0.001). Conclusion. Through the first 7 years of the epidemic, small but significant changes in AIDS trends have been observed. The proportions of all AIDS patients who are women, who are heterosexual men and women, and who live in areas other than CA, FL, NJ, and NY are increasing. 4186 AIDS IN FOREIGN-BORN HISPANICS IN THE UNITED STATES: CUMULATIVE INCIDENCE AND TRANSMISSION MODE BY COUNTRY OF BIRTH RM Selik, KG Castro, M Pappaioanou, AIDS Program, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA Objective. To compare cumulative incidence (CI) and mode of transmission of AIDS in foreign-born U.S. Hispanics by country of birth. Methods. AIDS cases were those in U.S. residents reported to the Centers for Disease Control between June 1, 1981, and January 25, 1988. CI was the number of AIDS patients born in a particular country per million U.S. population born in that country, as reported by the Bureau of the Census for 1980. Puerto Rico (a U.S. territory) was analyzed here as if it were a foreign country. CI was analyzed by region of residence in the U.S. and transmission mode. Significance of differences was tested by first-order Taylor series estimates of 99% confidence intervals around relative risks. Results. Overall, CI was greater in U.S. residents born in Puerto Rico (1,160.7) than in those born in Mexico (159.1), Cuba (788.1), or other Latin American countries (603.9) (p<0.01). The proportion of AIDS cases in heterosexual intravenous drug abusers (IVDA) was 56% for persons born in Puerto Rico and 3-5% for other foreign-born Hispanics. For IVDA-associated AIDS, CI in persons born in Puerto Rico was greater than CI in persons born in Mexico, Cuba, and other Latin American countries in each of the 4 U.S. regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). Conclusion. The risk of IVDA-associated AIDS in persons born in Puerto Rico exceeds that in other foreign-born Hispanics, regardless of their region of residence in the United States. Notes: 4187 CORRELATION OF CUMULATIVE INCIDENCE OF AIDS WITH POPULATION SIZE OF METROPOLITAN AREAS RM Selik, KG Castro, M Pappaioanou AIDS Program, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA Objective. To compare the cumulative incidence (CI) of AIDS in metropolitan areas of different population sizes. Methods. We analyzed the 50,192 cases in U.S. residents reported to the Centers for Disease Control between June 1, 1981, and January 25, 1988. The CI of AIDS was the number of cases in a metropolitan area per million population in the area, as reported for the 318 standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSAs) identified in the 1980 census. We assessed the association between the CI and population by the Spearman rank correlation. We also calculated the CI for 5 categories of SMSA population size and a 6th category consisting of persons outside SMSAs. Results. CI of AIDS was correlated with population size of SMSAs (p=0.0001). Of the 318 SMSAs, only 4 in the smallest population size category had no cases. CI of AIDS by Population Size of SMSAs % of % of % of CI of Population Size SMSAs Population AIDS Cases AIDS Outside SMSAs - 25.2 5.1 44.6 50,000-250,000 52.8 10.5 3.5 73.2 12.4 7.7 137.4 1,000,001-2,000,000 6.9 13.9 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 221.5 Conclusion. AIDS is predominantly an urban disease; the incidence is highest in the most populous metropolitan areas. 4188 Extent of HIV Infection in the United States A Review of Available Information. Timothy Dondero*, and HIV Data Analysis Team*,** *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta GA; **Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, Washington, D.C., USA Objective. To assess the existing levels and trends of HIV infection in the United States. Methods. All available data on HIV prevalence and incidence in the United States were reviewed, including over 300 published and unpublished surveys and studies. Results. HIV infection in the U.S. remains largely confined to the populations at recognized risk: typically 20%-50% seroprevalence in homosexual men; 50%-60% in IV-drug users on the East Coast to <5% in most other areas: 70% in hemophilia A in hemophilia B patients; and 10%-60% in heterosexual partners of infected persons. In segments of the general population, rates include 0.04% for first time-blood donors; 0.14% for military applicants (adjusted); for entrants; 0.19%-0.87% statewide for childbearing women; and 0.30% for sentinel hospital patients. HIV prevalence still appears very low in heterosexual persons not using IV drugs and without sexual contact with persons at increased risk; 80%-90% of interviewed seropositives in low-prevalence groups have identifiable risks. Prevalence varies widely by geographic area and is higher in males, young to early middle-aged adults, and blacks and Hispanics. Trends have been stable for 2 years in military applicants and blood donors. New infection rates have declined in observed cohorts of homosexual men. Conclusion. Further HIV prevalence and incidence data are needed to target and evaluate HIV prevention programs and to monitor the HIV-AIDS epidemic. 306 [Page 307](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/305) 4189 HIGH PREVALENCE OF HIV ANTIBODY IN HETEROGENOUS POPULATIONS IN THE BRONX, NEW YORK CITY (Bx, NYC) Ellie E Schoenbaum*, M Webber*, J Ernst**, K Davenny*, H Gayle*** *Montefiore Med. Center & **Bronx Lebanon Hospital Ctr., Bronx, New York, & ***CDC, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A. Objective. To determine the prevalence of HIV antibody Ab) in heterogenous samples of adolescents and adults, from a location with a high rate of AIDS in heterosexual intravenous drug users (IVDUs) and sex partners. Methods. During May-October,1987,HIV Ab was determined in anonymous discard sera from three Bx,NYC hospitals serving poor non-Whites. Sera from 95% aged 15-49 yrs were from: 1)tests for syphilis exposure at a central x hospital (VDRL) 2)adults evaluated at an emergency room in south Bx (ER 3)pediatric chemistry hospital lab in central Bx (PEDS). Sera were linked to age, sex, race, insurance, zip code, clinic/in-patient ward, \"blood precaution\" status, VDRL titer and, in ER sera, diagnosis and HIV risk factor from chart review. Duplicates were excluded. Results. In ER 14.1%(20/142) had HIV Ab. Of seropositives 6~5(13/20) were from known IVDUs and one AIDS case. HIV Ab was present in 4.3%(38/894) of VDRL and 1.7%(2/120) of PEDS sera. No Ab was present in persons aged 15-18(n=165). For all groups the prevalence of HIV Ab increased with age: 1.3%(3/228) aged 14-19, aged 40-49. HIV Ab was present in 15.5%(41/265) of males and 1.2% (9/776) of females (p<.05), both with mean age 34 yrs. No racial differences were noted in the VDRL sample: Blacks 3.3%(9/270), Hispanics 5.4%(25/466), Whites 4.7% (3/64) (p=NS). Conclusion. HIV infection is occurring at a high rate in young and middle-aged adults in the Bx, NYC, presotntyly sparing adolescents under 19. Further characteri ation of the samples is needed to explain the striking difference in prevalence between males and females. The high level of HIV Ab in males has disturbing implications for spread of HIV among female heterosexual partners in the Bronx. 4190 HIV SEROPREVALENCE AT COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL, CHICAGO. Renslow Sherer, D Seibert, R Cadena, S Allen, J delaCerda, P Tsui, R Sable, J Giner,J Kowalski, M Telischi, M Sonnenberg, C Kallick. The Cook County Hospital AIDS Service and Blood Bank. Purpose: To study the prevalence of HIV in persons at risk in a public hospital. Method: From 11/17//86 to 7/31/87, 576 individuals with a risk of HIV infection were identified in the ER, clinics, and wards. Class IV HIV infection was excluded. All were counseled and tested with EIA (Abbott) and confirmatory western blot. Results: Overall, 36.6% tested positively: TABLE I N pos % gay/bi males 181 110 60.8% gay/bi + ivdu hetero ptnrs of above 50 12 24.0 infants of women at risk 10 3 30.0 transfusion recipients 20 2 10.0 hemophiliacs 3 2 66.7 mult hetero partners only 66 6 9.1 occupational exposure 6 0 0 household contacts 28 0 0 TOTALS 579 212 36.6% Conclusions: People at risk of HIV in urban public hospitals have a higher than expected prevalence of HIV infection. Aggressive counseling and testing, and periodic blinded sampling in this setting are warranted. Notes: 4191 GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS OF RISK FOR AIDS IN NEW YORK STATE J. Stan Lelman*, B. Truman*, J. Mikl*,. Morse** New York State Department of Health, Albany, New York,USA Objective: To identify distinct geographic regions of risk for AIDS within New York State (NYS) and compare the epidemiologic characteristics of those regions. Methods: 12,062 AIDS cases (27% of U.S.A. total) from the 62 counties of NYS were classified into five groups. The two classification criteria were: 1) degree of urbanization; and 2) proximity to the New York City (NYC) epi-center. We compared AIDS incidence rates and the proportional distribution of cases by selected variables in the five regions of risk. Results: The five regions were clearly distinguishable by cumulative incidence rates and by the proportional distribution of cases by risk, race and mortality. Incidence rates per 100,000 adult population varied considerably by region, ranging from 175.3 in NYC; to 23.8 in the region closest to NYC; 14.9 in the region mid-way between NYC and rural NYS; 9.3 in the urban counties of northern NYS; and 3.9 in the rural counties of NYS. Conclusion: With the exception of the urban counties of Northern NYS, regions which are closer to NYC have higher incidence. This supports the hypothesis that the AIDS epidemic in NYS continues to emanate from urban epicenters, of which NYC is the oldest and largest. Further, theyprovide a useful and manageable framework for evaluating the progress of the AIDS epidemic in a large and diverse geographic area. 192 ^Surveillance of HIV infection in an urban population of I million BA DeBuono*, HD Scott*, CE Haskell*, R. Yankee **. The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDH)* and the Rhode Island Blood Center(RIBC)**. Providence, RI, USA OBJECTIVE: To outline the course of HIV infection in a \"low\" prevalence population from 1983-1987. METHODS: Since 1983 RIDH has required reporting of all AIDS cases. Since 3/85, data on HIV+ individuals have been collected and include results from Counselling and Testing Clinics (CTS), the RIBC, and the US Armed Forces. RESULTS: AIDS cases first appeared in RI in '83 during which 7 cases were reported. In the next four years there were 7, 14, 39, 77. 85% were male, 33% IVDAs, 79% whites, 21% minorities. Voluntary testing and counselling commenced in '85. Annual clinic visits increased from 291, to 518, to 2041. In contrast to the AIDS cases 36% have been female; 7.2% minorities; and 8.6% IVDAs. Of males 30.8% reported being homosexual. Over the three years the HIV+ rate for gay men went from 13.0%, to 20.0%, to 5.8%. This same pattern was noted in IVDAs: 8.6%, 13.0%, 7.4%; and Seroprevalence for whites Minorities accounted for 19.4% of HIV+ individuals. From 10/85-9/87 three of 3.978 (0.08%) military recruits were HIV positive about 1/2 the national rate of 0.15%. All were male, two white and one black. Blood donors have been HIV tested since 3/85. By 12/87 26 of 152,451(0.017%) were HIV+, about 1/2 the national rate of 0.040%. 25 of 26 were male. None of 6,000 17 year old donors was HIV+. CONCLUSION: In Rhode Island HIV infection is well established in high risk groups but not to the extent seen in many urban areas. Among blood donors and military recruits HIV is quite rare. Voluntary testing and counselling programs in Rhode Island are beginning to reach high risk individuals, particularly gay men but the modest number of IVDAs and minorities seen in clinic indicates a need for expanded outreach. The annual change in HIV+ rates may indicate a change in the occurrence of new infections and/or a change in the threshold, which high risk persons use, for visiting a counselling and testing clinic. Methods of ascertainment of the new infection rate are urgently needed. 307 [Page 308](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/306) 4193 HIV SEROPREVALENCE AT AN ALTERNATE TEST SITE IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA Wayne D Johnson, FS Sy, KL Jackson University of South Carolina School of Public Health Columbia,SC 29208 USA Objective. To determine the prevalence of HIV antibody (HIVAb) among different demographic and risk behavior groups in Charleston, SC, from May 1985 to June 1987. Methods. Demographics and risk behavior were obtained before testing of 990 clients at the alternate test site. Repeat ELISA positives were confirmed by Western blot. Prevalence of HIVAb was calculated for each group. Logistic analysis was used to determine odds ratios for significant predictors of positivity. Results. 16% of all tests performed were HIVAb positive. Reported risk whites blacks All When compared with clients reporting no risk, the odds of positivity was 15.5 times greater for homo/bisexual men, and 4.5 times greater for persons reporting heterosexual contact with a known HIVAb positive or high risk partner. Conclusion. Although this state is considered a low endemic area for AIDS, the high rate of HIVAb obtained in this study was comparable with that of higher risk areas of the US. As elsewhere in the US the rate was highest among gay men, but particularly high among blacks in most risk groups. There was a high prevalence (18%) among men reporting heterosexual HIV contact. 4194 PREVALENCE OF AIDS RISK FACTORS IN THE POPULATION OF THE STATE OF Dept. of Health Services, ***ViRx, Inc., California Objective. A major challenge of planning for the AIDS epidemic has been the lack of reliable population-based estimates of the size and composition of behaviorallydefined AIDS risk groups. This study has yielded the first population-based estimates of incidence of risk behaviors among a large-scale community, the State of California. Methods. Data was collected by telephone through a random digit dial probability sampling of 2,012 California households, with a response rate of 72%. Results/Conclusions. Preliminary analysis indicates that of approximately 19 million adult Californians, 1.6% (CI = 1.0-2.2%) or 309,000 individuals indicate usage of intravenous drugs at least once in their lives. 11.3% (CI = 9.9-12.7%) or 2,190,000 individuals are heterosexuals reporting two or more sex partners or one or more high risk sex partners in the last year. 2.75% of men (CI = 1.8-3.7) or 259,000 individuals self-identify as gay or bisexual. 3.9% (CI = 3.1-4.8%) or 767,000 individuals say they are sure of contact with a member of an AIDS high risk group: an intraveous drug user, bisexual or homosexual male, or someone with HIV infection. In addition to these data on risk, data from populationbased accessopoints such as blood banks, family planning facilities, and STD clinics have been collected. Seroprevalence data derived from other studies can be combined with these population-based data to estimate the size of the infected population in California. Notes: 4195 CLINICAL AND LABORATORY FEATURES OF 200 HIV ANTIBODY-POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS FROM AN ALTERNATE TEST SITE John Howard, J. Sperling, and R. Mahon, Edelman Health Center, Los Angeles, CA. Objective. To describe the clinical and laboratory features of the first 100 HIV antibody-positive persons seen at an alternate test site in Los Angeles (Group I) and compare them with 100 recently seen HIV antibodypositive individuals (Group II). Methods. History, physical examination and laboratory information were obtained on the first 100 HIV antibody-positive persons from an alternate test site in 1985. Data was compared with similar data from 100 HIV antibody-positive persons seen in late 1987. Results. In Group I, 65 were asymptomatic and 35 had minimal symptoms. Of the total, 80 had generalized lymphadenopathy, 16 onychomycosis and 6 oral thrush. In Group II, 83 were asymptomatic and 17 had minimal symptoms. Forty-one had generalized lymphadenopathy, 8 had onychomycosis and 3 had oral thrush. Despite normal white cell counts in both groups, 71% of Group I and 57% of Group II had T4 lymphocyte cell counts below 500 cells/mm. In Group I, 47% of3subjects and in Group II 14% had less than 300 cells/mm. While 78% of Group I were anergic to seven intradermal antigens, only 12% of Group II were anergic. Differences between mean T cell counts in groups were significant (P 0.001). Conclusion. Despite improvement in clinical and laboratory findings, the continued high frequency of laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency in asymptomatic HIV infected persons evaluated at the Los Angeles alternate test site demonstrates a need for medical evaluation and follow-up care for asymptomatic HIV antibody-positive persons. 4197 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) SEROPREVALENCE IN AN ADULT MEDICAL AND PEDIATRIC OUTPATIENT POPULATION IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY (LAC), CA, USA, Peter Kerndt*, F Sorvillo**, M Tormey**, G Run**, K Iwakoshi**, *Centers for Disease Control, GA, USA; **Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, CA, USA. Objective: To estimate HIV seroprevalence in an adult medical and pediatric outpatient population in LAC. Methods: 4,936 serum samples were collected anonymously from adult medical or pediatric patients at 23 privately operated outpatient clinics in LAC between Oct. and Dec. 1986. Specimens collected from adult medical patients were drawn to determine syphilis markers as part of medical, premarital, annual, sexually transmitted disease evaluation, or clinic admission routine; pediatric specimens were drawn to determine routine chemistries. Demographic data collected and linked anonymously to each specimen include age, sex, race, census tract, zip code, and health district. HIV screening was done using an ELISA (Dupont) test; all repeatedly reactive sera were confirmed by immunofluorescent antibody (IFA). Results: To date, 1,265 sera have been tested; 1 (.04%) pediatric and 23 (2.3%) adult patients were repeat positive by ELISA and confirmed by IFA; 18 (75%) were male, 6 (25%) female. HIV infection rate among Asians was 2.7% (2/72), 2.3% (9/381), Blacks 1.9% (5/262), and Whites 1.6% (7/448). Results will be stratified by health district and compared to the known distribution of AIDS cases in LAC. Conclusions: Seroprevalence studies of select populations such as outpatients provide the best approximation of the extent of HIV infection; this information is useful in planning health-care services, education and intervention strategies. 4198 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF AIDS IN SAN FRANCISCO: EVIDENCE FOR A SECOND EPIDEMIC WAVE IN HETEROSEXUAL INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS George W. Rutherford, JL Barnhart, GF Lemp; Department of Public Health, San Francisco, California, U.S.A. Objective. To evaluate the current epidemiology of AIDS in San Francisco with emphasis on recent trends, specifically in intravenous drug users. Methods. We reviewed AIDS cases reported in San Francisco through December 31, 1987, with regard to transmission category, race and year of diagnosis. Results. As of December 31, 1987, 4,238 cases of AIDS and 2,544 deaths from AIDS had been reported in San Francisco, corresponding to an incidence of 6.19 cases per 1,000 residents. Prior to 1986, 97.6% of patients were homosexual or bisexual men, 0.7% heterosexual intravenous drug users, and 87.2% whites. Since January 1, 1986, however, the numbers of AIDS cases diagnosed in heterosexual intravenous drug users and non-whites have risen significantly more rapidly than in homosexual and bisexual men (275% vs. 57%, p=.03) and whites (123% vs. 51%, p=.005). Overall, the relative risk of AIDS by transmission category and race/ethnicity is: White Black Latino Heterosexual intravenous drug users 1.0 7.6 2.9 Heterosexual cases 1.0 4.3 0 Children of parent at risk for AIDS 1.0 4.3 4.2 Conclusions. We conclude that while AIDS remains predominately a disease of homosexual and bisexual men in San Francisco, a second wave of the epidemic has emerged which disproportionately involves, as in the eastern United States, Black and Latino heterosexual intravenous drug users. Notes: 4199 SEROPREVALENCE SURVEY OF RISK FACTOR ASSESSMENT OF HIV INFECTIONS IN MANITOBA G Hammond*, and the Manitoba AIDS Virus Epidemiology Study (M.A.V.E.S.) Collaborative Group 4200 *Cadham Provincial Laboratory, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada Objective. A collaborative outreach study has evaluated the seroprevalence of HIV infections in individuals at risk and their demographic profiles, in Winnipeg. Results. Thirteen (5.2%) of 250 study patients were seropositive. Infected patients were gay/bisexual (56), hemophiliacs (10), or from an endemic region (2). No evidence of HIV infection was documented among those (exclusive of the above categories) with the following risk activities: I.V. drug abusers (83), prostitutes (24), patients with STD's (58) or sex contacts of high risk individuals (62). This HIV antibody seroprevalence is very similar to the result of diagnostic testing for HIV infection of over 2000 specimens in Manitoba. Conclusions. Information obtained by study questionnaire showed i) a high proportion of those in high risk categories were Native/Metis; ii) a low knowledge level of HIV information among individuals at risk of HIV infection; iii) an improvement in short term knowledge of HIV information associated with counselling. HIV infection in Manitoba is not widespread at present, but is found in individuals in selected high risk categories, at a lower seroprevalence than other larger urban Canadian centres. 309 [Page 310](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/308) 4201 HIV ANTIBODY TESTING IN PRISONS: ASSESSMENT OF VOLUNTARY VS.MANDATORY TESTING Jon K Andrus*,** D C Knox***, R McAllister**, M Skeels**, L Foster** *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA, **Oregon State Health Division, ***Oregon State Corrections, USA Objective. Despite limited data, many authorities recommend mandatory HIV testing of all prison inmates. This study was designed to assess the usefulness of voluntary vs mandatory testing strategies in prisons. Methods. We studied 746 consecutive newly incarcerated inmates for HIV antibody and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) status. Results were linked to a previously administered questionnaire that assessed desire for HIV testing, history of risk behaviors, and risk self-assessment. Results. Sixty percent (448) of the inmates were positive for either HBcAb and/or IV drug use, indicating behaviors that put them at risk for HIV. Only 6 inmates were HIV positive (0.8%, 95% confidence limits (CL) 0.2%, 1.4%); 4 chose to tested. A total of 472 (63%, 95% CL=60%, 66%) inmates chose voluntary testing. Inmates who chose testing were more likely to be IV drug users (relative risk (RR) 1.2, p=0.001) and to believe that they had been exposed to AIDS (RR 1.3, p<0.001). Conclusion. In this low-HIV-prevalence group, for those uninfected but at risk, voluntary programs that emphasize counseling may be more appropriate than mandatory programs that emphasize testing. 4202 PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS FOR HIV INFECTION AMONG INMATES Pilar ESTEBANEZ:(Madrid City Hall, Madrid, Spain), Concepci6n COLOMO,(Madrid City Hall, Spain), Maria Victoria ZUNZUNEGUI (Escuela Andaluza de Salud PGblica, Granada, Spain) and Milagrosa RUA (Madrid City Hall, Madrid, Spain) Prevalence and risk factors for HIV infection were studied among 307 men and 95 women inmates at two state jails in Ma drid, Spain,from April through December 1987. Among men, the overall prevalence was 55% (77% for intravenous drug users, IVDUs). Tattooing was a significant risk factor (RR - 4.3) even after controlling for IVDU in a multivariate lo gistic model. There was no significant assooiation between HIV infection and anal intercourse. Among women, the overall prevalence was 26% (70% among IVDUs). Tattooing, number of times in prison, being a prostitute and history of sexua lly transmitted diseases were significantly assooiated with HIV infection. However, these associations disappeared, after controlling for IVDU. Among IVDUs, being a prostitute marginally increased the risk of HIV infection. Among prostitutes, tattooing marginally increased the risk of HIV infection. These data indicate the need of control measures to avoid further spread of HIV infection among the prison population by the use of contaminated syringes, in particular through tattooing while in jail. Notes: 4203 INFORMATION ABOUT AIDS IN FRENCH JAILS P.ESPINOZA, GOLOVINE, I.BOUCHARD. A trial experiment took place in May and June 87 at the Fresnes prison. It involved about 300 guards (30% of the force) and about 100 inmates, all being recruted on a volunteer basis. The meetings with the guards were without incident and we noticed an absence of concern with respect to eventual professional risks. The meetings with inmates (12.5 of which are seropositive) revealed a constant worry and anguish reactions. After seminars, we became convinced that going on with those meetings would elicit a risk of exclusion (towards the high risk subject i.e. the drug addicts). There was real danger in pursuing that type of information gathering action inside an overcrowded institution where daily tensions already exist between guards and inmates. In June 1987, the penal authority decided to organize a national conference with concerned parties from 9 major penal areas. Those regional entities periodically organize local conferences with representatives of each penal institution: physicians, nurses, guard training supervisors. The collaboration of hospital physicians facilitates the exchange of information. The participants of each institution have the responsibility of organizing information meetings for the personnel. In some cases, whenever the environment of the institution allowed it, meetings with the inmates were organized as well. 4204 HIV SEROPOSITIVITY IN INCARCERATED ADOLESCENTS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY Charles J. Baker, M.D., Susan Huscroft, M.D., Robert Morris, M.D., Osvaldo Re', M.D., Julie Roseman, M.P.H., Biruta Schultz, B.S., M.T. LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A. Adolesents in the Los Angeles County Juvenile Halls were studied to determine the prevalence of HIV infection. Unlinked serologic testing for HIV antibody was performed on 1,878 juveniles aged 16-17 years. Three positive cases were found in this group (incidence: 0.16%). In addition, all HIV antibody test results requested for high risk juveniles during 1985-87 were reviewed. Four out of 239 juveniles tested in this group were positive for HIV infection (incidence: 1.6%). The low prevalence of HIV infection in this incarcerated adolescent population suggests that mass screening for HIV antibodies is not justified in juvenile correctional facilities at this time. We recommend instead that emphasis be placed on voluntary testing and on educational programs to modify high risk behavior. 310 [Page 311](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/309) 4205 4206 AIDS in New York State Prison Inmates Dale L.

Methods: Epidemiologic data (including demographic, risk factor, disease and mortality information) will be presented from the case registry of all inmates developing AIDS within the NYS correctional system from 1981-1987. Results: Through December 18, 1987, 503 cases of AIDS had been confirmed among prison inmates in NYS correctional facilities. Cases increased from three in 1981 to 132 in 1986, with an incidence > 330 cases per 100,000 inmates per year over the past three years. Case ages ranged from 18 to 59 years: 486 (97%) were male, 17 (3%) were female. Forty-seven percent were hispanic, 38% black and 14% white. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (74%) and other opportunistic infections (23%) were the most common diagnosis, while Kaposi's sarcoma was rare (3%). Intravenous drug use (97%) was the major risk factor and most cases lived in NYC prior to diagnosis. Only 12% gave a history of homo/bisexuality and 73% of these had used IV drugs. To date, 329 (65%) have died and AIDS now accounts for > 70% of inmate deaths. Conclusion: AIDS is a major problem among New York State inmates and is primarily related to IV drug use. Notes: 4207 HIV SEROPREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS AMONG PRISON INMATES ENTERING NEW YORK STATE PRISONS Benedict I. Truman*, D. Morse*, J. Mikl*, S. Lehman*, A. Forte**, R. Broaddus**, R. Stevens* *New York State Department of Health, U.S.A. **New York State Department of Correctional Services, Albany, New York, U.S.A. Objective: To determine the prevalence of HIV infection and associated factors among male inmates entering New York State prisons. Methods: Between December 22 and January 8, 1983, we conducted a blinded cross-sectional seroprevalence survey among inmates entering the New York State prison system. Selected non-identifying variables including age, race, IV drug use, homosexuality, PPD and HBS Ag status were collected. HIV antibody was detected by ELISA and Western Blot (WB) analysis. Results: Serum specimens were available from 494 (94%) of 524 inmates surveyed; 84 (17.4%) were HIV positive. Seropositivity was highest in IV drug users (43.1%), homosexuals (38.5%) and Hispanics (23.6%). Of 30 HBS Ag positive inmates, 30% were also HIV seropositive. Multivariate analyses are pending. Conclusion: The high prevalence of HIV, PPD and HBS Ag positivity (17.4%, 18.2% and 6.1%, respectively) among entering New York State inmates will require enhanced medical and preventive efforts. 4208 DIFERENCES IN HIV ANTIBODY PREVALENCE IN PENITENTIARY POPULATIONS: Valladolid. Serum samples from 477 inmates of 3 spanish State Prisons (SP) were tested for HIV antibodies, using ELISA and Western-blot tests. (311 in 1986 and 88 in 1987 from SP\"A\", 19 from SP\"B\" and 59 from SP\"C\" in 1987). One year later we perform new analysis to seronegative inmates from the first prison studied, who voluntary accept this offer. Global percentajes of seropositives were as follow: in 1987) and 0,6% for SP\"C\" in 1987. Occurrence of risk factors was also different between prisons studied. In SP\"C\" only 3,4% of inmates declared to belong to IVDA group, nevertheless in the rest of prisons 46% to 63,2% belonged to at least one of the classical high-risk groups. Differences refered, are probably due to the fact that in SP\"C\" most of inmates were incarcerated for terrorism offences, while in SP\"A\" and SP\"B\" were due to common faults. The follow-up of 31 seronegative inmates of 1986 from SP\"A\", show 2 seroconversions (6,4%) one in the IVDA group and another in one heterosexual man. We noted an increase in HIV Ab prevalence from 1986 (54,9%) to 1987 (78,3%) in the IVDA group. These results shows that infection prevalence in penitentiary populations are in relationship with the particular risk-factor occurrence. An aditional hipothesis to be confirmed, is that negative results could give to the inmates a false sensation of security and so to refuse a new control, making difficult the following up. 311 [Page 312](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/310) 4209 SEROEPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV INFECTION IN JAIL COMMUNITIES Verona - Italy. Objective. To carry out a seroepidemiological survey on HIV antibodies in prisoners of some institutions in the Venetian Region. Methods. Almost all subjects entering five Institutions in the Venetian Region were voluntarily screened;besides a small group of warders and/or attending staff were stu died. Serological tests included Elisa as screening; IFA and/or W.B. as confirmatory test. Results. Out of 2255 prisoners 290 (12.9%) showed HIV antibodies;none of 72 warders and/or attending staff was po sitive.The prevalence rate in each jail community,ranging from about 9% to 16%,was clearly related to the number of IVDU associated to them,and roughly to the prevalence in IVDU of the general population.Drug abuse was the only known risk factor in 95% of 290 seropositive; two subjects with HIV antibodies admitted homosexuality and one per son had been heterosexually infected.Preliminary data of a perspective survey showed no seroconversion in 30 priso ners with continuous detention(mean 10.6 months)and in 26 warders monitored for a mean period of about 20 months. Conclusion.Cross-sectional evaluation showed a crowding of infected people in prisons in our country;perspective studies must be continued to evaluate the communitary risk. 4210 INFREQUENT TRANSMISSION OF HIV-1 S INFECTION IN MARYLAND PRISONS D Vlahov*, F Brewer**, E Taylor*, D Hall*, A Munoz*, T Stough**, BF Polk* *Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, **Maryland Division of Corrections, Baltimore, MD, U.S.A. Objective. To estimate the incidence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in the Maryland state prisons. Methods. Inmates with excess sera stored from specified intake periods between April and June, 1985 and 1986, were approached in May, 1987 to volunteer for venipuncture. Specimens were assayed for anti HIV-1 using ELISA and Western blot techniques. Results. Of the 2,286 inmates for whom intake specimens were stored, 1,038 (45.4%) were no longer incarcerated as of April, 1987; another 319 missed the survey. For the 929 eligible inmates approached for the study, 446 (48%) consented and 422 (94.6%) provided a specimen. Twenty-nine (6.6%) were confirmed seropositive at time of entry into prison, indicating that infection had occurred prior to incarceration. The 393 participants seronegative at baseline provided a total of 482 prison-years of potential exposure to infection. Two inmates seroconverted with baseline specimens seronegative on Western blot and follow-up sera confirmed positive; their duration of pre-incarceration detention was 69 and 146 days. The rate of infection in this prison sample was 0.41% per prison-year. Conclusion. The data suggest that the risk of HIV transmission is likely to be low in the correctional setting. Notes: 4211 TRENDS OF HIV-1 SEROPREVALENCE AMONG INMATES ENTERING MARYLAND PRISONS (USA) 1985-1987 D Vlahov*, Brewer**, T Stough**, BF Polk* Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health*, Maryland Division of Corrections**, Baltimore, MD. Objective. To monitor secular trends of HIV-1 infection among inmates entering Maryland State prisons, and to investigate whether the strength of association between HIV-1 and select demographic factors varied over time. Methods. Excess sera and demographic data were obtained from samples of consecutive inmates arriving during the same months over three years. Specimens were assayed using ELISA and Western blot techniques. Logistic regression methods were used for multivariate analysis. Results: Year: 1985 1986 1987 4212 PREVALENCE OF HIV ANTIBODIES IN ISRAELI JAIL INMATES Ethan Rubinstein*, J Ziegelbaum**, R Guttman* A Vonsover*** *Infectious Diseases Unit, Sheba Med Ctr, Tel-Aviv Univ ** Dept of Health, Jail Authorities, ***Central Virology Lab, Ministry of Health Prisoners have been considered a high risk group for contracting AIDS in many Western societies which have a high rate of HIV seropositivity. We have screened Israeli male and female prisoners and general population, in order to evaluate if this situation prevails in Israel as well. HIV antibodies were screened by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot. 7/52 (6.9%) of male prisoners and 3/113 (2.7%) of female prisoners were found to be HIV positive, none had AIDS. 3 of the male had persistent lymphadenopathy whilst all females and the remainder of the males were asymptomatic. 1 of the males had a single homosexual contact and all used i.v. drugs. All 3 females were prostitutes and used i.v. drugs. 2 of the positive inmates contracted the disease abroad and 3/10 patients were neither Jews or Moslem. From this limited survey it is concluded that jail inmates in Israel constitute a high risk group on a background of low HIV prevalence in the general population. The major risk factor being i.v. drug use. Estimated % IVDU % years 2.2 2.3 3.9 (Univariate) minority group 5.5 5.2 9.2 metropolitan 7.7 3.4 2.8 Conclusion. Although univariate analysis suggested a trend upward for older inmates, minority group members and a trend downward for metropolitan commitments, none of these trends were statistically significant in a multivariate model. The data suggest that among these incoming inmates, the prevalence of HIV-1 infection has remained stable over time. Continued surveillance is planned. 312 [Page 313](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/311) 4213 PREVALENCE OF INFECTION AMONG A CLOSE POPULATION OF PRISONERS IN ARGENTINA. Jorge Benetucci*, L Astarloa*, S Multare*, S *Muhiz Hospital, **Federal Service, ***Department of Microbiology School of Medicine. Buenos Aires, Argentina. Objective. To evaluate HIV infection in a close community of male and female prisoners in Argentina. Methods. A group of 267 men and 109 women (most of them declared to be heterosexuals) confined in 2 federal prisons were selected for the study. IV drug addiction (IVDA) Was the main risk factor. Median age was 30 years for men and 27 for women. Screening of HIV antibodies was performed by EIA and particle agglutination. Positive samples were confirmed by Western blot. Results. Total HIV prevalence reached 17.9% in the male and 14% in the female population. PGL were found in most HIV sero positives examined. Anti-HIV antibodies distribution according to sexual habit and IV drug addiction is shown in table. 4214 ANTI HIV SOROLOGICAL TRIAL IN THE FEMALE INCARCERATED POPULATION OF THE SAO PAULO STATE PRISIONS; 1987. Queiroz W, Rodriguez C, Paula M, Lorenco R, Soraggi C, Janini M, Bedaque E, Janini M Hospital EmTlio Ribas, Sio Paulo, Brazil. Objective. The purpose of this report is to establish the incidence of positive anti-HIV tests among the female incarcerated population of the Sao Paulo State Prisions and its relationship with risk factors and age. Methods. Initially didatic speeches were given to all incarcerated population (employees and prisioners). After that, all inmates were individually interviewed, using an epidemiological form, and blood samples were collected for ELISA and WESTERN BLOT tests. Results and conclusion.Among the 284 volunteers inmates, 52 (18.3%) had positivesorology. The use of endovenous drugs was the most important risk factor, related for 47 (90.4%) of the soropositive women but only 8 of them (15.4%) had this risk isolated; 36 (69.2%) had 2 or more risk factors related. Thirty eight (73.1%) had their ages ranging from 20 to 30 years. The rate of HIV infection in this population is high. The most important risk factor related was the use of endovenous drugs. The association of this factor with others such as various sexual partners, high risk partners, and blood transfusions affects evaluation of which factor is more important and if the risk of infection is potencialized with this association. Sexual habit Homosex. Bisex. Heterosex. prevalence of 17% HIV infection was detected in a close population of prisoners. 98.4% of sero positives were hetersexual IV drug addicts. Notes: 4215 SCREENIIG FOR HIV ANTIBODIES IN HIGH-RISK GROUPS AMONG INMATES OF BRUSSELS PRISONS. A.Donot, L.Verhoeven-Lespagnard. Centre Medico-Chirurgical, Prison de St Gilles, Brussels Objective. To monitor the epidemic of HIV infection among drug-addicted inmates of Brussels prisons. Methods. Since May 1985, an information campaign on AIDS was launched in Belgian prisons. Prisoners belonging to high-risk groups were encouraged to submit volontarily to a screening test. In 30 months, we have tested 2,240 newly identified inmates having used IV drugs, at least once. To this end, we used the Abbott ELISA test. The repeatedly positive sera were verified using one or more confirmatory tests. Results. The seropositivity rates were, per semester, 7.1%, 7.1%, 7.7%, 3.2%, and 5% respectively. In addition we found that, among these drug-addicts, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the ELISA test (0.88) is significantly lower than the calculated PPV (0.97). Conclusion. These results suggest that information and screening of a fraction of drug-addicts from an urban district of 1,500,000 inhabitants slows down the progression of the HIV epidemic in this particular environment at a time when the seropositivity rate is still low. We also suggest that the sensitivity of the confirmatory tests, viz. western blot and irnunofluorescence, among recently infected individuals, might be lower than that of the ELISA screening test. When the ELISA test is positive, and the confirmatory tests are found to be negative, the tests are to be repeated some months later. 4216 A Ccmprehensive Prison Program for AIDS Risk Reduction. Sheila Noone*, F. Birch*, S. Sereti*, L. Santana*, P. J. Sullivan*, Worcester City Health Department*, Spectrum House, Inc.**, Worcester County House of Correction***, AIDS Project Worcester**** Objective: To develop a comprehensive AIDS Risk Reduction Program for a prison that incorporates education, testing, follow-up counseling and advocacy. Method: Through a coordinated effort involving the Worcester City Health Department, Spectrum House Drug Treatment Program, AIDS Project Worcester, and the staff of Worcester County House of Correction a comprehensive AIDS risk reduction program was developed. Correction officers and prison administrators were educated prior to implementation of the program. Each week prisoners are offered AIDS education, voluntary HIV counseling and testing. A program for ongoing counseling and advocacy for HIV seropositive prisoners with a link to community resources after release is an integral part of this program. Results: Since the program was initiated in July of 1987 we have tested 456 individuals with a seropositivity rate of 11%. The rate of seropositivity among hispanics is 27%, 17% among blacks, and 4% among whites. There have been no episodes of violence, discrimination or segregation of seropositive inmates. Correctional officers have been enthusiastic supporters of the program: Concerns about identification of, or isolation of, infected prisoners have not materialized. Conclusion: A successful, comprehensive program of HIV education and testing with coomunity follow-up can be implemented in a prison setting. 313 [Page 314](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/312) 4217 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTION AMONG PRISONERS IN NORTH-EASTERN ITALY. U. Tirelli, D. Serraino*, E. grant NO 1004/700/85n06/86.*AIRC bursars. Objective: To determine the prevalence of HIV infection among prisoners in north-eastern Italy. Method: Between July 1985 and March 1987, a survey was carried out male inmates at country jails of 3 neighbouring cities (Pordenone, Udine and Gorizia) in the north-east of Italy. A relevant population of the prisoners of these cities are intravenous drug abusers (ivda) and among the 129 subjects who accepted to participate in this study, a sizeable number of ivda (91 individuals) was observed, permitting the evaluation of the differences with prisoners not otherwise at risk for HIV infection (38 individuals), of similar age and duration of imprisonment. For a totality of 129 prisoners, a detailed past and present personal history was collected, by means of a standard questionnaire; physical examination and blood sample for testing HIV antibodies (ELISA and Western Blot confirmation) and T4/T8 ratio were also performed. Results: The percentage of seropositive prisoners was very different between the two groups: 33/91 ivda prisoners were positive (36%, 95% CI subjects not at increased risk (8%, 95% CI 9%-16%). The 3 seropositive prisoners who were not ivda denied either homosexual intercourse or exchange of razors or toothbrushes, on the other hand, there is no evidence that seroconversion did occur in prison because they did not perform HIV tests before entering prison. Conclusion: HIV infection among Italian prisoners is mainly restricted but it may also involve prisoners who currently do not belong to high risk groups. 4218 MEDICAL CARE ISSUES OF PRISON INMATES (PIs) ATTENDING AN ON-SITE HIV CLINIC Jordan B. Glaser, M. Foley, P. Gordon Arthur Kill Correctional Facility(AKCF), Staten Island,NY Objective: To identify medical care issues of PIs attending an on-site HIV clinic. Methods: Medical record review and PI interviews. Results: AKCF houses 800 male PIs for up to 4 years before parole board review or conditional release. We established an on-site HIV clinic to provide for greater PI access, without incurring security costs and risks of off-site PI transport. From 7/87 thru 12/87, 37 with TB(3), thrush(3), fever(2), HIV Ab test requests(3), or other (11). 29 PIs were non-white, 27 were IV drug users. 30/33 tested were HIV Ab+. AZT was taken by 14/16 PIs in whom indicated (i.e. symptomatic and TH(275). Neither duration of incarceration nor admission lymohopenia could predict which HIV Ab+ PIs required AZT, even though the 16 AZT PIs had HIV signs for mean 13 mos(range 1-48) prior to referral. PIs feared that either having an HIV Ab test, being Ab+, or taking AZT would threaten their physical safety and/or delay parole. Therefore, only TH results and AZT Rx were noted on charts and PI callout lists were not used. HIV Ab+ PIs also required psych support and improved post-release concrete services (e.g. for AZT costs, clinic referral). Conclusions: Now that AZT is annroved, on-site HIV clinics should be available ior earlier Dx and Rx of PIs. PT fears should be allayed through education, improved services and confidentiality safeguards. We therefore, regularly meet with administration and PI groups. PIs have sponsored boxing matches to raise research funds, HIV related newspaper articles and an HIV team, which is developing orientation and prerelease workshops. Notes: 4219 HIV-1 Is ASSOCIATED WITH FATAL INFECTIOUS DISEASESOTHERTHANAIDS AMONG INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS Don C. Des Jarlais*, J Sotheran**, R Stoneburner***, S Friedman**, M Marmor****, R Maslansky**** et al. *New York State Div. of Substance Abuse Serv.,**NDRI,***NYC Dept. of Health,****NYU Med. Center, New York City, USA Objective: To determine outcomes of HIV-1 infection and rate of HIV-1 seroconversions among intravenous drug users. Methods: A cohort of 487 IV drug users was enrolled from drug treatment programs in NYC from 1984 through 1986 and followed through 1987. 241 (49%) were initially anti-HIV-1 positive. Subjects were re-interviewed and additional blood samples were collected every 9 months. For subjects who left treatment, data collection included telephone contact, searches of drug treatment, AIDS and death registries. Results: There were 18 known cases of AIDS in the cohort, with a relatively constant 4% of seropositives developing AIDS per year. There were 31 known deaths in the cohort: 12 AIDS, 4 non-pcp pnuemonia, 1 endocarditis, 1 tuberculosis, and 13 non-infectious causes. In a logistic regression analysis, HIV-1 seropositivity at enrollment was the best predictor of death from \"non-AIDS\" infection; all 6 such deaths were among seropositives (p<.02). HIV-1 was not related to non-infectious deaths. There was a constant annual seroconversion rate of 7% among subjects initially anti-HIV-1 negative and retained in treatment, primarily associated with cocaine injection. Conclusion: The association between HIV-1 and \"non-opportunistic\" fatal infections indicates that surveillance definition AIDS misses a substantial amount of HIV related mortality. The current seroconversion rate indicates a need for more intensive risk reduction efforts. AIDS PREVENTION IN GAY MEN Ronald 0. Valdiserri, DW Lyter, LC Leviton, C Callahan, LA Kingsley, CR Rinaldo University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA Objective. To compare the effects of two AIDS risk reduction interventions in a group of gay and bisexual men enrolled in a prospective study of the natural history of HIV infection. Methods. Between February 1986 and March 1987, 588 men were randomized into two interventions. One group (N=342) attended a peer-led, small group lecture on HIV infection and risk reduction. A second group (N=246) attended the same lecture plus a \"skills\" training session promoting \"safe sex\". Self-reported sexual behavior was collected by questionnaire prior to intervention, and at 6 and 12 months. A comparison group consisted of 207 gay men in the same prospective study. Results. Over the 12 months of the study, the experimental and comparison groups demonstrated a decrease in the mean number of different partners with whom they had anal intercourse (both insertive/receptive), and in general an increase in the use of condoms for anal intercourse. Based on multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), there were no observed effects of the intervention except in the case of insertive anal condom use which was increased at 6 months (p<.01) for men who attended the skills training. Knowledge of HIV serostatus was not a significant covariate for either insertive or receptive anal intercourse, but being \"high\" was for receptive anal intercourse. Conclusion. These findings support the fact that gay men are making sexual behavior changes, and give limited support for the role of skills training in promoting \"safe\" sex. They also suggest that evaluation of AIDS prevention strategies in gays may be difficult because of the overall change already taking place. 314 [Page 315](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/313) 5001 SCREENING FOR HIV ANTIBODIES AMONG BLOOD DONORS AT RIYADH ARMED FORCES HOSPITALS A. M. Al Rasheed, D. Fairclough, A. S. Abu Al Saud, A. O. Osoba. \"Department of Microbiology, Riyadh Armed Forces Hospital Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\" Objective. Over the last 2 years, it has become mandatory for blood banks especially in the developed countries to screen all blood to be used for transfusion by one of the HIV screening tests. This is expected to prevent the transmission of HIV to otherwise healthy recipients and most especially to haemophiliacs, among whom a high incidence of HIV has been recorded. The objective of this study was to determine the presence of HIV in our community. Methods. Screening blood donors for HIV antibody was routinely commenced in RKH in January 1986. Up-to-date, a total of 23,000 healthy blood donors have been screened by Abbott Recombinant HTLV III EIA screening test and positives were confirmed by HIV I Antigen (Env/Core) Recombinant E.coli and Western Blot. Results. Of these 23,000 samples tested, 5 were positive by the screening test and subsequently confirmed by all the confirmatory tests performed. The Abbott HTLV III Antigen EIA test was performed on the five positive sera and only one was positive for the presence of HIV antigen. Conclusion. It is observed that HIV seroreactivity in the Kingdom is very low (0.02%) but neverthless screening for HIV needs to be routinely performed in order to prevent any transmission of the virus by blood transfusion. 5002 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS IN THE AIDS CLINIC AT HADASSAH MEDICAL CENTER IN JERUSALEM S. Maayan*, D. Engelhard*,S. Boger*, A. Ganer*,A. Morag*, M. Shapiro*, T. Sacks*. Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hadassah Medical Center Jerusalem Israel. Of the first 395 attendees at the AIDS clinin in Jerusalem homo/bisexuals accounted for 32%, I.V. drug abusers (IVDAs) for 4%, persons with minimal risk for AIDS for 24% and persons having no risk for 38%. HIV antibody rates were 7% for homosexuals, 29% for IVDAs, 1% for persons with minimal risk and 0% for persons at no risk. Israeli homosexuals had a significantly greater risk for HIV infection (9/35) if they had had sexual contacts with non Israelis as compared with homosexuals who had local partners only (0/91; p<0.001). The mean number of attendees/month increased by 431% during the 4 months following the first prime time TV program on AIDS. The largest increases occured among persons at no risk (1 to 27.2), those with minimal risk (2.5 to 16.5) and among women (1.25-20.0). This report indicates that HIV infection among Israeli homosexuals has not yet reached the U>S> proportions. It also shows that while raising anxiety to AIDS among the general public, the TV program probably helped formulate an approach to HIV testing as part of a general health screening program. Notes: 5003 ANTIBODIES TO HIV IN JORDANIAN BLOOD DONORS AND PATIENTS WITH CONGENITAL BLEEDING DISORDERS M.S. **Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan. To evaluate the risk of transmission of HIV via blood or blood product transfusion in Jordan. We have tested a) 21,000 volunteer blood donors. b) 44 patients with severe hemophilia and 8 patients with afibrinogenemia who received commercial factor concentrates. c) 30 patients with mild to moderate hemophilia, 33 patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia, and 31 patients with Von-Willebrand's disease who received local blood or blood products. The sera were tested with enzyme immunoassay (Abbott and Organon). Only repeatedly reactive were confirmed by Western blot (Bio Rad and Bio Merieaxe) of the 21,000 blood donors. Two specimen were repeatedly positive and only one were confirmed as positive by Western blot. The one positive blood donor admitted to be drug abuser and he lived in New York for almost 10 years and he return back to Jordan. Although the incidence of HIV antibodies in Jordanian blood donors is very low, the testing of all blood donors for HIV is mandatory since October 1987. The study of 52 patients who received commercial factor concentrates for anti-HIV, 10 (22.7%) sera were positive, 9 patients with severe hemophilia, one patient with afibrinogenemia and only 5 (11.4%) were confirmed positive. All patients received locally prepared blood or blood products were negative for anti-HIV. 5004 SERO EPIDEMIOLOGY OF BLOOD BORNE VIRUSES AMONG HIGH RISK GROUPS IN EGYPT *Shaker M.I., ** Mona El Baz, Z., **Hassan, H.A. W.M. *Egyptian M. Medical Academy (Virol. Dep) **Al-Azhar University, Faculty of Medicine for Girls (Community Medicine Dep.) Objective and Methods. Twenty thousand individuals, during a survey study, were tested for the prevalence of antibody to human immunedeficiency virus (anti HIV) (Abott recombinant HIV EIA). Among the 20,000 serum samples tested, 15,000 were at high risk to blood borne viruses (I.V. drug addicts, homosexuals, renal unit patients, repeatedly transfused patients, etc...). Another 1,500 within the total sample, were considered as a control group. The risk group as well as the control group sera were also tested for HBsAg, HBsAb, and cytomegalovirus antibody (CMV Ab) by the ELISA techni4ue. Results. The results revealed that anti HIV was not found in all the 20,000 sera samples including the high risk groups, after carrying out the confirmatory test for the previously +ve cases (confirmatory envelope core HIV EIA) Abott. HBsAg was detected in 135/1500 (9%) among the risk group, compared to 75/1500 (5%) in control group. HBsAb was detected among 765/1500 (51%) in the risk group in comparison to 450/1500 (30%) in control group, whereas CMV Ab was detected among 1425/1500 (95%) in comparison with 1350/1500 in the control group. Conclusion. We therefore conclude that the prevalence of HBV and CMV infections are higher in the risk group than the control group, and that there is no evidence suggesting the presence of HIV infection among the studied sample. 315 [Page 316](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/314) 5005 HIV SEROPREVALENCE Woody** *Ministry of Health, A.R.E., ** U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit #3, Cairo, Egypt (a WHO Collaborating Centre for AIDS) Objective. To determine the prevalenceof HIV seropositivity in Egypt. Methods. During 1986 and 1987, 10,234 samples from 24 Governorates of Egypt were screened for the presence of antibodies to HIV. Risk groups included: drug addicts, prostitutes, prisoners, STD clinic patients, blood product recipients, professional blood donors, FUO patients, and routine blood units. Samples from foreigners from high risk areas were also tested. Sera which reacted pos. repeatedly using several commercial ELISAs were assessed by the Du Pont Western Blot (WB) for confirmation. Results. Seventy-seven sera (.75%) yielded repeatedly pos. results by ELISA. Of these, 54(.91%) occurred in 1986, 23(.54%) in 1987. This subsequent decrease may be attributed to the use of recombinant ELISA tests (less false positives) during the latter portion of the survey. Sixteen sera (.16%) were confirmed pos. by the WB. Confirmed cases included elevenblood transfusion/product recipients who had been infected while outside Egypt, three international travelers, one newborn of an infected mother (may be maternal antibody), and one wife on an HIV pos. blood recipient. Conclusion. In this large two year HIV serosurvey including high risk groups in Egypt, the incidence of HIV WB confirmed pos. cases is exceptionally low. All known cases have contracted their infection while outside of the country, or have been in contact with (infant &wife) a case contracted outside the country.

Tigani***, J. George***, and J. Woody* *US Naval Medical Research Unit No.3 (A WHO Collaborating Center for AIDS), Cairo, Egypt, **Ministry of Health, ***Central Health Laboratories, Khartoum, Sudan. Objective. To determine the prevalence of HIV infection in Sudan's main deepwater port, Port Sudan, amongst groups shown to be at high risk for HIV infection in other parts of Africa. Methods. Epidemiologic questionnaires were completed and sera collected from prostitutes, prisoners, lorry drivers, as well as hospitalized patients and outpatients. Sera were tested for antibodies to HIV using a commercial ELISA test, and confirmed by Western blot analysis. Results. There was a total of 599 study participants. Sera were collected from 176 prostitutes, 120 male prisoners, 86 lorry drivers, 44 hospitalized patients, 156 outpatients, 13 patrons of prostitutes and 3 homosexuals. Of the total males, 69% admitted using prostitutes, and over 50% had a previous history of STD. Of prostitutes, 9% had previous history of STD and 23% had positive RPR tests. Almost 75% of the study participants had serological evidence of exposure to hepatitis B virus. Despite the sexual practices of these groups and the high incidence of exposure to hepatitis B there was no evidence of antibodies to HIV and no clinical AIDS amongst the study groups. These data suggest a very low incidence of HIV infection in Port Sudan.

Njie, K. Cham, A. Wilkins, A. Egboga, H. Whittle, B.M. Greenwood. *Medical Research Council Laboratories, Fajara, The Gambia Objective. The incidence of HIV infections appears to be lower in West Africa, but there is thecomplicating factor of a second retrovirus (HIV-2). Methods. Available seroepidemiological data show that HIV-2 is the main pathogen particularly amongst the risk groups of West Africa. The screening for both retroviruses for blood transfusion is mandatory though expensive. Results. Studies in the Gambia show \"slim disease\" to be the main clinical manifestation and a strong relationship between HIV-2 and Tuberculosis. The mortality and morbidity of HIV-2 infections is discussed. Conclusion. AIDS in West Africa is caused by at least two distinct types of human retroviruses. 5008 PREVALENCE AND SEROEPIDEMIOLOGY OF HUMAN RETRO VIRL'S INFECTIONS IN THE GAMBIA Department of Health, Banjul, The Medical Research Council Latoratories, Fajara, The Gambia; University College and Middlesex Hospital School of Medicine, London, U.K. Objective: To study the prevalence, natural history and clinical features of human immunodeficiency virus infections. Methods: Cross sectional hospital and clinic based serological prevalence surveys are being conducted using competitive ELISA's and antiglobulin ELISA's for antibody to HIV-1 and HIV-2. Patients with disease indicative of HIV infection are also being examined for serological evidence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection. Results: 10/185 (5%) of patients with none were seropositive for anti-HIV-l. Of 278 vcluntary blood donors only one was HIV-seropositive, for anti-HIV-2 alone. Further donor screening has indicated a continuing prevalence of around 1 in 250. 34 patients with AIDS have been identified to date. Fifteen have been characterised in detail:- 7 had weight loss, with chronic diarrhoea. Un responsive TB characterised 3 patients. 4 patients were infected by HIV-1, the remainder by HIV-2. Conclusion: HIV-2 is the dominant virus in The Gambia. Infection by HIV-2 is associated with a clinical disease similar to that of HIV-l-associated AIDS. Dual infections have not yet been identified. 316 [Page 317](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/315) Laboratory, Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, ***National Bacteriological Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden, Objective. To investigate HIV-2 associated AIDS and determine the prevalence of HIV-2 infection in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. Methods. During a six month period in 1987 suspected clinical AIDS cases at the main hospital in Bissau were examined. 2342 sera were also collected from groups of patients and healthy subjects in Bissau. Sera were screened for HIV-2 antibodies by ELISA and positive sera were further tested by Western blotting. Results. Twenty cases of AIDS were found, 19 of which were HIV-2 seropositive (one not tested). The two most prevalent major symptoms were weight loss and diarrhoea. In the seroprevalence study antibodies to HIV-2 were demonstrated in 8.5% (46/535) of prenatal women, 7.8% (9/114) of women attending a family planning clinic, 5.1% (22/430) of applicants for scholarships, 17.5% (16/91) of blood donors tested during the first two months and 5.2 (10/189) of blood donors tested thereafter, 5.7 (2/35) of policemen, 33.3% (11/30) of prostitutes, 5.9% (13/217) of patients visiting an STD clinic, 15.7% (97/614) of outpatients suspected of tuberculosis, and in 55.1% (48/87) of patients suspected of HIVrelated disease but not fulfilling the AIDS criteria. Conclusion. The prevalence of HIV-2 infection is rather high in Bissau and AIDS appears to be an important manifestation of HIV-2 infection in this area. 5010 HIV-1/HIV-2 ANTIBODY PREVALENCE AMONG FEMALE PROSTITUTES AND THEIR PROCURERS (WEST AFRICA) E MED. TROPICAL - LISBOA Twenty six female prostitutes and four procurers were selected from a urban district of Bissau to find the prevalence of HIV-2 infection. Participants ranged in age from 17 to 56 years old for the prostitutes and from 40 to 58 for the procurers. The sera were tested by ELISA and confirmed by Westernblot methods. 13 (50%) of the prostitutes and 1 (25%) of the procurers were positives to HIV-2. Some sera had cross reactions with HIV-1 but none presented specific HIV-1 antibodies. Clinical symptoms associated with AIDS were only present in one of the infected persons. (Chronic diarrhoea). These results prove that prostitutes are a major at risk group of HIV infection and significant disseminators of the virus. The lack of clinical abnormalities in the HIV2 seropositives individuals is markedly different from other studies on HIV-1 seropositive individuals. Notes: 5011 RETROVIRUS INFECTION IN ****Laboratorio de Saude Publico, Bissau Objectives. To determine the extent of HIV-2 infection in the general population of Bissau, to identify risk factors for transmission and to get an indication of the influence of retrovirus infection on the general morbidity and mortality of the area. Methods. By random sampling 100 houses were selected in three adjacent parts of Bissau. The families living in the chosen houses were informed and asked to participate, and if consenting, all family members were interviewed, physically examined and blood was taken on filter paper. - Blood samples are to be analyzed in HIV-1 and HIV-2 ELISA, if reactive confirmed by Western Blot and imnunofluorescence. Results. Of 1501 persons, 1330 (88.6%) participated in the study. Among these 71 were found to be HIV-2 ELISA positive (Diagnostics Pasteur). The confirmatory results are not completed (Jan 88), but the trend is that more than 80% of samples reactive in HIV-2 ELISA can be confirmed in imnunofluorescence (CEM, +/- infected with HIV-2/LAV-2). - Twentysix women and 32 men are HIV-2 ELISA positive, among these are 7 couples. There are no clear cases of vertical transmission, but at least one confirmed case of HIV-2 in a child of 1 year who has received a blood transfusion. - Less than half of the HIV-2 ELISA positive persons were without signs or symptoms of any disease. 5012 EVALUATION OF SERA DUALLY REACTIVE TO HIV-1 AND JW Moreau*, MA Rayfield**, JW Krebs, **Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA. ***Genetic Systems Inc. Seattle, Washington, USA. Objective. To determine the virus status of individuals dually reactive by ELISA to HIV-1 and HIV-2. Methods. Sera from individuals reactive to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 by ELISA were collected from a seroprevalence study of 5 groups (TB patients, prenatal women, hospitalized patients, blood donors, and STD patients). These sera were subsequently tested for HIV-1 and 2 specificity by: a) type specific peptide ELISAs, b) Western blot analysis, c) virus isolation on selected samples, and d) nucleic acid hybridization. Results. Of 957 sera tested, 81 (8%) were HIV-1(+) only, 16 only, and 154(16%) were dually reactive. Subclassification of these samples by type specific peptide ELISAs yielded the following: HIV-1 specific = 82(53%); HIV-2 specific = 31(20%); and HIV-1 & 2 specific = 41(27%). HIV-1 Western blot analysis of the latter group showed that 36(88%) of 41 were reactive. To date HIV-2 Western blot analysis of the 41 samples showed 5 (12%) to be reactive; of these, 3 remain positive for both HIV-1 and 2. These samples are being further analyzed by virus isolation and nucleic acid hybridzation techniques. Conclusion. Individuals may be infected with: (1) both HIV-1 and 2; (2) a third or recombinant virus: or (3) either HIV-1 or 2 only and develop a broad cross-reactive response to shared epitopes. 317 [Page for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, ***Genetic Systems Inc., Seattle, WA, USA Objective. To determine the prevalence and clinical manifestations of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. Methods. A total of 957 serum specimens were collected trom 5 study groups; hospitalized patients (internal medicine and infectious diseases); tuberculosis outpatients; outpatients with sexually transmitted diseases; pregnant women; and blood donors. Serum samples were tested for antibody to HIV-1 and HIV-2 by ELISA and, for repeatedly positive samples, by peptide ELISA and/or Western blot. Lymphocytes were collected from selected patients for attempted virus isolation. Results. Total HIV-antibody prevalence by ELISA ranged from 15% (pregnant women) to 50% (infectious diseases). The prevalence of antibody to HIV-1 only ranged from 7% (sexually transmitted disease patients and pregnant women) to 13% (internal medicine), and to HIV-2 only from 0.5% (pregnant women) to 7% (infectious diseases). Dual reactivity to HIV-1 and HIV-2 occurred in 31% of infectious disease patients and 25% of patients with tuberculosis. AIDS and other opportunistic diseases were observed in HIV-1-negative patients infected with HIV-2. Further Western blot and virus culture results are pending. Conclusion. (1) Infection with HIV-1 is more prevalent than HIV-2 in Abidjan. (2) Virus culture and confirmatory serologic tests may clarify dual ELISA reactivity. (3) AIDS was observed in HIV-2-infected patients. 5014 SEROEPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED PATHOGENIC AGENTS (HIV-1, HIV-2,T.PALLIDUM,C.TRACHOMATIS) IN IVORY COAST.

HIV positivity and serotyping were confirmed by Western Blot.Hemagglutination assay and microimmunofluorescence were used to detect antibody to T.pallidum and antibody to C.trachomatis respectively. Results. Approximatively 1000 symptomless participants were recruited among six populations of Ivory Coast. Positive for Antibody to HIV-1 or HIV-2 T.pallidum prevalences of T.pallidum and C.trachomatis infections were significantly higher in HIV (1 or 2) infected people when compared to the HIV negative population.The results indicate that HIV-1 and 2 are mainly sexually transmitted. The immunodeficiency induced by HIV may interfere with the natural course of co-occuring sexually transmitted diseases.

Pasteur Institute, Abidjan, Ivory Coast 2. CNRS Laboratory, Faculty Medicine Alexis Carrel, Lyon, France Sera were collected from healthy adults in July 1987 in four geographical areas of Ivory Coast, i.e. the towns and surroundings of Man in the western region, Bouak in the central region, Korhogo in the northern region and Bondoukou in the northeastern region, two years after a previous seroepidemiological survey conducted in March-June 1985 in the same areas of the country. In parallel, sera were collected in internal medicine wards in the above mentioned towns, to assess the proportion of hospitalized patients carrying HIV-infection. Detection of antibodies to HIV-1 by ELISA from Diagnostics Pasteur followed by western blot from Dupont de Nemours, and to HIV-2 by ELISA from Diagnostics Pasteur followed by western blot from Diagnostics Pasteur and recently from Dupont, was carried out in Abidjan and in Lyon. We observed that while the sero-prevalence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections was similar (1.3 %) and remained unchanged during this two years period in the general population of these areas, the AIDS epidemics raised dramatically in the above mentioned secondary towns of the country, with proportions of sero-positive hospitalized patients raising from 0 to 18 % within this two years period. That, in the countryside of Ivory Coast, HIV-1 and HIV-2 sero-prevalence remained stable while AIDS epidemics took place, suggests that the population group at risk has been limited during the study period. 1. Dabou Protestant Hospital, Dabou, Ivory Coast 2. Treichville Hospital, Abidjan, Ivory Coast 3. Pasteur Institute, Abidjan, Ivory Coast 4. CNRS Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine Alexis Carrel, Lyon, France In contrast to the similar level of HIV-1 and HIV-2 prevalence in the general populations of various regions of Ivory Coast (see Ouattara et al, this conference), or in groups sexually at risks in Abidjan, we observed that patients with AIDS, as seen in three different settings (adults in pneumo-phtysiology in Treichville University Hospital, adults hospitalized in the internal medicine wards of Dabou hospital and children suffering of severe malnutrion in pediatric wards of Dabou hospital), exhibited antibodies either to HIV-1 alone (43 to 62% of the cases), to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 (30 to 40 % of the cases) or to HIV-2 alone (5 to 16 % of the cases). Furthermore, clinical follow-up of these different groups of AIDS patients showed that patients with only HIV-2 infection evolved better than those infected by HIV-1 alone, and that the clinical evolution of those having antibodies to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 was worse than that of patients with only HIV-1 infection. These results suggest that HIV-2 is less pathogenic than HIV-1, but that co-infection with both viruses leads to a more aggressive form of AIDS than infection by HIV-1 alone. HIV-2 transactivating genes may enhance replication of HIV-1 and be responsible for the worsening of the clinical evolution. 318 [Page 319](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/317) 5017 MICROELIZA HIV NTIBODY TESTING IN TO LEST AFRICA C.P.Freemn,MT(ASCP),MS-Chief Lab. Tech.,E.K.Kollie,M-T, Lab. Tech.,L.H. Reithner,M.D.,PFD,Chief Lanco Hospitals, Liberia. OBJECTIVES: To support the Lanco personnel and the infrastructure around Nimba and Buchana,Laco is running two hospitals.Each hospital is serving a population of 30-35,000,performing 700 surgical procedure arnually.The incentive to begin testing for HIV antibodies was to ascertain that the blood in our blood banks were not contaninated with HIV.Therefore,HIV antibody testing began May 1987. MATERIAL: The population tested were healthy,voluntary blood donors from Nirba(240mCf)and Buchana(95m4f)and healthy persons from Monrovia applying for inmigration visa 493. NETH]DS: Organon Teknika plate reader,a high speed 8-chamel photoTeter,an automatic washer,a computer and a heating block was test kits used were Organon Teknika Vironostika anti-HTL-III.The Microeliza system is designed to detect to human T-lynphotropic virus,subclass III in serun or plasma.All tests were read photmnetrically with the Organon Teknika reader.Some positive and negative controls from Du pont were also tested for confirmation ad control of the method. RESLLTS: All sarples were negative including the negative controls. All positive controls lere positive. CONCUJSION: The tested subjects cane from three different areas of Liberia.Monrovia the Capitol(n=41 ),Buhanan,international port(n=99) ad Ninba mining and logging area(n=249).No patients with clinical signs of AIDS have been reported in Nirba or Buchanan Hospitals.As the Organon test kit has a 75/o sensitivity to HTLV-IV,(Francis Barin Tours,France,lHO report Geneva February '87),a high frequency of HTLV-IV antibodies in the population should have been detected in these sarples.Further tests of larger sarples including risk groups are needed to determine the frequency of HTLVIII ad IV positive persons in the Liberian population.We have volunteered to assist. 5018 HIV1 AND HIV2 MALI. Francoise Brun-Vezinet*, de In order to determine the importance of retroviral infection in Mali, we studied the prevalence rates of HIV1 and HIV2 antibodies among different populations in Bamako, the capital city. Methods. In april 1987, 912 serum samples were collected. They were tested for HIV1 and HIV2 antibodies by Elisa, Western Blot, and RadioImmunoprecipitation-Assay; HIV1 and HIV2 transmembrane synthetic peptides were also used.

HIV2 infection was slightly higher in all groups. The highest rate of retroviral infection was observed in prostitutes; in this group positivity was correlated with the number of sexual partners. In hospitalized patients (Gastroenterology and Infectious Disease), clinical symptoms of AIDS were mainly associated with HIV2 or HIV1 plus HIV2 infection. In Mali the coexistence of HIV1 and HIV2 needs further study to evaluate their different patterns. of Calabar, Calabar. nbjective.

Objective: Reports on the prevalence and features of AIDS in Nigeria have recently been made. Since its establishment in 1986, the National ccmmittee has undertaken a systematic study of the situation. This preliminary report documents our experience. Our\\methods were standard. 17,762 serum samples were collected from different groups of subjects and patients from different parts of the country and screened by Elisa using Wellcozyme reagents. 329 were tested by Elavia 2 where indicated. Results showed that 16 samples (0.1%) were seropositive for HIV-1, nil for HIV-2. Nine of 16 seropositives (56.3%) were AIDS patients who presented with different combinations of features; their male:female ratio was 3:1 and mortality was 88.9%. It is concluded that HIV-1 is the current dominant AIDS infection in Nigeria. The need for intensive preventive public education is emphasized. ** To address Correspondence 319 [Page 320](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/318) 5021 SEROLOGICAL ELISA, VESTERN BLOT AND IMMUNOFLUORESCENT IN LAGOS, NIGERIA, SOMORIN A.Q,, SOGBAMU I,B,, HOFLER W, FROM DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF LAGOS, P,M,B, 12003, LAGOS, riTAv AND UNITERSITY OF TUBERIGEN, TUBINGEN, GERMANY, ABSTRACT A serological study of fifty adult, Nigerian patients suffering Fl^ ~yeoproliferative, sexually transmitted diseases, herpers zostefr assorted clinical states, were assessed for their antibody cont\"'A An initial screening of 50 sera was carried out by ELISA technique, The 3 HIV ELISA positive sera wre subsequently subjected to genosic Vesern blot analysis, Later these ELISA positive sera were assesed for their imnunofluorescent HIV antibody specificity, RESULL The study revealed: a) 3 ELISA HIV positive sera b) Genomic, HIV (Types I & II) antibody precipitation bands, c) Immurofluorescent antibody specificity of HIV Types I II1 infections, CONCLUSION The epidemiological,, immunological, clinical, and prognostic highlights of these results are discussed, 5022 THE EVALUATION OF AIDS IN HIV-2 ENDEMIC AREAS A. **Harvard University School of Public Health, Boston Objective. To evaluate the seroprevalence of retroviruses among suspected AIDS cases in Dakar, Senegal. Methods. We analyzed 68 hospital cases referred to Pr. M'Boup's laboratory in 1986-87. Results. 44 of these 68 individuals actually fulfilled the lJHO criteria for AIDS by these clinical criteria. Serologic analysis by WB and/or RIP data follow: Antibody Positive for HIV-1 HIV-2 Both Neither TOTAL: Suspected AIDS-Like Illness 19 (27.9) 14 (20.6) 4 (5.9) 31 (45.6) 68 (100) %Suspected AIDS-Like WHO Criteria Cases with '!HO AIDS Cases Criteria for AIDS 17 (38.6) 89.5 9 (20.5) 64.3 3 (6.8) 75.0 14 (34.1) 48.4 44 (100) 64.7 Conclusions. (1) 17 of 44 WHO-defined AIDS cases were seropositive for HIV-1. (2) 14 of 44 WHO-defined AIDS cases were seronegative to both HIV-1 and HIV-2, emphasizing the difficulty in attributing \"cause and effect\" to the evaluation of AIDS in West Africa. (3) There was no relationship between ill HIV-2 seropositive individuals who did not fulfill WHO criteria (9/44 compared to 5/24; odds rat =.93, p =.97), causing us to consider that HIV-2 disease manifestations may not be adequately monitored by WHO criteria for AIDS in this setting. Notes: 5023 Comparison of HIV1 and HIV2 infections Principal, Dakar Objective: To compare clinical and laboratory data from patients and healthy persons infected with HIVI or HIV2. Methods:Sera were collected from patients presenting with ARC or AIDS symptoms, blood donors (2000)and pregnant women (800) at * Hospital Principal\", and persons sent for HIV serodiagnosis in Institut Pasteur Specific HIVI and HIV2 ELISA kits (ELAVIA 1 and 2) were used to screen all sera. All positives were confirmed by western blot (LAV blot 1 and 2). Most western blot positive individuals were examined and bled for further biochemical and hematologic tests including T4/T8 ratio and macrophage phagocytic activity. Results:Using the 1987 CDC/UHO case definition for AIDS clinical evaluation, persons with HIVI and HIV2 were not distinguishable. Laboratory data from both clinically affected and apparently healthy individuals was independent of virus type. The ratio of HIV1 to HIV2 infection is 1 in both AIDS patients (21 HIV1,22 HIV2) and apparently healthy individuals (16 HIV1,17 HIV2). The sex ratio in patients (M/F=4)is comparable to HIV antibody prevalence of 1.5% among blood donors, mostly males between 20-40 years of age, and 0.3% among pregnant women. Conclusions: Among 76 HIV positive individuals studied in Dakar in 1987,clinical and laboratory findings suggest similar expression of HIVI and HIV2. 5024 HIV AND RELATED Dakar, SENEGAL **Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA. Objective. Regional surveillance of HIV-1 and HIV-2 in 6 different urban areas of Senegal. Identification of risk groups for HIV infection. Methods. 4583 serum samples were collected from select populations from 1985-1988 St. Louis, Dakar, M'Bour, Kaolack, Ziguinchor Individuals were classified three groups: a)High risk groups including prostitutes and STD patients, b)Hospitalized patients and c)Healthy adults as a control population. All samples were analyzed for reactivity to HIV-1 and HIV-2 by immunoblot and/or radioimmupoprecipitation in two laboratories (Senegal and U.S.). Results. Seroprevalence to Regional differences to HIV-1 and HIV-2 will be discussed. Age-specific seroprevalence suggests that HIV-2 has been present in this population for several generations at least. Conclusion. In 1985, HIV-2 was discovered in Senegal. This is the most common retrovirus in Senegal, however HIV-1 is entering the population. The pathogenicity of HIV-2 appears to differ from that of HIV-1. 320 [Page 321](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/319) 5025 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL SURVEY OF HIV-2 SENEGAL D. Ricard*, de Microbiologie, Hopital Le Dantec, Dakar, Sen;:jal. Objective. To evaluate the risk of infection and the pathogenicity of HIV-2 in an high prevalence risk population. Methods. In our preliminary study, 33 prostitutes from Casamance were found HIV-2 antibody positive and were clinically followed since 1985. We then in July 1987 established an age matched cohort of 110 prostitutes residing in this area and monthly attending the STD clinic for clinical evaluation. Most of the HIV-2 positive prostitutes of the preliminary study were included in this cohort for prospective study. Results. At enrolement, 39% of the prostitutes were HIV-2 infected. HIV-2 seropositivity was associated with age, the HIV-2 positive prostitutes being older than the HIV-2 negative ones, but no significant association was found with the duration of prostitution, number of clients, history of immunization, surgical intervention or scarifications. Comparing the clinical records, there was no difference between HIV-2 positive and negative groups. None of the HIV-2 positive prostitutes showed any signs or symptoms associated with immunodeficiency. Conclusion. These data are in accordance with a similar study conducted in Dakar where the HIV-2 prevalence is lower. Considering the studies published on clinical surveys of HIV-1 infected prostitutes in Central Africa, HIV-2 seems to be less pathogenic than HIV-1, or at least to have a longer latency period. 5026 OUTCOME OF AN AIDS COHORT IN WEST AFRICAN SETTING. A DAKAR COLLABORATIVE STUDY ON 60 CASES: 1986 - 1988 Dakar Service de MNdecine I du C.H.U. de Dakar *** Service de Pneumophtisiologie du C.H.U. de Dakar Objectives. To describe the outcome of AIDS patients in African environment, compare frequency and severity of pathologic episods due to HIV-1 or HIV-2 and analyse socio-economic impact of the disease. Methods. Since June 1986 after the first publication of an AIDS case in Senegal, more than hundred patients suspected to be infected with HIV are admitted in the main Clinics of the University Hospital Center (C.H.U.) of Dakar. By December 1987, 60 among the followed had positive antibodies testing (ELISA and W.B.) and are the background of this paper. Follow up period starting from June 1986 will continue until June 1988. All events (opportunist diseases, deaths, laboratory analyses and medications) are computerized. Recruitment period is from June 1986 to December 1987. Among the cases 43 males and 16 females; 26 were infected with HIV-1, 28 with HIV-2 and for 5 cases we observed a double serologic.al profile. Conclusion. By December 1987, 31 of the followed died so, the case fatality rate (CFR) is 52% a year. A dramatic decrease of family income is observed. Notes: CLINICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS University Hospital, Brazzav lie 2: Pitid-Salpdtriere Hospital, Paris Objective: Identify the main clinical and biological features of AIDS in the Congo. Methods: Analysis of 62 well-documented cases of AIDS; diagnosis based on a combination of the WHO clinical criteria for AIDS in Africa and HIV-positivity shown by Elavia and Western Blot. Results: There were 34 men, average age 36, and 28 women, average age 32: a sex ratio of 1.2. 19% of cases had earlier received transfusions. The main clinical signs are: significant weight loss: node tuberculosis. 83% presented anergy to tuberculin and candidin. Six patients out of 27 presented anomalies of the ocular fundus, including 3 dysoric nodules. Among the 18 lymph node biopsies there were 12 with atypical features 3 cases of tuberculosis, 1 of Hodgkin's disease, 1 atypical mycobacteriosis and 1 Karposi's sarcoma. 18 cases out of 49 had lymphopenia (less than 1500/mm3). Anaemia was found in most cases: 4 patients out of 28 had a platelet count of< 100 000/mm3. Conclusions: The results accord with those previously presented for Central Africa. These cases are distinguished from cases of AIDS in Western countries by the following features: a sex ratio close to 1, frequent history of blood transfusiom, high prevalence of chronic diarrhoea, pruriginous dermatitis and rarity of Karposi's sarcoma. 5028 HIV1 INFECTION IN AN URBAN POPULATION OF WOMEN (PROGRESS REPORT) M.Lallemant*, **** INSERM U132, Paris Objective. To identify risk factors of maternal HIV1 infection in the course of a study of HIV1 materno-foetal transmission. Methods. 1531 pregnant women were enrolled in 1987 at the time of routine examination in 2 mother-child clinics in Brazzaville. Sera were tested by ELISA with confirmation by WB (ELAVIA & LAVBLOT, Diagn.Pasteur). Results. 130 women had positive or borderline ELISA. 48 women had uninterpretable WB. The prevalence rate of confirmed anti-HIV1 was 4.0% (62/1531). Characteristics of anti-HIV1(+) vs (-) women anti-HIV1 (+) anti-HIV1(-) Age mortality0 27% + 13 22% + 3 Miscarriageo 16% 18% + 3 31% + 14 21% + 3 Stillbirths0 0 6% + 1 Transfusion 8% ~ 7 3% ~ 1 * % of column o rate Conclusion. That none of these parameters discriminates between anti-HIV1(+) and (-) women demonstrates the difficulty in identifying a population at risk to which prevention might be preferentially targetted. A-21 321 [Page 322](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/320) 5029 BURKINA R Soudre*, P Ouedraogo*, Laboratory, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, **Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA, ***USAID, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, \"Genetic Systems Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA. Objective. A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2) infection among high risk groups in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Methods. A serosurvey was conducted of 416 individuals in three study groups: tuberculosis patients (TB), hospitalized patients (HP), and sexually transmitted disease patients (STD). Specimens were tested on site by ELISA. Subsequent whole virus ELISA, peptide ELISA, Western blot analysis, and selective virus culture are in process at CDC. Results. Based on repeat ELISA, HIV-1 seroprevalence is high (TB=30% HP=23%), while HIV-2 seroprevalence remains relatively (TB=2% HP=0.5%). Western blot analysis of all reactive sera is ongoing as is the analysis of dually reactive to HIV-1 are being further evaluated by peptide ELISA and Western blot. Conclusion. This preliminary study suggests that both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are present within Burkina Faso, but that the seroprevalence of HIV-1 is greater than that of HIV-2. The significance of dual ELISA reactivity as well as the clinical interaction of HIV-1 and HIV-2 need to be determined. 5030 CLINICAL ASPECTS of Public Health, ** Central Hospital, *** University Hospital, **** Centre Pasteur, YAOUNDE CAMEROON. Objective. To describe the clinical aspects of AIDS in Cameroon. Methods. A campain for active casefinding was conducted since 1985, and patients suspected of AIDS were refered to Central Hospital Yaounde where blood for HIV serology testing was obtained, interviews and examinations carried out. Results. As of December 1987, 47 cases of AIDS have been diagnosed: 20 men and 27 women. The mean age was 37 ranged from 18 to 59. The mortality rate is running at 50 %. The most frequent clinical symptoms were: severe loss of weight (> 10 % body weight) 96 %; asthenia 96 %; fever (prolonged or intermittent since at least 1 month) 90 %; chronic diarrhea 86 %; cough 48% (of those 60% 6 %. Some infections have been discovered: cryptosforidiosis, candidosis of digestive tract, tuberculosis (pulmonary, intestinal), septicemia (salmonella typhi murium), herpes zoster. Conclusion. The clinical spectrum of AIDS in Cameroon is similar to the one described in the other central Africa countries. Notes: 5031 SEROLOGY SURVEY OF OCEAC Yaounde Cameroon. Objective: Detection of antibodies to HIV1 among the normal population. Methods: The handerson method was used in 17 towns of Cameroon: 5 400 sera were collected in adults populations and 667 samples in children under 14 years old. Elisa technic were performed (Elavia of diagnostics Pasteur). Confirmation test by Western Blott (Dupont de Nemours). Results: Out of 5 400 samples in adults, 27 were found positive. The prevalence is 0,5 %. Among 667 samples in children only 2 were found positive. The prevalence is 0,3 %. Conclusion: Low prevalence among normal population. This is in agreement with the few number of clinical cases (47) observed since 1985. 5032 SERO-PREVALENCE OF HIV INFECTION IN CENTRAL AFRICA ** Projet National de lutte contre le Sida Objective. Since 1983 epidemiologic surveys of the major cities and of the rural areas of Congo, Chad, Gabon, Central African Republic, Mozambique, and Equatorial Guinea were performed in order to determine the extent of HIV infection. Method. Study populations (ages 15-45) were chosen according to the cluster sampling method. In addition, we surveyed at-risk or suspected at-risk groups. Sera were first screened by Elisa. Positive results were confirmed on Western Blot. Results. The rates of seropositivity range from 0 % to 0.25 % in some rural areas (Mora, Cameroon; Makokou, Gabon; Nsork, Equatorial Guinea) to 0 %-7,8 % in major cities (Ndjamena, 0 %, 1986; Brazzaville 1986 4.6 %, Bangui 1987 7.8 %. In the CAR, it is now apparent that certain semi-rural towns near Bangui have begun to show significant rates of seropositivity: Bambari 1987 3.7 %. Statistical analysis has demonstrated that female have a significantly higher rate of HIV infection than male in Bangui (1986 and 1987) and Bozoum (1987). Finally, risk groups have shown tremendous variability in seroprevalence rates: prostitutes, Bangui 1986 20 %; malnourished children, Bangui 1986 12 %; tuberculosis patients, Bangui 6 %; sexual promiscuous adults, Bozoum 1987 7,8 %; and hospitalized patients, Bozoum 1987 6 %. Conclusion. HIV infection is widespread yet variable in Central Africa and appears to be spreading from urban centers to smaller towns. 322 [Page 323](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/321) 5033 CONTINUING STUDIES ON SEROEPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEYS OF HIV INFECTION IN CENTRAL AFRICA: ABOUT 35 SAMPLE SURVEYS. R. JOSSE1 E. DELAPORTE2 D.KOUKA-BEMBA1, KAPTUE., PASTEUR, BANGUI, RCA. Objective. A three years seroepidemiolooical survey for HIV1 antibodies has been conducted since January 1985 in six countries of Central Africa: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. Methods. All in all, 14000 randomly selected peoples were concerned by 35 serolooical cluster sample surveys carried out by OCEAC and National Health Services. All sera were screened usina Elisa test, then positive cases were confirmed by Western Blot (GP 110 or GP 41 and their percursor GP 160). Results. In the general population sero prevalence rates vary from 0 to 7,5 %. The prevalence of anti HIV1 anti bodies observed in Western Blot are significantly hioher in adults (<15 years) and in urban areas. Both sexes are infected by HIV1 but females seem more affected than males. In several towns incidence rates are evaluated by comparison from one year to the other. Anti HIV2 anti bodies were found in Central African Republic and Gabon with very low level (WB GP 36/41 or GP 105 and their precursor GP 130) and in Congo. Conclusion. Sera Elisa+/WB- are numerous and the Western Blotting tests show non specific bands. The problem of the interpretation of these sera is still unsolved. 5034 HIV INFECTION IN KAGERA REGION, TANZANIA: A POPULATION BASED STUDY Klinton Nyamuryekunge*, *Bukoba hospital, Bukoba,**Muhimbili Medical Centre, es Tanzania,***National Bacteriological Laboratory, Stockholm,****University of Umea, Umea, Sweden. Objektive. A population based survey was commenced in August 1987 to determine the magnitude of HIV infection in the Kagera region of Tanzania where the initial cases of AIDS were reported in 1983. Methods. A cluster sampling technique was used to obtain a study population from the region which had been divided into four zones based on presumed differences in HIV infection rates. Sera were collected and screened for HIV-1 antibodies by two ELISAs and positive sera were further tested by Western blotting. Results. Data from 1063 adults (15-54 years of age) have been analysed so far, representing almost half of the total study population. The HIV seropositivity rate was 10% and less than 1%, respectively, in two rural zones while it was 43% in the urban zone. The positivity rate varied considerably between different wards of the urban zone. Overall, the highest proportion of positives was found in age groups between 25-39 years. The seroprevalance was higher among males than among females in the rural zones but not in the urban areas. Conclusion. The prevalance of HIV infection differs greatly in various parts of the Kagera region and is much higher in the urban zone as compared to the rural zones.

Objective. To determine the HIV seroprevalence and the importance of HIV as a cause of death at UH. Methods. Cardiac puncture was performed on 500 (89%) of 563 cadavers received at UH between 15 August and 22 December, 1987. UH is a reference hospital serving Kinshasa's 3 million inhabitants. Cause of death was obtained from death certificates and medical history from clinical charts. An external examination was performed. Blood was tested for HIV-1 antibodies (ELISA and Western blot). HIV-1 seronegative suspect cases of AIDS will also be tested for HIV-1 antigen and HIV-2 antibody (ELISA and Western blot). 5036 HIV-1 PREVALENCE IN HOSPITAL PATIENTS AND PREGNANT WOMEN IN MALAWI HM Ntaba*, GN **Max von Pettenkofer Institute, Munich, FRG Introduction. It is essential to have accurate information about the prevalence and incidence of HIV infections to predict the further spread of this infection in various regions of the world. We have began to get some of this information for Malawi. Methods and Results. About 800 serum samples were obtained from adults of urban and rural areas and from 96 antenatal women from 4 towns from the central and southern region in 1986 and from 290 antenatal women from 8 towns in 1987. All sera were tested in a sensitive ELISA for anti-HIV and reactive samples were confirmed in an immunoblot. Only sera reacting with at least 2 viral antigens were scored as anti-HIV positive. Anti-HIV Adults Antenatal women 1987 1986 1987 Positive 132(16%) 4(4.2%) 19(6.5%) Negative 688 92 271 The 4 positive women in 1986 came all from one and 15 of the 19 positive women in 1987 from the two main towns. The anti-HIV positive adults (in- and outpatients) were distributed over the entire country with a predominance in the urban centres. None were anti-HIV-2 positive. Conclusion. HIV infections in Malawi appear to be widespread with a predominance in urban areas. Further studies are urgently needed to monitor the further spread of the infection and the effectiveness of control programmes. Results.

Objective: To determine the seroprevalence and estimate incidence of HIV-1 infection in pregnant women in Malawi. Methods: In May 1985 a serosurvey of consecutive pregnant women was conducted in Lilongwe and Blantyre. The survey was repeated in April 1987, and incidence was calculated from the two estimates of prevalence in unselected populations. Other serosurveys were conducted during late 1987 and serve to estimate the period prevalence. Serological testing was performed using the Genetic Systems ELISA and Biotech Research Laboratories Western blot. Results: Seroprevalence of HIV-1 infection was 2% (4/200) in 1985 and was 8% (7/85) by mid-1987. These two estimates of prevalence in similar populations yield an annual incidence of 3% to 4%. During the last half of 1987, the period prevalence of HIV-1 antibody was 9.5% in a group of 399 pregnant women. Conclusion: HIV-1 infection is prevalent in Central Africa and requires intensive intervention to reduce incidence. More intensive studies are needed regarding the predominant mode of spread and effective methods in reducing dissemination of the virus. 5038 SEROEPIDEMIOLOGIC ANALYSES ON POPULATIONS FROM UGANDA AND TUNISIA - HIGH AND LOW RISK AFRICAN REGIONS FOR HIV INFECTIONS, RESPECTIVELY Gaetano Giraldc1, D Serwadda2, Establishment of HIV antibody prevalence by IIF and Western blot analyses in selected high and low incidence areas of Africa: high - Uganda: serum samples from more than 1000 hospital populations (bled 10/86-6/87) showed a seropositivity to HIV-1 in 8% of patients with fractures, 20% in pregnant women, 30% in patients with carcinomas, 45% in Kaposi's sarcomas and 58% in patients with TBC. While none had antibodies to HIV-2 alone, 18.7% showed a double reactivity to HIV-1 and HIV-2. Current analysis is ongoing for antibody prevalence to HHV-6. Low-Tunisia: serum samples (10/85-10/87) from 1500 blood donors demonstrated a seropositivity to HIV-1 of 0.13%, from 373 prostitutes of 1.9%. No antibody prevalence to HIV-2 has been observed in more than 3000 serum samples from various risk groups, such as prostitutes, sailors, prisoners, blood donors and students. These data confirm a) high HIV-1 infection rates in hospital populations,as also observed in some other capital cities of equatorial African regions and b) identifies Tunisia as a country with low HIV infections.

The 2 outstanding risk factors were low age & promiscuityo The sero-positive persons had a mean age of 27 yrs (SoD = 12) while the sero-negative persons had a mean age of 32 yrs (SoD = 15) the difference was significant P o,001o Promiscuity as assessed by number of sex partners in the past 6 months was strongly associated with HIV infection. Persons who recorded no sex partners in the past 6 months had a sero-prevalence of 8.2% those with 1 partner 12o9%, 2 - 5 partners 13o3%, 6 - 9 partners 14*2% and 10 partners + 21.7%o When the seroprevalence is correlated with the median number of sex partners in each category, the correlation coefficient r is 0094, (the group with 10 partners + was regarded as being 10 - 20 with a median of 15)o Preliminary conclusions from the survey are that in the area studied HIV infection rate is about 12% in the adult population, and the infection rate is higher in women, in the younger age groups & in people with many sex partners, It is also estimated that for each person with Aids symptoms there are about 80 healthy - looking infected persons in the communityo 5040 Cross sectional Study of HIV Infection in South Western Uganda. W.R.Naamara* I.Minawa** R.Knight**F.Plummer*** * ACP Uganda ** Dept of C.M. Nairobi University *** Dept of Microbiology Nairobi University. Heterosexual transmission of HIV in Uganda is well known but the prevalence is not well known. This study was to determine the seroprevalence, risk factors and morbidity of HIV in this rural community. 400 participants were seen. 46% high risk, 31% normal risk and 22.7% children. 67.7%, 17.7% and 1.1% were seropositive for HIV respectively. There was a significant difference in these groups p=0.0000. M/F ratio was 1:1.3. HIV was associated with number of sexual partners in high pop. only p=0.0002. Having more than one sexual partners had OR 3.09 95% CL 1.4-6.39 in high risk pop. No significance in normal risk. Marital status was associated with HIV p=0.002 in normal risk pop. only. Divorce had an OR of 4.49 95% CL 1.42-14,25. Injections were associated with HIV in all the pop. groups p=0.0001. PCN used as a screening sign had sensitivity of 93.18% in high risk pop. and 85.7% in normal risk. HIV was associated with HZ and Lues, F-test 0.032 and p= 0.004 respectively. Injections, Number of sexual partners were big risk factors. Further studies are needed to evaluate these observations.We conclude that HIV is a big problem in this rural area with high risk pop. as the reservoir. 324 [Page 325](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/323) 5041 THE CLINICAL IYP NIFESTATIONS OF AIDS IN AN cFRICPN POPULATION - some Senior Lecturer,Makerere Univ.lied.ach. LITY, COUNTRY: KAMPALA, UGANDA In most developing African countries, the diagnosis of AIDS depends on the UHO clinical case definition. Unfortunately, confirmatory tests are rarely available, and in an analysis of over 500 patients who fulfilled the UHO clinical c.se definition but were HIV-serology negative various conditions were identified as potential diagnostic pitfalls. Infections particularly tuberculosis, other bacterial infections, hidden pus and parasitic infestations very often mimick AIDS. Lymphomas and occult carcinomas often present with prolonged fever and cachexia akin to 'SLIM' disease. Endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus,thyrotoxicosis and Addison 's disease, cause weight loss and dermatomucosal features similar to those of AIDS. Other misleading conditions include mosquito bites scabies and skin drug reactions. Some individuals who develop extreme fear of AIUS present with anxiety and somatic features such as diarrhoea, anorexia, weight loss, fatigue and night sweats leading to a mistaken diagnosis of the disease. 5042 HIV-1 AND HIV-2 SEROPREVALENCE IN DISEASE FREE AND PATIENT GROUPS IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF ANGOLA. M. O. SANTOS FERREIRAl, T. COHEN2, M. H. LOURENGO1, M. J. MATTOS DE Paris. OBJECTIVE To determine HIV-1 and HIV-2 seroprevalence in disease free and patient groups in Angola. METHODS Serum samples obtained from disease free (Group A) and patient (Group B) groups from 4 provinces comprising a total of 1194 subjects were studied for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies by the ELISA ( ELAVIA, Pasteur Diagnostics ); positive cases in the ELISA were confirmed by Western blot. and immunofluorescence. Group A consisted of 563 persons recruited among blood donors (112), displaced persons(142) pregnant women (38), army personnel (105) and urban residents(166).Group B consisted of 621 subjects distributed over the following groups: Sexually transmitted diseases (204), hospital inpatients (151) outpatients (156) and tuberculosis (110). RESULTS As shown in the TABLE higher percentages of positive cases were seen in the patient than in the disease free group. SEROPREVALENCE IN ANGOLA GROUP N HIV1+ HIV2+ 9,3% 2,7% Striking differences also seen within each group according to region, with the highest % of positive cases in the northeastern region with a border with Zaire. CONCLUSION The present results provide an additional illustration of the extent of HIV seroprevalence in Africa and of the equal contribution of HIV-1 and HIV-2 for that prevalence. The sum of the percent is 10,1% (Group A) and 20,0% (Group B).

To determine, with the respective Ministries of Health, the seroprevalence of HIV in the population, and in high risk groups. Methods. Approximately 15 serosurveys were conducted with the Ministries of Health during 1986-88. Results. The seroprevalence of antibodies to HIV in the general population of Egypt, Sudan, Somalia, and Djibouti is extremely low, no positives having been identified in over 8000 sera that were examined. The prevalence in high risk groups including prostitutes, drug addicts, truck drivers, STD clinic patients and others is also low, ranging from less than.01% to 1.2%. This data is based on analysis of over 5000 sera fromhigh risk groups, on multiple occasions. Possible reasons for this very low prevalence will be discussed. Conclusion. The seroprevalence of HIV in these countries and in high risk groups of these countries is low.

Virology and Rickettsiology Division. P.O.Box 1242. Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Objective. To study the prevalence of HIV infection in HBsAg positive patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods. HBsAg positive sera samples stored in the deep freezer since 1983 are randomly picked out and tested for anti HIV. 180 representative samples for the years between 1933-1987 were tested for anti HIV. 50 sera samples from blood donors negative for H3sAg collected in 19333 were also tested for anti HIV. The blood donors samples are included in the study as a control group. In all cases first generation ELISA kits Organon, Holland and Sorin Biomedica, Italy were used for the detection of anti HIV. Result. Only one sample 1/230 (0.43%) was found to be positive for anti HIV. The positivity of the sample was confirmed by both tests. The positive sample was found out to be from the 1987 collection. The sample was taken from a young male of 29 years of age. Conclusion. The low incidence of HIV infection in a potentially high risk group indicates that the Aids epidemic has not yet reached Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Since Ethiopia is in a preepidemic state for the Aids epidemic extensive sex education will play a major role in the prevention of the widespreac of the infection in the country. 5046 PREVALENCE OF HIV INFECTION IN A GROUP OF LUMPEN INDIVIDUALS IN ADDIS ABABA Debrework Zewde, Gezahagn Adal.

Bekura*, S. Buttb**, G.B. Rossi**. *Armed Forces General Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, ** Lab. of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy. Objective. To study the presence of HIV infection in Ethiopia. Methods. Tests for anti HIV antibodies were carried out by ELISA and reactive sera wge retested labelled infected cell lysates. RIA assays were used for HBV markers detection. Results. The study group was composed by 5270 military recruits aged 18 to 30 years and by 336 outpatients. The sera were collected in the period 1985-86 and were representative of each region of the country. The prevalence of HBV markers was 12% for HBsAg and 74% for at least one HBV marker. 118 out of 5606 sera (2.10%) were found reactive by ELISA for HIV-1. These reactivities were confirmed by W.B. only in four cases (0.07%). 23 sera presented reactivity to one or two bands related to core proteins (p15 or p24 or p55) and were, therefore, further tested for antibodies to HIV-2 by ELISA, W.B. (Pasteur) and RIPA; only two out of the 23 sera were found slightly reactive in ELISA, but not by W.B. and RIPA. Conclusion. Our data indicate that HIV infection was not widespread, at least until 1986,in the general population of Ethiopia. The high prevalence of HBV infection in the screened population suggests however that it could be considered \"at risk\" also for HIV. 326 [Page 327](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/325) 5049 THE SITUATION OF HIV INFECTION IN DJIBOUTI Abbatte EA*, Said S*, I Fox** *Ministry of Health, Djibouti, **US Naval Medical Research Unit No.3 (A WHO Collaborating Center for AIDS), Cairo, Egypt Objective. To determine if HIV-infection was present in the Republic of Djibouti in late 1987. Methods. A total of 645 high risk individuals were studied (150 hospitalized patients, 295 female prostitutes, 115 male STD patients and 85 others). Screening for HIV antibodies was done by ELISA (Abbott) while confirmation was done by Western blot (Dupont). Results. Only 8 subjects were found HIV seropositive. Two were young Djiboutian men, while 6 were young women who admitted to prostitution. The HIV seropositivity rate was 2% + 1.6% in the female prostitute population. One HIV-antibody positive woman also tested positive for circulating HIV-antigen. Of the 8 HIV seropositive subjects, 7 had no abnormal clinical signs, while the eighth was a 28-year old man hospitalized for pneumonia. Conclusion. In Djibouti in late 1987, the prevalence of both AIDS and HIV infection in high risk individuals was much lower than that reported from other East-African countries.

MSc.1'2 F M Mueke MD CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTRE (KEMRI) P.O BOX 20778, NAIROBI 2. National AIDS Committee - Nairobi Epidemiology Sub-Committee. 3. National AIDS Co-ordinator, Ministry of Health P.O Box 30016, NAIROBI. As of December 1987 a total of 1,304 cases of AIDS have been reported to the Ministry of Health among persons residing in Kenya. The first case was reported in early 1984 and since then the number of cases have increased dramatically. The disease is primarily an urban disease with over 90% coming from the major cosmopolitan areas of Mombasa, Nairobi, Kisumu and Nakuru. Those towns are also along the TransAfrican highway linking the west Coast to the East Coast of Africa. About 3% of the cases are aged < 5 years and are presumed to be infected perinatally while over 90% of the cases are aged 15-50 years. The male to female ratio is approximately 1:1. There were no distinct occupational groups at risk but sexual promiscuity or being a patner to a sexually promiscous person seems to be a distinct risk factor. Homosexuality and IV drug usage are not significant in the Kenyan situation. The commonest clinical manifestations are chest infections prolonged diarrhoea, weight loss, oral thrush, herpes zooster and kaposis sarcoma. The case fatality rate is about 50% annually. Blood donor screening since March 1987 have shown a gradual rise in seropositivity with the current level of 2.3%. AIDS is therefore a serious health problem in Kenya. Notes: 5051 LOW PREVALENCE OF HIV-1 INFECTION IN A RURAL AREA OF KENYA Heiner Bicherl, GG Fr6sner Max von Pettenkofer-Institut, University of Munich, FRG Objective. Prevalence of anti-HIV-1 was determined in an isolated rural area in the Rift-Valley Upland of Kenya. Methods. Between August and October 1986 a total of 379 sera (23 from hospital staff, 63 pregnant women, 17 children, and 254 patients treated mainly because of malaria, accidents and diarrhoea) were collected and tested for anti-HIV by recombinant anti-HTLV III EIA (Abbott Lab.). Results. From initially 29 reactive sera only one was confirmed to contain anti-HIV-1 by Western blot and by a highly specific immunoblot using recombinant HIV-antigen (Lancet 1987 II, 1093). This serum belonged to a 31 year olf businessman treated because of a road accident, who is likely to travel outside the area. The comparatively low prevalence of anti-HIV-1 is in agreement with a relatively low prevalence of 41.7 % for anti-HBc, 2.9 % for HBsAg, and 8.7 % for syphilis antibody as determined by hemagglutination test. Conclusion. The data suggest that HIV-1 may still not be highly prevalent in isolated areas of central Africa. 5052 Dr. D.M. Owili, M.D. Consultant Dermatologistt Dr. S.

Hygiene, ***Inst. r. Med. Chemistry and Biochemistry and **Dep. of Neurology, University of Innsbruck, Austria. Objective. To describe the sero-prevalence and the diagnostic problems of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in a rural area of North-West-Tanzania. Methods. Sera of 253 persons attending a Health Centerwere collected. All sera were tested with commercially available ELISA for HIV-l-antigen and for antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2. Antigen reactive sera were confirmed with a neutralization procedure and antibody reactive sera were confirmed by conventional and recombinant Western-Blot (WB) with the HIV---gp4l. Results. 2 sera without antibodies reacted confirmed positive in the antigen-assay. 22 sera reacted positive in the screening ELISA for HIV-1 and 12 in the screening ELISA for HIV-2. In the HIV-1 WB 6 sera were positive and 2 doubtful. In the recombinant gp41 7 sera were clearly positive and two doubtful. In the HIV-2 WB 1 serum was positive, 2 sera gave doubtful results. All sera known to be HIV-1 positive showed a cross reaction with the HIV-2-p26. The HIV-2 positive sera reacted also positive in the recombinant WB with HIV-1 gp41 and in the conventional WB for HIV-1. Conclusions. (1)Sero-prevalence of HIV-1 in a rural area is much lower than expected. (2)There might be few cx=es of HIV-2 infections in East Africa, but cross reacti in conventional HIV-1-WBs complicates the diagn;, is ( 3 Recombinant proteins of the transmembrane region c:jn help to distinguish between HiTV-;,i ii V 2 infection. 5054 AIDS IN NORTHERN TANZANIA: AN URBAN DISEASE MODEL W.M.M.M. Nkya, W.P. Howlet, C. Assenga and B Nyombi. Northern Reference Centre for Parasitic and Infectious Disease, KCMC, Moshi, Tanzania. A longitudinal serosurvey cutting through an urban and a rural population was carried out. A total of 1861 people were screened for the presence of antibodies against HIV - I by both ELISA and Western blot tests. About 1365 people were from Moshi town and 100 of them were demonstrated to have HIV-1 antibodies giving a prevalence of 7%. 496 people from both the rural centres were screened and none was demonstrated to have any circulating antibodies against HIV-1. The results of this survey shows that the epidemic is presently spreading in the town but not in the rural area giving an impression of an urban disease model. Notes: 5055 AS IM*NILGIC PARMETER. E.

W^bchter 2. 1 Department of Neurology, 2 Tnstitute of medical chemistry and biochemistry, 3 Institute of Hygiene University Tnnsbruck, Austria, 4 Nyakaiga Hospital, Tanzania. 253 consecutive patients, seen in a rural hospital of FNA-Tanzania ere examined clinically and screened serologically for HTV 1 and 2 antibodies and antigen and for ab to various infectious pathogens. Determination of Neopterin was chosen as imiunologic parameter because of limited local laboratory facilities and it's acceptable stability on trans-,crt.8 patients (= 3,2) vwre diagnosed clinically - according to established criteria (Colebunders)-as suffering from AIDS.5 of them had either HfV 1 or 2 ab and in two ab negative AIDS-patients HTV 1 ag was found. Additionally in four individuals with different other diseases HIV 1 or 2 ab were detected. Persistent fever, weightloss, diarrhea and cough (> 1 month) and a history of previous gonorrhea were significantly associated with HTV \"seropositivity\", whereas preceding operations, injections, blood-transfusions, vaccinations and scarifications did not show any correlation to HIV status (Fisher's exact test). Test for linear trend showed a significant correlation of nervous system affection an a highly significant correlation of pathological lyrphnode status with HTY \"seropositivity\". Kruskal-4allis HTV B virus (69,2%) and T. pallidum (I1,~5..bo differences for these antibody prevalences could be found when broken dobn into HWV 1/2 seropositives and - negatives. Activation of T-lymphocytes, ref~ected by raised neopterin levels, is thought to be a predisposing factor for developing AIDS. All 7 HIV seropositive ATDS patients had extramely high neopterin levels, compared with non-AIDS HIV seropositivs. This is consistent with the fact, that a stimulation of the T-cell/macrophage system is, indeed, paralellino development of AIDS. 5056 SEROEPIDIEIOLOGICAL STUDY ON HIV-1 AND HIV-2 PREVALENCE IN MOZAMBICAN GENERAL POPULATION. 1987. F.DE LA CRZsJ.BARRETO, PALIA MINI STRY OF HEALTH, NOZAMBI QUE. Objective: To evaluate the HIV 1 and HIV 2 circulation in Mozambican general population. Methods: A random sample of individuals aged 15 -44yrs both sexes, living in the ten capital towns were selected by a multi-stage sampling method. In the first step a cluster sampling method was applied using the \"quarteirao\",the smallest administrative division, as sampling unit. In the second step households were random selected and all adult people living there were included in the study. A total of 6100 serum samples were collected in the second semester of 1987. Each individual studied was interviewed to collect demographic data and potential risk factors. A clinical examination looking for clinical signs of AIDS was also done.For HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies screening ELISA (ELAVIA I & II) and WB (BIO-RAD & LAV BLOT II) kits were used. Results:Preliminary results already available have shown evidences of HIV 1 and HIV 2 circulation in the country. HIV 1 prevalence found in Maputo and Beira was 0.9% and in Nampula 2.2%. HIV 2 reactivity rate by ELISA has been higher than HIV 1 but WB confirmation is underway.Results on HIV seroepidemiology in the ten capital towns will be presented. The usefulness of serosurvey for initial evaluation of AIDS situation and for monitoring epidemic progression will be discussed. 328 [Page 329](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/327) 5057 THE DISTRIBUTION OFHIV I\\FECTICN of Health.

Notes: 5059 PREVALENCE OF HIV-2 ANTIBODIES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. 5060 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF AIDS IN SOUTH AFRICA S. ANTUNES and R SHER. Department of Immunology, School of Pathology, University of the Witwatersrand and The South African Institute for Medical Research, Johannesburg. South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of HIV-2 antibodies in Southern Africa. METHODS: 1036 sera from the following countries and groups of people were tested: Malawi 194, Mocambique 140, Zambia 132, Botswana 100, West Africa 76, Lesotho 65, black South Africans 91, haemophiliacs 48 and white South African homosexual men 52. All sera were tested for HIV-1 antibodies with the Abbott recombinant EIA except Malawians, which were tested with the Wellcozyme EIA. All positives were confirmed with an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test. The ElaviaR Ac-Ab-Ac II was used to measure HIV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: 209 sera were positive for HIV-1 antibodies and of these 136 (65%) also reacted positively with the HIV-2 test. Eighty-two percent of those found to be positive with Wellcozyme test and 59% with the Abbott test cross reacted with HIV-2. Thirty-seven of the HIV-1 negative sera were positive on first testing with the HIV-2 test, however only two, both from Malawi, were found to be repeatedly positive. CONCLUSION: This study shows that 1) at present, there is little, if any, HIV-2 infection in Southern Africa, 2) there is cross reaction between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigens. BD Schoub*, HS Hurwitz**. *National Institute for Virology, **City of Johannesburg Health Department, South Africa. Until recently AIDS in South Africa has followed almost exclusively a \"Western\" pattern, mainly in white male homosexuals and a few blood product recipients. The prediction of a \"Western\" pattern in the white population and an \"African\" pattern in the black population may well by an over-simplification. The dimensions of the epidemic may be quantified in terms of end-stage disease based on voluntary notifications of AIDS, providing post-facto information on the status of the epidemic some 1 - 5 years previously. At 31/1/88 a total of 77 South African AIDS cases were reported, 72 or them in white homosexuals or blood product recipients, thus giving a population incidence of \"Western AIDS\" (using the total white population as a denominator) of 15.5 per million compared to 208 per million for the USA and 21.5 per million for the UK. Epidemiological aberrations are apparent with respect to the shape of the AIDS epidemiological curve which has not shown the logarithmic increase seen elsewhere in Western countries and also in the unexpected lag in the development of \"African AIDS\" given the potential extent of introduction of the virus by, for example, migrant Malawian mine workers. Antibody prevalence studies in sentinel populations have corroborated the low level of epidemic activity in the country. Extrapolation of future trends will need to be carefully assessed on the characteristics of the population as well as knowledge of the behaviour of the virus. 329 [Page 330](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/328) 5061 AIDS IN SOUTH AFRICA 1982-1987. R Sher, D Sifris, J Metz. AIDS Unit, School of Pathology, University of the Witwatersrand and South African Institute for Medical Research, Johannesburg, South Africa. Objective. To present the epidemiology of AIDS in South Africa - 1982-1987. Methods. Patients with AIDS from all over South Africa were diagnosed according to CDC criteria, and reported to the AIDS ADVISORY GROUP since 1982. Results. A total of 76 cases of AIDS - 1982 (2), 1983 (4), 1984 (8), 1985 (8), 1986 (21), 1987 (33) - were recorded and the overall mortality rate was 70%. The composition of cases was homosexual/bisexual men 65, heterosexuals 5, blood transfusion related 3 and haemophiliacs 3. Seventy-two of the cases were white, 3 black and one coloured. Sexual distribution was 74 male and 2 female. The main geographical areas reporting cases were Johannesburg 60.5%, Cape Town 17.1%, Durban 9.2%, Pretoria 6.6%. The commonest opportunistic diseases addition to the 76 cases of AIDS reported in South Africans a further 22 cases from other countries - Malawi (11), Zambia (8), Zaire (1), Haiti (1) and Canada (1) - were also seen. Conclusions. 1) There has been an exponential increase in AIDS cases since 1982. 2) The epidemiological pattern of AIDS so7 far is similar to that seen in Western countries. 3) Three cases of AIDS in black South Africans were reported for the first time in 1987. 5062 HIV SEROPOSITIVITY IN HIGH-RISK GROUPS IN ARGENTINA: FUTURE IMPACT ON HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION G Muchinik*, Oscar Fay***, Cahn**, To analyse seropositivity in risk ponulations in Argentina and evaluate possible imoact on transmission. Methods. ELISA and immunofluorescence studies, confirmed by Western Blot, were carried out on 1419 homosexuals(HS), 609 intravenous drug addicts(IVDA), 413 hemophiliacs(HF) and 87 heterosexuals (ITS) having sexual contact with seroTositive individuals, without any orevious risk factors, all of them snontaneously attending the Reference Centres. Results. Grouo HS IVDA HF HTS Total n 1419 609 413 87 HIV n 253 236 144 13 646 Positivity % 18 39 35 15 26 Total 2528 Conclusions. IVDA and HF seronositivity was twice that of HS, while HTS seronositivity was similar to HS. If these Dreliminary data are to define an enidermiological tendency, the number of heterosexually transmitted cases is exoected to grow. Notes: 5063 PREVALENCE OF HIV-1 SENEGAL, ***Special Programs on AIDS, WHO, Geneva, SWITZERLAND, **** Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA. Objective. To survey select populations in Benin for the presence of HIV-1 and HIV-2; and to identify risk groups. Methods. In May, 1987, 923 (M:F = 1.55) individuals from Benin were sampled for antibody reactivity to HIV-1 and HIV-2. All samples were analyzed by commercial ELISA and immunoblotted on HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigens in Dakar, 0% 0% 0% Conclusion. Low seroprevalence of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are seen in Cotonou, Benin. Of the select groups sampled, female prostitutes appear to be at higher risk for infection with either virus. 10 of the 11 HIV-1 or HIV-2 positive prostitutes were not Beninois. We hope that prevention and control programs will be effective in limiting the spread of these viruses. 5064 THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN BRAZIL E A Castilho*; P Chequer**; L G M Rodrigues** *WHO Collaborating Centre on AIDS-Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, **Ministry of Health, Brazil Objective. To describe the Brazilian AIDS epidemic as it has progressed since 1982. Methods. Data collection was done in aroutine basis by the national surveillance programme.A quadratic regression model was used to fit yearly incidence data over time. Results. Between August 1982 and November 1987,2325 cases of AIDS(17/1000000 inhabitants)were reported to the Ministry of Health.The male to female ratio was approximately 18:1. Among cases in men,75 per cent were homosexual or bisexual, 5 per cent were intravenous drug users(IDU),and 8 per cent were related to blood transfusions/hemophilia.Among the cases in women,29 percent were reported as heterosexual contacts of persons with HIV infection or in a group at high risk,18 per cent of female cases were IDU,and 36 per cent were recipients of blood transfusions.66 cases in children under 15 yearswere diagnosed up to November,1987. 14 out of these 66 cases(21 per cent) were presumed to have been vertically infected;76 per cent occurred in children with hemophilia and/or had received blood transfusions. A mean of 1.8 AIDS associated diseases was reported per person.The most common opportunistic diseases were: infection with C.albicans(33 per cent),P.carinii pneumonia (14 per cent),Kaposi's per of potenti~T life lost\"before age 65,in single men 20 to 49 years,over 2 per cent were due to AIDS. Conclusion. Besides some particular characteristics,epidemiological data indicate that the pattern for the Brazilian epidemic is similar to those observed in USA and Western Europe. 330 [Page 331](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/329) 5065 OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND NEOPLASMS RELATED TO ALL KNOWN AIDS CASES IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF RIO DE JANEIRO - BRAZIL. DURING THE PERIOD 1982 TO 1987 RJ). OBJECTIVE: To analyse the pattern of opportunistic infections and neoplasms of AIDS patients in this 5 million inhabitants city. METHODS: We studied 406 AIDS cases confirmed according to current CDC criteria after investigation of all (1660) suspicion cases reported to this secretary, which is the official branch of communicable disease reports in the city. RESULTS: Among the 406 AIDS patients we found (77.5%) whites, (88.9%) males, mean age 35.28, (45.3%) homosexuals, (23.6%) bisexuals (the higher increasing rate among risk groups), (9.3%) blood transfused and (22.8%) other risk groups. The Most patients had more than two opportunistic infections. The more frequent neoplasm found was Kaposi's Sarcoma (22.2%) of all patients and skin was the common localization of the lesions (86.6%). CONCLUSIONS: 1. Tuberculosis was the opportunistic infection of greater epidemiological importance. 2. Bisexuals were the risk group of higher increasing rate between 1986 and 1987. The maintenance of the phenomenon may result to future higher diffusion of HIV by heterosexual (male to female) transmission. 5066 LABORATORY PROFILE OF HIV of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil Objectives and methods: 290 individuals were evaluated at the Immunodeficiency Clinic( Feb 86-Aug 87),with the following protocol:l)Serology for HIV-1( ELISA, W Blot and Karpas cell test 28.5% ) and none HIV-2 positive; of the 82, 30( 36.5% ) were AIDS cases( CDC classification ) and among these, 64% were skin test negative, 50% were lymphopenic and 80% had an ESR above 20 mm/h( -=67.95mm). Of the remaining 52 infected, 15( 18.3% ) were asymptomatic (A) and 37( 45.1% ) had symptoms related to Conclusions: These simple laboratory tests seem important in the evaluation of HIV infected individuals and should be evaluated as a follow up tool. * Supported in part by a grant from FINEP(Brazil) Notes: 5067 SEROPREVALENCE OF JP Allain*, DD Ho+*. *School of Medicine, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; +UCLA School of Medicine and ++School of Public Health and *Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA; '*Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA. Objective: To determine the seroprevalence of three human retroviruses (HIV-1, HIV-2 and HTLV-I) in high-risk Brazilians from Rio de Janeiro, San Paulo, and rural areas. Methods: Serum samples were first examined for antibodies against human retroviruses by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). (4%) HIV-2-positive sera were HIV-1 negative. Three sera had antibodies versus envelope proteins of both HIV-1 and HIV-2. These may represent cross-reactivity or co-infection. Twenty-two individuals had dual infection by HIV-1 and HTLV-I. Serological, epidemiological, and clinical correlations will be presented. Conclusion: HIV-1 is already prevalent and both HIV-2 and HTLV-I are becoming prevalent in high-risk persons in Brazil. 5068 HIV-INFECTION IN RISK GROUPS IN BUENOS AIRES. PREVALENCE AND PREDICTIVE FACTORS Pedro Cahn*, H Perez*, Medicina, Argentina Objective. To study risk populations in Buenos Aires and analyse the existence of seroDositivity predictive factors. Methods. ELISA and immunofluorescence studies were carried out on 348 homosexuals(HS), 101 intravenous drug addicts (IVDA) and 117 heterosexuals(HTS); a clinical history was drawn during the first visit specifying sexual contact in HIV-high-prevalence areas, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), signs and symptoms. Results. Seropositivity was found in 29% of HS, 60% of IVDA and 7.7% of HTS. There was no difference between seroDositive and negative patients concerning age, sex and previous STD. Sexual contact in high-prevalence areas (o 0.02) and symntoms (p 0.01) were associated with seropositivity: out of 226 individuals having sexual contact outside Argentina, 59.2% corresnonded to Brazil and 13.4%, to USA and/or Europe. Conclusion. HIV-infection nrevails among risk grouns in Buenos Aires. Incidence on IVDA calls for snecial control plans. The 7.7% of infected HTS confirms the effectiveness of sexual transmission. Symptomatic natients and/or individuals having sexual contact in high-orevalence areas showed greater tendency to seropositivity. 331 [Page 332](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/330) 5069 HIV-1, SEXUAL PRACTICES AND CONTACT WITH FOREIGNERS IN HOMOSEXUAL MEN IN COLOMBIA. N. Merino*, R. los Andes, BOgota, **Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Objective. To investigate the seroepidemiology of AIDS in homosexual men in Bogota. Methods. 294 Colombian homosexual males volunteered to answer a questionnaire on sexual practices and consented to HIV-1 testing. Envelope-and core-specific ELISAs were used to confirm seropositivity (Abbott Labs). Analysis included MantelHaenszel statistics on contingency tables. Results. The overall seropositivity rate was 21%. Subjects who reported a receptive role (either as predominantly receptive or as mixed receptive-insertive intercourse) had a seropositivity of 24%, significantly higher (p=O.02) than the 11% found in those reporting predominantly insertive intercourse (RR=2.31). For subjects reporting receptive intercourse, sexual contact with foreign visitors was a significant (p=O.02) risk factor for HIV-1 infection (RR=1.84). Factors of borderline significance were more than 10 homosexual partners in the preceding year (RR=1.53) and a history of international travel (RR=1.43). These associations did not hold for those who were predominantly insertive. We found no difference in seropositivity between those classifiable as bisexual (13/67=19%) or homosexual (18/89=20%). Conclusion. Significant behavioral risk factors include receptive intercourse and, for the subgroup reporting receptive roles, contact with foreign visitors. For this subgroup we identified international travel and promiscuity'as risk factors of borderline significance. Taken as a whole, these observations suggest that the epidemic in Colombia may have greater impact than anticipated. 5070 PREVALENCE OF ANTIBODIES TO HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) IN PROSTITUTES IN GUADALAJARA, MEXICO. B.M. Torres-Mendoza*, E. Vazquez-Valls*, M.N. Ayala-Chavira*, G. Ayala y Experimental, Univer sidad de Guadalajara, **Hospital Civil de Guadalajara. Objetive. To evaluate in prostitutes from Guadalajara the prevalence of HIV antibodies and their risk factors. Methods. 670 women (18-45 years old) were interrogated and bleed between December, 1986 and December 1987. They worked in nightclubs with three differents socioeconomical status: high(550), middle(50) enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) as a confirmatory test. Results. Three prostitutes (0.44%) were seropositive by ELISA and IFA tests to HIV antibodies, who were working in a high socioeconomical ninghtclub; two of them had had blood transfusions and they had generalized lymphadenopaty. The third one did not have history of other high risk factors for AIDS. We found that mean duration of prostitution was 29 months and the mean number of sexual partners was 40 per months. All women were engaged in vaginal intercourse, using condom in 70% of occasions; 34% has oral sexual intercourse and 9% engages in regular anal intercourse. No significant correlation was found with the kind of sexual activity, use of condoms, intravenous injections, drug adiction, and other sexually transmitted diseases. Conclusion. a) The seroprevalence to HIV in this study was low, as compared with other countries. b) An educational program on AIDS is important to avoid further incidence to this group.

So to-Sanchez*, de Guadalajara, **Hospital Civil de Guadalajara. Objetive. To evaluate the prevalence of Human Immuno - deficiency Virus (HIV) antibodies in a male homosexual representative sample in Guadalajara (GDL). Methods. By population density, GDL has the highest incidence of AIDS in Mexico. A sample of 383 homosexual men from the metropolitan area cf GDL (4.5x106 people), was examined serologically for antibodies to HIV from August, 1985 to December 1987 by an enzyme-linked-immunosorbentassay (ELISA) and by an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) as a confirmatory test. A detailled, behaviourally oriented, epidemiological questionnaire was used. Results. Antibodies to HIV were detected in 122 (32%) and 119 (31%) cases with ELISA and IFA test, respectively, of which 84 (69%) seropositive cases were ages 20-39. Nearly 68% (79 cases) of seropositives has traveled to some of the principal states with AIDS cases in USA, in contrast with 176 of the seronegatives who had not. Generalized lymphadenopathy was present in 46 of the positive cases, and 22 of all developed AIDS. No significant correlation was found between results and other sexually transmitted diseases, drug use or transfusions. n=119 SEROPOSITIVE n=261 SERONEGATIVE Active anal 0.81%) 6 ( 2.29%) Conclusion. Data suggest that HIV infection results in young adults predominantly from sexual transmission, particulary with a high risk population. 5072 FREQUENCY OF ANTI-HIV ANTIBODIES IN HIGH AND LOW RISK GROUPS FROM GUADALAJARA, JAL AND TIJUANA, B.C, MEXICO. M.E. Acevedo, J.C. Bolens, U. Bernard, M. Martinez, F. Flores. Biological Sciences Institute, Autonomous University of Guadalajara, Mexico. Objetives: In the view that the incidence of the broad clinical spectrum caused by HIV infection more epidemiological studies need to be done in Mexico. These will help to determine the frequency of HIV infection and its related risk factors. In the present study, we determined the presence of serum anti-HIV antibodies in 100 male homosexuals and a random sample of 700 people from a low risk group, both samples from Guadalajara, Jal. and 100 prostitutes from Tijuana, B.C. Mexico. Methods: A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using monoclonal antibodies was utilized to determine the presence of IgG in serum. All positive serum samples were confirmed by Western Blot analysis. Results: Homosexuals Prostitutes Low Risk Group Negatives 85 93 697 Positives 15 (15%) 7 ( 7%) 3 (0.42%) Out of seropositive homosexuals, 12 of them had at least one of the many clinical manifestations related to HIV infection, while none of the HIV prostitutes and low risk people showed any clinical signs of infection. Conclusions: The identification of HIV infected individuals in high and low risk groups helps us asses the mag nitude of this health problem in Mexico and to establish preventive measure to control and limit the spread of infection. 332 [Page 333](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/331) 5073 DIFFERENCES IN THE CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF AIDS CASES BETWEEN MEXICO AND OTHER COUNTRIES. Garcia M.L.. Gallardo E., and SepOlveda J. General Directorate of Epidemiology, Ministry of Health, Mexico City. Objective: To compare clinical manifestations of AIDS Mexican adult patients with data reported from other countries. Methods: Information for this study was taken from 796 adult patients notified up to Dec. 1987. Results: Clinical information was available from 295 patients (95% men and 72% between 25 and 44 years of age). Data on reported diseases at time of initial AIDS diagnosis are presented: P. carinii pneumonia (PCP): sarcoma (KS) 32 (11%). Cases with more than one disease are tabulated only in the disease category listed first. KS has been reported in 70 (24%) cases. The proportion of AIDS patients with KS has decreased from 27% (1981-1984) to 17% (1985-1987). The average duration of disease is 11.2 months. Five hundred six pathogens have been identified: C. of the total pathogens identified. Conclusion. Comparatively with the USA and Europe, PCP is less frequently reported. Other opportunistic infections, mainly tuberculosis and enteritis, are more common. The frequency of tuberculosis correlates with data reported in minority groups in the USA, in the Caribbean and in Africa. These differences may be explained by the prevalence of local pathogens, host immunological characteristics and possibly viral pathogenicity. 5074 CHARACTERISTICS OF AIDS IN A REFERENCE HOSPITAL IN MEXICO CITY. S. Ponce de Leon R.; G. Ruiz-Palacios, B. Schnieders, A. Cruz. Instituto Nacional de la Nutricion. Mexico, D.F. OBJECTIVE: Describe the main features of AIDS in Mexico including rates of hospitalization, opportunistic infections, and mortality. METHODS: This is a retrolective analysis of the first 93 patients admitted to our hospital with diagnosis of AIDS. RESULTS: Between January 1983 and August 1987, 93 AIDS patients were studied. 81 patients (87%) were homosexuals, 25 of whom (30.8%) had bisexual practices, 3 admmitted heterosexual promiscuity and 9 denied exposure to any risk factors. History of sexual contact with foreigners decreased progressively with the years. Anti-HIV-I antibodies were present in all patients, and 14 of 24 studied had detectable HIV antigen. The first manifestation of AIDS was an opportunistic infection in 75.3%, Kaposi's sarcoma in 20.4%, and both in 4.3%; 50% survival was of 22 weeks after the diagnosis. The rate of admissions to the hospital was 2.2 per patient-year, with a rate of 47.7 days of hospitalization. The microorganisms more frequently identified were Candida albicans in 63 patients (68.8%), cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 33 mycobacterias in 25 and Pneumocystis found patients (51.6%) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in four (4.3%). CONCLUSION: Manifestations of AIDS in our patients were similar to those reported in other countries, although history of bisexuality and infections by CMV, Cryptosporidium and M. tuberculosis were more common; and P. carinii infections were less frequently found. Survival was twice lower than that reported elsewhere. Notes: 5075 INFECTIONS IN MEXICAN AIDS PATIENTS - A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY Barbara Schnieders*, G M Ruiz-Palacios*, M H Wolff** *Instituto Nacional de la Nutricion, Mexico (INNSZ) **Institute of Microbiology and Virology, University Witten/Herdecke, FRG Objective. To evaluate the incidence of opportunistic agents and compare the results with the incidence described in industrialized countries. Methods. In a retrospective study we reviewed the first 89 AIDS cases seen at INNSZ during the period 1983-1987 through the patients history. Diagnosis in all patients was carried out by using CDC-classification. The analysis was made employing the \"Statistic Pack for Social Science\"Programme (SPSS). Results. All patients were male. There were 53 (59,6 %) homosexuals and 25 (28,1 %) bisexuals, no hemofiliacs, no drug abusers; 49 (53,9 %) patients died, 42 (47,2 %) had opportunistic infections alone, 43 (48,3 %) had opportunistic infections along with neoplasms, 4 (4,4 %) showed only neoplasms. Table of infectious agents. Number of cases per cent Cryptococcus neoformans 8 Isospora 7.05 % Mycobacterium tuberculosis 12 14.11 % Mycobacterium atypicum 12 14.11 % Salmonella 6 7.05 % Conclusion. The results indicate a substantial difference to incidence described in industrialized countries. It is thought that hygienic and/or geographic circumstances lead to higher incidence of these opportunistic agents. 5076 AIDS IN PERU 6. Aguero, t Luila National Multisectorial Program for the Prevention of AIDS. Peruvian Ministry of Health. The first AIDS case in Peru was recognized in 1983. By January 1, 1988 the number of cases exceeded 100 and an ongoing serologic survey had detected 192 seropositives (33,623 samples analyzed. Although these figures are low in comparison with high incidence countries, it is feared that contributing socio-economic problems could spread the epidemic through a population already burdened with other endemic diseases. In April of 1987 the Peruvian government Kresponded to the AIDS problem by setting up the National Multisectorial Program for the Prevention of AIDS. The program's phibfi1li are: a) To educate the Peruvian people on the methods of prevention currently available; b) To establish and maintain an epidemiological surveillance system; and c) To conduct surveys to determine the extent of HIV infection. The program has representatives from the Ministries of Education, Justice, Internal Affairs and Presidency, and from civil organizations. The paper describes the extent of the epidemic in Peru, its epidemiology, projections for the near future, the activities developed by the AIDS procrarm including cooperation with international agencies, strategies for the future, and other issues relevant to the Peruvian situation. 333 [Page 334](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/332) 5077 AIDS Phillips**, *Peruvian National AIDS Commission, **Naval Medical Research Institute Detachment, Peru Objective. Estimate the annual incidence of AIDS in Peru and the associated risk groups and behavior. Methods. HIV antibody determinations and confirmations were made by commercial ELISA and Western BLot kits. Consenting symptomatic patients or their referring physicians anonymously completed a questionnaire required by the Peruvian AIDS registry. Results. 88 cases have referred to the AIDS technical commission for certification as cases since 1983. 44 were reported in 1987. 215 patients with signs or symptoms of possible immunodeficiency were tested in a reference lab for HIV antibody in 1987 and HIV positives registered with the commission. Mean age was 36 years; 77.7% were mestizo; 56.45% were unmarried. 1/39 women (2.5%) were HIV seropositive. The woman was married to a unconfirmed suspect positive. 36/41 (87.8%) men admitted homosexual behavior, 2 (4.8%) received transfusions in the last four years and 1 (2.4%) had no risk other than a prior history of STD. In confirmed positives, principal complaints were weight loss, fever, night, sweats, adenopathy and diarrhea in descending order of frequency.No single complaint was significantly associated with infection. Travel with sex (homosexual or with prostitutes) in endemic areas outside Peru was associated with seropositivity in 10/25 (40%) (p<0.0001). Of positives, 2/42 (2.3%) were CDC Group III and 40/42 (95.2%) CDC Groups IV at the time of initial evaluation. Conclusion. Major risks for development of AIDS are homosexual behavior and travel with sex in endemic areas outside Peru. Risk of disease in women and children was low. m Am I 5U7X8 HIV INFECTIONS IN PERU G Aguero**, F Stephen Wignall*, W Alexander*, I Sanchez*, G Chauca*, M Ghisilieri* *US Naval Medical Research Institute Detachment, Lima, Peru, **Finistry of Health, Lima, Peru Objective. Determine the HIV seroprevalence in Peruvian populations at risk and identify factors associated with HIV seropositivity. Methods. Consenting participants anonymously answered a questionnaire during routine health screening, blood donation, or at the time they presented for HIV antibody testing. Antibody was detected and confirmed using commercial ELISA and Western Blot kits. Results. 35,526 individuals were tested and 175 (0.5%) are HIV seropositive. Mean age was 30, 83% were male; 83% were mestizo; 53% were unmarried.

Notes: 5079 SEROEPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY OF HIV ANTIBODY PREVALENCE IN THE SANTA CRUZ REGION (BOLIVIA) F Paradisi,A *Unidad Sanitaria, Santa Cruz, Bolivia **Dep. of Microbiology, Careggi Hospital, Florence, Italy OBJECTIVE. A seroprevalence survey for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was carried out in the Santa Cruz region in south-eastern Bolivia. Methods. During the months October-November 1986 we collected samples of blood of 446 individuals from three different localities, Camiri, Boyuibe and Javillo,in the south of the Santa Cruz region. In November 1987 we collected blood samples from 333 licensed female prostitutes and 12 homosexual men in Santa Cruz, a city of about 700,000 inhabitants. The sera were stored at -200C in Bolivia, transported to Italy in dry ice and then tested for HIV antibody by ELISA (Wellcome Diagnostics, England). Results. All samples were negative for HIV antibody. Conclusion. Our data show that in this area of Bolivia the populations studied, including female prostitutes and homosexual men, are free from HIV infection. 5080 AIDS IN COLOMBIA Jorge Boshell S*, MG Gacharna**, *******Instituto de Seguros Sociales-Villavicencio. Objective. To describe the prevalence of HIV infection and AIDS among selected population groups in Colombia. Methods. Since 1984, AIDS has been a reportable disease in Colombia. As of December 1987, 161 cases of AIDS have been reported to the Ministery of Health. Serologic studies, using ELISA for screening and IFA and Western Blot for confirmationwere done on selected population groups in Bogota, Villavicencio and several Amerindian reservations. Results. AIDS cases have occurred in 15 mejor cities througout the country. The number of cases has doubled or tripled each year since reporting began. Most cases (97%) have occurred in homosexual or bisexual men. Eighty-four percent of cases occurred among persons 20 -39 years of age. HIV antibody prevalence among gay men in Bogota and Villavicencio was 14 and 4 percent, respectively. In contrast, the HIV antibody rate among 38,077 volonteer blood donors in 7 different cities was 0.009%. One out of 762 amerindian was positive. Conclusion. HIV infection is widely distributed in Colombia although the prevalence is still relatively low. To date the sex ratio is similar to the pattern observed in North America and Europe. 334 [Page 335](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/333) 5081 AIDS IN GUATEMALA Julio Argueta, J. M. Luna, O. Velasquez, O. Zeissig, J. Cabrera, C. L. Gonzalez-Camargo, E. Villatoro. Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Guatemala. Objective: To describe the prevalence of AIDS in Guatemala from 1984 to december 1987, since the first reports in this Country. Methods: All cases reported to the Public Health Service, were confirmed by the clinical and serologic studies by the ELISA technique and confirmed with western blot, following the CDC criteria. Results: Until december 1987, were 56 persons with HIV Po sitive test; 30 (53.6%) had AIDS, 19 asymptomatic carrier (33.9%) and 7 (12.5%) ARC/LAC. Of the cases with AIDS, 29 were men (90%) and 3 (10%) female. 21 (70%) were living in the USA and returned to Guatemala and 3 (10%) foreing people. 28 of the cases were between 20-49 years of age. 83.3 % of the cases had transmission with homosexual and/ or bisexual contacts, and only in 2 had heterosexual relations, 2 with drug addicts and 1 had a history of blo od transfusion in USA. The more frecuent complication illness were Sarcoma Kaposi: 7 (23.3%), Pneumonia by P. Ca rinii: 6 (20%), other diseases were Tuberculosis, Candidia sis, etc. The mortality rate was 83.3 %. CONCLUSIO N: The majority of cases of AIDS in Guatemala were person s residing in USA or other countries and when ill came back to Guatemala. The local transmission has been very low and the rate of carriers also low. 5082 HIV EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PATTERNS IN MEXICO. Valdespino J.L., Sepulveda J., Izazola J.A., Garcia M.L., Loo E., and Rico B. General Directorate of Epidemiology. Ministry of Health, Mexico City. Obiective. To describe the HIV epidemiological patterns in Mexico. Method. Analysis of AIDS cases, seroprevalence surveys and predictions have been been carried out. Results. Mexico has a population of 80 million. The first AIDS cases were diagnosed in 1983. Since then, 1091 cases have been notified, showing an exponential growth. Doubling time at present has been calculated to be 7 to 8 months. At the beginning of the epidemic, AIDS cases were observed among homosexual males living in urban areas, and with a high socio-economic level. Now the disease is spreading to heterosexuals, to rural areas, and to all socioeconomic strata.In Mexico, pediatric cases account for 4% of all cases, homosexual males 59%, bisexual males 24%, heterosexual contacts 5.4 %; blood transfusion or hemophiliacs 10 %; IV drug users 0.4%, and the rest to other factors.Seroepidemiologic surveys have shown the following HIV-antibody prevalences: male homosexuals 0 to 31 %, male prostitutes 6 to 16%, female prostitutes 0 to 1%, hemophiliacs 20 to 66%, paid donors 7 to 30 %, voluntary donors < 0.1%, and jail inmates 0 to 0.5 %. The expected AIDS cases for 1991 are 20,000 to 35,000 calculated with different epidemiological models. We do not have incidence data about HIV infection. Conclusions. Based on seroprevalence data, a continued increase in infection rates in homo and bisexual males and male prostitutes is expected. Heterosexual transmission will probably increase more rapidly than homosexual transmission. Therefore in Mexico as in other Latinamerican countries, HIV heterosexual transmission may become more important than in the United Sates and Europe. Notes: 5083 PREVALENCE OF anti-HIV ANTIBODIES IN HIGH RISK GROUPS IN MEXICO Izazola JA, Valdespino JL. SepOlveda J. General Directorate of Epidemiology. Ministry of Health, MEXICO Objective. To determine the prevalence of HIV infection in different groups: homo and bisexual males, male and female prostitutes, and hemophiliacs. Methods. ELISA for screening and Western Blot for confirmatory tests have been used in several cross sectional seroepidemiological surveys in Mexico since 1985. The data were collected in the 3 largest cities of Mexico (Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey), in 2 resort cities (Acapulco and Merida), and Tijuana which is on the border with California, U.S.A. Results. The prevalences in the different groups are summarized in the next table: GROUP YEAR RANGE PREVALENCE (%) HOMO-BISEXUAL MALES 1985-1986 0.0 - 25.0 HOMO-BISEXUAL MALES 1987 1.2 - 31.0 MALE PROSTITUTES 1986-1987 2.2 - 16.0 FEMALE PROSTITUTES 1986 0.0 FEMALE PROSTITUTES 1987 0.0 - 1.2 HEMOPHILIACS 1987 28.0 - 67.0 There are aditional studies in jail inmates in Mexico City and in armed forces male personnel throughout Mexico both with a seroprevalence of 0.5%. Conclusions. This study confirms the low prevalence in female prostitutes and points out the increasing transmission in male prostitutes and homosexual/bisexual men. 5084 SEROPOSITIVITY OF HIV INFECTION AMONL INDIVIDUALS 50 r ATTENDING THE IMMUNOLOGY CLINIC AT HOSPITAL UNIVERSITARIO GAFFREE E GUINLE - UNIVERSIDADE DO RIO DE JANEIRO IMUNOLOGIA (FIOCRUZ) OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of HIV infection among individuals at risk for AIDS. METHODS: We tested 789 individuals for HIV antibody by ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence and Western Blot methods from April'85 to Dec'87.These individuals belong to the following groups: homosexual/bisexual men,. intravenous drug abuser (IVDA), blood transfused patients, sexual partners of infected individuals with or without symptoms, familial and health care workers (with or without accidental exposure to HIV contaminated material. Some individuals could not be included in none of the above groups. We selected these patients in three groups according to the current CDC criteria. RESULTS: From the total of patients tested 370 were seropositive for HIV infection and the distribution is shown in the next table. GROUPS AGE SEX (%) RACE (%) RISK GROUPS (%) (CDC) X MALE FEMALE WHITE BLACK H/B IVDA B.T. B.P. I. G. II n= 73.9 2.3 G.III 92.8 7.2 81.7 G.

CONCLUSIONS: 1. There was no seropositivity among familial contacts and health care workers. 2. The predominance of seropositivity was in the homosexual/bisexual men group in all stages of infection. 3. The positivity was higher among white patients. 335 [Page 336](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/334) 5085 ANTI-HIV ANTIBODIES IN OUTPATIENTS FROM A SEXUALLY TRANSMITED DISEASE CLINIC IN BUENOS AIRES CITY. M Boxaca*, L R Carrillo*, M Ambrona***, Mercedes Weissenbacher* *Department of Microbiology School of Medicine, ** STD Section University Hospital, ***Natl. Program for AIDS Control, Argentina. Objective. To know the HIV prevalence in a selected male population in consultation for a sexually transmited disease (STD). Methods. Among outpatients consulting between April-October 1987 for an STD, but unbias about HIV infection, 285 males (median age 27) with some HIV risk factors were selected. 80% of them declare they had 2 or more previous STD infections. Anti-HIV antibodies were screened by EIA and particle agglutination and confirmed by Western blot. Results. Anti-HIV antibodies distribution according to sexual habit and other risk factors is detailed in table. Risk factors Homo- prevalence was 19.7%. Though similar percentages were found in homo bi or heterosexuals, higher prevalence was associated to promiscuity in homobisexuales (24%) and with IV drug addiction (IVDA) in heterosexuals (73%). Conclusions. Findings point to a considerable proportion of HIV infection among STD patients, unware of the posibility of being infected. 5086 HIV-1 ANTIBODIES IN BRAZILIAN INTRAVENOUS DRUG-ADDICTS Nelson F. Mendes*, I Dines*, Z F Peixinho*, H J Hernan dez*, I M Longo*, N C C Beck*, A El-Khoury** *Escola Paulista de Medicina, Sao Paulo, Brazil, **Hemosoro, Sao Paulo, Brazil Objective. To investigate the presence of HIV-1 anti bodies in Brazilian intravenous drug-addicts (IVDA), without other risk factors. Methods. Serum samples were obtained from 188 IVDA(170 males and 18 females) from the States of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, between November 1986 and November 1987. Their ages ranged from 13 to 46 years old (mean= 25.7). They were attending clinics for drug-use treat ment. The sera were analysed by HIV-1 ELISA test (Elec tro-Nucleonics), H9 control plates (Electro-Nucleonics) and indirect ELISA using the synthetic peptide RILAVER YLKDQQLLGIWGCS corresponding to a segment of gp41 en velope protein of HIV-1 (J.J.G. Wang et al., PNAS 83: 6159, 1986). Results. Thirty sera (15.9%) were confirmed to be posi tive. They were from 26 males and 4 females, with ages ranging from 15 to 42 years old (mean = 24.2). Clini cal evaluation of the 30 seropositive IVDA at the time of blood collection revealed that 1 had AIDS, 8 presen ted features of ARC and 21 were clinically well. Conclusion. Intravenous drug-addiction constitutes an important risk factor of HIV-1 transmission in Brazil, being responsible for approximately 6% of the AIDS ca ses officially reported. Notes: 5087 THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF AIDS IN THE AMERICAS Ronald K. St. John, Maureen Clifford, Fernando Zacarias Pan American Health Organization, WHO Regional Office for the Americas, Washington, D.C. Objective. To describe the epidemiology of AIDS in the Western Hemisphere. Methods. Since 1983, the Pan American Health Organization has carried out surveillance for AIDS. Quarterly data are analyzed to assess trends and define the epidemiological profile of the disease in the Americas. Results. As of 30 November 1987 a total of 52,908 cases and 29,192 deaths have been reported in the Americas. Four countries, the United States, Brazil, Canada and Haiti, account for 95% of all reported cases Excluding the United States and Canada, the remaining countries have reported 5,324 cases. Only two countries, the British Virgin Islands and Montserrat, have yet to report a single case of AIDS or HIV infection. We calculated cases per millon population by subregion and by country for the year 1986. These data demonstrate that the entire Caribbean area has exceptionally high rates of AIDS. In addition, male/female case ratios reveal two patterns of disease: 1) the homosexual/bisexual pattern with a very high male to female case ratio, observed in North America and most South American countries; and 2) a second pattern suggesting increasing heterosexual transmission in a number of Caribbean and Central American countries. These and other data indicate clear subregional differences as well as rapidly changing patterns in the epidemiology of AIDS and HIV infection in the Americas, which should be addressed accordingly. 5088 FIRST STUDY ON THE PREVALENCE OF HIV IN THE FORCES OF DEFENSE OF PANAMA Manuel Pereira V.,MD*, Anayansi H. de Pereira MD*, Carlos A. Garcia A.,MD**, Antonio Saiz, MD** * Office of Coordination and Surveillance of Health, Military Health Battalion, Forces of Defense of Panama ** Experimental Laboratory, Military Health Battalion, Forces of Defense of Panama Objective: Determine sero-prevalence of HIV among the personnel of the Forces of Defense of Panama. Methods: Civilian and military personnel working in the Forces of Defense of Panama were tested for HIV antibodies. After a repeated positive ELISA, a Western Blot was performed. Every sero-positive person was clinically examined; an epidemiological chain was established and the immunological status was assesed. Results: 17,001 persons were tested up to August 31, 1987 with a sero-positive prevalence of 0.47 per thousand. False-positive ELISA tests were high. Sexual contact was the only mode of transmission. Inversion of the OKT4/OKT8 ratio was found in 62.5% of carriers. All were assymptomatic. Conclusion: The presence of HIV was established, thus encouraging an intensive prevention campaign started early in 1987 in the Forces of Defense of Panama. 336 [Page 337](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/335) 5089 AIDS AND PRE-PUBERTAL SEX EDUCATION E. Maxine Ankrah * Department of Social Work and Social Administration, ** Faculty of Social Sciences, *** Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda Objective. To discover views and sexual behaviors of pre-pubertal and adolescent pupils for formulation of primary school curricula that incorporate sex/AIDS education. Methods. Multiple-choice type questionnaires were administrated to 80 randomly selected pupils in classes 6 and 7 in 4 representative primary schools, to 40 teacher trainees and a content analysis was undertaken of interviews with 24 parents and teachers on the sex behavior of the young with implications for AIDS control. Results. Less than 20% of the sample of children (11 to 15 years age range) engage in some form of heterosexual acts. But 53% of these have already commenced sexual intercourse. Seventy-six percent knew about AIDS and 57% linked its transmission to sex. Children as well as adults see prevention of its spread related to particular sexual behaviors. Table of Preventive Approaches Pupils Trainers Teachers Parents One Partner 40% 55% 25% 50% Reduced Numbers - 3 17 25 No Casual Sex - - 25 17 Use of Condom 20 33 - - Abstinence 40 7 - - No Way of Prevention - - 16 - Others - 2 17 8 N = (80) (40) (12) (12) Conclusion. AIDS education receives a higher degree of approval among adults than does sex education alone, while primary children show readiness to be educated for both. 5090 KNOULEDGE, ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS OF AIDS AMONG YOUNG ADULTS IN SALVADOR, BRAZIL Dr. Barbara Janowitz*, Dr. Leo Morris**, Dr. Virgilio Bastas*** *AIDSTECH,FHI, **CDC, Division of Reproductive Health, ***Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil In 1987, a reproductive health survey of young men and women aged 15-24 was carried out in Salvador, the capital of the State of Bahia, Brazil. The survey was householdbased and is a probability sample yielding approximately 1000 interviews each for men and women. Because of concern with AIDS in Brazil, an AIDS module was added to the survey questionnaire. The basic questionnaire contains information on sexual activity, including numbers of partners and contraceptive use. The AIDS module includes questions on knowledge of ways the infection can be transmitted, perception of risk for various groups, assessment of individual risk, and actions to reduce risk among the sexually active. Preliminary tabulations indicate that while most young men and women can correctly identify sexual intercourse and blood transfusions as ways of transmitting infection, many are also very likely to identify incorrect sources such as mosquito bites (5% for men) and using utensiles of infected persons (57% for females). Almost all men and women identify prostitutes and homosexuals at high risk. Both men and women identify married men at higher risk than married women and women identify these groups at higher risk than do men. Also, men are more likely to perceive themselves at risk than are women. Data analysis will focus on relationships between sexual activity, marital status, contraceptive use, and knowledge and risk perception. Notes: 5091 ATTITUDES TOWARD AIDS, HIV INFECTION AND CONDOM USE IN HEALTHY TEXTILE WORKERS AND THEIR WIVES IN KINSHASA, ZAIRE Kathleen Irwin*, J Bertrand**, N Ndilu***, K R Ryder*** Centers for Disease Projet Naissances Desirables**, Projet SIDA***, Ministry of Health****, Kinshasa, Zaire Objective. To facilitate conduct of an epidemiologic study, we determined attitudes towards AIDS, HIV infection, and condom use in healthy men and women with unknown HIV serostatus in a Kinshasa textile factory. Methods. In November-December 1987, we convened six focus group discussions for factory foremen and six for their wives. Sessions addressed knowledge and attitudes about HIV infection and condoms and predicted family dynamics if a couple were aware of their discordant HIV serostatus. Results. Preliminary analyses indicated that most participants knew that AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease that can be transmitted in the absence of symptoms. The majority believed that abstinence would be the only reliable way to prevent transmission in discordant couples. Many believed consistent condom use would be ineffective, partly because of misperceptions about modes of transmission. Most participants predicted that couples in which only the wife was seropositive were more likely to experience marital discord than couples in which the husband was seropositive. Conclusion. Although these attitudes cannot be generalized to all sexually active persons, focus group methodology can be used to develop and test other counseling and education programs in Zaire. 5092 IMPERTINENT INTERVIEWERS AND LYING RESPONDENTS: A CRITIQUE OF THE SURVEY RESEARCH METHOD FOR HETEROSEXUAL HIV TRANSMISSION RESEARCH IN AFRICA. EPY Muhondwa Muhimbili Medical Centre, Dar es Salaam. The survey method is shown to be inappropriate for the research which is required to elucidate the dynamics of heterosexual HIV transmission in Africa in order to provide sound basis for the education intervention and to counter the strong motivation of the people in this part of the world to reject the heterosexual transmission hypothesis as another slander of Africa. The survey interview is shown to be unlikely to engender honest honest self-reporting of.sexual practices given the sensitive nature of the research questions which goes beyond what fertility, teenage pregnancy, and STD studies reported from Africa have\\covered. This is inspite of the alleged promiscuity an openness of the Africans about their sexual lifestyle. The selection of respondents and the interviewer - respondent interaction are shown to constitute highly contrived social situations which evoke deep-seated suspicion, leading to withholding of information. This is in addition to the other aspects of the interview situation known to inhibit honest self-reporting. The notion that anthropological methods are a panacea is shown to be untenable, as is the view that any one social science discipline is more qualified for this. A case is made for a multi-methods and multi-phases approach which deals with convenience samples and key informants, and for collaborative research which involves scientists of different disciplines as well as other Change Agents in these societies.

Objective:To determine the prevalence of anti-HIV antibodies in a sample representative of the total population of the country, provide information about its association with other infectious diseases, and correlate it with demographic, socioeconomic and cultural variables. Methods: A nationwide probabilistic sample, representative of all households in Mexico was drawn for the survey. In total, 63,000 households were selected from a current master sampling frame that includes urban and rural population stratified by socio-economic level. Previous informed consent, a blood sample was collected from all the inhabitants of each household to be processed for antiHIV antibodies, hepatitis B virus, herpes virus and cytomegalovirus. Demographic, socio-economic and cultural variables were also collected. The information was otained through standardized interviewers and blood sample collection by a team of physicians and nurses strictly following the rules of confidentiality and willingness to participate. Results: A total of 78,536 blood samples have been obtained and preserved in a specially designed sera bank. Sera are being analysed by commercial ELISA screening kitts and confirmed by Western Blot. Data analysis is currently under way and the results will be presented at the Conference. Conclusions:The Mexican National Household Serologic Survey is the first population-based study to allow calculation of the prevalence of HIV antibodies in the total population of a contry. Until now, studies on the prevalence of HIV and related variables have been targeted mainly to high risk groups. 5094 AIDS-RELATED KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES AND PRACTICES IN KINSHASA, ZAIRE, 1987-88.

This study was conducted among a probablistic sample of 4000 men and women from all 24 adminstrative zones of Kinshasa, Zaire. It measured the level of knowledge concerning the transmission of AIDS, attitudes toward testing/informing those who are seropositive, extra-marital sexual activity, use of condoms and related topics. Results. The findings reflect the level of awareness and concern among all levels of the population regarding AIDS, and the extent to which the population is currently taking preventive action. It also defines barriers to more widespread use of condoms in this population. Conclusion. The findings are being used by the National AIDS Coordinating Committee in developing information, education and communication (IEC) activities in Kinshasa. It also provides a baseline for future studies of effectiveness of AIDS prevention programs in Kinshasa. Notes: 5095 KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES ON consultants. Objective. To study knowledge and attitudes on AIDS, other STDs, and sexual education, as a basis for AIDS education programmes. Methods. Random samples of students (n=615, age 13-18) and teacher staff (n=173) of 5th-6th class level at Maputo Secondary Schools, Health Centre Staff (n=22) Health Centre patients and their relatives (n=86) and participants in a National Medical Congress (n=108) were asked to answer questionnaires specially designed for each group. Results. Basic knowledge on AIDS was only partly existent,the AIDS campaign not yet initiated. Secondary school students showed low degree of knowledge on AIDS, STD and basic sex education. Students and teachers requested teaching in these fields. Health centre patients and relatives preferred health staff as AIDS informers. Fear of AIDS was common but few could define correct preventive measures. Condom use was not well accepted. Superior medical staff was reasonably well informed, 83% of congress attenders correctly indicating main route of HIV infection in Africa. Conclusion. Basic AIDS education is needed,and in schools should include sexual education. Superior health workers know basics but need updating. 5096 KNOWLEDGE REGARDING AIDS IN ZAIRE: A STUDY OF Clinics of Kinshasa OQblgtive. To describe current knowledge regarding AIDS in a selected Zairian population. Methods. 150 consecutive HIV-infected cases seen at the University Clinics of Kinshasa were interviewed during February-April 1987. Results. Only 1 of 150 persons appeared aware of their AIDS diagnosis, though 148 (99%) had heard of AIDS. Knowledge had been acquired via word of mouth (78%), radio (55%), television (41%), journals (37%) and friends (12%), with specific age, sex and educational groups associated with each of these. communication. Ninety percent cited sexual relations as a route of HIV transmission, and 30-31% cited contaminated needles or transfusions; 8 incorrect routes were also cited, most notably mosquito bites. Most patients (87%) wanted to be informed of a diagnosis of AIDS, and 86% wanted their family to be informed. All cases reported having greatly reduced their sexual activity since the onset of illness. Conclusions. At least in early 1987, Zairian patients were not aware of their HIV-seropositive (or AIDS) status. Most knew the principal route of transmission, though incorrect concepts remain to be corrected. This study provides a useful basis to begin planning AIDS health education efforts in Kinshasa. 338 [Page 339](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/337) 5097 KNOWLEDGE OF AND ATTITUDE TOWARDS (VOUNG BRAZZAVILLIANS) - CONGO B. CARME, M.C. - Comit6 National de Lutte contre le SIDA du Congo. Objective. To determine the knowledge and reaction of young brazzavillians to AIDS. Methods. Survey carried out in November 1987 among 330 highschool students aged between 14 and 24 years. Anonymous questionnaire distributed in class, completed and returned to medical researchers immediately. Results. 1- The term SIDA (AIDS) was familiar to 98% of the students. 2- 68% were frightened by the disease, only 8% said there were not afraid. 3- Transmission: 79% replied, 96% of them mentioned sexual relations, 22% blood, 2% maternal/child transmission and 12% mentioned other modes of transmission. 4- 79% said there had rpceived specific information, especially from medical personel and the press. Sex and age were not distinguishing factors in the replies to question 1 to 4. 5- Protection: 88\"1replied, 19% of them thought there was no possible protection, 50% mentioned limiting the number of sexual partners, 25% the use of condoms, 8% drugs and vaccines. Boys were slightly more informed than girls, as were older students. 6- Sexual relation: 93% replied, 25% had their first experience of sex before 14 years of age and 61% before 16; boys started earlier than girls. Questions 3 and 5 were open questions. Conclusion. Young brazzavillians are frightened of AIDS, the mains concepts of which are relatively familiar to them. Information which should concentrate on protection, should begin as early as 13 years of age and should preferably be conducted in school. 5098 KNOWLEDGE-SEXUAL BEHAVIOR INCONSISTENCIES AMONG SCHOOL Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, **Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland. Scant information is available from Africa on adolescent sexuality. Although available literature suggests widespread ignorance about basic reproductive knowledge, transmission and prevention of venereal diseases, little empirical evidence is known about the relationship between knowledge and sexual behavior. This paper will present empirical findings on the relationship between reproductive knowledge and knowledge of venereal diseases and students' coital experiences. The data was collected in 1986 using selfadministered confidential questionnaires, involving 657 teenage students from various schools in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. Half the students were sexually active and very few of them ever used condoms or other contraceptive devices. Several misconceptions about venereal diseases were found, and many students did not know condoms are also good protective devices against venereal diseases. Such ignorance poses a serious potential problem should the HIV virus be introduced in the study population. Although knowledge was weakly related to students sexual behavior, a substantial number of students expressed an interest in receiving sex education in schools. Notes: 5099 VIROLOGICAL AND ELECTRON MICROSCOPIC EVIDENCE FOR POSTNATAL HIV TRANSMISSION VIA BREAST MILK Marion Bucens*, J Armstrong**, M Stuckey***, *State Health Laboratories, **Royal Perth Hospital and ***Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth, Western Australia Objective. To describe an instance of postnatal HIV transmission via breast milk. Methods and results. A 22 yr old woman, with a past history of intravenous drug abuse, presented with a four month history of lymphadenopathy and weight loss. She was still breastfeeding her 11 mth old infant. Anti-HIV serology, which had been negative 8 weeks earlier, was now positive by EIA, IFA and Western Blot. The infant was also seropositive. HIV was isolated from a cervical lymph node of the child. Breast milk was not submitted for HIV culture. Electron microscopy of lymph nodes from the mother and child showed grossly expanded follicular dendritic cells with profuse virus particles sequestered in the germinal centres. The breast milk was hypercellular with markedly increased numbers of lymphocytes and histiocytes. Electron microscopy revealed cell-free virus and histiocytes containing virus. Conclusion. The timing of the mother's acute illness and seroconversion confirm that the child was infected postnatally,al most certainly via breast milk. The question arises of whether HIV seroconversion may be delayed during pregnancy. 5100 BREAST FEEDING AND TRANSMISSION OF HIV FROM MOTHER TO INFANT. J. B. Ziegler, G. J. Stewart, R. Penny, M. Stuckey and S. Good. Prince of Wales Children's, Westmead, and St. Vincent's Hosps., Sydney and Princess Margaret Hosp. for Children and W.A. Alcohol & Drug Authority, Perth, Australia. AIMS AND METHODS: To estimate the risk of breast feeding (BF) for infants of HIV seroconverting mothers and relative importance of post partum (PP) transmission following an antibody-positive (AB+ve) pregnancy and confirm the association of BF and HIV transmission by documenting relevant observations in Australia to date. (In reported cases of probable breast milk transmission of HIV (Ziegler et al., Lancet i:896-8, 1985; Lepage et al. Lancet ii:400, 1987) the mother was believed to have been infected PP but acute phase testing was not done.) RESULTS: Data are available on 4 w men who were infected via blood transfusion immediately PP, had no other risk factors and reported BF for up to 3 months: 2 of the 4 babies including 1 reported previously (Ziegler et al.) were found to be infected. A seroconverting illness was documented in a further BF mother when her infant was 9 m old. At 11 m the infant was found to be infected. (PP BF infection rate=60%). 8 women who were AB+ve during pregnancy reported BF their infants. 3 of these infants are infected (rate=27%, comparable to that reported in absence of BF). CONCLUSION: BF during seroconversion may carry more risk than AB+ve pregnancy. BF after AB+ve pregnancy may not involve additional risk. The importance of cofactors, the prognostic value of antigen or virus testing of maternal blood or colostrum remain unknown but the association of maternal seroconversion, BF and transmission to infant appears to be established. 339 [Page 340](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/338) 5101 Breastfeeding and HIV Transmission in PAPE*, R. VERDIER**, S. JEAN**, College, N.Y., N.Y.*, GHESKIO, Port-au-Prince, Haiti**. Objective. To determine the risk of transmitting HIV infection by breastfeeding. Method. HIV seropositivity was studied in breastfed children less than one year of age, born either to the seropositive spouses of AIDS patients or to AIDS mothers. Results. At the time of initial evaluation, 38/89 (43%) children less than one year of age were HIV seronegative, while their mothers were seropositive. 35/38 (92%) HIV seronegative children were breastfed for a mean of 7 months and remained seronegative. 47/51 (90%) HIV seropositive children were breastfed for a mean of 5 months, during which time 16/47 (34%) became seronegative. In addition, 4/8 infants who were born seropositive to mothers with HIV seropositivity documented during pregnancy, and who breastfed for periods up to 1 year, became seronegative. Altogether we have observed 55 infants less than 1 year of age who either became HIV seronegative (n=20) or remained seronegative (n=35) while being breastfed by HIV seropositive mothers. Conclusion. We have been unable to document the transmission of HIV infection via breast feeding and conclude that the risk is low. These findings have important implications for health care policy in the developing world. 5102 BREAST-FEEDING AND HIV1 TRANSMISSION P. WEINBRECK*,V.LOUSTAUD*,F.DENIS**,F.LIOZON* FRANCE **Bacteriology and Virology division: CHU Limoges FRANCE Milk borne transmission of HTLV1 is well documented (ref). All reports have been consistent with HIV1 transmission in utero or during the birth process (ref). HIV1 was isolated form human breast milk (ref), but only few cases of HIV1 transmission by human breast milk are reported. Objective: To describe a case of breast-feeding HIV1 transmission. Case report:A previously healthy white woman whith no HIV risk factors, delivered her second child vaginally. Because of blood loss, she received 2 blood units after delivery (before the policy of screening blood donors in France) Breast-feeding was established on the first day and continued for 4 weeks with no nipple difficulties. 27 months later, the mother was admitted for AIDS whith pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis; her CD4 were < the child is clinicaly normal and immunologicaly well (cf tables). R6sults:27 months after delivery, the mother and the child were HIV1 sero-positive (Elisa and Western Blot positive for all bands) (cf tables), the father and the older sibling were negative, one of the 2 blood donors was tested retrospectively and was a male homosexual HIV1 sero-positive. Main point, a mother's frozen blood sample taken during the 4th month: of pregnancy was retrospectively tested and was negative for HIV1. Conclusion:This case seems to be highly convincing of the possibility of HIV1 transmission by breast milk during HIV1 primary infection of the mother. Notes: 5103 BREAST-FEEDING AND TRANSMISSION OF HIV Robert L. Colebunders, B Kapita, W Nekwei, Y Bahwe, F Baende, R Ryder Projet SIDA Department of Public Health, Mama Yemo Hospital, Kinshasa, Zaire Objective. To study HIV transmission by breast-feeding. Methods. In Kinshasa, the following groups of children were enrolled in a clinical and serological prospective study: Group 1: 3 breast-fed children born to HIV(-) mothers who received an HIV(+) post partum transfusion; Group 2: a 1 year old child, breast-fed since birth by an HIV(+) wet nurse with ARC [The child was born healthy to a mother of unknown HIV status who died during caesarian section but who never had HIV related symptoms; the child's father was HIV(-)]; Group 3: a cohort of 450 children born to HIV(+) mothers, including breast and bottle-fed children. Results. Group 1: after 9 months of breast-feeding, 2 of the children remained HIV(-). One child was HIV(-) 2 months after the mother was transfused but was HIV(+) 4 months after transfusion. During the 4 months prior to seroconversion the child did not have any injections, scarifications, or transfusions. Group 2: at 1 year of age, the child breast-fed by the HIV(+) wet nurse was HIV(+), had recently developed recurrent episodes of fever and diarrhea, and presented with failure to thrive, oral candidiasis, and polyadenopathy. He never received a transfusion or scarification Group 3: the clinical and serological outcome of breast and bottle fed children born to HIV(+) mothers will be presented. Conclusion. This report suggests that breast-feeding may be a mode of transmitting HIV infection. Cohort data will clarify the clinical and public health policy impact of this possible route of HIV infection. 5104 DO THE BENEFITS OF BREASTFEEDING OUTWEIGH THE RISK OF POSTNATAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV VIA BREASTMILK? M Bonhomme, K Kennedy, J Fortney, M Potts, P Lamptey, T Petrick, W Carswell, D Sokal. Family Health International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709 Objective. The consequences of HIV positive mothers not breastfeeding their HIV negative infants are examined. The benefits of breastfeeding are compared with the risks of infection. Methods. The number of infant deaths during the first two years of life which could be expected to occur if infants are not breastfed is compared to the number of deaths during the same period which can be attributed to HIV infection. Model inputs include the prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women and in the general population, total and cause-specific annual infant mortality rates, and prevalence of breastfeeding. The relative contribution of breastfeeding to infant mortality is varied to simulate the different levels of economic development and health technologies in developed and developing countries. Results. Analyses are ongoing. Conclusions. The policy recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization are considered in light of these results. Epidemiologic and laboratory studies are needed to determine the risk of HIV transmission via breast milk and the potential benefits of breast milk in infants who are at risk of infection or who are infected. 340 [Page 341](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/339) 5105 ANTI-TETANUS ANTIBODY (ATA) IN UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD FROM HIV-1 SEROPOSITIVE HAITIAN WOMEN NealA Halseyl, R Health, Port-au-Prince, Haiti; 3Tulane University, New Orleans, LA; NIH, Bethesda, MD Objective: To determine if infants born to HIV-1 positive Haitian women receive protective levels of ATA. Methods: Tetanus Toxoid (TT) is administered to pregnant women to prevent tetanus neonatorum. ATA were measured in 470 serially diluted UCB specimens by ELISA, standardized with WHO reference serum and capable of detecting 0.008 IU/ML. Protective levels of ATA were defined as > 0.01 IU/ML. Results. Eight (6.0%) of 134 UCB specimens from HIV-1 positive women and 24 (7.1%) of 336 specimens from HIV-1 negative women contained less than 0.01 IU/ML ATA. 13% and 9.5% of HIV negative specimens had borderline levels (0.01-0.04 IU/ML). The GMT of ATA in HIV-1 positive specimens was not significantly lower than that of HIV-1 negative specimens (0.39 vs. 0.54 respectively). Of the women whose immunizaton records have been reviewed to date, there are no differences in frequency of ATA <0.01 IU/ML for HIV-1 seropositive vs. HIV-1 seronegative individuals when stratified by doses of tetanus toxoid received. Conclusion: Although 6.8 % of infants in this population do not receive protective levels of ATA, infants born to HIV-1 positive mothers were protected as frequently as those born to HIV-1 negative mothers. 5106 HOW FAMILY PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS CAN HELP PREVENT AIDS IN COLOMBIA Ricardo Vernon*, G Ojeda**, R Murad** *The Population Council, **Profamilia Objective. To present preliminary results of an operations research project currently testing whether field workers in Profamilia's Community-Based Contraceptive Distribution Program can (a) establish condom distribution posts in meeting places of high risk groups, such as brothels, gay bars, turkish baths, jails and V.D. clinics; and (b) effectively provide information about risk-reduction techniques to members of high risk groups, such as homosexuals, prostitutes, prison inmates, teen agers and V.D. clinic clients. Methods. 30 fieldworkers received a 3 day training course on AIDS and STD's. 10 were randomly assigned to a group where 20% of their time had to be devoted to AIDS and STD prevention activities. The rest were placed in a control group with no specific AIDS time requirements. In both cases field workers were asked to establish condom distribution posts and to provide information to high risk groups. Results. Results from the first four months of the program will be presented. These include number of condom distribution posts established, number of condoms sold in these posts, number of educational sessions held, attendance to educational sessions, and the increase in the knowledge of AIDS prevention of the attendants to these sessions. Conclusion. No conclusions available yet. Notes: 5107 RESPONSE TO CHILDHOOD VACCINATIONS IN AFRICAN CHILDREN WITH HIV INFECTION. Medi Mvula*, R Ryder*/**, T Manzila*, B Matela*, Onoratto**, *Project SIDA, Kinshasa, Zaire, **CDC, Atlanta. Objective. To assess the safety and immunogenicity of BCG, oral polio (OPV), diptheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) vaccines in African children with known perinatal HIV infection. Methods. 223 children (30% symptomatic) with confirmed HIV infection (IC) and 443 non-infected control children (CC) were vaccinated with the 5 WHO childhood vaccines listed above. Weekly surveillance was done for serious adverse reactions (TB meningitis, BCG dissemination, paralysis, etc.). Serum for measuring antibodies to diptheria, tetanus, polio and pertussis was obtained at 3, 9 and 12 months of life. Lymphocyte phenotyping was performed every three months for the first year of life of each study child. Antigen skin testing was carried out at one year. Results. BCG-induced regional lymphadenitis was observed in 9% of IC and 5% of CC (P=NS). Fistulous drainage not requiring antituberculosis treatment was noted in 2% of IC, and 1% of CC. Extra-regional dissemination of BCG and other serious vaccine-induced adverse side effects were not seen in over 600 child-years of follow-up. Episodes of fever in the week after vaccination were similar in both groups. Antibody results will be given and correlated with each child's immune profile. Conclusion. Live (BCG, OPV) and killed (DPT) vaccines appeared to be safe in this group of prospectively followed HIV-infected young African children. 5108 VACCINATION OF INFANTS OF HIV SEROPOSITIVE MOTHERS. Joanne Embree*, P Datta**, M Braddick***, Nairobi, ***Middlesex Hospital, London,**** Univ Washington Objectives. To evaluate safety and efficacy of vaccination of infants of HIV seropositive mothers. Methods. Responses to vaccinations were assessed as part of an HIV vertical transmission study in Kenya where 93 infants of seropositive (cases) and 123 of seronegative (controls) mothers have been followed for mean of 7 and 9 (range 1 to 24) months. BCG vaccine was given to 73 cases and 90 controls, a complete course of OPV and DPT (OPV at birth, OPV + DPT at 6, 10 and 14 weeks) to.57 cases and 80 controls, and measles vaccine at 9 months to 30 cases and 51 controls. Results. Fifty-six (77%) cases and 82 ( 1%) controls had a normal response to BCG with pustule formation, breakdown and cutaneous scarring. Two cases and 1 control had cold abscesses. Fifteen cases (20%) and 7 (3%) controls had no response (p=0.03);15 (62%) of 24 cases and 13 (36%) of 36 controls had no response to PPD testing at 3 months (p=0.04). No infant had generalized BCG infection or TB. No major reactions to DPT vaccine occurred except for site swelling in 1 case and 1 control. No infant developed clinical polio, diphtheria, pertusis or tetanus. No vaccine associated measles occurred but 1 case and 1 control later had natural disease. Conclusion. In this cohort, infants of HIV seropositive mothers did not have an increased risk of vaccine complications. Policy decisions affecting immunization due to HIV in developing nations should await further data. 341 [Page 342](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/340) 5109 RESPONSE TO CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS IN CHILDREN WITH HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTION Hermann Mendez*, S Fikrig*, A Deforest**, J L Clark**. *SUNY-Health Science Center at Brooklyn, N.Y. **Temple U Sch of Med, St. Christopher's Hosp. for Children, Phila., PA USA Objective. To assess the serological responses of HIV infected children to childhood immunizations. Methods. Sera from HIV infected children with recorded immunizations to Diphtheria(D)-Tetanus(T)-Pertussis(P), Poliomyelitis(p)l,2,3, and Measles(M)-Mumps(Mu)-Rubella (R) vaccines and known positive and negative laboratory controls were assayed by direct whole cell agglutination for P, neutralization of toxin and virus, respectively, in VERO cells for D and p, modified passive hemagglutination for T, and ELISA for M, Mu and R. Results. 29 HIV infected children between the ages of 9 mo and 105 mo (median 41 mo) were included. 27 received at least three doses of DPT-Polio, 20 MMR. The DPT-Polio and MMR post vaccination intervals ranged from 1-64 mo (median 13 mo) and 2-92 mo (median 27 mo) respectively. % Children with Indicated Levels D T P pl p2 p3 M Mu R 20.1IU significant percentage of children with HIV infection had antibody responses to D,P,M,Mu,and R below indicated levels. Post exposure prophylaxis, when applicable, should be used in this patient population regardless of history of vaccination. 5110 PLASMA-DERIVED HEPATITIS B VACCINATION IN ANTI-HIV POSITIVE PATIENTS of *Haematology and **Medicine, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, England. Objective To observe the response of anti-HBs -ve haemophilic patients to vaccination with Hep B Vax, related to HIV status. Methods 79 haemophiliacs with an anti-HBs titre < 10 IU/1 were vaccinated at 0, 1 and 6 months with Hep B Vax (MSD) either subcutaneously (20ug) 14/63 (22%) 13 patients were anti-HBc +ve when vaccinated: 1 month later the median anti-HBs in the anti-HIV -ve patients was 380 (67-1680) IU/1, whereas in the anti-HIV +ve patients it was 2 (1-22) IU/1. During 1 year of follow-up, in the group as a whole the anti-HB titre fell by 75%, but 1 child's anti-HBs titre from a peak of>1000 IU/1 to < 10 IU/1 - this child became anti-HIV+vc 19 months after his firstanti-HBs. Conclusion Infection with HIV impairs the serological response to Hep B Vax. Notes: 5111 The Effect of a Booster Dose of Influenza Vaccine on Antibody Responses of HIV-infected Adults. Kenrad E. Nelson, P Miotti, ML Clements, S Cohn, J Baker, BF Polk. Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Objective: Findings of poor serological responses to a single dose of influenza vaccine in HIV-infected subjects prompted us to study the effect of a booster dose. Methods: Persons immunized with inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine 1 month apart included HIV-seronegative controls (8), asymptomatic HIV-seropositives (10), ARC (4), AIDS on AZT (20), and AIDS not on AZT (5). Their hemagglutination inhibition antibody (HAI) responses to A/Taiwan/86 (H1N1) and A/Leningrad/86 (H3N2) viruses were measured at 0, 1 and 2 months post-vaccination. Results: As shown below, most patients with AIDS failed to develop protective HAI antibody titers (>1:64) even when they were on AZT or when a booster dose was given. % WITH A 4-FOLD OR GREATER HAI RISE (AND WITH HAI TITER >1:64) AFTER VACCINATION A/Leningrad (H3N2) A/Taiwan (H1N1) Dose 2 Dose HIV- 75(100) 75(100) 63 (88) 75(100) HIV+, Asx. 70 (90) 70 (90) 80(100) 80(100) ARC 0 (75) 25 (75) 75 (75) 75 (75) AIDS, +AZT 15 (0) 30 (20) 30 (35) 40 (35) AIDS, -AZT 40 (40) 40 (40) 40 (40) 40 (40) Conclusions: Chemoprophylaxis may be required to prevent influenza in AIDS patients. 5112 MEASLES AND MEASLES IMMUNIZATION IN AFRICAN CHILDREN WITH HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS Medi Mvula*, R Ryder*/**, M Oxtoby**, *Project SIDA, Kinshasa, Zaire, **CDC, Atlanta. Objective. To assess the clinical severity of measles and to estimate measles vaccine efficacy in perinatally HIV infected children (IC). Methods. 223 children with known HIV infection (IC) and 443 age-matched control children (CC) received measles vaccine at 9 months of age according to WHO guidelines. Close surveillance for measles before and after vaccination was carried out. Blood for lymphocyte pheno-typing and determination of measles antibody titer was obtained before and 3 months after vaccination. Results. Before vaccination 32 children developed clinical evidence of measles (14 IC and 18 CC). % with Measles Incidence Hosp Death Diar 85 50 100 73 100 CC(n=443) 18(3.0) 0 11 75 44 75 P Value NS.01.01.08 NS.08 Post-vaccination complication rates (fever, swelling, etc) were noted to be similarly uncommon in both groups. One (0.4%) case of post-vaccination measles in IC and 5 (0.8%) in CC (P=NS) have been observed. Measles antibody results will be provided. Conclusion. The high virulence of measles in IC before vaccination, the lack of serious vaccine side effects, and the apparent efficacy of the vaccine in 260 child-years of follow-up emphasize the importance of giving measles vaccine to all young children, including those infected with HIV. 342 [Page 343](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/341) 5113 RISKS AND BENEFITS OF MEASLES IMMUNIZATION IN HIV-INFECTED CHILDREN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES Ida M. Onorato, TS Jones, W Orenstein Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta GA, USA Objective. To examine the risks and benefits of measles immunization in HIV-infected children in developing countries. Methods. We used decision analysis to assess the impact of two alternative measles immunization policies on a hypothetical birth cohort of one million children: 1) immunize all children regardless of HIV status, and 2) test all children and exclude HIV seropositive children. The latter policy requires a second clinic visit to receive test results and immunization (if appropriate). Results. Adoption of an HIV-testing and exclusion policy would prevent 3 measles vaccine-associated deaths in HIV-infected children. However, 6355 cases of measles and over 500 measles deaths would occur in HIV-infected children remaining unvaccinated under this policy. The need for an additional clinic visit may create a barrier to immunization of uninfected children. If immunization levels are reduced by 50%, an additional 205,000 measles cases and 5000 measles deaths in uninfected children are predicted. Conclusion. Our study supports the recent WHO recommendation for EPI programs to immunize all children with measles vaccine, even in the presence of symptomatic HIV infection. Although the risk of vaccine-related adverse events may be increased in HIV-infected children, there are greater benefits in protecting all children from the expected high mortality due to measles disease in developing countries. 5114 ARE LYMPHOCYTE SUBSETS MARKERS OF INFECTION IN CHILDREN Antonella Infectious Diseases Cli nic, *Pediatric Dept.(IV), University of Milan, Italy Objective. Evaluation of lymphocyte subsets at different ages in children born to HIVAb positive mothers and in HIVAb negative newborns. Methods.CD4/CD8 cell counts were performed in 32 healthy full-term newborns from HIVAb negative mothers, in 11 new borns and in 19 infected children of HIVAb positive mothers. HIVAb positive children were tested every 3 mo. for CD4/CD8 cell counts and HIVAb (ELISA Organon and WB Well come), p24Ag (ELISA, Dupont), IgM HIVAb (WB, Dupont). Of the infected children, 12 were younger than 15 mo.(8 clas sified as P-1A,1 as P-1B,3 as P2) and 7 older (all P-1B). Results.No significant differences were found in the number of CD4 and CD8 cells at birth between HIVAb negative and positive newborns, whereas CD8 percentages were signi ficantly higher in HIVAb positive newborns vs 19.9+5.3, CD4/CD8 cells ratio was lower(2.1+ 0.7 vs 2.8+0.9, p<O.05). Among the infected children, CD4 cell counts and CD4/CD8 ratios were significantly lower in the older group (888.6+481.7 vs 2287.1+1347.7,p<0.0005; 0.61+0.4 vs 1.3+0.9,p<0.05). C onclusion.CD4 cell counts do not seem to be an useful marker of infection at birth. The decrease in CD4 cell counts among HIV infected children seems to be related to duration of infection rather than to severity of disease. Notes: 5115 CHANGES IN T CELL SUBSETS IN ASYMPTOMATIC HIV-1-POSITIVE SUBJECTS AFTER INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION. J Margolick, K Nelson, S Cohn, J Baker, BF Polk, Johns Hopkins Univ., Baltimore, MD USA Objective: To determine if immunization of individuals with HIV-1 infection using inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) is associated with decreases in numbers of circulating helper (CD4) or suppressor (CD8) T cells. Methods: 34 asymptomatic gay men (19 seropositive and 15 seronegative for HIV-1) were given IIV intramuscularly. T cell subsets (CD3+* CD4+, and CD8+) were measured by flow cytometry at baseline and 1 month post immunization. Results: 5116 MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF HIV IN UGANDA 10 - 24 MONTHS Follow up. E. A.MWOROZI Department of Paediatrics & Child Health Makerere Medical School, Kampala Uganda Eighty seven HIV seropositive pregnant women were followed up through pregnancy. The pregnancy outcome was 1 abortion, 1 still birth and 87 live births. Only 17% of live births were below 2500 gms and there were no detectable congenital abnormalities. The 87 live births will have been foll'owed-up clinically and serologically at monthly and three months' intervals respectively for 18-24 months by April 1988. HIV Seronegative mothers and their children comprise the control group. The results are discussed in the paper. Mean numbers of T -13 These data show different directions and magnitudes of changes in T cell subsets in the groups studied. These differences were not statistically significant (p >0.20 for all subsets). Conclusion: The largest difference was seen in the CD4+ subset, whose susceptibility to infection with HIV-1 in vitro is amplified by antigenic stimulation (J. Immunol. 138:1719). Although our data may reflect an adverse effect of immunization, alternative explanations include chance alone (p >.05) and the expected loss of CD4+ cells with time in HIV-1-seropositive individuals. The effects of immunization on T cell subsets need further study. 343 [Page 344](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/342) 5117 SEROEPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV1 AND HIV2 INFECTIONS IN PREGNANT WOMEN First results of follow-up of mothers and their children 5118 MAKAWA,M - -BAKOUETELA,J LECKO,M. National Laboratory of Public PP 120 Brazzaville CONGO During one year/December 1986-December 1987/2000 pregnant were for serologic testingfor evidence of toxoplasmosis, Weasles and H1' infections. HIV screening were performed by ELA.7A-ELISA 1 and the positive sera were confirmed by Western Blot 1/Pasteur Production. 203 10,1 %/of 2000 pregnant women were seropositive by ELAVIA 1 and the positive sera were confirmed in Western Blot. At present, HIV2 screening and Western Blot 2 are performed. Almost all of the parturients were free of AIDS-related symptomatology during their pregnancies. One patient died only and two gave a history of symptoms during their pregnancy. 43 positive pregnant women were delivered in \"ilitary Hospital in Brazzaville and only 'o children were alive. 16 of them were seropositive by ELAVIA 1. Symptoms possibly associated with AIDS-related complexA'eight-loss, fever, lymphadenopathy/were noted by only four children of age between 14 days and 6 months of life. In 25 cases we noticed the natural abortion or preterm birth with foetal death. The seropositivity of spouses and the prevalence of HIV infection in household contacts were studied too. These results encourage the sanitary organisations to intensify the education and information of couple. Notes: 5119 RISK FACTORS FOR HIV-1 INFECTION IN PREGNANT HAITIAN WOMEN Reginald Boulos. N Halsey2, JR Brutusi, E Holt3, A MD; 3Tulane Univ., New Orleans, LA;4NIH, Bethesda, MD Objective. To identify factors associated with HIV-1 infections in pregnant women residing in an urban slum. Methods. Information was available on 799 of 3,000 pregnant women to be enrolled in a prospective evaluation of maternal-infant HIV-1 transmission. Results. 57 (7.1%) of 799 participating women were HIV1 positive by Western blot vs 51 (10%) of 517 nonparticipants screened. Seropositive women were significantly more likely to have a positive VDRL (23.5% vs 10.3%, p=0.003), to have had intercourse more frequently during pregnancy (p=0.06), but they did not report having had intercourse in the previous year with >1 man more often than seronegative women (8.4% vs 6.7%). Seropositive women were less likely to own a home (26% vs 43%, p=0.018). However, there were no differences in marital status, education, working status, number of previous pregnancies, prior use of family planning or survival of the last born child (78% vs 75%). Other possible modes of HIV-1 transmission such as IV drug abuse and blood transfusions were not important factors in this population. Conclusion. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the primary mode of HIV-1 transmission in this population is by heterosexual contact and seropositivity is associated with other sexually transmitted diseases including syphilis. 512U PREVENTION OF PERINATAL HIV TRANSMISION IN AFRICA:ARE THERE TO ANTENATAL SCREENING? Susan E. Hassig *, R Ryder*/**, W Nsa *, M Utuchidi***, H Francis *, N Mudibany****, E Paquot****, * ****Cliniques Ngaliema, the feasibility of developing a low-cost, serology-independent high-risk profile for use in identifying HIV(+) women of child-bearing age in Africa. Methods. The female participants in a number of age studies conducted by Project SIDA in Kinshasa, Zaire were utilized. Factors of possible significance, including age, marital status, obstetrical and other medical history were obtained from study records. Individual factors and various combinations of factors were examined for sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPV) for HIV seropositivity. Results. The following table summarizes the findings to date for several individual factors: Factor Sensitivity PPV Clinical AIDS 0.10 1.00 Prior hospitalization 0.40 0.53 Prior transfusion 0.04 0.79 Prior death of child 0.39 0.56 History of TB 0.03 1.00 Age 20-25 years 0.78 0.61 Other parameter combinations will be discussed. Conclusion. A strongly predictive and sensitive profile for HIV infection in women from Kinshasa has not been identified. African programs seeking to prevent perinatal HIV transmission may have to depend on HIV testing prior to conception in women of child-bearing age. 344 [Page 345](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/343) 5121 PROGRESSION of Manitoba, Winnipeg,++U of Washington Objective~ To study the influence of pregnancy on HIV disease progression in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods. Women were screened for HIV Ab at delivery. HIV+ women were enrolled into a prospective cohort study and followed for HIV-related illness at 6-12 week intervals. Results. Eighty-one HIV+ women were enrolled and followed for a mean of 6 months (range 0-18). At enrolment 49 women were asymptomatic, 27 had generalised lymphadenopathy (LAD) and 5 had systemic disease (2 Herpes Zoster, 1 pneumonia, 1 chronic pruritic skin rash and oral candidiasis, 1 kaposis sarcoma). Of the 49 asymptomatic women, 18 developed LAD during a mean follow-up of 4.5 months (range 0-18). Using survival analysis the cumulative proportion of women developing LAD was 53%. Of the 76 women who were either asymptomatic or had LAD at delivery, 2 developed Herpes Zoster over a mean follow-up of 6.2 months (range 0-18). Survival analysis showed the cumulative proportion with systemic disease to be 5%. The 5 women with systemic disease at delivery were followed for a mean of 6 months (range 4.5-9). Four were well at follow-up. The patient with kaposis sarcoma was sick when lost to follow-up at 4.5 months. Conclusion. In this cohort a high proportion of HIV+ women developed LAD following pregnancy but progression to systemic disease was rarely observed. 5122 HIV EIA NEGATIVE PEDIATRIC AIDS CASES IN RWANDA: ig and IgM ANTIBODIES PATTERNS, P.Van de Perre:o, P, Lepage *', F, Nsengumuremyi D, 0, Nzaramba 4, From tne AIDS Project, Kigaii, Rwanda (1), and Department of Pediatrics, Centre Hospitalier de Kigali, Kigali, Rwanda (4.), OBJECTIVE: During 1987, 244 children born of HIV sero+ mothers (EIA and IFA) were diagnosed as AIDS cases following the WHO clinical definition in Kigali, Rwanda, Eighteen of them (7,4%) were HIV seronegative by EIA, This study was perfomed to asses whether these EIA negative clinical AIDS cases represent false negative EIA or false positive WHO defined AIDS cases, METHODS: Serum samples of 12 of these patients (4 F and 8 M) were studies, All patients were born of HIV sero+ mothers (2 AIDS, 1 ARC, and 9 asymptomatic), They were tested for HIV antibodies by Western Blot (WB) and a igM HIV WB after precipitation of Rheumatoid Factor (Absorbant RF, Behring) (both UB from Biotech Du Pont de Nemours), RESULTS: Five patients had a positive WB test with a reaction with at least one core protein (p17, p25, p55) and at least one envelope protein (gp41, gpl20, gp160) and 4 patients had a WB reactivity limited to the core proteins, Three patients were positive by IgM WB (p17 and/or p24 plus p55), 2 of whom being IgG reactive only with core proteins and the other with core and envelope proteins, The age of the HIV IgM+ patients (8 to 78 months) was not significantly different from the IgM seronegatives (7 to 42 months), Only 3 patients were negative by both Ig6 and IgM WB, CONCLUSIONS: i, Seronegativity by EIA may occur in as many as 7% of WHOdefined pediatric AIDS subjects born of sero+ mothers in Africa, 2. Most of these cases are false negative EIA, 3, In none of these patients is HIV IgM the only marker of the infection, Notes: 5123 TRANSPLACENTAL HIV TRANSMISSION IN AFRICAN NEWBORNS Robert W. Ryder*/**, M Rayfield**, T Quinn***, M Atlanta, ***NIH, Bethesda, ****Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp. Objective. To describe the frequency of transplacental (TP) transmission and to correlate the clinical and immunologic characteristics of African newborn infants infected via this route. Methods. HIV cord blood (CB) cultures were obtained from children born to 96 HIV(+) mothers (MTH) at delivery. CB and blood collected at 3 months of age were tested for IgM antibodies (Western blot). Infants, now age one year, have been followed monthly since birth. Results. CB Cult. HIV(+) CBIgM 3 mo. CB +/or 3 Dead by (No) MTH w/AIDS (+) IgM(+) mo one yr. NS NS.001 Three (25%) of 12 babies with (+) CB cultures compared with 26 (37%) of 70 (P=NS) babies with (-) CB cultures who were alive at one year remained free of AIDS associated symptoms. Conclusion. Infants with (+) CB cultures are more likely to have mothers with AIDS; the prognosis for these infants was especially poor. Reliance on IgM testing, as currently developed, to diagnose TP acquired HIV infection may often underdiagnose true infection. 5124 VERTICAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV-1 FROM MOTHERS TO INFANTS IN RWANDA A Ndikuyeze*, A Klion**, A Vernon**, Butare, Rwanda*; Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions** Objectives. To determine the prevalence and vertical transmission of HIV-1 from mothers to infants in 5 rural health clinics in Butare, Rwanda. Methods. Mothers and their infants between the ages of 7-28 months (n=286 pairs) attending clinics were tested for HIV-1 by ELISA. Positive ELISA results were confirmed by Western blot, as were ELISA discordant mother-infant pairs. Infants less than 7 months of age were excluded to eliminate transfer of passive antibody. Results. The overall HIV-1 seroprevalepce in mothers was 5.9% and in infants, 1.4%. HIV-1 seronegative-infant seropositive. Univariate analysis demonstrated that seropositive mothers were younger, more likely to be single, and from the Rango district. Seropositive infants were more likely to have a history of transfusions and (perhaps) measles. The seropositive infant born to a seronegative mother had a history of 40 injections, 6 hospitalizations, and single transfusion. We found no association with breast feeding. Conclusion. The likelihood of vertical transmission from an HIV-1 infected mother to her infant (17.6%; 95% CI 3.8, 43.4%) appears to be somewhat lower than reported from other studies. We cannot exclude the possibility of postnatal maternal infection. 345 [Page 346](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/344) 5125 MATERNAL-FOETAL TRANSMISSION OF HIVI AMONG Ministry Health, ** University Hospital, *** Central Hospital, YAOUNDE CAMEROON Objective. Determine the prevalence of HIVI antibodies among pregnant women and the percentage of maternal foetal transmission. Methods. Blood from 900 Cameroonian women during delivery was tested. Cord blood of babies born to women who tested positive was also analysed. New-borns who were found positive were screened 6 months later. ELISA technic was performed (Enzygnost anti HIV BEHRING). Positive cases were confirmed by Western Blott (IgG Dupont de Nemours). Results. Of the 900 women tested, 12 of tested Elisa positive; only 10 of these patients were confirmed (the prevalence is 1,10 %). 10 babies from the confirmed positive mothers were tested, of these, 7 were found. positive. Of the 7 found positive: 1 died 15 days after 3 tested negative 6 months after and the 3 others are still being followed. Conclusion. The prevalence is 1,10 % in pregnant women and the percentage of materno-foetal transmission will be giving by the follow up of the three remaing children. 5126 VERTICAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV determine the rate and timing of vertical transmission of HIV. Methods. A prospective study of women and their infants was initiated in January 1986. Women were screened for HIV Ab at delivery and followed-up with their infants. Results. 117/4300 (2.7% women screened had HIV Ab by ELISA and WB and were enrolled along with 177 HIV- controls. Case and control women were of similar age (23.3 vs 23.7) and parity (1.6 vs 1.9), their infants were of similar gestational age (40.5 vs 40.1 wks) and APGAR score (8.0 vs 7.8). Infants of cases had lower birthweight (3083 vs 3239 gms, p<.02) and had a higher prevalence of palpable nodes (58/102(58%) vs 53/167 (32%), p(.001). In cord blood of infants of cases, IgG Ab was present in all of 105, IgM HIV Ab in 42/110 (38%) and p24 antigen in 0/37. HIV was isolated from cord lymphocytes of only 1/25 (4%). At follow-up IgM Abs appeared in 19/32 infants, giving a cumulative incidence of 72% at 6 months. Quantitative Ab levels to p24 and gp41 using a recombinant direct EIA were determined for 30 infants followed for a mean of 7 months (range 1.5-12). In 27/30, Ab levels declined or disappeared consistent with clearance of passively acquired maternal Ab. In 3 infants Ab levels rose at 1.5-12 months (after an initial decline in 2). 5 case infants died, 3 probably due to HIV, with failure to thrive, pneumonia, and encephalopathy. Conclusion. HIV culture,serial IgG levels or clinical disease suggest a low rate of vertical transmission. Notes: 5127 COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF SCREENING TO REDUCE TRANSFUSION-RELATED AIDS IN DEVELOPING. AREAS D S Shepard*, J Eichner* *Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA Objective: To model the impact and timing of screening of blood on transfusion-related AIDS infections, deaths and costs in developing areas where screening was recently or incompletely implemented. Methods: A deterministic simulation model was developed and calibrated with data from the literature and program experience. Input parameters include seroprevalence of HIV antibody, efficiency of transmission of HIV from transfusion, incubation period, mortality rates, screening and medical care costs, and accuracy of tests for HIV. Output shows costs, HIV infections, and deaths over time, both with and without screening, calibrated to San Juan, PR and other areas. Results: In San Juan, transfusions caused approximately 267 HIV infections and 53 deaths annually prior to screening blood. Screening virtually eliminates these infections. It eventually reduces deaths and saves health costs, as reduced hospital use more than offsets screening costs. Conclusions: Screening blood for transfusions is medically and economically advantageous, but benefits take at least 3 years to materialize. 5128 CONTROL MEASURES TO PREVENT HIV TRANSMISSION BY BLOOD PRODUCTS IN MEXICO Jaime SepOlveda*, C Avila*, JL Domfnguez** *General Directorate of Epidemiology, Ministry of Health, Mexico ** National Blood Transfusion Center, Ministry of Health, Mexico Objective. To describe the implementation in Mexico of measures to protect blood products from contamination with HIV and their impact in the short term. Methods. Information available from blood collection centers, before and after mandatory testing (implemented in May, 1986), and before and after prohibition of blood commercialization (implemented in September, 1987), were analyzed. Results. The Ministry of Health has carried out the following measures: mandatory notification of AIDS cases, mandatory testing of all blood product donors, prohibition of blood commercialization, and campaigns to promote voluntary donation of blood. During 1986 in Mexico, more than 700,000 units of blood were transfused; 70% came from voluntary donors and 30% from paid donors. In 1986, the seroprevalence of HIV was 0.1% in voluntary donors and 7% in paid donors. Following implementation of the above measures, the prevalence of HIV seropositivity in blood product donors has fallen to 0.04%. As of December 1987, blood product transfusion cases accounted for 10% of reported cases. Previous projections estimated that the number of cases in Mexico by 1991 will be between 22,000 and 32,000; twenty-five percent of these cases would be associated with transfusion if none of the preventive measures mentioned above had been taken. Present projections estimate that by 1991 the proportion of cases associated with blood product transfusions will be reduced to 14%, because of the preventive measures taken. Conclusion. There may be an increase in the proportion of cases associated with blood product transfusion in the short term, but over time this proportion should gradually decrease, proving the efficacy of the preventive measures for AIDS in blood collection centers. 346 [Page 347](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/345) 5129 ONE YEAR OF ANTI-HIV ANTIBODIES SCREENING AT THE BLOOD-BANK OF BRAZZAVILLE (CONGO) N. Copin**, F. Yala**, BrOcker*, M. Gentilini* *Dpt of Tropical Medicine and INSERM Research Unit 313, H6pital de la Salpetriere, Paris, Brazzaville, CONGO.***Laboratory of Immunology, H6pital de la Salpetribre, Paris, FRANCE. Objective. Our objective was to prevent transfusion transmission of HIV. Method. ELISA testing was effective at Brazzaville since october 1, 1986; positive sera were sent to Paris for Western blot (WB) confirmation. Results. From october 1, 1986 to september 30, 1987, 13 505 blood bank donnors were tested. 1005 (7,37%, 6,93% to 7,81%) were positive in ELISA. Males were slightly more frequently positive: 914 out of 12 089 males vs 91 out 1416 was available for 477 donnors. 55 (11,53%) were negative, according to the positive predicted value as calculated by Baye's theorem, 220 (46,12%) were positive (antibodies (ab) against enveloppe and core proteins or ab against core proteins and positive immunofluorescence), 108 (22,64%) had only anti-p24 ab and 94 (19,71%) had anti-p24 ab, and other anti core ab, usually against pl8. Those 202 (42,35%) doubtful sera are probably heterogenous: a small percent is perhaps corresponding to early seroconversion, and the majority to a false positivity. As a matter of fact, only 8,04% (7 out 87) of AIDS-patients had a doubtful WB. Conclusion. Blood bank screening in Brazzaville yielded 7,37% of positive donnors in ELISA. WB confirmation showed that only 46,12% were positive. Longitudinal and epidemiological studies are under progress to understand the significance of the doubtful sera. 5130 HIV ANTIBODIES IN BEGGAR BLOOD DONORS IN RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL Maria Inez Carvalho*, L Castello-Branco*, J G A S Pereira** da Previdencia, **WHO Collaborating Center on AIDS Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Objective. Blood transfusions in Brazil are often carried out without any control. Blood donation is a source of income for a part of the indigent population. We carried out a study to avaliate the risk of AIDS transmission from blood collected of a group of brazilian beggars,most of them \"professional\" blood donors. A total of 100 voluntary beggars was studied (87% male; average age 27.7; 23% 70% of them being \"professional\" blood donors. Tests were carried for the blood-transmissible infections: AIDS (ELISA, IIF, Western blot), syphilis, hepatitis B and Chagas' disease. Results. The following table shows the principal results. HIV HEPATITIS B SYPHILIS Our results indicate that an alarmingly high percentage of the beggars studied, notably those considered \"professional\" blood donors, were infected. These data demonstrate that the health authorities must take actioni against this commercialized blood transfusion system. Notes: 5131 HIV IN VOLUNTARY BLOOD DONORS IN ARGENTINA Oscar Fay*, G Muchinik**, N Rosenfeld****, MB Bouzas**, analyse the orevalence of HIV carriers anonp voluntary blood donors from different regions of Argentina Methods. ELISA screening, confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western Blot, was carried out in the sera of voluntary blood donors, collected from 2nd January to 30th December, 1987, a self-excluding questionnaire having been previously filled out. 5132 HIV PREVALENCE IN MOZAMBICAN BLOOD DONORS, (1987). J. BARRETO, L. I NGOLD*, F. DE LA CENTRE AND ~St*MOZAMBICAN RED CROSS. MAPUTO. NOZAMBIQUE. Objective: To study the prevalence of HIV 1 positive individuals in Mozambican blood donors to set up priorities for HIV screening introduction in Blood Banks. Methods: A serum sample of all blood donors attending during a month in nine provincial blood bank were collected and screened for HIV-1 antibodies by ELISA (Virosnosti a,Organon) and Western Blot (Bio-Rad). A total of 2306 serum samples were studied. To identify potential risk factors a questionaire was filled to each individual included in the study. Results: An overall positivity rate of 1.5% was found by HIV 1 ELISA ranged from 3.1% in Beira to 0.8% in Nampula. After WB analysis only 0.8% were confirmed as positive (from 2.8% in Quelimane to nil in Chimoio). No particular risk factors were identified in blood donors studied. Based on this results a programme for the progressive introduction of HIV screening on blood banks countrywide was drawn up. Evidences of HIV 2 circulation in the country create a new situation which is under evaluation.Results will be presented in the Conference. Results. Provinces Buenos Aires Rosario Tucuman Others Total n 7000 14201 5720 1255 HIV n 2 7 2 0 Positivity 0.02 0.04 0.03 0 Total 28176 11 0.04 Out of the 11 positive sera, 5 came from honosexuals, 3, from drug addicts, 1, from a bisexual and 2, from unknown risk. Conclusion. The low incidence of HIV serooositivity on voluntary blood donors indicates that transfusions do not represent an important transmission route of AIDS in Argentina. 347 [Page 348](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/346) 5133 AIDS AND BLOOD DONORS PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS Our blood centre took up the task to inform blood donors about AIDS and the risk factors and to evaluate the donor attitude. About 70 to 100 donors donate blood daily at our centre. The study was devised to investigate whether the information and the meaning and consequences of HIV test were explained. A questionnaire was prepared and circulated among the donor population. Results: 1. All donors indicated that the material provided was informative. We found ignorance about certain aspects. 20% had apprehension about AIDS through blood donation. 2% opted out of being a blood donor. The same percentage thought contamination was possible in blood donation. In case of a donor being positive of HIV, 98% wanted to know the results. More 'than 20% were afraid of the outcome of the test results. 2. Great concern was seen in the study. However, more information and education must be formulated in order to relieve anxiety and misunderstanding. The importance of testing blood for AIDS and the consequences of the test results have to be impressed upon the people, through health education by donor recruiters. The group studied comprised voluntary/ directed/replacement donors. 500 donors were involved in this exercise. 5134 Evolution of IgG and IgM antibodies in early progressive HIV infection in Kinshasa, Zaire H Francis*,M Tropical Medicine,Antwerp,Belgium,***National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda,MarylAnd Objective. To demonstrate the changing pattern of IgG and IgM antibody recognition of HIV antigens in African patients. Methods. Forty six pediatric patients who were retrospectively found to have received blood transfusions from HIV positive donors were studied. IgM and IgG western blots were done on 1,3,and 6 month post transfusion sera. The prevalence of HIV antibodies to p17, p24,p31,gp41,p55,p64, and gpl20/160 was calculated. Results. Prevalence pf IgM and IgG antibodies 1,3,6 months post Antibody recognition of different HIV antigens occurs at different rates that are dependant on the time of exposure to infection. Core antigen is the most commonly detected antigen in IgM western blots. Both Core (p24) and envelope (gpl20/160),are the most frequently recognised antigens in the IgG western blot. Notes: 5135 BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND HIV INFECTION IN BRAZZAVILLE (CONGO). Sant@, Yaound@, Cameroun. 3- Groupe Hospitalier Piti6-Salp(tri0re, Paris, France. Objective. To determine HIV antibody prevalence in blood donors and blood recipients as well as the aspect of post tranfusional AIDS. Methods. Survey carried out from October 1986 to October 1987. 13505 blood samples taken from blood donors and 197 blood samples from blood recipients (having received several transfusions) were screened with Pasteur Elisa test. Some positive cases were confirmed by western blotting. WHO clinical definition (Bangui 1985) was used. Results. 1- The prevalence of HIV antibody: - among blood donors 7,6% by ELISA but 4% by western blotting; men were slighty more often infected than women. - among blood recipients: 23,8% (47/197 of whom 38 were sickle cell anemia recipients). In this second group, the most frequent associated risk factors were medicament injection and scarification. 2- Clinical and biological investigations in blood recipients do not show particular aspects. Conclusion. HIV antibody prevalence is high among blood donors and blood recipients. The transmission of HIV by blood is still an important problem. It requires an urgent systematic screening in all the blood banks of the country. 5136 PSYCHOSOCIAL COUNSELING OF PATIENTS INFECTED WITH HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS AT THE UNIVERSITY TEACHING HOSPITAL, LUSAKA, ZAMBIA K Peltzer*, S Hira**, D Wadhawan**, J Kamanga* P Perine*** *Institute of African Studies, **University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia, ***Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, U.S.A. Objectives. 1. To assess the psychosocial symptoms and reactions of patients with HIV infections, their sexual partners, relatives and friends. 2. To develop a psychosocial counseling concept for these clients in Zambia. Methods. Twenty asymptomatic patients with HIV infection, 70 with AIDS-related complex (ARC) and 40 with AIDS were selected for the study at University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka. The contents of counseling included: factual information about HIV, the client's illness concept, information transfer of diagnosis, change of sexual behaviour, adjustment to family changes (no further children etc), psychosocial support and reassurance to reduce anxiety or health damaging behaviour. Results. More than 90% didnot know the symptoms and 60% didnot know the mode of transmission of HIV. The general reactions included four types: denial, anger or fear, bargaining or depression, acceptance or resignation. Complications were encountered in following situations: a) discordant HIV infection in a married couple; b) childless couple; c) pregnant patient; d) children of parents both of whom had AIDS/ARC. Conclusion. As a result of counseling, behaviour change was facilitated and actually took place especially with regard to further transmission, coping skills with the new situation were enhanced, decision making was promoted and interpersonal relationships were improved. 348 [Page 349](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/347) 5137 ACCEPTABILITY OF CONDOMS AND SPERMICIDES IN A POPULATION BASED SAMPLE OF URBAN RWANDAN WOMEN Susan Alien*, Antoine Serufilira**, in Francisco, **Centre Hospitalier de Kigali, Rwanda,***Free University of Brussels,****Family Health International Objective: To describe the acceptability and level of compliance with condoms and 2 spermicide preparations in a group of 220 women from Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. Methods: 221 women were interviewed individually by a Rwandan social worker and received a brief education about AIDS and a demonstration of condoms, spermicide cream, and spermicide suppositories. The limitations of each method was explained, including the limitations of our current knowledge of their effectiveness as an AIDS prevention technique. Each subject was given a choice of method.Those who accepted one of the three methods were asked to return at 2,4,8,12, and 16 weeks to respond to a questionnaire designed to evaluate compliance. Resulls: 112 (51%) of the subjects demonstrated an interest in using one of the methods, of whom 24% chose condoms and the rest spermicidal foam (28%) or suppositories (47%). Preliminary results of followup indicate that the success of condom use often depended on whether the male partner had had previous experience with it. Spermicidal suppositories were considered easy to use, but the 15 minute waiting period sometimes presented a problem. No waiting period is necessary for spermicide cream, but use of the cream is more complex and water is required to rinse the applicator. Tabulation of the final followup data will be presented. Conclusion: While the efficacy of spermicidal cream as an AIDS prevention technique is not known, laboratory evidence indicates that the virucidal effects of nonoxynol-9 may help prevent transmission of HIV. In high-risk populations unwilling to use condoms, spermicidal preparations may provide some protection against HIV infection. More studies are needed to determine the efficacy of nonoxynol-9 in the prevention of HIV transmission. 5138 CASE CONTROL STUDY OF RISK FACTORS FOR HIV INFECTION AMON6 AFRICAN ADULTS RESIDINS IN BELSIUM Pierre CornetS, M Laga$t, L Bonneuxl$, P Piot$t, H Taelmanl$ t Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Brussels, Belgium and tI Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium Objectives: To define risk factors for HIV infection among African adults residing in Belgium. Methods: 44 HIV seropositive African students (38 men and 6 women) were compared with 40 HIV seronegative African controls (34 men and 6 women) for potential risk factors. They were all participating in a screening programme for HIV and other infections and filled in a self administered questionaire on potential risk factors for HIV infection, Results: None of the study participants had had homosexual contacts or used IV drugs. 1 case and 2 controls had received a blood transfusion. The following were not significantly associated with HIV infection: number of life time sex partners (median: 6-9); prostitute contact during the last 5 years (53 X among the male cases vs. 29 X, p a 0.15); types of sexual practice; a history of gonorrhoea or serological markers for syphilis and hepatitis B; and exposure to medical injections. However, a history of genital ulceration was reported more frequently by the HIV positive cases (21 X vs. 5 X, p = 0.03). Conclusions: HIV infection was not associated with a particular type of risk behaviour among these riddle class, mostly urban, African men and women, as compared to controls. The data are consistent with genital ulcers as a cofactor for transmission of HIV infection. Notes: 5139 A SOCIAL CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE OF HIV TRANSMISSIONS IN THE KAGERA REGION IN TANZANIA Lwihula GK*, Nguma JK*, Dahlgren L** * Dept of Behavioural Science, Muhimbili Medical Centre, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania ** Dept of Sociology, University of UmeA, Sweden Little information is available in Tanzania on factors which may explain the transmission of HIV infection. This paper therefore, reports on a one year behavioural investigation highlighting on those missing gaps in Kager, which is the most a risk area, so far, in the country. A multi-method strategy was adopted by the investigators whereby data gathering techniques varried from personal interviews with samples of i) seropositive patients in hospitals, ii) adult healthy individuals in villages whose health status was yet to be determined, iii) self-administrered interviews with health workers caring for AIDS patients in hospitals to observations and discussions with a cross-section of local people on the subject of inquiry. The interviews probed into the histories of blood transfusion, peoples movements, their knowledge on the disease, cultural activities as well as sexual behaviour relevant to the topic, based on a seven year recall period. 5140 IMPLICATIONS OF THE HEALTH BELIEF MODEL IN RESEARCH AND HEALTH EDUCATION FOR AIDS CONTROL Nguma JK*, Lwihula GK* * Dept of Behavioural Science, Muhimbili Medical Centre, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania Control of communicable diseases in man usually focuses on breaking the transmission cycle between man to man or a vector to men. While success has been realized in the control of some communicable diseases, less has been achieved in getting the public adopt vital protective behaviour against a wide range of communicable diseases. Short of a vaccin or cure, the recent AIDS epidemic places even more emphasis or preventive measures against the disease. The current challange facing scientists therefore is to come up with ways that will not only influence adoption of protective behaviour among individuals against the AIDS infection but to sustain such behaviour. This paper argues that social sciences have the answers to this challenge. Using data collected from a small town in Tanzania, the paper illustrates the implications of utilizing a Health Belief Model derived from social sciences for both research and development of health education strategy for AIDS control. The paper concludes that social sciences provide both analytical tools for understanding and prediciting human behaviour as well as the mechanism by which such behaviour can be substained or modified through appropriate health education. 349 [Page 350](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/348) 5141 DURABILITY OF CHANGED SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR IN NAIROBI PROSTITUTES: INCREASING USE OF CONDOM Francis Plummer, M Braddick, W Cameron, J Ndinya-Achola, J Kreiss, M Bosire, A Ronald, E Ngugi. Kenya Meidal Research Institute, University of Nairobi, University of Manitoba, University of Washington. Objective: To evaluate the durability of increased condom use (CU) among a cohort of Nairobi prostitutes. Method: 363 female prostitutes enrolled in a study of HIV epidemiology were surveyed for the frequency of CU at November 1986 after an HIV education program and the initiation of condom distribution. We conducted a follow-up survey of CU 5 to 12 months after the intial survey. Women were divided into three groups on the basis of health education: group 1 (Gi) = most, group 2 (G2) = intermediate, group 3 (G3) = least. Results: Mean % CU Survey CU was HIV infection (OR=0.34, p<.01). Conclusion: CU has continued to increase in this cohort of prostitutes. Over 80% of women now report some CU. This has been achieved with modest educational inputs and at minimal cost. We have prevented a large number of secondary HIV infections through this program. Behavioural intervention in high risk groups is an effective means of HIV control. 5142 PROSTITUTES AND HIV TRANSMISSION IN ZAIRE: COMFJTER-BASED Public Health, ***Tulane SPHTM Obiective. To evaluate the role of prostitutes in HIV transmission in Kinshasa. Methods. Yearly incidence and prevalence rates of HIV infection and AIDS are projected for different levels of sexual activity with prostitutes and compared with a baseline model representing current Kinshasa estimates, using the SIMULAIDS computer model. Results. Halving the number of prostitutes results in less than proportional decreases in HIV transmission rates. Condom use with prostitutes results in significantly lover HIV transmission rates, but only at high utilization rates and only when condoms are properly used. HIV seroprevalence in prostitutes and, to a lesser extent, their clients is higher than that in other adult groups. However, quantitatively, most HIV transmission in the Kinshasa setting is attributable to regular and casual sexual relationships rather than to direct infection via prostitutes. Total elimination of prostitution results in seroincidence rates approximately 25% of those in the baseline model. Conclusions. Prostitution is an important determinant of the level of HIV transmission in the Kinshasa setting. Notes: 5143 PREVALENCE OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TYPE 1 (HIV-1) INFECTION AMONG FEMALE PROSTITUTES IN TWO NIGERIAN STATES Idris Mohammed*, J.O. Chikwen* and of Calabar, Calabar, Cross River State Objective. To determine the prevalence of HIV-1 infection amono orostitutes in order to establish whether or not they constitute a high risk group for HIV infection in Nigeria. Methods. Serum samples were collected from 823 female prostitutes of different socio-economic classes resident in Borno and Cross River states of Nigeria. The samples were screened by the Wellcozyme ELISA technique and positive ones were subjected to confirmation by the Western blot technique. Results. Fourteen of the samples were positive by Wellcozyme ELISA out of which four samples (0.49%) were confirmed by the Western blot technique as positive for HIV-1 infection. Three of the infected prostitutes were from the middle class. On the average, the prostitutes attended to 3.3 male clients per day. Conclusion. Compared to the general population, prostitutes are at a higher risk for HIV-1 infection. The prevalence of HIV-1 infection in prostitutes in Nigeria is very low compared to reports from other African countries. Educational compaign could therefore play a vital role in checking the spread of HIV infection in Nigeria. 5144 FREQUENCY OF ANTIBODY TO HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) IN MALE AND FEMALE PROSTITUTES IN RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL Luiz Castello-Branco*, M I L Carvalho*, E A de Castilho**, H E Pereira**, M S Pereira**, B Galvao-Castro** Previdencia, **WHO Collaborating Centre on AIDS Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Objective. Investigate the magnitude of HIV infection among people of both sexes leading promiscuous sexual lives in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Methods. Volunteers were recruited from an out-patient clinic in an area with a high concentration of female and male prostitutes as well as male transvestite prostitutes. An interview and ELISA, IIF and Western blot were performed. Results. The results are shown in the following table. Group Characteristics Female Male Transvestite N9 of cases 113* 24** 16*** Positive serology (years) 17-75 19-62 18-41 N9 parterns/year (mean) 800 10 480 Anal intercourse (%) 27.4 95.8 100 I. V. drug user (%) 6.1 4.1 12.5 Blood transfusion (%) 17.7 12.5 -Other STD (%) 43.3 70.8 50 *2, **1 and ***3 cases of AIDS Conclusion. So far, the majority of Brazilian cases of AIDS belongs to the classical risk groups (male homo/ bisexual, hemophiliacs, blood transfusion recipients, intravenous drug users), and from the medim and high social classes. Nevertheless, our present data indicate that promiscuous and poor people are already infected and can play an important role in the dissemination of HIV in Brazil. Thus, the epidemiological pattern of AIDS in Brazil could suffer modification in a near feature. 350 [Page 351](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/349) 5145 RISKS FOR HIV Carellan The Kealth Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, Alabanp, letro 'Ianile, Phil Objective. To determine risk p'ractices arons prostitutes which would increase the likehood of acquiring HIV infection in the Philippines. Methods. 'lale and female subjects in sex-oriented establishments in 'etro 'lanila were interviewed regarding risk practices during a two year seroprevalence survey for HIV infection. Demographic information, past medical history, drug use, sexual practices, and condcn use were elicited. Results. Preliminary.ata from 3,500 females and 600 male subjects revealed that more females than males were represented in the fnllowing categories: <18 vsl6%). The preponderance of females was sirnificant(p(.001). iiore males admitted to anal sex (53%vs2%). Regular condom use was rare in both groups((2%). No IV drug use was seen. HIV infection was first detected in females in Sept, 1986, and among males in Dec, 1987. Current prevalence rate are 0.13% in females and 0.3% in males. Anti-HIV was not seen in other population groups. Conclusion. Risk practices identified among prostitutes were many sex partners, partners of foreign origin, and minimal condom use. 5146 AN EXPERIMENT IN CALLAO, PERU TO PROTECT HIGH RISK NOMEN FROM AIDS AND OTHER STD'S J.

Notes: 5147 HIV-1 IN PROSTITUTES IN Public Health, Bos;,:'o', USA Objective. To evaluate the seroprevalence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 among certain population groups in Cameroon. Methods. 596 serum samples were collected from 4 citi.es in 1986 from healthy adults (N=150), hospitalized patients (N=204), prostitutes, STD patients and prisoners (N=242), and screened by ELISA (Abbott) to HIV and then by immunoblot and/or RIP to HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigenic probes. In 1987 a second survey was completed among healthy adults (N=370), hospitalized patients (N=119) and prostitute/prisoners (N=88) from the central and northern areas of the country. All sera were tested by immunoblot to HIV-1 and HIV-2. Results. None of the sera from 1986 tested positive for HIV-1 or HIV-2. In the separate survey in 1987, 4 of 53 prostitutes and one prisoner have demonstrated seropositivity for HIV-1 and none for HIV-2. Conclusions. Although separate populations were sur.veyed, this data suggests that HIV-1 is an increasing problem in certain populations in Cameroon. 5148 PREVALENCE OF HTLV-I ANTIBODIES AMONG FEMALE PROSTITIUES SIDA Kinshasa, Zaire Objective. To study the frequency and related risk factors of HTLV-I infection among Zairian prostitutes. Methods. 377 female prostitutes in Kinshasa, Zaire were enrolled in 1985 in a study to determine associated factors for HIV and HTLV-I infection.They completed a questionnaire regarding sex practices and demographic information, and blood was drawn. Sera were tested for antibodies to HIV and HTLV-I by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot. The presence of at least- p-19 and p-24 bands was required for HTLV-I positivity. Results. 12 (3.2%) of samples were positive for HTLV-I, and as previously reported, the HIV prevalence was 27%. Two of the women were co-infected. HTLV-I prevalence increased with age, and seven of the positive women originated from one region in Zaire. Presence of HTLV-I antibodies was not associated with frequency or type of sex practice, with number of injections (p=0.59), or history of recent transfusion (p=0.10); however there was an association with douching prior to or after intercourse (p=0.007). Conclusion. HTLV-I infection is present among Zairian prostitutes. Age and region of origin were the main risk factor for infection, suggesting the presence of geographic pockets of high prevalence, which warrant further study. Although HTLV-I may be sexually transmitted, the lack of association with sex practices in this study, indicates that the efficiency of transmission is much less than that for HIV. 351 [Page 352](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/350) 5149 A MODEL PROGRAM TO REDUCE HIV INFECTION AMONG PROSTITUTES IN AFRICA Dr. Peter Lamptey*, Dr. Alfred Neequays**, S. Weir*, Dr. **Korle-Bu Hospital, Accra, Ghana Objective-To describe a model intervention program for reducing HIV infection among prostitutes in Africa. Methods-Selected prostitutes were educated about their risk of becoming infected with HIV, motivated to use condoms and spermicides, and trained to educate their peers about AIDS and to supply them with free condoms and spermicides. Results-Pilot interventions to test this model have been undertaken in Ghana, Cameroon, and Mali. Data will be presented on the success of the program in Accra, Ghana which has been in operation since June, 1987. Baseline and six months follow-up data will be presented to show the effect of the intervention on prostitute knowledge about AIDS and their use of condoms and snermicides. Preliminary results show impressive increases in condom and spermicide use. Conclusion-Programs targeted at prostitutes can be effective in increasing their use of condoms and/or spermicides. 5150 REDUCTION OF URETHRITIS FOLLOWING INTENSIVE EDUCATION CONCERNING AIDS RISK WILLIAM O HARRISON, G B WHITTEN III U.S.Naval Hospital, San Diego, California U.S. Navy ships deploying to the western Pacific & Indian Ocean areas have had rates of urethritis ranging as high as 1100 cases/1000 men/year. Intensive and extensive informational programs have had little impact on these rates. Recently, a large naval vessel spent 7 months in these areas. Prior to departure a 70-minute briefing about AIDS, HIV and the risk of sexual transmission was presented live to the crew and also videotaped. The tape was shown repeatedly over the ships' closed-circuit TV during the trans-Pacific trip. A comparison of the rates of urethritis during this trip and a voyage one year previously is shown: DAYS IN PORT TOTAL CASES 1986 7 554 1987 10 250 CASES/1000/DAY 15.8 4.6 Interviews with crewmembers showed a keen awareness of the risk of HIV acquisition in the ports at which the ship called. Fear of AIDS contributed to the overall reduction of sexual activity and promoted extensive use of condoms by those continuing to have sexual contact. All crew-members were HIV-negative on departure from the USA. Repeat testing done immediately on return identified no new positives. Further testing will be done. In summary, the information provided by live briefings and videotape enhanced the awareness of the risk of HIV infection through casual, unprotected sexual contact. This in turn led to reduced and/or protected sexual activity, as manifested by a 70.9 percent reduction in the incidence of urethritis during the cruise.

BOMBA++, LA J.BARRETO L.BARQUET+ +IMMUNOLOGY DEPT, INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE SAUDE AND ++HEALTH DIRECTION TETE PROVINCE, MOZAMBIQUE. Objective: To assess HIV circulation among population afflicted by war in Mozambique. Methods: 720 individuals of both sexes, aged more than 17 years living in provisional settlement for displaced population and returned refugees in Moatize, Tete Province (Northeastern Mozambique), were tested in mid 1987 for HIV 1 antibodies by ELISA (Virosnostika) and Western Blot (Bio-Rad). Data regarding age, sex, marital status, previous residence in Mozambique, neighbouring countries and time abroad were collected. Results were compared with those obtained at the same time in population groups less affected by war. Results: An overall HIV-1 seroprevalence of 2,9% was found. This figure is higher than that found in 5320 samples studied from less afflicted populations (lower than 1%).The impact of population movements and disruption of families and social structures induced by war is discussed. Conclusions:Demographic and social disturbances created by war in Mozambique's rural areas (1.5 million displaced people and 350 000 refugees) could be an enhancement factor for HIV infection spreading. Further monitoring of epidemiological situation and a special effort on AIDS education should be done in those populations. 5152 PROJECT FOR TRAININI SEMINARS ON AIDS FOR AFRICAN Guinea *I* Special Program on AIDS, WHO, Geneve Objectives: The World Health Organization and the Health Ministeries of African Countries (Guinea. delegated M6decins du Monde, non governmental organization, to undertake the training of high-level medical personnal who will then shoulder the responsability of all AIDS related problems in their respective countries. Methods: the first series of seminars took place in Guinea in Decmber 1987. For one week in Conakry, 80 participants gathered for a variety of lectures and workshops on the following topics:natural history of the HIV infection in the world, epidemiology, virology, clinical management and therapeutic. diagnostic methods, methods of prevention in Blood Banks. prevention strategies, assuming medical responsibility for those who are HIV-positive. Comments: the results of our first training seminar in Guinea has shown us that: 1 High level medical personnel expressed an urgent need for information and training on all aspects of AIDS virus. 21 A need for information and training that would be adapted to the epidemiological sanitary and cultural realities of each African country. 31 The importance for participants in the seminar to pass on information to their paramedical staff and to take part in the preventive strategies dictated by the National AIDS Committee. Conclusion: This series of lectures responded to a preliminary need for training and will be followed by a study to evaluate the impact and benefits of such a program. 352 [Page 353](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/351) 5153 AIDS EDUCATION of Obst&Gyn, Karlskrona and ***ARO, Stockholm, Sweden. Objective. To initiate an AIDS education programme by training health workers. Methods. In Nov.87 the national medical conference, open to all health workers, spent one day on AIDS. Directly after the conference 2 three-day seminars on HIV/AIDS, other STDs, pedagogic methods and campaign plans were held for 2x35 congress participants, representing all provinces. During Jan 88 to April 88 5-day seminars were held in the country's 10 provinces, each with the same contents as the national ones. Results. Over 4oo00 health professionals in strategic positions were trained to independently or in groups initiate HIV/AIDS education in health care network, in schools, armed forces, factories, villages and citizen's organizations. Conclusion. Difficulties and feasibility of rapid training of health workers for AIDS Education Programme will be described.

To assess the efficiency of partner notification as a means to modify behavior and thus prevent further HIV transmission. Methods. As part of a heterosexual partners' study, we provided education and counseling about safe sex practices. Participants were evaluated 6 months to a year later. Results. Blood samples have been tested for over 60 initially seronegative female partners with no documented HIV seroconversion. Interview data are available for 17 of these women and their male partners. In addition, three couples who were HIV(+) concordant were interviewed as well. Fourteen are now having sexual intercourse less frequently but three of these couples are not practicing safer sex (including one concordant pair). Ten of these 14 couples are now always using condoms, although one couple reports only occasional use. Six couples report the same frequency of sexual activities (including the two concordant pairs) and three of these six couples report consistent condom use. Six of the twenty couples practiced anal intercourse at entry into the study; now none reports this practice. No pregnancies were reported by any couples. Conclusion. Partner referral remains an effective vehicle for behavior modification. In the absence of treatment, partners can be counseled and educated about HIV risk reduction. 6002 EVALUATION OF HETEROSEXUAL CONTACT TRACING OF PARTNERS OF AIDS PATIENTS. Jean San Francisco, CA, **Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA. Objective. To evaluate contact tracing of heterosexual sex partners of AIDS patients as a means of limiting sexual and perinatal HIV transmission. Methods. We identified bisexual and heterosexual AIDS patients reported in San Francisco (SF) from March 1985 through June 1987 and interviewed them regarding their opposite-sex partners since 1979. With the patients' consent, we contacted, confidentially interviewed, and offered risk-reduction education and HIV testing to all identified partners living in San Francisco. Results. Of the 2470 AIDS patients reported in SF in this period, we identified 210 (9%) eligible patients, and to date have investigated 145. Of these 145, 51 (35%) were interviewed and named 135 opposite-sex sex partners. 8 (6%) refused interview; 86 (59%) had died, moved out of SF, or were unlocatable. We interviewed 59 (44%) of the 135 partners; 9 (7%) refused interview, and 64 (47%) lived outside SF or were unlocatable. We tested 32 (54%) for HIV antibody; 7 (22%) were seropositive. Estimated costs for the program were $261/partner interviewed, $482/partner tested, and $2203/seropositive partner identified. Conclusion. Loss to follow-up rates were high due to the long incubation periods of HIV and the mobility of the population, but rates of refusal were low, indicating a high rate of acceptance of the program. While this program is relatively more expensive than more widely targeted AIDS prevention and education programs, its ability to target women at highest risk makes it potentially costeffective for prevention of perinatal transmission. Notes: 6 03 A Modified System of Contact Tracing for HIV Seropositives - A Year's Results Michael L. Rekart, Ministry of Health, British Columbia, Canada Objective. To report the results of a modified system of voluntary contact tracing used in British Columbia, Canada. Methods. A standardized form is attached to each positive laboratory HIV result to provide the positive patient an opportunity to anonymously submit contact information to public health for tracing. Results. In the first six (6) months of implementation, eighteen (18) contacts were notified through this modified system of possible HIV exposure. Several of these did not know that they were at risk for HIV infection. Conclusion. There may be sexual/blood contacts whom an HIV infected person wishes to be notified but will not himself notify due to inability, fear or embarrassment. A modified system of voluntary contact tracing can be effective in reaching such HIV contacts and should be considered as a adjunct to simple contact tracing (patient notifying his own contacts) where this latter system is the major strategy for contact notification. 6004 CASE CONTACT TRACING AND TESTING IN HIV INFECTION: Jan Emil Kristoffersen Dept.of AIDS prevention,Oslo Board of Health, Oslo,Norway. Objective: From april 1986 the dept. has systematically collected data on case contacts to HIV antibody positive patients,traced by cooperation and consent from the index patient. The effectiveness of this work is evaluated. Methods: All new HIV antibody positive patients are thoroughly and repeatedly examined as to whom they have shared risk behaviour with,and are encouraged to notify their contacts,or let us do it, thus keeping the identity of the indexpatient hidden to contacts. (Norwegian Law does not demand mandatory case contact testing) Results: 147 index patients i~eptte@ a total of 190 identifiable case contacts. 157 of these contacts Lare known to have been HIV antibody tested, of whom thet majority as a direct result of case contact tracing. 76 contacts tested negative, and 79 contacts tested positive.The index patients and case contacts are further characterized as to distribution of sex, risk behaviour, and age.Two cases are discussed in detail. Conclusion: The 79 HIV antibody positive patients equals to 15 % of all known HIV antibody positive patients in Norway.Case contact tracing based on cooperation and nonmandatory testing is a valuable tool when searching for HIV antibody positive individuals in groups at high risk. 354 [Page 355](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/353) 6005 CONTACT Aim of the study: To find out the prevalence of HIV in regular and nonregular sexual partners to HIV-infected patients. Method: We have interviewed 67 HIV-infected patients regarding sexual contacts from the assumed time of their infection. We want to point out the special technique in the interview with the HIV-infected patient and how to motivate the contacts to attend for an examination. Result: The 67 indexpatients ( 63 males and 4 females) named 101 contacts. All of them were tested at least six months after the last possible transmission episode. 8/20 male regular partners and 7/66 male nonregular partners of 57 male indexpatients were HIV test positive. 0/3 female regular partners and 0/6 female nonregular partners of 6 male indexpatients were HIV test positive. 0/1 male regular partner and 2/5 male nonregular partner of the 4 HIV-infected female indexpatients were HIV test positive. 17/101 patients, contacts of the indexcases, were found HIV test positive. 8/17 were diagnosed HIV test positive through contact tracing. 9/17 were already under medical care for HIV-infection or AIDS. Concidering the high number of HIV-infected found among named sexual partners, contact tracing is a valuable tool in the control of HIV-infection. 6006 CONTACT TRACING IN A COUNTRY WITH LOW HIV-PREVALENCE Knut Lidman, B Lundstr6m, G RAdo, A Norgren, Pettersson, B Skoldenberg Department of infectious diseases, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Objective. In a country with low prevalence for HIV like Sweden, where on average only 0,4% of the HIV-tests performed (blood donors 0,0013%) have been HIV-positive, contact tracing could be a mean to increase the number of HIV-positive patients found. Methods. Every HIV-positive patient was asked about their previous sexual contacts and possible sharing of needles. This is done in the context of psychosocial support of the patient. The contacts traced were encouraged to take the test. Results. When this is written 148 contacts of 161 HIV-positive patients (49 hs/bs men, 62 i.v. drug abusers, 31 infected by blood transfusion, 16 by heterosexual contact and 3 of unknown cause) have been tested. At least 5 (3%) were previously unknown to be HIV-positive. Conclusion. Contact tracing could be a method to increase the number of positives out of the number of tests performed. Notes: 6007 REASONS FOR SEEKING HIV TESTING; RESULTS FROM A SWEDISH ANONYMOUS QUESTIONNAIRE. R Olin, J Giesecke, J Hallqvist, M Lagergren, K Lidman. Karolinska Institute, S-104 01 Stockholm, Sweden. From mid-September to mid-November 1987 an anonymous questionnaire was distributed to all individuals seeking for HIV testing and counselling at 25 hospitals and GP's in Sweden. The purpose of the survey was to ascertain the reasons for seeking testing and to evaluate the effect of information campaigns. The testing sites were chosen from three major cities, which together already account for 90% of the known HIV cases in Sweden, and from a few smaller communities. During the study period 6549 persons were tested at these sites, 3846 (59%) completed the questionnaire. 38 patients were found seropositive at the 25 sites. The response rate was higher than the figures indicate, since for logistic reasons not all tested received the form. Analysis of response patterns from sites with low and high response rates fails to reveal any systematic differences. Some findings were: 1. The age distribution of responders closely corresponds to the known age distribution of HIV infected persons in Sweden. 2. The sexes were equally represented. 3. 23% had tested for HIV before. 4. 83% state fear of sexual exposure as a reason for testning; 4% of the women and 25% of the men through homosexual contact. 5. 4% indicate sharing of needles and 4% blood transfusion as reason. 6. Anonymity precludes comparison of self-perceived risk of HIV infection to actual result of testing. On group basis, however, our preliminary data indicates that women overestimate their risk of being infected, heterosexual men adequately assess their risk, and homosexual men may underestimate this risk. Final results will be available at the Conference. 6008 A standardize Training Curriculun and Caswll, B.S. New Jersey State Department of Health, Trenton, New Jersey,LMA. HIV antibody testing and couseling has evolved into an effective educational tool enabling irdividuals to modify beaviors that facilitate the transission of HIV. The lack of appropriately trained couselors is acrrently the major factor preventing the rapid expansicn of counseling and testing services. To meet this urgent training reed, the New Jersey State Departent of Health has developed a carTr iensi e thirty-xur training curriculun, the goal of thich is to certify participants as HIV Antibody Conselors. Training modules address the natural history of HIV infection, its tran issicn and notificaticn. Seializd dealing with grief and loss, assesment of suicidal ideation, ard resource assessment supplremnt the basic core olrriculun. Material is presented using a cmt ticn of dictatic sessions, role plays and other activities, group discussions, and veiwing and processing of video tapes.

KH Fife, RB Jones, DG Marrero, BP Katz, RT Serpe, and J Scott. Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. Objective: To study the effect of a negative HIV antibody test on sexual behavior. Methods: Gay men attending an HIV antibody testing and counseling facility were surveyed. Among the >2,500 individuals tested, HIV negative men who continued to be sexually active were encouraged to return quarterly for repeat HIV testing and completion of another questionnaire. Results: A comparison of survey responses at the first and second visits is summarized below: Behavior 1st Visit 2nd Visit P-value # Partners last month 2.1 1.6.012 # Casual part.last month 1.3 0.9.038 # Partners past year 12.1 8.7.005 # Casual part.past year 11.2 7.8.0003 Receptive anal sex <.0001 Conclusions: This group of gay men did not increase sexual activity upon learning they were HIV negative but they also did not modify specific high-risk sexual practices. They may be attempting to protect themselves by reducing casual partners, ascertaining antibody status of partners, and using condoms. More emphasis should be placed on educational strategies which discourage high risk sexual practices. 6010 ALTERNATIVE HIV-ANTI-BODY TESTING SITE IN FRANCE J. LEBAS, H. BLANCHARD, C. FOUCAULT. C. KATLANA.F.AEBERHARD, B. MASSE: MEDECINS DU MONDE. PARIS, FRANCE Voluntary HIV anti-body testing, in an official or governmental context in France, poses a number of difficulties of a psycho-social and ethical nature, namely the non-protection of anonymity and the subsequent risk of identification about the sexual practices and drug use of individuals. As a result, M6decins du Monde. a private, non-profit, non-governmental organization decided in September. 1987, to open the first anonymous HIV-testing center in France. The center is open to the public one day a week, at which time a staff of volunteer physicians, psychologists and nurses, counsel patients and test them for HIVI and HIV2 by Elisa Kits, followed by a confirmation by Western Blot. All patients are asked to fill out an optional anonymousquestionnaire which has provided us with the following data: - Since September 1987, 990 individuals have been tested of which 8.6 % were HIV-positive.

Only 14.8 % used our testing facility because of the exemption from charge. The remaining individuals were drawn particularly by the anonymity that the center offers. 36 % of these individuals, as a result of our counselling, now engage in safer sex, which leads us to believe that these types of centers are indispensable for the containment of the AIDS epidemic. Notes: 6011 Anonymous vs Confidential Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Testing: Results of a Trial in Oregon. 6012 CHANGE IN ACCEPTANCE RATE FOR HIV TESTING WHEN AIDS IS NOTIFIABLE ---an attempt Control 20regon State Health Division 3Multnomah County Health Department. Objective. From August 1986 to March 1987, a trial was conducted in Oregon to determine whether the availability of anonymous HIV counseling and testing draws clients who would not otherwise seek services. Methods. Before December 2, 1986, all public HIV testing was confidential (named). Demographic and risk factor information for all clients was collected. Beginning in December, clients were offered the option of either anonymous or confidential services. A supplemental questionnaire was administered to all clients. Results. Questionnaire responses indicated that the availability of anonymity resulted in an increase in demand for testing of 125% for homosexual men, 56% for female prostitutes, 17% for IV drug users, and 32% for other clients. The number of homosexual clients tested per month increased in a step-wise fashion from a mean of 42 during the 4 months before the trial to 108 during the 4 months after (P=O.003). During the same time, the number of homosexual clients tested did not increase at public sites in Colorado or California or private sites in Oregon. The number of seropositive persons identified during the 3.5 months after anonymity became available doubled from the 3.5 months before. The average time that homosexual men drawn by anonymity reported that they waited between deciding that they wanted testing and being tested dropped from 12 months in December to 5 months in February (P=O.O01). Conclusion. The availability of anonymous HIV counseling and testing preferentially drew homosexual men, the population currently at highest risk for infection in Oregon. Gen Ohi, T Hasegawa, W Hirano, H Terao, N Urano, I Kai, Y Kobayashi Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo Japan Objective: To estimate possible change in acceptance rate for HIV testing when notification of AIDS is legislated. Method: Students at medical school (57), nursing school (144), and training school for laboratory technician (96) were asked to fill a questionnaire concerning the following choices: 1) if one would come forward for HIV testing in case notification of carrier is compulsory and 2) if one would take the testing in case a private medical institute which does not comply with the rule of notification is available. In both cases underlying assumption is that one has had sexual contacts recently which might transmit HIV. Result: Response rate was 100%. In each group more than 90% replied that they would take the testing. However, 16-39% of them opted to go to the private institute which would not notify. Medical students showed the strongest aversion (39%). Conclusion: Under the stated setting, notification could drive a sizable fragment of potential HIV carrier \"underground\". 356 [Page 357](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/355) 6013 HIV EPIDEMIOLOGY IN SWEDEN.. ilargareta Bttiger, National Bacteriological Laboratory. Objective: To study the HIV epidemic in Sweden Methods. Analysis of reports of HIV-testings and HIV-seropositive individuals. Results. Up to Dec. 31st 1987 1701 HIV infected persons were reported, 159 of whom fulfilled the criteria of AIDS. After the first intensive testings in 1984 and 1985 of persons at increased risk 900 HIV positive persons out of 36 000 tests were reported from the laboratories. In 1986 the number of positive findings amounted to 580 out of 80 000 tests and 1987 preliminary figures are 400 out of 300 000 tests (double reporting occurs).To this can be added 1350 000 tests from estimated 350 000 blood donors among whom 18 seropositive persons were disclosed. In Nov. 1985 a legislation was introduced making it mandatory to report all HIV-infected persons diagnosed. During the first 8 months the majority of all diagnosed persons since '1985 were reported. The number of persons reported from physicians per month since August 1986 was rather similar i.e. 15 homosexual men, 5-10 i.v. drug users and 10-15 others per month irrespective of number of tests reported. Screening studies of 40 000 pregnant women disclosed 3 seropositive all with high risk for exposure. Ninety-two Swedes were reported to be infected by heterosexual contact. In 1987 the number of HIV infected persons known is about 11 times higher than the reported AIDS cases. 6014 IMPLEVNIATICN OF NATICNL HIV SURVEILLNCE Bruce M. Whyte, C.E. Swanson, David A. Cooper. NIfvRC AIDS Epidemiology Unit, Sydney, Australia. Objectives: To determine the incidence and prevalence of HIV infection and to monitor its spread in Australia. Methods: Infection with HIV is not uniformly notifiable in Australia. For quality control, 29 laboratories (excluding blood banks) are licensed to test for HIV antibody. A purpose-designed (PD) HIV antibody request form on which data was sought on age, sex, area of residence, risk activity for infection and clinical status was piloted in April 1987 for 3 months and was irrplerented subsequently, on a non-crompulsory basis in one Sydney laboratory. The data obtained in May 1987 and Novermber 1987 on this form were crompared to those obtained frcm a standard laboratory request form. Results: During the pilot program, 1% of tests were requested on the PD form; comrrplete surveillance data were obtained on 90% of the PD forms ccrpared with 1% of the standard forms. In Noverber 1987, 55% of requests were received on the PD forms and 60% contained ccrplete data. Requests containing data (%): May 87 November 87 PD(n=256) Std(n=3917) PD(n=1371) Std(n=1134) age 96 66 79 4 sex 93 84 97 94 risk 88 29 76 42 status 80 1 61 3 Conclusion: A PD HIV antibody request form obtains suitable data for laboratory-based surveillance of HIV infection. A PD form is now being irrplerrmented in all laboratories to obtain national surveillance data. Notes: 6015 U.S. Sentinel Hospital Surveillance Network: Results of the First 20 Months Timothy J Dondero*, K Rauch*, GA Storch**, L Crane**, M Proffitt,** ML Collinge**, C White*, *Centers for Disease Control Atlanta, GA USA, **National Sentinel Hospital Working Group. Objective. To monitor levels and trends of HIV infection in the general U.S. population through a sentinel hospital surveillance system. Methods. To avoid the uninterpretable biases resulting from a study of volunteers, anonymous HIV serologic testing is conducted on blood routinely collected at medical facilities. Four hospitals began the pilot phase of the system in 1986 and 4 more joined in 1987; a total of 40 is scheduled to participate in 1988, located throughout the country. Blood from persons not currently being treated for AIDS-related conditions is selected, with oversampling of young adults and children. Only demographic information is retained. Specimens are tested by ELISA, followed by Western blot. Results. Of the first 11,000 specimens tested, the overall seroprevalence was 3.0 per 1000. (The age- and sex adjusted rate for military applicants from the same cities as th sentinel hospitals is 1.1 per 1000.) Prevalence rates per 1000 at individual hospitals range from 1.2 to 7.6. Rates vary by age (seropositives concentrated in persons 20-45 years of age and in the very young); sex (3.2 male: 1 female); and race and ethnicity (3.4 black and Hispanic: 1 white). Data are not yet sufficient to evaluate infection trends over time. Conclusion. This sentinel surveillance network will enable health authorities to monitor over time national and regional levels and trends of HIV infection in the U.S. population. 6016 NATIONAL SENTINEL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM FOR HIV INFECTION Marguerite Pappaioanou, T Dondero, J Curran, C Schable, M Morgan Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To monitor the levels and trends of HIV infection locally and nationally through a coordinated network of sentinel subgroups from the U.S. population. Methods. Thirty standard meteropolitan statistical areas (SMSAs) throughout the United States were selected based on rank order of incidence of AIDS, gonorrhea, and syphilis and on geographic representativeness. In each SMSA, blood collected from all newborn infants; serum specimens from selected hospital admissions; and patients attending selected clinics for sexually transmitted diseases, drug treatment, tuberculosis, or women's health are tested for HIV antibodies. Surveys, conducted at least annually, are blind d (test for HIV conducted anonymously on blood drawn for other reasons) to obtain unbiased estimates of seroprevalence or are nonblinded, with interviews, to obtain detailed information on risk behaviors. Standardized criteria and sampling methods for patient selection, HIV testing procedures, and reporting of laboratory results are required for comparablility and reliablity of data. Results. Annually, beginning in 1988, at least 187,100 patients will be tested in blinded, and 27,900 in nonblinded, surveys in over 420 clinics; 144,000 specimens from AO hospitals and 800,000 neonatal blood specimens will be tested in blinded surveys. Conclusion. These surveillance data will be used to monitor the extent of HIV infection in the United States, target risk reduction programs and assess the impact of these programs on reducing transmission. 357 [Page 358](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/356) 6017 HIV TESTING: TRENDS IN PATIENTS OF J-B BRUNET+, A-J VALLERON* * INSERM U263, + D G S, MINISTERE DES AFFAIRES SOCIALES, PARIS, FRANCE Objective. To evaluate the request of HIV antibody testing by general practitioners (GP) and / or their patients. Methods. A survey was set up on the French Communicable Diseases Network in Mars 1987. This network links 480 sentinel GPs representative of French GPs by electronic mail to a central computer. GPs report all prescriptions made for HIV antibody testing and provide for each case: person requesting test (patient or GP), reason for request, age and sex of patient, result and method(s) used for the test. Results. The ten month survey shows on 917 HIV tests a sex-ratio of 1.1:1 for patients. 14 % of men were homosexuals. In heterosexual men, main reasons for test were prenuptial test (17%), IV drug use (11%), presence of STD (10%). In women main reasons were prenatal test (20%), prenuptial test (17%), sexual partner at risk (7%). No seropositivity was found in non-risk-group patients. 11 % of homosexual men and 34 % of IV drug users were seropositive. The sex-ratio was 1:1 for seropositive patients when homosexual men were excluded. Among sexual partner of seropositive or high risk subjects, one out of five men and 10 out of 39 women, were seropositive. Conclusion. The general population has been sensitized to the risk of AIDS, as demonstrated by the high percentage of subjects outside classical risk groups (> 70%), and, up to now, all seropositve patients were found in classical risk groups. 6018 RESULTS FROM ROUTINE Virology2and Dermato-Venereology3, Hospital, Sweden In Sweden large scale volontary HIV-testing and counselling has been advocated as one way to combat the HIVepidemic. In Stockholm county the incidence of HIV-infection has been found to be about 0,02% among blood donors and 0,04% (3/7708) among pregnant women. Since last fall routine volontary pre-operative HIV-testing has been started in some of the surgical departments as a security measure for the hospital staff. Methods: Analysis for HIV-antibodies (Wellcozyme antiHTLVIII,Wellcome foundation Ltd) were performed in preoperative blood samples from patients treated in the Depts. of Surgery,Urology,Neurosurgery,Thoracic surgery and E.N.T. at the Karolinska Hospital during 4 months (6 months for the E.N.T. dept.). To our knowledge,only 1 patient declined testing. Results:A total of 2275 patients agreed to be tested, 1353 males and 922 females in ages between 5-91 years (further demographic data will be presented). One patient (0,04%) was HIV-positive. This was a homosexual man, not previously tested, who had not disclosed that he could be at risk for HIV-infection. Conclusion: In a material of surgical patients less than 1/2000 was HIV-positive. This shows that the HIV prevalence in the general population in Sweden is still quite low and fails to show any spread outside established risk groups. Routine pre-operative HIV-testing may have an epidemiological importance, but has to be further evaluated as a safety precaution for the hospital staff. Notes: 6019 AIDS SCREENING: WHO IS Lo, **S Meacham, *N Milliken, * Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.,**UC Berkeley/UC San Francisco Joint Medical Program. Objective. To determine how women targeted for HIV screening might respond to proposals for mandatory testing and public health reporting of seropositive individuals. Methods. We administered anonymous questionnaires to consecutive women seeking care at a university based ObstetricsGynecology practice in San Francisco during August 1987. 377 women (84.5%) responded. Results. Over 90% approved of discussing HIV testing at visits for prenatal care (PC) or venereal diseases (VD). Over 86% would agree to confidential HIV testing if medically recommended. However, if seropositive persons were reported to public health officials, only 55% would agree to recommended HIV testing. Stronger public health measures would deter some women from seeking medical care. If HIV testing were mandatory but confidential, 12% would forego VD testing, and 10% would forego PC to avoid being tested. If HIV testing were mandatory and seropositive individuals were reported to public health officials, 27% would forego VD testing, and 19% would forego PC. Women with high HIV risk or without live-in sexual partners were significantly more likely to forego care for VD testing by multivariate analysis. Age, race, education, pregnancy status, and type of health insurance were not significantly associated with refusal of care under such testing conditions. Conclusion. Our findings suggest well-intentioned proposals for mandatory HIV testing or for public health reporting of seropositive persons may discourage women from seeking needed medical care, and decrease the opportunity to educate women about HIV transmission and prevention. 6020 THE IMPACT OF MANDATORY REPORTING OF HIV SEROPOSITIVE PERSONS IN SOUTH CAROLINA Wayne D Johnson, Francisco S Sy, KL Jackson University of South Carolina School of Public Health, Columbia SC, USA 29208 Objective. To characterize changes in attendance at an alternate HIV test site in Charleston, SC, after implementation of a statewide policy effective Feb 17, 1986, which requires that the name and address of persons found seropositive in any public or private setting be reported to the state health department. Methods. Demographics including age, sex, race, and risk behavior were gathered on 990 clients at the alternate test site in the first 24 months of testing from May 1985 to May 1987. Poisson analysis was used to describe changes in the monthly rate of attendance by each demographic and risk behavior group and by HIV antibody status. Results. The rate of monthly attendance by men reporting homosexual activity decreased by 51%. Attendance by persons with HIV antibody positive results decreased by 43%. Blood transfusion recipients and persons reporting no known risk contributed to an overall increase in clinic attendance of 8%. Conclusion. The current policy of mandatory reporting of HIV seropositive persons in South Carolina is associated with a decrease in attendance for testing and counselling by individuals most at risk for exposure to HIV. 358 [Page 359](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/357) 6021 EFFECTIVENESS OF VOLUNTARY TESTING IN REACHING HIV INFECTED PERSONS ATTENDING AND STD CLINIC Harry F Hull*, M Gallaher**, C Bettinger*, N Keller*, J Wilson*, G Mertz*** * New Mexico Health and Environment Dept, **Div Field Services, HPO Centers for Disease Control,**University of New Mexico School of Medicine Objective. To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for HIV infection among patients refusing voluntary HIV testing in a sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic. Methods. All patients attending an STD clinic were offered voluntary, anonymous HIV antibody testing and counselling. A blinded survey of refusers was conducted using blood collected for syphilis serology. Results. Between March 1 and May 31, 1987, 1134 (82%) patients accepted HIV testing and counseling and 255 (18%) refused. There were no differences in age or sexual preference between those accepting and refusing testing. Blacks refused testing at a higher rate than other ethnic groups. (Relative risk (RR)=4.4) Serum specimens were located and tested for 234 (93%) of patients who refused testing. 8 (0.7%) of those accepting testing were HIV positive compared to 9 (3.8%) of those refusing. (RR=5.4) All HIV infected were male. Men who refused testing were 5.4 times more likely to be infected than men who accepted testing. Male homosexuals and black and Hispanic males who refused testing were respectively 7.5 and 8.8 times more likely to be HIV infected than were their counterparts who accepted testing. Conclusions. Male STD patients, especially homosexual and minority males, who refuse HIV testing are at high risk of being HIV infected. Males who refuse HIV testing should be counseled regarding HIV. 6022 HIV TESTING AND COUNSELING ACTIVITY IN COLORADO,EFFECTS OF REPORTING RESULTS BY NAME Franklyn N. Judson*, FC Wolf**, DL Cohn* *Denver Public Health, **Colorado Department of Health Objective. To evaluate trends in HIV testing and counseling in Colorado (CO) vis-a-vis passage of legislated, confidential reporting of test results by name. Methods. Denver Public Health (DPH) testing activity was analyzed by sexual preference, July, 1985-December 1987. HIV reporting laws were debated and passed during the 4th quarter of 1985 and the 2nd quarter of 1987. HIV tests/100,000 population/month were compared for CO and California (CA), which requires anonymous testing only Results. No. tested (% positive) at DPH Period Gay Men(GM) Heterosexuals(HS) Total 1985 Jul-Dec 1,140 (30) 877 (2) 2197 (17) 1986 Jan-Jun 732 (34) 644 (2) 1436 (17) Jul-Dec 698 (27) 826 (1) Jul-Dec 795 (27) 3995 (1) 4790 ( 5) Testing of GM surged early then leveled out for 2 years, while testing of HS increased greatly after December 1986. Secular trend curves for testing activity in CO and CA are virtually superimposable with CO consistently testing 20% to 40% more/100,000/month (data not shown). Conclusions. Seroprevalence rates for GM and HS have remained constant for 2 1/2 years. There is no evidence that CO laws requiring confidential reporting of HIV results by name keep GM from being tested. The reasons why GM do or do not choose to be tested remain poorly understood but we estimate that more than 1/2 of Denver GM at risk of HIV have been tested.

Patricia E. Evans, JL Barnhart, GW Rutherford, M Herring, T Mosmiller, A Stern, R Rowell, A Back, D Werdegar; Department of Public Health, San Francisco, CA, USA. Objective. To evaluate HIV seroprevalence and demographic treads in San Francisco HIV counseling and testing programs. Methods. We reviewed serologic results and demographic data for clients attending anonymous HIV testing clinics between July 1985 and December 1987, comparing clients seen in June 1986 and earlier with those seen in July 1986 and later. Results. Of the 25,265 clients seen during the study period, 20% were HIV-seropositive; 26% of clients seen before July 1986 were seropositive as opposed to 16% of those seen after July 1986 (pv.001). The proportion of women increased from 11% to 26% (pt.001) during this period as well as the proportion of clients classifying themselves as heterosexuals with multiple sexual partners (12% LJune 1986 vs. 31% >July 1986, p.001). Additionally the proportion of clients classifying themselves as homosexual and bisexual men decreased from 77% to 54% (p<.001). There were no significant changes by age group or race/ethnicity. Conclusions. We conclude that San Francisco HIV counseling and testing clients seen in July 1986 and later are more likely to be heterosexuals with multiple sexual partners, females, and seronegative, reflecting increased utilization of the program by populations at lower risk of HIV infection. 6026 AIDS INFORMATION AND SUPPORT CENTERS (AISC) AS AN EFFECTIVE MEFNS FOR SEROEPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE FOR HIV IN A LOW PREVALENCE POPULATION. M-L Kantanen*, K Cantell*, O Lithen**, P Leinikki* * National Public Health Institute and ** Finnish AIDS Information and Support Center, Helsinki, Finland. In low prevalence populations like Finland effective seroepidemiological surveillance of HIV may be hampered by problems related to acquisition of voluntary blood samples from high risk individuals. Free tests for HIV are offered to anyone through the primary health care center system in Finland. AISC:s have been established in larger cities to provide psychological support and medical advice to those who regard themselves at risk for HIV and have proven more effective in providing positive samples than the primary health care system. The total anonymity in testing decreases the fears of being recognized as a risk behaviourer. Such fears may be substantial particularly in small communities. Also the supportive attitude probably encourages individuals to HIV-testing. During a period from October 1986 - December 1987 a total of 2373 samples were tested, from them 8 were positive. At the same period 40100 samples were tested from primary health care centers with 21 positive cases. The incidence of positivity for AISC-samples, 3.4 per 1000 is significantly higher than for health care center samples, 0.52 per 1000, demonstrating that AISC:s are useful for sample collection for seroepidemiological surveillance. Notes: 6027 HV Antibody Testing and Behavioral Risk Status: Do Women Perceived at Higher Risk Get Tested? S.O. Aral, L. Magder, and G.S. Bowen Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A. Objective: To evaluate whether available testing services are utilized adequately and appropriately by reproductive age women. Method: We analyzed responses to a self administered questionnaire from all 16,631 consecutive clients attending Pennsylvania family planning clinics, over an eight week period in the fall of 1987. Results: The overall response rate was 99 percent; item specific rates ranged between 95 and 99 percent. Four percent of all respondents reported that they had been tested for HIV antibodies. Compared to women who reported no risk behaviors, women who engaged in any of them were generally three times as likely to have been tested for HIV antibodies (p <.05): 3.7 percent of women with no risk factors; 11 percent of women who had received a blood transfusion between 1980 and 1985; 14 percent of those who had used intravenous drugs; and similarly higher proportions of those who had sexual intercourse with a bisexual (16 percent), intravenous drug user (10 percent), hemnophiliac (12 percent) or a person infected with HIV (40 percent). Women with a history of sexually transmitted disease (6 percent); women who had more than 9 sex partners over the past 5 years (8 percent); and women who had more than 1 partner over the past year (5 percent) also reported having had an HIV test significantly more often. Proportions tested increased significantly with age and education, and were higher among blacks and hispanics compared to whites; these trends remained significant after adjustment for risk status. Conclusion: Although rates of HIV antibody testing increased with self-reported risk, a great majority (85%) of high-risk women have not been tested. 6028 PSYCHO-SOCIAL FACTORS AND BEHAVIOR: MEASUREMENT AND DETERMINANTS *University Massachusetts/Amherst, Community Health Center, Boston, and Brown Univ., Providence, RI. Objective. To address the measurement and data reduction procedures of selected psycho-social constructs and to investigate the personal, social, and health services/ information factors related to AIDS protective behavior among asymptomatic homosexual/bisexual men. Methods. An integrated theoretical model explored predictors of sexual and preventive behaviors. Data were collected using a self-administered survey in a community health center. Principle factor analysis with varimax rotation was used to define scales and determine items. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to find the key determinants of several protective sexual behaviors. Results. Factor analysis demonstrated reasonable support for the theoretical model. Scales of perceived susceptibility, barriers to condom use, HIV test opinion, selfefficacy, change barrier, treatment efficacy and beliefs of social network members had highest alpha scores. Data analyses suggests that lower perceived susceptibility, higher educational levels, low levels of impairment due to alcohol or drugs during sex and higher perceived selfefficacy were significantly associated with lower numbers of sexual partners. Conclusion. It is important from the criteria of predictive power, parsimony, and specificity to complete rigorous analysis on items/scales. This provides valid analysis of behavior differences, which in turn provide better guidance for intervention programlplanaing. 360 [Page 361](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/359) 6029 SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ATTITUDES OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN SWITZERLAND - BEFORE THE START OF THE CAMPAIGN \"STOP AIDS\" AND 8 MONTHS LATER P. Zeuqin', Ph. Lehmann2, F. Dubois-Arber2, D. Hausser2 ' IPSO, Institute for Survey and Social Research, ZUrich 2 Univers.cy Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine, Lausanne One group with a high HIV-risk are young people between 17 and 30 years. In this period of life most of them experience their first sexual contacts and try to find a permanent relationship. For this reason the evaluation of the campaign \"STOP-AIDS\" in Switzerland included also a survey on sexual behaviour and attitudes of this group. The information was gathered via two telephone surveys in January and October 1987 (N=2x1200 persons in a representative sample). Telephone interviewing was choosen because of the two following reasons: First to get also information on persons you usually dont find at home - and therefore are of special interest. Secondly to prevent strange and uncontrolled situations while interviewing (i.e. the presence of some listener or an antipathy between interviewer and respondant). With regard to the contents the two main results are the following: 1) The degree of knowledge about AIDS and the methods of effective protection from a infection with the HIV-virus is very high and still growing. 2) The use of condoms on occasional sexual contacts increased from 33 % in January 1987 to 62 % in October 1987. 6030 BEHAVIORAL CHANGES AMONG FRENCH GAY MEN 1985 TO 1987 M. Pollak, M A Schiltz, CNRS, Paris, France Our annual nationwide survey (sample size 1200) shows a considerable increase in safer sex among gay men. Changes are gradual, start with a reduction in numbers of partners, before giving up anal intercourse and/or using condoms. 1985 1986 1987 Reduction in partner nbs. 29% 29% 94% 12% 11% 28% 18% 13% Important variations remain between social classes, residence and age. Urban intellectual middle class is most rapid in adapting to this health risk. To maintain safer sex practices over a longer time period poses major problems. Rapid adaption to the risk of infection and regularity in safer sex practices are favored by: - experience with medical authorities and past STD surveillance; - social acceptance of homosexuality; - personal knowledge of HIV infected persons. Notes: 6031 THE PREVALENCE OF HIGH RISK SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AMONG HETEROSEXUAL AND HOMOSEXUAL \"PICK UP\" BAR PATRONS IN SAN FRANCISCO R. Stall* and L. McKusick* *Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, San Francisco Objective. The intersections between alcohol and drug use during sexual contact and high risk sexual behavior for HIV transmission are well established. Persons who patronize \"pick up\" or \"singles\" bars may therefore be a group that contains a comparatively high proportion of persons who continue to practice unsafe sexual activity. This paper compares the prevalence of high risk sexual behaviors between heterosexual men and women and homosexual men who patronize \"pick up\" bars in San Francisco. The correlates of high risk behavior will also be compared between these three samples of bar patrons. Methods. Patrons of will-known heterosexual and homosexual pick up bars in San Francisco were handed questionnaires as they left such bars during three subsequent weekend nights during August, 1987. 4500 questionnaires were handed out, 1500 each for heterosexual men and women and homosexual men. The return rates were 21% (heterosexual men), 29% (heterosexual women) and 39% (homosexual men), for a total n=1338. Results. Prevalence of specific high risk sexual behaviors will be described for each of these groups, correlates of high risk sexual behavior will be compared across each of these groups. Conclusion. \"Pick up\" bar patrons represent a group among whom: significant numbers of persons continue to practice unsafe sex. The geographic concentration of these patrons make such bars possible foci for innovative prevention activities. 6032 EC SEXUAL BHAVIR TO SREDUCE AIDS RISK Dan S Berry*, B Rapkin** *Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, **New York University Objective Precautionary sexual behavior may be the only way to reduce initial infection with HIV. Prevention efforts require a clear understanding of social and psychological factors that lead to sexual adaptation. Methods. A sanple of 140 healthy gay men and 110 gay men diagnosed with ARC or AIDS participated in a study of psychological distress and precautionary sexual behavior. Results.lhese groups demonstrated significantly different behavioral repertoires in terms of condom use, partner restrictions and celibacy. The prevalent response among those men with AIDS or ARC was celibacy (53%). I Among asynptcanatic men, taking no precautions was the modal response (37%), although 63% of these men employed a combination of precautionary strategies. Discriminant function analyses were conducted to determine social network and psychological variables that distinguish groups engaging in different patterns of precautionary behavior. Behavioral choices among men with AIDS or ARC were related to partner status during the previous year and guilt over transmission of AIDS. Psychological distress discriminated asynptcmatic men who take some precautions from those who take none. A variety of psychological and network factors discriminated amonr men taking different precautions. Conclusion. Implications for aeveloDinq effective interventions for subgroups of men in the gav and bisexual community. 361 [Page 362](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/360) 6033 RELAPSE PREVENTION AS A PARADIGM METHOD FOR REDUCING COMPULSIVE CASUAL SEXUAL BEHAVIOURS PRESENTING HIGH RISK FOR HIV EXPOSURE. TMG Acton University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London. Objective To describe an intervention for chronic impulsive sexual activity presenting high levels of risk for HIV exposure. Methods Five male subjects reporting a median of 15 years chronic impulsive high-risk sexual activity were assessed, with baseline measures being taken for behavioural and mood states. Presenting symptoms were re-defined in each case. A cognitive-behavioural relapse-prevention programme was implemented over twothree weeks, and supportive monitoring was provided over twelve sessions. Subjects were followed up over three to six months. Results All subjects reported immediate behavioural change and complete remission of anxiety and depressive symptomatology. This change was sustained and consolidated over follow-up. Conclusion This intervention paradigm provides considerable benefit in alleviating distress, and reducing risk of exposure to HIV through impulsive sexual behaviour. 603A THE SEXOLOGY OF AIDS PREVENTION IN CROSS-CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE Andreas Gonzalez del Valle*, C Taylor** *Intituto Familiar de La Raza, Latino AIDS Project, **The Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality Objective. To test effectiveness in Latin America of the Sexual Health Attitude Restructuring Process (SHARP), a U.S. sexological approach to AIDS prevention. Methods SHARP is a sex-positive approach to AIDS prevention using techniques of sex therapy and education developed at The Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco, California. To assess potential cross-cultural effectiveness in Latin American urban settings, the SHARP protocol was tested in Mexico D.F. and Guadalajara, Mexico and Santo Domingo, The Dominican Republic. Presentations included a conference, university classes, a gay disco, community centers and a house of prostitution. Audiences were highly varied in sexual orientation, professional background and social classes. Written and verbal evaluations were made immediately after the process with follow-up interviews to some of the participants. Results. Response to the process was overwhelmingly positive. Participants arrived with less basic sexual knowledge than U.S. counterparts and in high states of anxiety, denial and despair but left eager to reduce risk and experiment with condoms. Conclusion. The SHARP approach is potentially extremely useful for AIDS prevention in Latin America. Traditional health education approaches are not sufficient. People need sexological help in order to make medical advice and devices sexually desirable. Notes: 6035 AIDS EDUCATION: A MIDWESTERN U.S. CITY'S RESPONSE Phair*, M McCarthy*, M Fitzgibbon*, E. Sheridan *Northwestern University Medical School Objective. Evaluation of a community-generated AIDS education program. Methods. Hospitals, medical school and county health department collaborated to present AIDS education for health care workers, educators, and the public. As of 1980, population was 139,712; 12% are Black, 3.4% Hispanic. The greatest population growth in 15 years is in the 55+ age range. The city may be seen as Protestant, Republican and conservative. Hospitals reported approximately 10 AIDS cases. Programs combined slides, panel discussion, question-and-anwser formats. Pre-, post-tests on knowledge and attitudes were analyzed. Results. For 108 health care practitioners who completed questionnaires, knowledge changed in the expected direction regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms in HIV infection (.01), incidence in minorities (.01), fetal transmission (.05), and need for infection precautions (.01). For 56 community leaders, knowledge improved regarding specific transmission routes (8 items;.01). For 43 educators, distinctions between infection and contagion were learned (.01) and risk of transmission via biting minimized (.01). Conclusions. Community-generated AIDS education programs are successful in conveying accurate information and reassurance. Follow-up data are needed to assess retention of knowledge over time. 6036 EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ON AIDS: HOW MUCH DO THE EDUCATORS KNOW? Samuel V. Duh, Texas Department of Health, Austin, Texas. Objective. To compare the basic knowledge on AIDS of Educators (health professionals and news media) and the public. Method. Over a five month period in 1987, I spoke to six groups on AIDS. A pre and post lecture questionnaire was filled out by each audience. A large portion of the lecture was on basic immunology in describing the tranmission of HIV and pathogenesis of AIDS. The questionnaires were analysed by comparing (1) knowledge before and after lecture, (2) knowledge between educators and the general public, (3) correlation between knowledge and attitude towards AIDS. Results. The vast majority of respondents lacked basic knowledge on HIV/AIDS before the lecture. Knowledge increased significantly post lecture. More importantly there was no significant difference in pre and post leci ture knowledge between educators and the public. Attitude towards AIDS changed with improved knowledge but not significantly. Conclusion. The results of this study confirms that a lot of hysteria about AIDS is due to lack of knowledge of the disease; that health professionals and the news media need to learn more about HIV/AIDS in order to educate the public; that AIDS education should emphasize mechanisms of transmission and pathogenesis. 362 [Page 363](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/361) 6037 AIDS: EDUCATION Goldstein*, Merton Kahne*, Janet Van Ness*, Arnold Weinberg* - for the AIDS Task Force. *Medical Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts U.S.A. Objective. To describe the development and implementation of an AIDS education program for a university community utilizing a multi-disciplinary task force. Methods. Educational strategies were developed which included the use of mass media, audiovisual techniques, publications, small and large discussion groups and more open dissemination of condoms. Innovative methods developed included the use of cable TV and a telecommunication-computer network. Results. Of special note, people who are, in general, curious and questioning in a university setting were usually mute or absent during AIDS educational sessions. These issues were the driving force for the development of anonymous mechanisms to gather information and to utilize modalities available in living areas, such as cable TV and computers. The methodology, programs and instruments for measuring effectiveness of these efforts will be the basis of our presentation. Conclusion. A sophisticated low-risk population of various ages can be motivated to assume greater personal responsibility through an AIDS educational program. 6038 THREE INNOVATIVE EDUCATION IDEAS FROM SEATTLE Ann Downer*, L Miller**, B Wood* *Seattle-King Co. Dept. of Public Health, **University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Wa., USA Objective. To develop and test new ways to reach people with information about AIDS and prevention. Methods. KIDS- KIDS, an acronym for Knowing Is Definitely Safer, is a peer education project. Two 8th graders had the idea after meeting a man with AIDS. Their lesson plans were written with help from the Health Department. Condom StickersA bilingual sticker was designed to adhere to condom dispensing machines. Cooperating suppliers placed them on 900 machines in Jan. 1988. The AIDS Hotline number and a prevention message are displayed. Ask Dr. BobThis medical column on AIDS appears in Seattle's largest gay newspaper. It is written by the Medical Director of the AIDS Project in Seattle. Results. Due to demand, KIDS is creating chapters. Assessment of students' perceptions of peers as a credible source of facts is underway. Condom machine sales have doubled in 2 years in the Seattle area. Calls to the Hotline due to stickers are being recorded. More than 45 letters have been answered by Dr. Bob since 1986. It is a successful mechanism for visibility in the community. Conclusion. The AIDS epidemic has spawned a creative outpouring of health education ideas. Since no single strategy is likely to be effective with all people, it is important to disseminate as many ideas as possible in order to maximize worldwide AIDS prevention efforts. These are only a few of the innovative education ideas emerging from organizations throughout the world. Notes: 6039 HEALTH EDUCATION IN AIDS: DEVELOPMENT OF A U.S. STRATEGY William R. Hendee, Ph.D., M. Roy Schwarz, M.D., Robert C. Rinaldi, Ph.D., John J. Henning, Ph.D., Norbert P. Rapoza, Ph.D. American Medical Association Chicago, Illinois 60610, U.S.A. At present, education leading to risk reduction through behavior change is the only preventive measure to control the spread of HIV. In the U.S., educational efforts should be targeted in part towards groups such as minorities, poverty-stricken youths, homeless adolescents, drug abusers, gay men, and others who are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection. These efforts need the focus of a national movement and the momentum of a concerted effort of several organizations working together to combat AIDS. To address these needs, the American Medical Association convened a meeting of approximately 250 professional and voluntary organizations in March 1988 to develop a national strategy for health education on AIDS. Evolving from this meeting was a white paper describing a strategic plan for employing the collective resources of the organizations to combat AIDS. Implementation of the strategic plan is underway. 6040 PLANNING, DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING AN AIDS CURRICULUM IN CULTURALLY DIVERSE SCHOOL SYSTEMS ML DAVIS* JD DUPREE** *Alameda County Health Care Services Agency, Oakland, California **AIDSCOM, Washington DC Objective. Since many young people experiment widely with sex and drugs, it is imperative that school-age children throughout the world be reached with AIDS prevention information as early as possible. The authors describe various means of overcoming cultural barriers and moral objections to AIDS education and prevention programs in the schools. Methods. Parent, teacher, student, school administration and community representatives from all 19 school districts in a diverse urban/suburban/rural county - some with 90% black or hispanic students, some with 90% white students - worked together developing a curriculum, organiz'ng public hearings, and training educators to present AIDS prevention messages to students from kindergarten age through secondary school graduation. Results. Nearly 100,000 students in a very ethnically diverse county of northern California now receive AIDS instruction as a result of a cooperative effort among parents, teachers, school boards, AIDS educators, health providers and students. Conclusion. Through community organization, cooperation and compromise, even areas with wide cultural and ethnic diversity can reach consensus on the vital matter of AIDS education and prevention programs in the schools. 363 [Page 364](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/362) 604 AIDS EDUCATION CAMPAIGN IN ICELAND AND ITS RESULTS Gudmundsson S Briem H Erlendsson K, Thorsteinsson B, -BeOlafssot 0, Magnisson G, Ing61fsd6ttir V, Bender S. 1. Reykjavik City Hospital, 2. National Hospital, 3. Directorate General of Public Health. Iceland should be well suited for a successful AIDS education campaign with a small population of 250.000, 100% literacy, and a high level of education. Newspapers and TV reach over 95% of the population. Organized campaign started in 1985 with frequent TV and radio programmes; brochures were mailed to every home, lectures were given by health care workers (HCW) in schools and workplaces all across the country. Two telephone surveys done in 1987 on randomized samples of 1500 and 1000 individuals k18 years old reveald that 67% of respondents got their most reliable information from the massmedia but only 9% from brochures and 13% directly from HCW. Knowledge on sexual and blood transmission of HIV was excellent, 99%. However, misconceptions were common: 62% believed that transmission occures kisses, 37% by public lavatories, 25% by food, 21% by swimming pools, 20% by coughing and sneezing, 6% by handshakes. The attitudes towards HIV infected persons (HIVIP) were as follows: 80% favoured detention of irresponsible HIVIP, 61 -64% opposed employment of HIVIP in the food industry and 13% did not want to work with them at all. While correct factual knowledge is difficult to convey to the public, change in attitude is even harder to achieve. 6042 EDUCATING YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT AIDS IN AUSTRALIA J. Ross, uttrose ousaferiadis, ias Kf'Ics YNACAIDS(Haemophilia '.Dept. of Health,Pi,?'g n f Wales Hospital,Sydney. The National Advisory Committee on AIDS (NACAIDS) in Australia has determined the education of youth as a high priority. Two working parties aiming at reaching students in public and private schools, and adolescents out of school have developed a wide range of strategies. Youth both within and outside the workforce, youth with low-literacy skills, HIV infected youth, youth with disabilities, youth with different ethnic backgrounds, and Aboriginal youth have all been considered. Education systems within States and Territories have responded to the need to educate young people. SDiscrimination and the legal rights of students and staff have been addressed. The development and introduction of curriculum materials has been innovative. Consultation between education systems and e.g. health departments, parent groups, student groups, teacher unions, the church, educationists and health professionals in developing suitable educational strategies has broadened the perspective of the community as a whole in regard to AIDS issues. Consultation with youth workers and youth themselves - four HIV infected youth between 15 & 17 are honourary advisors, have pointed up needs in this age group. Materials developed in various educational programmes include:SCurriculum Materials for schools \"Get Real Campaign\" (Private media communication for young people regarding the dangers of needle and syringe sharing.) SStreetwize Comics - messages for low literacy youth. SBooklet for adolescents (with Church input.) SPreventive sex booklets for young men with haemophilia. Notes: 6043 REFINING EDUCATIONAL MESSAGES TARGETED TO INNER CITY YOUTH. Lawrence L Sanders Jr, LC Egbuonu, RL Hassan BEBASHI, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Objective. To refine the approaches and messages used by a community-based organization to influence youth living in a United States inner city neighborhood to reduce their risk of acquiring HIV infection through sexual contact. Methods. We conducted focus group discussions with black youth between 15 and 19 years old to explore their attitudes about sexual behavior, HIV infection and condoms. Participants were recruited from local community groups and neighborhood schools. Discussions were stratified by age and sex. Results. Initial analyses showed differences and similarities in the knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of men and women. 1. Women question the ability of condoms to prevent infection; men express concerns about condoms breaking. 2. Both men and women said condoms were unlikely to be used in steady relationships. Men said they were more likely to use condoms if they suspected that their partner had an infection. 3. Women found condoms easily accessible; men frequently cited \"not having one\" as a reason for not using condoms. Conclusions. Qualitative exploration reveals some of the obstacles that block reception of risk reduction messages. Education initiatives that incorporate these findings may improve the response of the target group. 6044 DOES HEALTH EDUCATION WORK? PUBLICLY FUNDED AIDS EDUCATION IN SAN FRANCISCO, 1982-1986. Patricia E. Evans, GW Rutherford, JW Amory, NA Hessol, GA Bolan, M Herring, D Werdegar, Department of Public Health, San Francisco, CA, USA. Objectives. To evaluate the association between AIDS prevention and education programs and the incidence of HIV infection and gonococcal proctitis (GCP) in homosexual and bisexual men in San Francisco. Methods. We compared Department of public Health AIDS education expenditures for homosexual and bisexual men from 1982-1986 with incidence of HIV in a cohort of 359 homosexual and bisexual men and the reported citywide incidence of GCP in men during this same period. Results. Publicly funded AIDS prevention and education programs began in 1982, and expenditures have increased from $48,200 in FY 1982-3 to $2,536,136 in FY 1986-7. During 6-year HIV infection (% seroconvertors/yr) and GCP (cases/yr) were: 1981 1982 1983 1984 Funding, $1000 0 48.2 71.5 1112.1 2127.3 2536.1 HIV Incidence 1 GCP 4833 4008 2109 1375 703 390 Conclusions. Declining rates of HIV infection and GCP in homosexual and bisexual men preceded increased public funding for AIDS prevention and education. However, in 1984-1986 higher levels of public funding were associated with low levels of both HIV infection and GCP. The citywide decline in GCP and the stabilization of HIV seroprevalence at 50% suggest that changing sexual practices rather than saturation with HIV led to the decline in HIV incidence. We conclude that publicly funded AIDS prevention and education programs have been associated with maintenance of low rates of HIV infection. 364 [Page 365](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/363) 6045 A VIDEO MODEL FOR NATIVE EDUCATION D Cappello*, R Rowell**, Kathleen Toomey*** *Human Health Organization, Oakland, CA, **National Native Auerican AIDS Prevention Center, Oakland, CA, ***Consultant, Institute for Health Policy Studies, San Francisco, CA Objective. We developed a video format for AIDS prevention and concurrent overall STD reduction targeting Native Americans which can be used as a model in developing educational materials for other minority audiences. Methods. Native American health professionals were included in the initial design and script review, and as actors in the video production. A computerized visual format allows updating of material as new information is available. The video has three segments: 1) General STD information including diagnosis and treatment; 2) Group discussions; 3) Role-playing. Results. A handbook with the complete video text can be used by a facilitator for discussion and can be distributed to viewers. Ethnic-specific drawings with an adapted text can be modified to develop AIDS education materials for different minority populations. Role-playing provides the viewer with practical strategies to discuss STD prevention in social situations, an especially effective technique for teenage audiences. Conclusion. An effective video program for minority AIDS education using ethnic-specific graphics and role-playing can be modified and adapted to meet the needs of different minority populations. 6046 CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AND HEALTH EDUCATION RISK REDUCTION AIDS PROGRAM INTERVENTION RIGAUD, Michele MD MPH */**; Bryan Page PHD ** * Health and Rehabilitative Services, State of Florida AIDS Program Office, Miami, Florida U.S.A. ** University of Miami, Department of Psychiatry, Miami, Florida U.S.A. Objective:To identify cultural differences among cubans, haitians and black americans living in Miami which may result in lack of risk reduction programs on AIDS. Methods: A comparative analysis of cultural factors involved in the cuban, haitian and black american population shows the uniqueness of Miami where multicultural interaction and crosscultural approach is the basis for effective AIDS education program. Results: The analysis of cultural differences demonstrate that risk reduction intervention in Miami can be established around a standard theme - HIV infection - providing cultural nuances are recognized and instituted. Systems must be set up to provide a transcultural and interdisciplinary approach in a coordinated, integrated manner. Conclusion: Educators, program planners and funding agencies need to understand the strong cultural values of these ethnic groups and how they contrast with those of the surrounding society in order to make determinations that are truly in the best interest of the cuban, haitian and black american population Notes: 6047 EFFECT OF AIDS EDUCATION ON POLICE KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES Kathleen Sheridan*, M McCarthy*, M Fitzgibbon* E Sheridan* *Northwestern University Medical School Objective. Evaluation of a police AIDS education program in a large, urban U.S. city. Methods. Two-hour AIDS seminars were presented to 728 police. Programs combined film, slide, lecture and quest tion-answer media. Pre-5 post-tests on risk perception, knowledge and attitudes were analyzed. Results. A profile of the urban police officer who attended seminars is a 30-40 year old (43.4%), married (73%), Catholic (68%), male (76%), with children (78%), and some college (58%). Patrol (26.4%), detectives (20.6%), and tactical (18%) officers were well represented. Significant changes (.01) in risk perception in expected directions included: being bitten by an HIV+ arrestee; spit upon by same; and resuscitating an unknown person. Education \"corrected\" (.01) knowledge on the distinctions between HIV+ and AIDS, prevalence among heterosexuals and minorities. Police reported significant (.01) reducation in fear that their families were at risk. Conclusions. AIDS education for police demonstrated significant immediate changes in risk perception on the job, knowledge and attitudes. Follow-up data are needed to assess robustness of changes over time, and translation into on-the-job behaviors. 6048 A Curriculum for Teachine AIDS in the Elementary School Anne C. Freeman, J. Valentine, W. Holland, C. E. Haley, Dallas County Health Department, Dallas, Tx. Objective. To provide AIDS information to students in elementary schools. Methods. A curriculum was developed by the Dallas County Health Department to teach the facts about AIDS and HIV transmission to children in school. It includes: the definition of AIDS, the function of the cellular immune system, the virus-HIV, the transmission of HIV, and the long-term consequences of risk behavior. It is in simple language and includes illustrations. Cartoons and fairy tales are also part of the format. It is introduced to the faculty of the school by the health department educator. Then, before presentations to the students, the curricul\\um is presented to parents during Parent Teacher Association meetings. After these meetings the curriculum is presented to the students. Results. The curriculum has been presented to 507 parents, 837 students, and 169 teachers. PTA presentations have allowed for the education of parents regarding AIDS. No complaints have been registered in response to AIDS education in the elementary schools. Students have grasped the AIDS information and experienced reduced fear of AIDS transmission in the classroom. Conclusion. E]ementary schools will permit AIDS education. Parents wish to learn about AIDS and provide their children with accurate information. Children can learn AIDS prevention before adolescence when there is increased rlSK for infection. 365 [Page 366](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/364) 6049 A TRAIN-THE-TRAINER APPROACH TO SCHOOL-BASED AIDS EDUCATION IN WASHINGTON STATE Ann Downer*, J Maire**, *Seattle-King Co. Dept. of Public Health, Seattle; **Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, Olympia, Wa., USA Objective. To prepare a statewide cadre of school personnel to train teachers, develop policy, and implement AIDS curricula in Washington state schools. Methods. 297 public school districts and 445 private schools were asked to identify people to comprise a team of in-house AIDS educators. Each team consisted of a teacher, parent, administrator, nurse, board member and/or counselor. One-day training sessions were conducted in 10 sites throughout the state during Nov.-Dec.1987. Each session included: 1) modeling of an AIDS training outline; 2) review of adult learning theory and resistance to change; 3) practice responding to difficult questions; 4) guidance on policy development; 5) review of AIDS curricula; and 6) creation of developmentally appropriate student learning objectives. In addition, local health departments made presentations. Results. 235 teams representing 1200 people from 45 private schools and 190 public school districts attended. Each team identified goals to accomplish by June 1988. Less than half currently have AIDS policy and even fewer have approved curricula. A telephone survey in May will determine which teams have achieved goals, how many have implemented policy and instruction, and what barriers still exist to progress in these areas. Conclusion. The train-the-trainer model has the potential to educate large numbers of people quickly. Assessment of this approach will help determine its applicability for training teams from settings such as hospitals, clinics, and other health care facilities. 6050 INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL STRATEGIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AIDS PREVENTION AND CONTROL -rancisco Sy and D. Richter; University of South Carolina School of Public Health, Columbia, SC, USA Objective. To develop innovative and practical educational strategies to prevent and control AIDS in various target groups and settings. Method. 462 practitioners and researchers in AIDS educa-- tion from different disciplines and countries participated in the 1st International Conference on AIDS education in Columbia,SC,USA,Summer 1987. The main purpose of the conference was to review current AIDS education programs and to develop educational strategies for AIDS prevention and control. The 10 workshops conducted were: I. AIDS education for sexually active individuals. II. AIDS outreach programs for IV drug abusers III. AIDS prevention programs for women and newborn IV. AIDS education in schools V. AIDS education for health care workers VI. Educating the general public VII. AIDS education programs for minorities VIII. Worksite AIDS education programs IX. AIDS education programs in correctional systems. X. AIDS education programs in developing countries. Results. The various recommendations developed in the workshops can be grouped into three main models of AIDS education: providing AIDS information focusing on prevention, developing self-empowerments skills, and organizing community based AIDS education programs. Specific recommendations from each workshop will be presented. Conclusion. AIDS education should use a full range of educational strategies combining the 3 models of AIDS education and tailored for specific target groups and settings. Notes: 6051 Providing AIDS Information and Risk Reduction Guidelines in the Workplace Anne C. Freeman, J. Valentine, C. E. Haley, Dallas County Health Department, Dallas, Tx. Objective. To provide AIDS information and risk reduction guidelines to the sexually active minority adult. Methods. The cooperation of businesses and service institutions that employ substantial numbers of minority persons is enlisted by the AIDS Prevention Project. They agree to provide times and locations for AIDS education sessions. They also agree to permit both pre and post-test assessments to be given measuring knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. Results. Preliminary data collected from pre-test assessments indicate: 1) ongoing irrational fear of contracting AIDS in the workplace through casual contact, 2) a prevailing belief in common myths about AIDS, 3) persons with multiple sexual partners, and 4) consistent denial of personal risk for AIDS. Conclusion. Businesses and service institutions will agree to AIDS education in the workplace. They recognize that this activity will allay their workers irrational fears of contracting AIDS in the workplace, and that the activity could also reduce long-term health care costs. The workplace provides a setting for minority persons to receive AIDS information and risk reduction guidelines to reduce their potential risk for AIDS, without the stigma of attending an AIDS educational program. 6052 A NATION-WIDE STRUCTURE FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND COUNSELLINS: THE ITALIAN NATIONAL AIDS HOT-LINE. Damiano Abeni, C Valdarchi, D Greco National Institute of Health, National AIDS Taskforce, Rome, Italy Objective. To describe the organization of the Italian National AIDS Hot-line and to present the data collected from Jun. to Dec. 1987. Methods. The Italian Ministry of Public Health has created a tollfree AIDS hot-line which covers the entire country. Answers are given by a team of experienced medical doctors and psychologists, expressly selected for this duty. Phone calls are absolutely anonymous, but data concerning the caller and the content of the call are collected and processed with specifically designed software. Results. In the first six months, 27747 calls were received. Data are available froa 17077 calls, accounting for 32510 specific questions. The male/female ratio is 2:1, and 72% of the calls come from the 20-39 age group (43% in the 20-29 a.g.). 22% of the calls come from people who say they belong to a \"risk group\". A significant correlation (p<0.01) exists between regional incidence of AIDS and n* of calls/ inhabitants. Detailed cross tabulations are available to analyse the relationship 'type of caller-type of questions'. Conclusions. There is a great need for specialized personal information about AIDS in Italy. The regional magnitude of the epidemic correlates with the need for information. Different groups of callers ask for different kinds of information. 366 [Page 367](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/365) 6053 WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT? THE PARIS AIDES HOTLINE AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL AND A COUNSELING SERVICE. Michael POLLAK, CNRS; Isabelle de Informaticien; Marc IMBERT, AIDES. The voluntary association AIDES has operated a hotline since 1985. Standardised records of all calls have been kept. The total number of calls has increased from 1000 in 1985 to 8800 in 1987. In 1985 the callers were male homosexuals (60%) and bisexuals (15%), the largest age group being 30-40 years (40%). Only 24% were women. In 1987 the caller population is more diversified although the sex ratio has remained stable. 50% are now heterosexual, the 20-30 year age group is largest (40%). 20% of the callers are HIV+, ARC call \"for themselves\", 10% for \"somebody else\". Questions of general information have become less frequent (symptoms, transmission, treatment: 80% in 1985, 60% in 1987). Specific problems such as coping with seropositivity have gained in importance: 20% in 1987. Social and legal counseling slightly increased from 1% to 3%. Drug users now represent 5% of the caller population. Among their concerns abortion is important. In its beginnings the hotline served educating the most concerned homo- and bisexuals. Today it fulfills the same purpose for a more diversified population. At the same time specific counseling of HIV+, ARC or AIDS people is becoming an important task, as voluntary testing becomes more widespread and the HIV+ population grows. 6 5 THE ROLE OF AN AIDS HOTLINE AS A PRIMARY NEEDS 4 ASSESSMENT TOOL FOR EDUCATION PROGRAMS Hector Carrillo*, B Maerten*, D Rittinger*, C Frutchey* *San Francisco AIDS Foundation, San Francisco, California. Objective. To analyze the value of a telephone Hotline as a primary needs assessment tool for AIDS agencies in planing and implementing education and prevention messages for a variety of different risk groups. Methods. The AIDS Hotline started operating in June 1983. Statistics have been compiled since November 1983. To date more than 150,000 calls have been recorded. We have drawn a random sample of 5,000 calls and selected four basic variables: gender of caller, sexual orientation, caller's degree of risk for HIV infection and content of the call. Statistical measurements and trends are then analyzed in conjunction with program development within theFoundation, and epidemiological changes in the region covered. Results. The anlysis shows that the need for AIDS education and prevention information has changed rapidly over time. Different groups express a need for information at differing times, and educators have taken advantage of this data base as a way to tailor messages to specific audiences. Trends and findings will be thoroughly discussed. Conclusions. A telephone Hotline has a unique role in AIDS education/prevention. Not only does it provide personalized information to people in an anonymous way, but it can also serve as an immediate source of information about the changing needs of various groups. A more structured monitoring of the Hotline's calls can result in a better perception of the trends of educational needs. Used to its full potential, a telephone Hotline can greatly increase the value and timeliness of AIDS education strategies. Notes: 6055 AN ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF HOW MINORITY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS RESPOND TO THE AIDS EPIDEMIC Nicholas Freudenberg, Jacalyn Lee Center for Community Action to Prevent AIDS, Hunter College/CUNY, New York Objective. Effective mobilization of communities for the prevention of HIV infection requires an understanding of how indigenous organizations perceive and respond to the epidemic. This report describes how grassroots organizations such as churches, civic associations and social service agencies in two minority areas in New York City have acted in response to the AIDS epidemic. Method. To assist in planning neighborhood-based prevention campaigns in two primarily Hispanic communities, investigators interviewed community workers, leaders and activists to assess how organized groups have defined their role in AIDS prevention. Fifteen respondents in each neighborhood were asked to describe what requests for AIDS services they had received, what services were provided and what influenced decisions on how to define a role for their group. Investigators attended ten community meetings to observe how the issue of AIDS was discussed. Results. Based on these interviews and observations, investigators concluded that an organization's perception of risk, its previous experience in sexuality or drug issues, and its members' experience with AIDS predicted its willingness to take on AIDS prevention activities. Conclusion. Effective community campaigns for AIDS prevention require careful assessment of the potential for involvement of various groups. This report describes one method for identifying such groups in urban minority communities. 6056 AIDS Risk Behavior in Family Planning Clinics G. Stephen Bowen, L. Magder, and S. O. Aral, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA Objectives. To measure risk behaviors for AIDS of women at Family Planning Clinics in Pennsylvania. Methods. In September and October 1987, 16,631 clients (participation rate 99%) visiting all 39 clinics of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in Pennsylvania completed an anonymous behavioral risk assessment questionnaire for AIDS. Clients were asked demographic information, reason for visit and drug using and sexual behavioral risk data about themselves and present/past sexual partners. Seventy-two percent of clients were single; were white; 11.5% were black; and 1.6% were Hispanic. Results. Six percent of clients were at high risk for AIDS/HIV infection because they used IV drugs within the last 5 years (1.8%), or because their sgx partners were drug users (4.3%), were bisexual (1.25%), had hemophilia 0.02% or had AIDS/HIV infection known to the client (0.07%). The proportion of clients who were IV drug users, who had sex partners(s) who were IV drug users, and who had bisexual sex partners(s) increased with age up to the age of 34 (RR 1.2 increasing to 2.1), then declined (RR 1.4). Women who were divorced, separated or widowed also were more likely to have used drugs or have sex partners who used drugs or were bisexual than were single or married women. An additional 39% of clients were at moderately increased risk due to history of STD or more than 5 sex partners in the last 5 years. Conclusion. Women attending FP clinics are at significant risk for AIDS/HIV infection; education and risk reduction counseling based on individual risk assessment as well as HIV testing for women at risk is essential to reduce HIV transmission. 367 [Page 368](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/366) 6057 ABSENCE OF HIV INFECTION IN SEXUAL PARTNERS OF HIV INFECTED HOMOSEXUAL MEN. JJ Guinan*, J Gold*, A Morlet*, D Cooper** * Albion Street AIDS Centre, Sydney Hospital, **St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney. Objective. To identify factors which discriminate between HIV negative and HIV positive sexual partners of HIV infected homosexual men. Methods. We examined the behavioural, medical and demographic characteristics of 63 subjects who were the regular sexual partners of HIV infected homosexual men. Results. The sexual behaviours of HIV negative subjects which discriminated them (p<0.01) from HIV infected subjects were; the use of condoms, absence of other sexual partners, and avoidance of behaviours involving rectal trauma. Subjects who had partners in addition to their regular sexual partner were more likely to be HIV infected (p<0.01), particularly if their behaviours involved unprotected anal sex and rectal trauma. Marijuana use, either with the regular sexual partner or with others, was associated with HIV infection (p<0.05). A history of hepatitis was associated with HIV infection (p<0.001) while there was a significant negative association between hepatitis B immunisation and HIV infection (p<0.05). There was no association between prior infection with other sexually transmissible diseases such as herpes, gonorrhoea and syphilis and HIV infection. No demographic variables were found to be associated with HIV infection. It was also found that HIV negative subjects were more likely to have responded to the fear of becoming HIV infected by changing their sexual behaviours. Conclusion. Absence of HIV infection in partners of HIV infected men was associated with avoidance of sexual behaviours involving rectal trauma. 6058 BEHAVIOR CHANGE AND PREVENTION OF SEXUAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV Stephen F. Morin Umnversity of California, San Francisco Objective. To provide an update on a five point model developed in 1983 for guiding AIDS prevention efforts. Methods. The five factors in the model (perceived threat, response efficacy, self efficacy, skills attainment, and peer support) have shaped prevention efforts in San Francisco and elsewhere. The prevention campaign has involved media, information and referral, workshops, support groups, and individual health education and counseling. Initial efforts were targeted to gay and bisexual men; later efforts to ethnic minorities, youth, and IV drug users. Results. Dramatic changes in sexual behavior among gay and bisexual men have been documented since 1983. These changes are being maintained over time. Recent data indicate that change in sexual behavior has been greater among gay and bisexual men in San Francisco than in other parts of the country. The city now has the lowest rate of new infections among gay and bisexual men of any city studied in the United States. Different factors in the model have been of more or less importance at different stages of the epidemic. Conclusion. Comprehensive theoretical models can be of assistance in shaping successful prevention efforts. Notes: 6059 USE OF PSYCHO-SEGMENTATION TECHNIQUES TO DEFINE TARGET AUDIENCES FOR AIDS PREVENTION ML DEBUS*, MA KILBY** * Doremus Porter Novelli, Washington, D.C. ** AIDSCOM/Doremus Porter Novelli, Washington, D.C. Objective: To apply market segmentation techniques using psychographic/behavioral measures to define target audiences for AIDS prevention campaigns. Method: Health communication, following general marketing trends, is using audience segmentation in psychographic and behavioral terms to fine-tune the definition of target audiences beyond mere demographics. Tightly defined target audiences are especially important in media-sophisticated countries where \"narrow-casting\" is a viable media approach. The technique is equally applicable in developing countries, where psycho-segmentation is key in developing culturally sensitive target audience definitions for more strategically accurate and effective communications programs. Results: Analysis of programs underway in countries in Africa and Latin America illustrates the utility of the concept as both a planning and evaluation tool. Conclusion: Psycho-segmentation plays an essential role in initial development of effective prevention campaigns; it ensures that the tone of the communication is relevant. It also provides a method for assessing and modifying the soundness of strategies and messages being used in existing campaigns. 6060 BEHAVIOURS AND ATTITUDE OF \"PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE HETEROSEXUAL PARTNERS\" AND AIDS PREVENTION IN SWITZERLAND J.B. Masur, Ph. Lehmann, F. Dubois-Arber, D. Hausser University Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, Lausanne From now new HIV-infections will probably appear mainly in the heterosexual population in Switzerland. This study is a part of the overall evaluation of AIDS campaigns and addresses attitudes and behaviours as well as the mechanisms of changes and resistances. 50 men and women with at least 2 different partners each month have been interviewed in the 3 linguistic regions using indepth questionnaire and psychological tests. Such people do not recognize themselves as belonging to a group. They alltogether behave regarding sexual relationship according to common cultural and psychological framework. 5 subtypes were characterized: 1) lonesome hunters of short term partners, 2) same hunters picking up girls in small groups, 3) those not recognizing themselves as picking up girls, having a network of sexual partners, 4) those perpetually looking for the ideal partner, 5) depressed ones in search of affective and sexual relationship. Attitudes and behaviours highly depend of that typology. Types 1 and 2 reduce number of partners, use more often condoms and adopt other erotic behaviours without risks. The other types, especially 4 and 5, deny AIDS-risk or behave guilty, neglecting protecting themselves and partners. The condom image is very negative and bounded with prostitution, suspicion, sexual impotency... AIDS prevention should take a better account of such cultural and psychological resistances. Diversity in safer sex practices is to be promoted and heterosexual transmission repeatedaly stressed. 368 [Page 369](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/367) 6061 AIDS PREVENTION: AIDSPRVENRESEARCHCENTERS SUPPORTED BY THE US INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH Ellen S. Stover, Ph.D.* *National Institute of Mental Health Objective. To review research findings on the prevention of AIDS emerging from three NIMHsupported AIDS Research Centers. Methods. Currently the only effective strategies to prevent the spread of AIDS involve changing behavior. This session will review the design and implementation of interventions undertaken by Research Centers in New York, Miaric and San Francisco to prevent the spread of AIDS by changing relevant behaviors in major risk groups. Collaboration between researchers and community organizations will be discussed, as well as the importance of multidisciplinary approaches to research. Emerging findings will be reviewed and emphasis will be given to methodological difficulties in study design and their recommended solutions. Conclusion. The three AIDS Research Centers supported by NIMH are engaged in a broad range of innovative research on changing behavior to prevent the spread of AIDS. Emerging findings from these Centers are of keen interest to the worldwide ccmmunity of AIDS researchers and health care providers. 6062 TARGETING AIDS PREVENTION AND EARLY TREATMENT TO SEROPOSITIVE PERSONS. THE CONCEPT OF THE PREVENTION/TREATMENT CENTER of California, (4)Santa Clara County Health Department, (5)Long Beach City Health Department, (6)State of California, (7)ViRiX, Inc. Obiective. To examine the feasibility of delaying development of AIDS in infected persons, decreasing the severity of disease and prolonging life and improving its quality for persons who do develop disease. Methods. Two treatment and prevention centers were established to follow infected persons at 4 month intervals. They are given immunologic and behavioral evaluations. Individualized and group behavior modification sessions together with medical, psychological, and legal referral are provided. Results. The effect of the centers are evaluated in terms of: 1. at-risk behavior change(sexual and IV drug use) compared to pre-enrollment and to two control groups; 2. productive life extension resulting from early referral and medical intervention; and, 3. emotional status improvement. The costs of the program are evaluated in terms of actual financial expenditures, excess medical costs, and adverse outcomes (medical or personal) to program participants. Conclusions. Although everyone needs to know something about AIDS, some need intensive education, motivation and skill building to protect themselves and others from infection. This, combined with state-of-the-art medical follow-up could be the model for future AIDS prevention and treatment. Notes: 6063 PREVENTING PERINATAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV IN CENTRAL AFRICA S. Lallemant*, M. Lallemant**, S. Paris Perinatal transmission of HIV is a major problem in central Africa due to high anti-HIV prevalence in young adults, particularly in urban settings (4.0% among the 1531 pregnant women we tested in Brazzaville). The feasibility of prevention is low. The controversial premarital screening would be difficult to enforce as many pregnancies occur outside marriage (54% in our study) and most marriages (75%) are celebrated only traditionally. Prenatal screening would be of limited efficacy since many women attend mother-child clinics late in pregancy and the acceptance of abortion (and further birth control) would be low. Breast-feeding is not contraindicated for anti-HIV(+) mothers given the lack of hard data on this mode of HIV transmission and the risks related to artificial feeding in such an environment. Additional problems are: high cost of screening and difficulty in identifying high risk groups; low acceptance of proposed screening due to the social stigma of HIV infection and concern for confidentiality; inadequacy of structures; unequal training of personnel for lab. testing, pre/post-test counselling and follow-up of anti-HIV(+) subjects; high social value attached to fecondity and parenthood. In addition to developing adapted training and structures, the control of sexual and percutaneous (including transfusional) transmission remains the basic tool for preventing the spread of HIV infection among women of child-bearing age. 6064 QUALITY ASSURANCE WITH SMALL SAMPLES FOR MAINTAINING EFFICIENT PREVENTION PROGRAMS Joseph J. Valadez, Yamil Kouri Harvard Institute for International Development, Cambridge, MA, USA Objective. To demonstrate application of a tested quality assurance method for assessing prevention programs. Methods. Lot Quality Acceptance Sampling (LQAS), tested by Harvard in Central America, measures the quality of Primary Health Care coverage. An adaptation of industrial control procedures, LQAS measures coverage quality by local health facilities. An LQAS sample of only 28 is required although the population size is assumed to be infinite. Alpha and Beta errors are <5%. Now applied to the QA of AIDS prevention programs in San Juan, Puerto Rico, local clinics were evaluated on their capacity to produce knowledge, attitude and behavior change through mass education, and risk group specific education. Results. All local clinics in San Juan were included in the study. Knowledge by risk group members and local populations of HIV transmission, attitudes about sexual practice and sexual relationships with high risk group members, and behavior such as condom use by prostitutes and homosexuals, and high risk sexual behavior were evaluated. Of all clinics in San Juan (pop.: 1,000,000) less than half have prevention programs producing prescribed KAB changes. San Juan thereby instituted steps to improve its prevention programs. Conclusion. LQAS rapidly assesses prevention programs leading to underlying programmatic problems. LOAS is recommended for both LDCs and MDCs to rapidly identify facilities with substandard prevention programs where scarce resources can then be invested for remediation.

The AIDS epidemic forces health educators and policy makers to confront controversial and sensitive subjects, such as sexuality, monogamy and drug use. Since education is the best known weapon for slowing the rate of HIV infection, it is imperative that methods be developed for providing prevention tools to individuals and groups within cultural constraints. Methods. AIDS prevention campaigns in areas with religious, moral, political and/or legal constraints on safer sex information must do considerable negotiation with political, religious, educational and other community leaders in order to garner support for mounting the campaign. Results. Progress is sometimes slow in convincing community and religious leaders to support specific AIDS prevention efforts, relying heavily on prevention of disease and compassionate efforts to preserve the family and community. Conclusion, some AIDS prevention programs have found that the best \"support\" they can get from community and religious leaders is to cooperate in those leaders' ignoring of the issue. In other cultures, leaders who were initially opposed to the campaign have been persuaded to actively endorse it on medical, humanitarian or compassionate grounds.

Executives of the U.S. life and health insurance industry determined in 1985 the urgent need to focus the attention and resources of business, labor and other orivate sector institutions in the fight against AIDS. Several prominent health and business officials agreed to lead organizing meetings representing major coroorations, labor unions, religious denominations, AIDS organizations, health associations, ethnic and minority groups and other non-governmental institutions. Strategic planning sessions were held. Results. From October 1986 to lay 1987 three organizational sessions involving up to 100 constituent groups were held. On May 26, 1987 the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS was oficially founded and announced under the chairnanshio of Dr. Edward _I. Brandt. By January 1988 it had over 100 member institutions and is recognized as the umbrella private sector resource on AIDS in the U.S. Conclusion. A determined and well-planned campaign to bring together major elements of non-governmental organizations can orovide a significant new dimension to a national AIDS effort. 6068 METHODOLOGY OF THE EVALUATION OF NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGNS AGAINST AIDS IN SWITZERLAND Ph. Lehmann, D. Hausser, F. Dubois-Arber, F. Gutzwiller. University Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, Lausanne, Switzerland. The objective of the overall scientific evaluation of AIDS prevention campaigns in Switzerland (1985-1988)is measuring their efficiency and suggesting the policy makers some improvements according to resistance or withdrawal effects. The evaluation design takes both account of results variables (knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, behaviours; condom sales) and process variables (message exposure, multiplying factors). It adresses changes in the general population and in various sex, age, behavioural and cultural (exposed) groups. Conclusions have to be drawn every 6 months. In order to cover every aspect, the whole evaluation programme included in 1987 13 intercomplementary studies (15 studies foreseen in 1988) using various methods. According to the specificity of each group, it has been necessary to develop particular sampling strategies (representative, tardeted, snowball samples; over 5500 people reached) and interviewing techniques (by phone, in depth face to face, written questionnaires). The synthesis is based on qualitative and quantitative analysis. After 2 years, both the evaluation design and methodology help answering the policy makers'questions. 370 [Page 371](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/369) 6069 PREVENTION POLICIES IN SWEDEN Benny Henriksson. Institute for Social Policy, Inc., Stockholm Obectives: To describe and analyze important parts of the Swedish aids-policy in the light of recent sociological theories. Methods: The theoretical background of this paper is an analysis of the development of the Welfare State and theories about formal and informal social control. One important part of the Swedish welfare system is the professionalization and centralization of the social and health care systems. There is also a strong belief in formal social control methods. That has been very obvious during the aidsepidemic. In Sweden there are many contradictory patterns including both strong formal and informal social control institutions. Aids has in many ways made these contradictions more obvious. Also around information strategies there are contradictory patterns. On the one hand we have lived through a very centralized information campaign and on the other hand we have the important role of different movements which can give people more than imperonal leaflets and advertisements. Conclusions: In many aspects the Swedish aids prevention campaign has been very successful. In many others there are very critical points. Our aim, as independent researchers, is to further illuminate these critical points. 6070 RESULTS AFTER 10 MONTHS EVALUATING NATIONWIDE CAMPAIGNS AGAINST AIDS IN SWITZERLAND F. Dubois-Arber, D. Hausser, Ph. Lehmann, F. Gutzwiller University Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, Lausanne, Switzerland Ten months after the starting of the STOP-AIDS campaign, which objectives are to promote condom use, nonexchange of syringes and faithfulness, initiated by the Federal Office of Public Health and based on a multi media advertising strategy and a stimulation of potential multipliers (such as health professionals, teachers, regional authorities...), it is possible to confirm the efficiency and the feasibility of it. The grounds of this are the following observations: - the campaign and its objectives reached the general population and the target groups, - message exposure and amplification by the mass media was adequate, - multiplying effect was important (repercussion of the STOP-AIDS messages and local actions developped by authorities, non gouvernemental groups or informal leaders...), - condoms sale has increased of nearly 60 % in 1987 compared with 1986, - noticeable changes in attitudes and behaviours took place in the way of better protection among the general population as well in the observed groups choosen for probability of adopting risk behaviours (adolescents, homosexuals, intraveinous drug users, young adults with many sexual partners, sex-tourists), - phenomenon of stigmatisation was very low and is not affecting the minority groups. Notes: 071 PROGRAM OF PREVENTION AGAINST AIDS ADAPTED TO THE REUNION ISLAND Dc TROUSSIER* - Dr GERARD\" SHead of the North - Sainte Clotilde 97488 - Saint Denis C6dex - REUNION \" Head of the North Blood Service CHD de Bellepierre - 97400 Saint Denis - REUNION The setting up of the program has two aims: - to limit the number of infected persons in the future - to prepare everyone to get his own prevention behaviours. The Conseil General of the Reunion Island with the active participation of physicians, biologists chemists and non medical staff, public and private has contributed for an AIDS prevention adapted to the islander character of a departement with 550 000 inhabitants, know for having no case of AIDS reported in 1986. In fact this program allowed: - to open the out patient departements for unameless screening - to distribute unfolds and posters - the start of an answering service called \"INFO SIDA' - to give lectures to the public and to the health professionals - the show of telecasts about AIDS - the presentation of audiovisuel fitting on AIDS for pupils and students. The action, through the information given, has raised the number of the voluntary screenings and permitted the selection of new positif in the Island. This number is doubling every nine months since early 86. On december 31st 1987, 50 positv have been selected. The preponderance of homosexuals was noted but more and more heterosexuals are found: 29 year old is the average. The contamination is becoming more local. The sale of condoms has risen up. This action will go on in 1988 and hopefully will hold up the evolution of reported cases. 6072 PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVES ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF HIV PREVENTION PROGRAMS FOR ADOLESCENTS Ralph J. DiClemente, University of California, School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA., U.S.A. Adolescents have been identified as a high-risk population for HIV acquisition based on their high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases and other risk-taking behaviors. The future rate of HIV infection in this age-group may sharply increase unless prevention programs are rapidly developed and implemented. Risk-reduction education programs are the only practical public health strategies for controlling the spread of HIV infection in this population. Implementation of programs has progressed slowly, however, due to the lack of a coherent and systematic national AIDS education policy. This paper will explore the controversy surrounding implementation of HIV risk-reduction education programs within school systems in the U.S.A. This analysis is relevant for other countries confronting the AIDS epidemic as well. Three central issues are identified and discussed: (1) mandated vs volitional exposure to HIV prevention education, (2) centralized vs local community development of curricula, and, (3) emphasis on teaching safer sex techniques vs sexual abstinence. Recommendations for successfully resolving these issues without limiting program effectiveness will be described. 371 [Page 372](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/370) 6073 EMERGENCE OF PUBLIC POLICY ON AIDS; THE NEW ZEALAND CASE GM Fougere Department of Community Health, Wellington School of Medicine & J Kehoe Department of Sociology, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand. Objective: To describe, analyse and explain the pattern of state policy on AIDS in New Zealand. Methods: Documentary analysis, interviews with key informants among the state bureaucracy, politicians and interested professional and community groups. Results: Shows how the forms of transmission of the disease and the timing of its appearance in New Zealand, together with the diffusion of information through international networks, the Department of Health's standard operating procedures and the institutional division of labour on which they are based, the concerns of party politicians and of professional and community interest groups are aggregated to produce policy. Emphasis is given to the ways in which the state's decision to forgo traditional coercive forms of surveillance and contrql, coupled with the political organization of the gay community and IV drug users, have led to formal and informal institution building to elicit co-operation. Such institutions are typically at arms length from the state machinery itself. Conclusion: AIDS present a new kind of policy problem whose solution in the New Zealand case has led to institutional innovation. While understanding the factors that lead to differences in national AIDS policies - and their consequences - will require careful comparative studies, case studies like this one are a first step in locating important explanatory variables. 6074 RESULTS OF A LONGITUDINAL PSYCHOSOCIAL STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF ANTIBODY TEST NOTIFICATION. J Moulton, R Stempel, P Bacchetti, L Temoshok A Moss. UCSF and SFGH, San Francisco, Ca USA Objective To examine the correlates of and changes in psychological distress related to antibody test notification in gay men. Methods One hundred and seven gay men were recruited from the San Francisco General Hospital cohort, a long-term prospective study. From 1985 onward, HIV Ab results were made available. Participants completed questionnaires on distress, coping and perceived risk of AIDS 2 weeks before and 2 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after notification, and at comparable times if not notified. Results Prenotification, among Ab+ men, fatigue was correlated with overall distress (p=.004), confusion (p=.005), depression (p=.002), tension (p=.006) hopelessness (p=.01) and anxiety (p=.02). postnotification, no significant difference in distress was found between Ab+ men notified of their Ab status and those not notified. Two weeks post notification, Ab- men showed significantly less hopelessness, depression, anger and confusion than reported prior to notification. No additional changes from baseline levels of distress were seen in Ab- men. Conclusions Seropositive status was a better prelicuor of distress than notification. Such distress as did occur appeared soon after notification. Seronegatives were signifcantly relieved of distres by notification. D. Sweet**, M. Hovell***, R. Fagan* *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, ** University of California, San Francisco, CA, *** San Diego State Univ., San Diego Objective. To determine what factors are associated with voluntary HIV testing and why some individuals, once tested, fail to return to learn their HIV test results. Methods. A two-page questionnaire which measured reasons for testing as well as psychosocial, behavioral and demographic factors thought to be predictive of failure to return, was administered during pre-test counseling sessions to 2,916 consecutive clients. These included heterosexual (75%), homosexual (13%), and bisexual (12%), male (55%) and female (45%) clients seeking HIV testing in five California Alternate Test Sites (voluntary, anonymous testing sites). Site characteristics were examined as well. Results. As of December 1987, 173,693 individuals had been tested in California's 55 Alternate Test Sites with over 10,000 tests being performed in that month alone. Of those sampled between March and May 1987, 11.3% (n=329) failed to return for test results. Regression analyses showed client factors, independently predictive of failure to return included: low social support (p=.02), whether or not the client intended to return (p=.02), and low client satisfaction with services provided by the site (p=.002). The site characteristics and procedures varied greatly and seemed to play an important role in influencing whether or not sceaone would return for their test results (Chi square = 30.54(4df), p=.001). Higher return rates were associated with shorter delays experienced in waiting for the test once at the site, the comfort of the setting, the nature of the setting and smaller numbeis of clients seen per week by the site. Conclusion. These results suggest characteristics of both clients and counseling/testing facilities which can be targeted to improve HIV testing return rates. 6076 HIV PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN A MIDDLESIZE TOWN IN SWEDEN: EXPERIENCES ON INFORMATION,TESTING AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL * Huddinge Hospital,**County Social Service of S6dertdlje, Sweden Objective. A special clinic for HIV prevention was established in 1986 in S6dertalje, a town of 80 000 inhabitants nearby Stockholm. The purpose was to broaden the knowledge in general of HIV among the inhabitants, offer HIV testing and councelling and by epidemiological work in collaboration with social workers seek out and persuade those at risk to attend the clinic. Methods. HIV information in small groups covering basic facts as well as psycho-social aspects was given primarily to social-and youth workers, high school students and immigrants. Free of charge testing and examination in a centrally located office on a drop in basis was made possible. Contacs of HIV infected persons and drug abusers known to the authorities were called upon and offered tests and information. Results. The intense information program reached large groups in a short time thereby hopefully contributing to a sound view of the disease and reducing anxiety for HIV and prejudices of infected persons. During the first year over 600 individuals were tested of which one third were considered at risk. Due to good local knowledge of the group with drug abuse contact tracing could effectively be carried out. The results of these measures will be presented. 372 [Page 373](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/371) 6077 A COMIPARISON OF CURRENT AND EARLY UTILIZATION OF ALTERNATIVE TEST SITES FOR HIV ANTIBODY TESTING. Susan M. Keqeles, Joseph A. Catania Thomas J. Coates, University of California San Francisco Objective. To determine who uses Alternative Test Sites (ATSs), why they want to know their antibody status, and how those currently obtainino the antibody test differ from those who obtained it when the clinics first opened. Methods. The first cohort's data (N=273) were collected from July 1985 (when ATSs opened in California) to May 1986. Data from the second cohort have been collected since May 1987 to the present (N=800, oreliminary data on 300 individuals presented here; all of the data will be analyzed and presented at the Conference). Self-administered questionnaires assessed: gender, sexual orientation, how believed exposed to HIV, current sexual and IV drug risk behavior, AIDS knowledge. Results. Originally 46% of test-seekers were gay/bisexual males, 48% heterosexual are males and 74% are heterosexual. As before, all gay/bisexual males and most heterosexuals (70%) believe exposed via sexual contact; currently many health care workers seek the test. The % of IV drug users has remained stable (7-8%). In both cohorts, nearly all sexually active non-monogamous people engaged in hinh risk sexual activity in the preceeding month. Current IV drug use and level of AIDS knowledge will be reported. Conclusions. Although the majority of test-seekers are not \"hiqh risk grouD\" members, most had engaged in risky behaviors and many did so in the month prior to obtaining the antibody test. Thus, ATSs were and still are used by people at risk for HIV infection. Counseling must emphasize risk behavior reduction, regardless of antibody test results. 6078 SHOULD GENERAL HIV SCREENING BE PERFORMED IN NORWAY?-A DECISION ANALYTIC APPROACH. Per Magnus*, F Sundet*, A Eskild*, LS *Department of Epidemiology, National Institute of Public Health, **Norwegian School of Management, Oslo, Norway Objective. To reach a decision on the question of general HIV screening based on consequence modelling, given a set of decision maker preferences. Methods. Some of the factors influencing the consequences of a general HIV screening are: the population compliance, the sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests, the prevalence and incidence of HIV, the distribution of risk prone behavior, the degree of behavioral change after testing, as well as the economic, social and individual costs. The decision to screen will depend on the attitudes of the decision makers to the conflicting objectives involved. These are identified, and a formal analysis of preferences is performed in cooperation with decision makers. Results and conclusion. The conditions under which general screening is preferred is given for different sets of preferences and assumptions. The analysis points out sensitive parameters for which we need better estimates in order to reach firm decisions. Notes: 607Changing Patterns of Client Characteristics and Seropositivity at Upstate New York HIV Alternate Test Sites J. C. Grabau,* Dale L. Morse* *New York State Department of Health, Albany, New York Objective: To describe the changing epidemiologic characteristics of persons seeking HIV testing and associated changes in seroprevalence over time. Methods: State sponsored anonymous counseling and testing for HIV began in mid 1985 with voluntary completion of a blind questionnaire since January 1986. Epidemiologic and laboratory results from these activities will be updated thru March 1988. Results: Between mid 1985 and December 31, 1987, 17,741 persons had been tested at Upstate New York alternate sites with an overall positivity rate of 7.6%. However, there has been a temporal change in rate of seropositivity with a high of 14.4% for early 1986 to 4.3% for late 1987 in association with an increase in the number of persons seeking testing. Client characteristics have also changed considerably: females increased from 27% to 43%, non-whites decreased from 17% to 12%, persons with symptoms decreased from 18% to 8%, persons with IV drug use decreased from 15% to 10%, homosexuals/ bisexuals decreased from 43% to 26%, and persons with no risk factors or only heterosexual contact increased from 39% to 58% of attendees. Conslusion: As concerns about heterosexual transmission have increased, so have the number of persons seeking HIV testing. This has been associated with a decreasing rate of seropositivity and changes in client characteristics which will require program changes to ensure persons at highest risk are adequately served. 6080 CONTINUED RISK TAKING BEHAVIOUR AND SEROCONVERSION IN HIV TESTED INDIVIDUALS. A Morlet*, J Gold*, JJ Guinan*, D Cooper**. *Albion Street AIDS Centre, Sydney Hospital, **St.Vincent's Hospital, Sydney. Objective. To investigate epidemiologic and risk taking behaviour related to HIV seroconversion. Methods. Detailed medical history, AIDS related signs and symptoms, recreational drug use and specific sexual behaviour information were collected from all high risk clients presenting for HIV diagnosis. At risk clients found to be HIV seronegative were requested to return for repeat testing each 3 months. Clients found to be seronegative by ELISA on early testing while seropositive on follow up were investigated for risk behaviour. Stored sera were tested for the presence of p24 antigen. All clients received risk reduction and supportive counselling on all visits. Results. Since March 1985, 9286 clients were tested and 5315 follow up tests performed. 47 clients seroconverted; 40 (85%) homosexual, 4 (9%) homosexual-IV drug users, 2 (4%) female heterosexual partners of IV drug users and 1 (2%) bisexual male. 50% reported unprotected anal sex after their initial test, 6% reported no unprotected anal sex other than on a single occasion when a condom broke, 21% had no risk behaviour since their initial test and 23% remain unclassified. No patients had any evidence of prolonged antigenaemia. 11 patients had a history of an acute mononucleosis type illness at time of seroconversion. Conclusion. While no evidence for prolonged antigenaemia prior to seroconversion was demonstrated, repeat testing of high risk individuals is indicated. Detailed, explicit safer sex counselling and correct use of condoms needs to be emphasised. 373 [Page 374](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/372) 6081 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) Spicehandler, R. Chieffe, D. Ryan, S. Shetty St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center, New York, NY Objective. To evaluate the populations who present for HIV testing and counseling at a designated hospital AIDS center. Method. We evaluated 359 patients who registered in the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening clinic at the Spellman Center for HIV-Related Disease of St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center in New York City (a designated AIDS center), between 8/87 and 1/88. All patients received confidential pre-test and post-test counseling by dedicated AIDS team members. 78/359 (22%) patients did not take the test after pre-test counseling. Results. The total number who were tested for HIV by Elisa and Western blot analysis was 281. The total number of the tested group confirmed HIV positive was 133 (47%) and HIV negative 148 (53%). Analysis by risk groups indicated the following HIV positivity intravenous drug users 65/81 (80%); of high risk individuals 13/21 (62%); persons with no stated risk factor 10/109 (9%). Our overall rate of 47% HIV positive was higher than the 10% reported rate at the New York City health department anonymous HIV test sites. Conclusion. The high rate of HIV positivity reflects both effective pre-test counseling of low risk individuals and self selection by high risk individuals to a designated hospital AIDS center. 6082 DIVERSITY 3N RISK FACITORS, Timothy M. Sankary, M.D., M.P.H. AIDS Prevention Center, San Francisco, CA Objective. To assess the seroprevalence, risk factors, sense of urgency and utility of those seeking an HIV anti body test. Methods. We screened and counsel ed 1054 adul ts with the ELISA method, confirmed if reactive, by j rnurnoflourescent assay (IFA). Results. 6.1% were initially reactive on ELISA, of which 33.3% of femal es and 80.0% of mal es were confirmed positive by IFA. 3n men with initially reactive (\"]nconc3usive\") ELISA results, 33.3% of men (HM), 77.7% of bisexual men (BM) and 90.9% of gay men (GM) were confirmed positive. Sexual preference was a significant risk factor in men where 8.8% of GM, 7.4% of BM and 0.2% of HM were positive (p<.001). Age, race, relationship status were not si gni fi cant whil e 3V drug abuse, hemophi - 3ia, and transfusions were too rare to measure the risk. A sense of urgency was preval ent, causing 52.8% overall to request same day test results, which was independent of all other factors. Overall, 26.5% asked to have a hi gh-security photo certi fi cate of negative results, which was independent of age, sex, race, or actual result outcome. In men, 29.8% of HM and 25.7% of BM asked for the certificate, much more than GM (11.9%) (p <.01). Particularly in HM, the desire for the certificate was higher among divorced (38.0%), unattached singles (32.7%) and attached singles(31.4%) than married men(18.3%)(p<.02) Concl usion. These data underscore the need to individualize the approach to H3V antibody testing and counseling and to diversify the options available to different segments of the population. Notes: 6083 HIV ANTIBODY TESTING IN A MINNEAPOLIS GROUP PRACTICE David N Williams, S Strickland, A Raze Park Nicollet Medical Center, Minneapolis MN, U.S.A. Objective. We retrospectively evaluated how HIV antibody (AB) serology was undertaken in a 250-physician group practice in an area with low incidence of HIV infection. Data was used to develop guidelines for HIV AB testing in our clinic setting. Methods. HIV AB tests were identified from the central clinical laboratory. Testing was done at a regional reference laboratory. Specimens repeatedly reactive by ELISA and confirmed by Western Blot assay were defined as positive. Data was analyzed from June 1985 to Nov. 1987. Results. Between June 1985 and Nov. 1987, 2556 specimens were analyzed. 27 (1.1%) were positive. The number of tests performed increased from 91 in 1985 to 371 in 1986 and to 2094 from Jan. to Nov. 1987. Analysis of 1436 tests on 1421 patients between Jan. and Sept. 1987 follows: MDs % MDs in Tests HIV AB Tests Ordered Spe- Ordering Specialty Ordered Per Per Specialty cialty Test Ord.

In a homogeneous suburban group practice the number of HIV AB tests varied enormously between physicians in any given specialty. Most tests were ordered by primary care physicians (91.2% of tests between Jan. and Sept. 1987). Data on informed consent, appropriateness of HIV AB testing, development of guidelines for testing, education, and counseling will be presented. 6084 THE \"COUNTY HOSPITAL\": MAJOR PARTNER IN AIDS EDUCATION/PREVENTION VS MISSED OPPORTUNITY Naiel Nassar, N. Flynn, S. Jain, J.Carlson University of California, Davis, Medical Center, Sacramento, CA., U.S.A. Our university hospital (UCDMC) provides the majority of medical care received by indigent persons in our area (pop. 1 mil). We have offered HIV antibody testing to individuals at risk for HIV infection since 11/84. We have studied the results of this hospital-based testing program in order to develop a more unified, comprehensive approach to AIDS prevention in our community. A total of 2,694 HIV-Ab tests were performed between 11/84 and 8/87 on patients seen in hospital or clinics of UCDMC, exclusive of the AIDS Clinic. 10% were positive by ELISA and Western blot assay, more than double the + rate at the area voluntary test site. 42% of the testees used IV drugs (IVDU). 10% of IVDU were +, more than four times the rate among IVDU attending drug treatment programs (DTPs). 80% of the + IVDU were male, of whom 37% were also gay/bisexual. Blacks and females constituted a significantly higher proportional hospital IVDU than DTP IVDU. Drugs of choice were also different in these populations (heroin, 31 vs 65%; cocaine 31 vs 7%; amphetamines 11 vs 7%). 8% of all testees were gay/bisexual men, of whom 37% were +. A signed consent was obtained from almost every subject tested, but physicians rarely documented that prevention education had been provided to these testees. HIV testing at hospitals serving indigent persons in U.S. cities access large numbers of a different HIV high-risk pop. than do DTPs or voluntary test sites. Based on these findings, we developed an intensive AIDS testing and education/prevention program for high-risk patients at UCDMC, funded by local health department. 374 [Page 375](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/373) 085 SEROPREVALENCE OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) OF PARTURIENTS AT UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, NEWARK, NEW JERSEY, U.S.A. E Connor**, L Goode*, S Morrison*, M Schneck*, M Oxtoby *** and J Oleske*. *UMD-NJ Medical School, Newark, NJ, **Children's Hospital of NJ and ***Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA Objective To determine seroprevalence of HIV in peripartum women in an inner city hospital serving a population at high risk for AIDS. Methods Between 9/21/87 & 12/21/87 maternal, infant or cord blood sera were obtained within 24 hours of delivery and anonymously tested for presence of HIV antibody (Ab). Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) was performed by standard methods (Abbott Labs). All positive ELISA's were tested by Western Blot (WB) (Biotech/Dupont). Results 604 Specimens were obtained from 617 deliveries (98%). 31 were reactive by ELISA (5.13%); 26/31 (84%) positive ELISA's were confirmed by WB, giving a 4.3% seroprevalence. The other 5 WB's demonstrated the following bands: 1-24, 2-gpl20, 1-gpl60 and 1 none. Conclusion Seroprevalence of HIV of parturients delivering at this hospital is 4.3%. The CDC recommends routine testing of all childbearing women with identifiable risks, and/or who live in high HIV prevalence areas. Despite aggressive teaching and testing programs by the pediatric study team during this period, only 9/26 HIV positive patients were identified. Our high rate of seroprevalence supports routine testing of women in high risk areas. 6086 SEROPREVALENCE OF HIV INFECTION IN UNSELECTED HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS. Fred Gordin, C. Gibert H. Hawley, A. Willoughby*. Veterans Administration Medical Center, Washington, D.C., *N.I.H., Bethesda, Md. Objective: To determine the nrevalence of HIV infection in unselected hospitalized patients, and correlate this information with sociodemographic data and risk factors. Methods: All consecutive, unselected hospital admissions were interviewed concerning medical history and risk factors for HIV infection. A serum sample for HIV antibody testing was obtained and linked by code to this information, after which individual identifiers were removed. Results: Serum was obtained from 616 (97%) of 636 consecutive admissions. 23 patients (3.73%) were confirmed HIV positive, only 9 of whom were known to be infected on admission. Infected persons were more likely to be Black (91% vs 64%) and younger (mean age 43 vs 57) than uninfected persons (p<.02). Risk group correlation is below: HIV Status of Population by Risk Group Risk Group HIV (+) HIV (-) Total Homosexual* 6 (55%) 5 11 (1.8%) IV Drugs* 13 47 (20.3%) Unable to talk/missing 1 ( 1%) 75 76 (12.3%) * 3 persons both Homosexual and IV Drugs Conclusions: The prevalence of HIV infection is high in hospitalized patients due to a larne number of persons in high risk groups (35.0%). Universal Blood/Body Fluid Precautions are warrented based on this data. Voluntary testing of at risk patients will be beneficial in detecting unsuspected infection. Notes: 6087 PREVALENCE OF HIV-ANTIBODIES AMONG HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS IN NORWAY Jan H Dobloug*; Johan Bruun*; Jan Hospital, Oslo, Norway During a one-month period in early 1988, all patients admitted to Dept. of Medicine and Dept. of Surgery at Ullevaal University Hospital in Oslo, the largest hospital and also the largest emergency hospital in Norway, were tested for antibodies to HIV. Before testing, all patients had given informed consent. Those who did not agree to be tested, were tested anonymously. This sero-prevalence study, comprising approximately 1600 patients, and to be repeated in 1-2 years, was aimed at determining 1) the prevalence of HIV-antibodies among our hospitalized patients (a high-prevalence area in Norway) 2) the attitude to routine HIV-testing in hospitals Almost 100% of the patients volonteered to be tested. The results, with prevalence data from different subgroups of patients (e.g. patients suffering from violence injuries, self-induced intoxications, car accidents, patients having received blood transfusions, and \"ordinary patients\") will be presented. 6088 SEROPREVALENCE OF ANTIBODIES TO THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) IN APPLICANTS FOR MARRIAGE LICENSES IN ALABAMA Richard Moody*, Lu Ann Foss*, Jeannine Parker*, William Calan*, Donald Williamson** *Alabama Department Health (ADPH), Bureau of Clinical Laboratories (BCL), **ADPH, Bureau of Disease Control and Rehabilitative Serv. Objective. To estimate the seroprevalence of anitbodies to HIV in marriage license applicants (a presumed heterosexual, low risk population) in a low prevalence AIDS area. Methods. All specimens submitted to the ADPH-BCL for routinely required premarital syphilis serology from 1 November 1987 to 31 January 1988 were tested for HIV antibodies in an anonymous study using Abbott enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Repeatedly reactive specimens were tested by Western Blot. Result. 4694 specimens yielded the following: REsult Number Percent EIA+/Blot+ EIA+/Blot- 4623 Total 4694 100.00 Conclusion. The observed proportion of EIA+/Blot+ specimens was 0,21%. This result falls between the observed seroprevalence among Alabama military recruits (0,1%) and Alabama alternate test site volunteers (3,2%). 375 [Page 376](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/374) 6089 AIDS RELATED CHANGES IN DISEASE PATTERN IN COPENHAGEN. Carsten Determination of antibodies against Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-ab) was introduced in 1984 in a major STDclinic in Copenhagen attended by about 10000 new patients each year. From 1984 to 1987 the proportion of patients examined for HIV-ab rose from 7% to 32%. The overall incidence of HIV-ab positivity decreased from 30% in 1984 to 3% in 1987, the combined result of decreased HIV-ab positivity among tested high risk-groups and increased HIV-ab screening among low risk-groups. HIV-ab positivity has been largely confined to homosexual men and drug addicts. However, since 1985 21 of 2623 (0.8%) heterosexual non-drug addicts tested were found HIV-ab positive. During the period 1984 to 1986 the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases most frequently encountered among high risk-groups, i.e. syphilis and gonorrhoea, decreased by 64% and 41% respectively. Whereas diseases most often diagnosed in low risk-groups, i.e. condylomata acuminata and genital herpes, were seen with increased frequency amounting to 70% and 34% respectively over the same period. Addition of HIV-infektion to the list of sexually transmitted diseases requires allocation of resources to the STD-clinics enabling these clinics to handle this new problem. Screening for HIV-ab of all patients attending a STD-clinic must be considered and in our area it was found to be a cost-effective routine. 6090 ANTI-HIV PREVALENCE IN STD CLINIC PATIENTS IN BRITAIN PHLS Collaborative Study by Consultants in Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinics and Public Health Laboratories in 14 Towns Dr Sheila Polakoff,Central Public Health Laboratory, London, England.

NOTE: Similar findings in limited study in 7 Towns in 1986 COMMENT: This study should: 1) Give early warning of heterosexual spread of HIV infection. 2) Provide an on-going account of the upper limit of anti-HIV prevalence in heterosexuals and homosexuals in Britain. Notes: 091 HIV SEROLOGY IN PUBLIC HEALTH CLINICS IN SOUTH CAROLINA Wayne D. Johnson*and**, G.A. and Environmental Control, Columbia, South Carolina; **University of South Carolina School of Public Health, USA Objective: To determine the demographics and secular trends in HIV infection among public health clinic patients for sexually transmitted diseases (STD), maternity, and tuberculosis (TB) in South Carolina. Methods: During a one-week study period in April 1987, all blood samples drawn for syphilis serology from new STD patients were also tested anonymously for HIVAb. Similar studies had been performed in TB and maternity clinics. Prevalences were calculated by age, sex, race, and geographic regions of the state. This survey was repeated in all three populations in January and February 1988. Results: In April 1987, 12 (1.4%) of 783 STD samples were confirmed positive for HIVAb. Seroprevalence was 2.3% among male patients and 0.6% among females, a ratio of 3.8:1. Seroprevalence was nearly identical between races overall, but among teenage black males, 4 (3.8%) of 104 were positive. Syphilis serology by RPR in the same population yielded 31 (4.0%) reactive tests. Nine of 610 TB patients (1.5%) and 0 of 200 maternity patients were HIVAb positive. The 1988 survey will also be analyzed and presented. Conclusion: There is a continued risk among STD patients of infection by HIV. Teenagers at STD clinics may be at particularly high risk. Seroprevalence among maternity and TB patients is expected to be lower than in STD patients. 6092 PREVAENCE OF ANTIBODY TO HIV AT A CLINIC Worm, Birgit Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark. Testing for HIV antibodies in Denmark is on a voluntary basis after informed consent. The exact prevalence of HIV antibodies among high risk and low risk groups is unknown the latter however supposed to be very low. An increasing spread of the HIV infection among the heterosexual population may first be manifest among persons with a high prevalence of other sexually transmitted diseases. At the outpatient Venereal Disease Clinic of Copenhagen previous studies from 1985 and 1986 showed that on reguest up to 30% of the patients refused HIV testing. As the attitude to HIV testing alter it was decided to elucidate this together with the prevalence of HIV antibodies. During periods of 3 weeks, repeated every third month, all persons that apply for an examination are requested to have a blood test for HIV antibodies and to give data about sexual orientation, prostitution, drug abuse and sexual contacts with high risk groups. Data from October 87, January 88 and April 88 including about 1.2oo persons will be presented. The preliminary data from October 87 showed that among 358 previously untested persons HIV testing was accepted by 92% of heterosexual men, 93% of homosexual men and 95% of wnmen. Two homosexual men was HIV positive, all other persons were HIV negative. Testing with anonymous data was wanted by 7% of heterosexual men, 14% of homosexual men and lo% of the wonen. The study shows an increased acceptance of HIV testing. The HIV antibody status can however not be clarified in 5 to lo% of these persons a fact that lower the epidemiological value of the results. 376 [Page 377](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/375) 6093 Prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection in the Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Clinics of New Jersey. C.G. Freund, Pizzutti, F. Wah, M.J. Coye. New Jersey State Department of Health, Trenton, NJ. State and Local Health officials have recently been encouraged by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to expand HIV counseling and testing activities beyond the present AIDS Counseling and Testing (CTS) sites. Considering the need for planning data, we decided to gather existing information by anonymously testing sera already submitted to our State Laboratory for syphilis serologic screening. Overall, 3,407 specimens were tested from 32 different STD clinic sites in 16 New Jersey counties. There were 163 (4.8%) sera positive for HIV infection by repeated ELISA and Western Blot confirmation. Age was known for 3,299 (96.8%) patients and the mean age was 26.4 years. Gender was recorded for 3,393 (99.6%) and 66% were males, 33.6% were females. Counties in close proximity to New York City and with known I.V. drug abusing populations had the highest seropositivity rates (Essex = 13.2%; Hudson = 10.4%). HIV seropositivity was also strongly associated with syphilis seropositivity. The relative risk of infection with HIV was about four times (RR = 3.88) greater in patients seropositive for syphilis. Males had a higher seropositivity rate than females (5.8% vs. 2.8%)and the highest seropositivity rates were found in 35-39 year olds (11.1%) and 40-44 year olds (10.9%). Since population sizes differ for each STD clinic, we calculated a seropositivity rate of 8.5% for this population based upon a weighted average. These data demonstrate a high prevalence of HIV infection in the STD clinic population and suggest the opportunity for disease prevention through aggressive educational approaches in this setting. 6094 HIV-I INFECTION IN PERSONS ATTENDING A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE CLINIC IN NEW YORK CITY Rand L. Stoneburner*, MA Chiasson*, AR Lifson**, D Hildebrandt,* S Schultz*, HW Jaffe** *New York City Dept of Health, NY, ** CDC, Atlanta, GA OBJECTIVE To determine HIV-1 seroprevalence and risk factors associated with infection in a sexually transmitted disease clinic. METHODS Volunteers were enrolled in the study from 12/86 to 12/87. HIV antibody status was determined, and information on risk factors for HIV infection was collected by an interviewer using a structured questionnaire. Seroprevalence of a representative sample of the entire clinic population was also measured using discarded blood, but no risk information was obtained. RESULTS Data from 1169 of 1200 volunteers were analyzed and their seroprevalence was 11%, while that of the representative sample was UTV-1 SEROPREVAT.(ENE BY RTSK \"... ~LI~) ~~---- Male Tot.

Miller* Paul ilfred Van Gorp*, Barbara Visscher**, Jan Dudley**. *UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, ** UCLA School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California Objective. To develop a computerized neuropsychological (NP) screening battery for early identification of cognitive decline in HIV-infected individuals. Methods. A cohort of 451 HIV-1 seropositive (SP) and 508 seronegative (SN) gay men (the Los Angeles cohort of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study) were administered a computerized NP screening battery together with a conventional NP screening battery. Both the computerized and conventional batteries were designed to tap critical cognitive domains representative of NP deficits found in HIV-orelated encephalopathy, including motor speed, verbal memory, rapid visual scanning of verbal and nonverbal materials, and divided attentional skills. Subjects were designated as 'outliers' on the conventional and computerized measures if they scored two or more SDs below the mean for SN's on 2 or more measures. Results. The computerized and conventional screening measures agreed on outlier status 85% of the time. Further, 60% of individuals identified as outliers by the computer screen were identified as having equivocal or aLnormal clinical neuropsychological or neurological exams on follow-up. Additional validation data are being collected Conclusion. These findings suggest that computerized techniques may prove practical as a rapid, efficient and inexpensive screening tool for detecting early cognitive decline in HIV-infected individuals. 7002 EARLY MARKERS OF HIV INFECTION OF THE CNS. Lionel Resnick*, WW Tourtellotte** J Berger****, P Shapshak**. *Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami Beach, Florida, ** VAMC Wadsworth, Los Angeles, CA, ***Rancho Mirage, CA, ****Univ. of Miami, Florida. USA Objective. To investigate the prevalence and prognosis of early laboratory markers of HIV infection of the CNS in HIV seropositive patients. Methods. HIV isolation from blood and CSF, intra-BBB IgG synthesis (rate, CSF IgG oligoclonal bands (OB) )and abnormal serum IgG bands (ASB) were investigated in 50 HIV seropositive patients in various stages of disease development. Results. 50 patients were classified as HIV seropositive (sero+ without AIDS or ARC), having ARC or AIDS. 43% of the patients had neurologic abnormalities. (18% of sero(+) 64% of ARC, 43% of AIDS). 12% had virus cultured from the CSF (all stages of disease development). 65% had a significantly elevated intra-BBB IgG synthesis and 75% had CSF IgG OB. ASB were detected in neurologically asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. 93% of the patients had elevated intra-BBB IgG synthesis. Conclusion. Elevated intra-BBB IgG synthesis and abnormal serum IgG bands are indicative of early CNS infections by HIV and are markers of impending neurologic dysfunction in asymptomatic patients.

To assess the diagnostic value of brain stereotaxic biopsy in AIDS patients with focal neurologic manifestations when combined sulfadiazine-pyrimethamine treatment has been ineffective. Methods. 23 AIDS patients presenting with focal neurologic manifestations based-Onr-linical and/or CT scan data received 3g sulfadiazine and 50 mg pyrimethamine daily for a presumtive toxoplasmosis. In 19 cases this treatment was successful. Indication for brain stereotaxic biopsy where in 4 cases absence of improvement after a 3 weeks therapy. The samples were examinated by standard histopathological techniques and a combination of in situ immunological and hybridization diagnostic techniques for HIV, MV ard JC virus. Results. In 2 cases standard histopathology showed lymphoma and in one case an adenocarcinoma metastatic localizatition. In the fourth patient demyelinisation and no evidence of CMV, HIV and JC virus were observed on the biopsy sample. Howewer subsequent autopsy revealed evidence of infection by these three viruses. Conclusion. Our study confirms the high prevalence of toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients with focal neurological manifestations (82%). In case of failure of antitoxoplasmosis treatment, stereotaxic biopsy may easily diagnose opportunistic malignancies thus allowing radiotherapy. Place of this technique in the diagnostic of viral infection of CNS remains to be evaluated. 7004 AFrequency of chronic HIV encephalitis in Federal Republik of Germany Objective. More than 90% of AIDS patients show involvement of the brain. The virus invades the central nervous system (CNS) early in systemic infection frequently leading-to progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms up to severe dementia. To get more information about the onset and early clinical manifestation of chronic HIV encephalitis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 37 asymptomatic antiHIV seropositive patients (WR I and II) were analysed. Methods. CSF and serum was analysed in respect to the following methods for the characterization of the cellular and humoral immune response within the CNS: mononuclear produced HIV-antibodies by ELISA, evaluation of CSF and serum antibody spectrum by Western blot, and p24 antigen detection in CSF and serum. Results. Evidence for chronic HIV encephalitis could be demonstrated in 25 of 37 asymptomatic patients (=--67%) by intrathecally HIV-antibody synthesis and/or p24 antigen detection in CSF. In addition, 4 patients showed unspecific inflammatory signs (pleocytosis, activated B-lymphocytes) indicating a beginning encephalitis in the cellular, prehumoral stage. Conclusion. This study demonstrates a frequent HIV invasion of the brain even in the asymptomatic carrier stage. Neuropsychiatric abnormalities were rarely found in these patients, but psychological testing revealed frequent memory disturbances. 378 [Page 379](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/377) 7005 7005 NEUIROLOGICAL INVOLVEMENT IN INFANTS WITH PERINATALLY ACQUIRED HIV INFECTION AND THEIR CONTROLS. Joseph C. Marcus*, Butler* J.H. & S. Landesman*. * SUNY, Brooklyn. ** NIH, Bethesda. Objective. To ascertain the earliest neurological changes and progression of disease in infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Method. Infants at risk of developing AIDS and their controls- born of drug-abusing or Haitian women from our antenatal clinics- are undergoing paediatric neurologic examinations at birth, and then at 3-monthly intervals, according to defined protocols. The examiners are blind to the serological status of the mothers and infants. Results. To date, 75 infants have been seen. No specific pattern of neurological findings has been noted; tone disturbances are the only common abnormalities. Examinations from birth through 1 year are normal in 104 instances, and abnormal in 73. Relating these findings to the serological results shows no statistical differences between the infants of HIV -positive and -negative mothers. At 9 months of age, 100% (4/4) of infected infants are abnormal, compared to 33% (7/21) of HIV -negative babies. By 1 year, 100% (4/4) infected infants, compared to 36% (5/14) HIV -negatives are abnormal (neither statistically significant, p<.10). Conclusion. Neurological changes in the study Infants do not relate to serological status during the first year of life. By 9 months, all infants subsequently shown to be infected, are abnormal. As numbers increase, we hope to be able to delineate a syndrome-complex, diagnostic of early CNS disease, and demonstrate its natural history. 7006 REPCTICN-TIvE IN PATIENTS WITH HIV INFECTICN Michael Perdices, 3. Tebbutt, David A. Cooper. N-MRC Epidemiology Unit, Sydney, Australia. Objectives: To measure response latency for simple (SR) and choice (CR) reaction time tasks in patients with HIV infection. Methods: Three groups of homosexual men with HIV infection (Ab+=10, ARC=6, AIDS=6) were ccrrpared with 8 age-matched HIV Ab negative hrrosexual men on two reaction-time tasks. There were 5 trials, each containing 10 target stimuli in the SR task, and 10 trials, each containing 5 target stimuli randomly interspersed with 5 non-target stimuli in the CR task. The dependent measures (in milliseconds) were the mean SR and CR response latencies (SRL and CRL respectively), over all trials. Results: The for (SRL and CRL repeated factor), showed that although there were no significant betweengroup difference in SRL, CRL was significantly greater than SRL in each group. However, the SRL-CRL difference was significantly different between the groups. Crrpared to controls, patients had a greater SRL-CRL difference. There was a significant linear increase in the SRL-CRL difference with disease progression. Although patient groups did not differ significantly from each other, the SRL-CRL difference of the AIDS and ARC, but not the Ab+ patients, was significantly different to that of the control subjects. Conclusion: HIV infected patients show an impairment of infrnat.ion rocessing biity on ccrrplex.but not simple tasks, that is relate o disease progression. Notes: 7007 SUBCLINICAL CEREBRAL DYSFUNCTION IS COMMON AMONGST VOLUNTEERS HIV INFECTION. M.Field, J.Tate, H.Kunze, I.H.Frazer. Lions of Queensland, Woolloongabba,Qld. 4102. Australia. Twelve asymptomatic subjects ages 21 to 40 years, with serological evidence of HIV infection but without laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency were examined for evidence of cerebral dysfunction using standard neuropsychological methods. Significant deficits of memory and frontal lobe function were found in 5 subjects. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination was performed on the subjects; all but one had measurable CSF titres of antibody to HIV. Oligoclonal immunoglobulins unique to the CSF were found in 5 subjects, and four had neuropsychological abnormalities. CT and NMR scans of the brain were normal in all subjects tested. These results support other evidence that HIV is neurotropic and capable of directly inducing brain damage even in immunologically normal subjects early in the course of HIV infection, and suggest that assay of CSF for 'unique' oligoclonal immunoglobulins, in parallel with tests of memory and frontal lobe function, are the most sensitive indicators of subclinical HIV induced cerebral damage. 7008 FREQUENT EARLY INFLAMMATION IN CSF IN HIV-POSITIVE PERSONS AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OFHIV-ENCEPHALOPATHY K.M.EINHAEUPL The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of neurological syiptois and signs as well as CSF-findings for the diagnosis of HIV-encephalopathy. In 46 consecutive HIV-positive patients of a the following procedures were performed: neurological examination, EEG,CCT,CSF-study (white cells, protein, oligoclonal bands). From CSF and serum samples intrathecal specific HIV-antibody synthesis was estimated by a) comparison of western blots in CSF and serum b) calculation of CSF/serua indices using Elisa titers. Patients with opportunistic CNS infections were excluded. Examining the central nervous system, CSF-findings suggestive of an inflammatory CNS-disease were found in 77% of HIV-positive, clinically and immunologically healthy persons. In stage WR 1 the CSF abnormalities of the inflammatory type (WBC )5, positive oligoclonal bands, spezific HIV-antibodies) were the only pathological finding in 69%, in stage 2-5 in 55%, in stage 6 in 38%, whereas in none CCT or EEG was the single abnormality. Clinical syaptoms and signs, if present,were mild in all WR-1 patients, in most WR 2-5 patients and in many NR-6 patients. Assessment of HIV-encephalopathy on clinical grounds was therefore very inhomogenous. It is concluded, that already 2/3 of HIV-positive otherwise healthy persons suffer from HIV-encephalitis before clinical symptoms or immundeficiency. The high frequency and the early occurence of inflammatory CSF-findings has to be considered when the diagnosis of HIV-encephalopathy has been made. 379 [Page 380](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/378) 7009 HIV AND HEARING Atkins, R Boswell, Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center, Lackland AFB, Texas, USA Objective. Review of 138 enlistment and subsequent HIV+ audiograms to evaluate for SNHL. Methods. Retrospective review of 138 military enlistment and HIV+ audiograms for threshold shifts of at least 15dB with subsequent 20dB or worse hearing, qualifying as clinically significant SNHL. Decibel hearing comparisons are made by ear and frequency of HIV+ to a large, age-matched military population, to evaluate for statistically significant SNHL. Age, Walter Reed Stage, syphilitic serology and occupational noise exposure are evaluated. Results. Mean interval between audiograms is 5.7 years. Six patients were excluded for history of middle ear disease. Thirty of the remaining 132 HIV+ qualified as clinically significant SNHL; only two of which have positive syphilitic serology, and eight hold occupational noise exposure jobs. Thirty five HIV+ have positive syphilitic serology. There are no significant differences in age, WRS, lymphocyte counts or CSF between HIV+ with and without SNHL. Twenty five HIV+ with SNHL between 20-34 years were compared by ear and frequency to 80,000 age matched military controls, with statistically significant HIV+ SNHL demonstrable at most frequencies, p<0.05. Conclusion. HIV infection produces clinically and statistically significant SNHL. Audiometry should be added to testing battery on detection of positive HIV serology. 7010 TRAER CLADOSPRIOSIS MICKING TOXOPLASMOSIS IN E Lopez*, G Lasala*, M Kanzer**, J Parisi**, M De Vinatea**, AMacher** *Puerto Rico Medical Center, San Juan, Puerto Rico **Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC USA Objective. To describe the first case of intracerebral cladosporiosis in a patient with AIDS. Methods. We studied the clinical, radiological, and histopathological presentation of intracerebral cladosporiosis in a patient with AIDS. Results. A 38-year-old drug abuser presented with fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, and left sided weakness. He had papilledema, facial nerve palsy, left homonymous hemianopsia, hemianesthesia and hemiparesis. A computed tcmographic scan of the head revealed ring enhancing lesions in the right temporal lobe, thalamus and midbrain, with compression of the right lateral ventricle. He was seropositive for HIV and was empirically treated for suspected toxoplasmosis. He became disoriented, comatose and died. Postmortem examination revealed a 6.0 by 5.5 centimeter grayish lesion in the right hemisphere that began at the level of the anterior ccamissure and ended at the third portion of the occipital horn. The lesion involved the right thalamus, internal capsule and peduncle, lenticular nucleus and hypothalamus. A left pontine lesion extended into the fourth ventricle. Microscopic sections revealed suppurative necrosis with numerous pigmented, brown-walled, budding yeasts and hyphae typical of Cladosporium sp. Conclusion. These findings are characteristic of intracerebral cladosporiosis and demonstrate the nonspecificity of neuroradiologic findings and the inportance of histopathologic confirmation in patients with AIDS. Notes: 7011 DEVELOPMENTAL DECLINE IN UNINFECTED INFANTS BORN TO HIV-INFECTED MOTHERS Ron Kletter*, R Jeremy**, C Rumsey**, P Weintrub**, M Cowan** *BAART-FACET and **Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA USA Objective. To define early developmental changes in infants with congenital HIV infection. Methods. As part of a prospective study of infants born to IV drug-using HIV infected women, we assessed their mental development using the Bayley exam. 4 infants were infected with HIV (POS); 12 were uninfected but born to infected mothers (NEG); and 10 were uninfected born to uninfected mothers (CONT). We followed the Mental Development Index (MDI) scores over time. Results. We found that NEG infants deteriorate with age, in contrast to CONT infants who maintain development at age level. The developmental pattern of NEG infants resembles that of POS infants. 8/12 (66%) NEG infants had a pattern of declining MDI scores with age vs. 0/6 CONT infants. Decreasing MDI scores were seen in 2/2 POS infants with repeated exams (2 other infants had only one exam). Conclusion. The adverse effects on the mental development of uninfected infants may relate to in utero exposure to HIV even in the absence of viral infection or other covarying environmental factors. 7012 DO NEUROPSYCHIATRIC MANIFESTATIONS OF HIV DISEASE RESPOND TO S. Burton**, Stephen's Hospital, London ***Southampton General Hospital, Southampton U.K. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the effect of AZT treatment on neuropsychiatric function. METHODS. 8 Homosexual men with ARC and subjective complaints of cognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms were evaluated prior to starting AZT treatment, with a neuropsychological and psychiatric test battery also used in our prospective study of neuropsychiatric manifestations of HIV infection. The same test battery is now being administered to the 8 subjects after 4 months of AZT treatment. RESULTS. The initial assessment shows that all the subjects are of average or superior intellectual ability. Most (6 out of 8) however show a marked impairment in the Digit Symbol subtest of the VAIS-R. Anxiety and depression scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory are high in 5 out of 8 subjects. First and second test results and serological data will be presented and compared. CONCLUSION. Although testing is still in progress, early results suggest AZT can improve some some of the neuropsychological disfunction in the short term. As well as direct antiviral effect other possible confounding issues will be discussed. 380 [Page 381](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/379) 7013 SINGLE University of Innsbruck, Austria Objective. SPECT - a useful method in the differential diagnosis of dementia - was performed in 13 patients with AIDS dementia. Methods. There were 7 homosexuals, 5 drug abusers, and one patient infected by heterosexual transmission. Seven patients suffered from a mild dementia, and 6 patients were judged as moderate demented. IMP was used as radiopharmaceutical in all patients, HM-PAO scans were performed additionally in 5/13 patients. In all patients follow-up examinations and repeated CT scans were carried out during a period between two and six months. Six patients underwent additional MRI examination. Results. CT showed a diffuse cerebral atrophy in 9/13 patients, MRI exhibited atrophy in two and a leukoencephalopathy in another two cases. SPECT revealed Dathologic findings in all patients, either multiple focal lesions or single uptake defects. Follow-up examinations showed significant deterioriations of the prior SPECT findings correlating with the clinical picture. Conclusion. Although not specific for AIDS dementia SPECT findings sensitively show pathologic changes even in the early stages of the disease. Our data indicate that both disturbance of cerebral amine metabolism and alteration of local perfusion share in in the pathophysiology of AIDS dementia complex. 7014 CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM LESIONS IN AIDS: DIAGNOSTIC ASPECTS AIDS by HIV itself,opportunistic pathogens,and neo plasms.We investigated type and prevalence of CNS involve ment in AIDS patients observed in western Veneto region during the period 1984-87.Adequacy of diagnostic tools was evaluated as well.

Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) is commonly elevated in the serum of AIDS patients and has a high predictive value for the development of AIDS in HIV-seropositives. A preliminary study was undertaken to determine the range of values of B2M in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and their relation to serum values in a number of neurological conditions complicating HIV infection, with particular attention to its diagnostic value in brain lymphcma and the AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC). Methods. 37 samples of CSF fraom 36 neurologically symptomatic patients at various stages of HIV infection and suffered several neurological symptoms and disorders were analyzed for B2M by radioinmunoassay. Concomitant serum B2M levels wre available in 30 patients. Of 11 patients diagnosed as suffering brain lymphama, histological confirmation was available in 7. Results. Neurological # B2M CSF/serum B2M headache 10 3. 1+1.0 0.8+0.2 Conclusions. CSF B2M is frequently elevated in HIVinfected and AIDS patients compared to normal controls (laboratory normal <2mg/l). While highest values were found in lymphctna, similar elevations were noted in other conditions. Also, a CSF/serum ratio >1 was most common in lymphana, but not confined to that condition. Cognitively Normal 2 1 4 CONCLUSION: Infection with HIV-1 is associated withdiffuse brain involvement, disrupting both subcortical and cortical areas. Individuals may demonstrate SPECT abnormalities early in infection, before there is evidence of cognitive impairment on NP testing. SPECT may be useful in predicting those individuals at ris: for developing CNS ccnplications. 381 HIV-INFECTED WITHOUT AIDS-RELATED DEMENTIA (ARDC) H.-D. *Inst. f. Medical Virology & Immunology, **Neurological Clinic, University of Essen Med. School, ***Neurological Clinic, University of Aachen Med. School, ****Inst. f. Laboratory Medicine, Municipal Hosp. Heilbronn, FRG. Objective and Methods. To assess the clinical significance of anti-HIV antibodies measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of HIV-infected patients, the relative concentrations of anti-HIV in relation to equal IgG contents in 44 pairs of CSF and serum samples from 31 patients were determined by serial dilutions in an antiHIV ELISA (Abbott, Dupont). Differences between CSF and serum anti-HIV concentrations were expressed as intrathecal measured by oligoclonal bands in isoelectric focussing (IEF) or by a method developed by H. Reiber to describe the protein profile in CSF (J. Neurol. 224: 89-99, 1980) were related to the presence of symptoms (polyneuropathy, encephalopathy, meningitis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, lues or ARDC). Results. Q-HIV ranged from 0.7 to 16 (median 1.7). Six of 7 patients with ARDC, but only 7 of 23 patients with symptoms different from ARDC showed Q-HIV values of 2 or higher (p<0.01). The Reiber method and IEF similarly indicated IgG synthesis in CSF, but no correlation was found here to the presence or absence of ARDC. Conclusion. A Q-HIV value over 2 may indicate an HIV infection of the central nervous system. Determination of Q-HIV may therefore facilitate the choice of treatment of neurological symptoms in HIV-infected patients. 7018 IMMUNOGLOBULIN CONTAINING CELLS (ICC) IN CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) AS EARLY INDICATOR FOR AN OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTION OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM IN HIV-POSITIVE PATIENTS Peter Rieckmann*, T. Weber, L. Daloull* C.Gilles * of Neurology and* Laboratory of Neurochemistry, University of G6ttingen, West Germany Objective. To evaluate a simple procedure for the detection of opportunistic infections of the central nervous system (CNS) in HIV-positive patients. Methods. Intracellular Immunoglobulins (Ig) G, A, and M were analyzed in CSF cells from of 21 HIV-positive patients in all stages of the disease and compared to intrathekally synthesized HIV-specific antibodies. Results. ICC positive for IgG were found in 14/21 patients. Intrathekal synthesis of HIVspecific antibodies could be demonstrated in 13/21 patients No IgA and/or IgM positive cells were found in stages I and II. IgA and IgM positive ICC were only found in a patient with a cytomegalovirus encephalitis. Conclusion. Using a simple and inexpensive technique it seems to be possible to differentiate an inflammatory pleocytosis in HIVencephalitis by IgG positive ICC only from a pleocytosis in HIV positive patients with opportunistic infections of the brain by IgG, IgA and/or IgM positive ICC. Notes: 7019 INTERVAL CHANGE IN CLINICAL AND CSF PARAMETERS IN HIV+ PATIENTS R. Brey, D. Marshall, W. Cahill, R. Zajac, R. Houk, R. Boswell. Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center, Lackland AFB, Texas, USA. Objective. To describe changes in clinical and CSF parameters over one year in 57 HIV+ patients. Methods. CSF studies (wbc, protein, oligoclonal bands, IgG, IgG synthesis rate), neurological and general physical exam findings and peripheral immune function were assessed by initial evaluation and at one year follow-up in 57 HIV+ patients and interval changes were determined. Results. Fifty three patients had some abnormality on either initial (CSF-1) or repeat (CSF-2) study: CSF-1 abnormal/CSF-2 was normal in 6, CSF-1 was normal/ CSF-2 was abnormal in 14 and in 33 both had some abnormality. Only four patients had completely normal CSF studies on both occasions. Clinically, 29 patients remained stable (22 asymptomatic [AS]; seven with lymphadenopathy [LA] and 28 progressed [25 AS to LA]; three to systemic symptoms or AIDS). Neurologic symptoms were present in 4 and developed during followup in five patients. The changes in CSF parameters were variable and did not correlate with systemic or neurologic symptoms. The mean white cell count was highest in the AS group and CSF immunologic abnormalities were of greater magnitude in the LA group, but neither reached statistical significance. Conclusion. The data demonstrate early and persistent CSF abnormalities in HIV infection which are not well correlated with systemic or neurological disease. 7020 PRECLINICAL DYSAUTONOMIA IN autonomic nervous system (ANS) have been noticed in a few cases of AIDS.In a preliminary research we have found in 2 cases of 6 drug addicts HIV positive subjects an altered heart-rate answer to deepbreathing:others 2 were borderline and 2 normals.In this investigation we present the results on 24 drug addicts (17 males,7 females) without symptoms or signs of autonomic neuropathy,treated with Methadone. 14 were HIV positives and 10 HIV negatives. Methods.We have studied the ANS function with the 5 tests of Ewing & Clarke:heart-rate response to Valsalva manoeuvre,to deep breathing and to standing up,and blood pressure response to sustained handgrip and to standing up. We have judged the normal state or the ANS involvment at different degrees by the combined results of these 5 tests. Results. 4 of 14 HIV positive subjects present severe involvment and 2 early involvment. 6 are normals and 2 have an atipical pattern. 2 of the 4 subjects with severe autonomic neuropathy belong to the IVo of CDC classes, 2 to the III0 class.1 of the 2 with early involvment and 3 of the subjects with normal response belong to the III0 class:all the others to the II class. All the tests performed on the 10 HIV negative subjects are normals. Conclusion. These results confirm the involvment of ANS in the HIV neuropathy and the relevancy of the tests for dysautonomia to evaluate the progression of HIV infection, 382 [Page 7021 COHORT STDY (MACS) William R.

This study describes our assessment of electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy HIV- infected individuals. mthBoE. EBG's were performed on 136 healthy HIV-1 seropositive (SP) and seronegative (SN) homosexual men participating in the MACS. All records were read by one observer (EN) masked to all clinical details except age and ranked according to the degree of abnormality. Subjects with AIDS were excluded from analysis. R isults. EEG abnormalities were identified in 6 of 51 (12%) of SN subjects compared to 17 of 85 (16%) of SP men. This difference was not statistically significant. Of interest, anterior-midtenporal minor slow and sharp activity was observed in 12 subjects, 10 SP (mean age 37) and 2 SN individuals (mean age 38, one aged 50). Conclusions. In this group, EBG abnormalities were infrequent and occurred independently of HIV-1 serostatus. In addition, these data suggest a trend towards more frequent anterior-midtesporal slow and sharp activity in healthy HIV-1 infected men. This pattern has been associated with early cerebrovascular disturbances after age 50, however, its significance in this setting is uncertain. Sequential studies and correlation with other imaging modalities will determine the sensitivity of EBG for early detection of HIV-1 encephalopathy. 7022 HIV 2 INFECTION IN A HETEROSEXUAL FRENCH MAN WITH MENINGOENCEPHALITIS AND HIS SYMPTOM FREE PARTNER. J. BERTHERAT*, D. SICARD*, A. BAETZ*, D. GUETARD**, S. CHAMARET**, *Department Departement d'oncologie virale. CASE REPORT: A white heterosexual french man aged of 33 years lived in Tchad, Cameroon (1981), Central Africa (1982) and Tahiti (1985 and 1986). His symptoms started in 1986 with incontinence and personality changes. In July 1987 gait abnormality with dysarthria, progressive forgetfulness and confusion appeared. The examination revealed spatial disorentiation, frontal release signs and spastic paraparesia. No lymphadenopathy or opportunistic infection. Magnetic resonance imaging p26); RIPA synthetic antigen. Transcriptase reverse activity from peripheral blood lymphocytes detected after 15 days. T4 lymphocytes = 104/ul and T4/T8 < 0.1.His wife who always lived in France has no symptom. Her serum reacted againts HIV1 = 491/ul and T4/T8 = 1. CONCLUSION: HIV2 should be suspected in patient presenting only with neurologic symptoms even if they have never been in West Africa.

Purpose of the study was to determine the clinical value of CT and MRI in the diagnosis of cerebral manifestations in AIDS. Methods. 52 patients with prooved or presumed CNS-manifestations in AIDS or ARC were included in this study. Examinations using CT (3 rd generation scanners, plain and contrast enhanced scans) and MRI (0,5 T Magnetom\"; SE 1600/35,70; SE 400/30; FLASH 315/14, plain and Gd-DTPA enhanced) were performed within a maximum time interval of seven days. Results. * CT and MRI normal: 21 patients. * CT and MRI show pathological findings with equal sensitivity: 8 patients. * CT and MRI show pathological findings, MRI superior to CT, e.g. in terms of number of detected lesions: 16 patients. * CT normal, only MRI reveals the lesion: 7 patients. this group: 2x toxoplasmosis, 2x 3x meningitis.) Conclusion. Specificity of both compared imaging modalities is limited. In diagnosis and follow up of cerebral manifestations in AIDS, MRI is the method of choice.

To investigate the natural history of CNS involvment in patients with HIV infection. Methods. Thirty AIDS patients (CDC group IV C-l or IV D), 10 patients CDC group IV A or IV C-2 and 20 patients CDC group II or III, were enrolled in a prospective study of CNS involvment in HIV infection. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR), Computerized Scanning (CT) and clinical neurological examination were done every four months in group IV C-l/D, and about every six months in the other groups. Results. In no case was CT or clinical examination abnormal in patients with normal MR.

P.M. Trotot, C. Sandoz-Tronca, Paris, France. Objective: To study the natural history of Central Nervous System (CNS) infection by HIV from early stages of the disease on. Methods: Since october 1986, a cohort of 50 sero-positive patients belonging to CDC groups II and III, has been constituted. Follow-up comprised clinical examination, psychometric testing, extensive biological testing and CNS Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) every six months with sagittal T1 weighted and coronal T2 weighted sequences. Results: Initial examination demonstrated that 11 patients (22 %) had one or sevral high signal intensity areas (HSIA) of small size in the subcortical white matter analoguous to those observed in multiple sclerosis. Such lesions were not observed in healthy seronegative individuals in the same range of age. Among the patients who have been examined two or three times, evolution of the lesions follows three different lines: diminution, stability or increase in size and/or number. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that CNS may be involved early in the course of HIV infection. Nature of HSIAs is as yet unclear. They may represent scars attesting of primary infection of brain tissues or initial lesions that will further lead to the developpement of AIDS dementia. 7026 MRI DEECTED HIV RELATED PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES OF THE BRAIN IN RELATION TO IMMUNOLOGICAL DEFICIENCY A. Sonnerbora. S. Britton, J Saaf. Psychiatry, Institute, Goran's Hospital, Dept of Infectious Diseases, Karolinska Institute, Roslagstull Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Objective. To study the occurrence of pathological changes in the brain of patients in different stages of HIV infection using a new imaging technique based on ultra low field MRI and computer assisted classification. Methods. Sixty-four patients in different stages of HIV infection participated in the study. The patients were devided into four groups based on the absolute numbers of T-lymphocytes and CD4 - lymphocytes. The duration of the infection was defined as the period between seroconversion and the occasion for the MR examination. Brain pathologies were detected and characterized from MR scans using a recently developed procedure of computer assisted classification. Results. Most of the detected aberrations exhibited a significant relation to the stage of HIV infection. Focal pathologies.e.g. abscesses, cortical atrophy and enlargement of the ventricles, were most pronounced in patients with more advanced immunodeficiency. More subtle changes, such as demyelinisation of the white matter, were detected in all groups The degree of these white matter lesions was related to the duration of the infection. Conclusion Tissue characterization by ultra low field MRI in combination with computer assisted classification is sauseful method in the study of brain lesions in HIV infected patients. Pathological changes were detected to different extent in all stages of the infection. Notes: 7027 NON-INVASIVE CHARACTERIZATION OF WHITE MATTER DEMYELINISATION IN PATIENT WITH AIDS.. Saaf. K Kristensson, A. Sonnerborg, L-0 Wahlund, L. Wetterberg. Karolinska Psychiatry, St Goran's Hospital, Dept of Neuropathology, Huddinge Hospital, Dept of Infectious Diseases, Roslagstull Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Objective. To compare the histopathological characterization of white matter demyelinasation with the use of a new non-invasive characterizing technique based on MRI and computer classification. Methods Using a unique combination of ultra low field MRI and computer assisted classification white matter lesions were detected and characterized in ten patients with AIDS. In three of these patients a post mortem histopathological examination was also undertaken. Results. All ten AIDS patients showed marked pathological changes in the white matter of the brain.as judged from the MR examination. The changes were detected predominantly in the frontal areas of the brain. In severe cases almost the entire white matter was affected. The comparison between the results obtained with MRI and the histopathological examination showed a good agreement between the two methods for detecting HIV related demyelinisation of the white matter in the three patients studied. Conclusion. Ultra low field MRI in combination with computer assisted classification is a unique non invasive technique for detecting HIV related white matter demyelinisation in situ. 7028 ULTRA LOW FIELD MRI OF THE BRAIN IN HIV INFECTED TRANSFUSION PATIENTS Yvonne Freund *, Jan S f *, Lars-Olof Wahlund Lennart Wetterberg *, Ove Hospital, **Department of Infectious Diseases, Roslagstull Hospital,Stockholm Obiect To study possible structural changes in the brain with MRI technique in a group of patients infected with HIV by transfusion. Method Four out of ten HIV infected women with a range of 67 years to 74 years of age (mean71 years) were available for examination with an Ultra Low Field Magnetic Resonance Imager (MRI) operating at 0.02T (Acutscan 110). The patients were examined three times during one year. The degree of structural changes (central and peripheral atrophy) were rated independently and blindly by two raters according to a MRI-rating scale. The patients were infected 25 months to 53 months prior to their first MRIexamination. They had received a range of 335 ml to 1310 ml erythrocyte-concentrate and two of them received an additional transfusion of 570 ml and 646 ml blood plasma respectively. Results A comparison of brain morphology was made between the patients and a group of age-matched healthy controls (average 74 years) and no significant changes were found (Mann-Whitney test). Nor did the brain of each patient show any significant structural changes between the examinations one year apart (Sign test). Conclusion Although this group of patients received a large dose of infected material no structural changes in their brains were detected. This might be due to the period of observation and/or the selected group of four patients studied. Possible subtle changes in discrete areas of the brain is being evaluated using computer assisted tissue characterisation based on the estimation of the magnetic relaxation times T1 and T2. 384 [Page 385](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/383) 7029 ACQUIRED IMMUNE S.Novak Neurological Center,Houston Texas U.S.A.

To define the relative frequency of motor abnormalities in the 'bedside' neurological examination in HIV-infected individuals with and without clinically significant cognitive impairment. Methods. 139 first neurological evaluations undertaken in the presence (clinical referral) or absence (prospective evaluation, protocol screening) were available for this study after exclusion of patients with confounding neurological or systemic illnesses. 68% of the patients had AIDS; none was receiving AZT. Standardized neurological history and examination forms were used and patients were assigned a clinical staging of dementia (none, mild, moderate or severe). Only 1 patient was 'severe'; he was abnormal in all examination catagories. A control group of seronegative gay men was also studied. Results. HIV-NEG HIV-POS: SEVERITY OF DEMENTIA CLINICAL ' None' Conclusions. Neurological signs are frequent in advanced HIV infection and correlate with the degree of dementia. Their frequency in nondemented patients possibly reflects 'subclinical' disease. Notes: 7031 STANDARDIZED NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE AIDS DEMENTIA COMPLEX: EVALUATION OF 2 INSTRUMENTS AND SCORING METHODS Richard W Price*, B Brew*, D Ornitz*, A Sadler*, Neurology*, Biostatistics Laboratory**, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York Objective. We have developed very brief (MICRO) and short (SCREEN) instruments to assess the presence and severity of the AIDS dementia complex (ADC) for epidemiological, natural history, therapeutic and clinical studies. We present a first evaluation of these instruments applied to a group of HIV-infected, largely AIDS patients. Methods. The 2 instruments represent subsets of an evaluation which include standardized neurological history and examination and neuropsychological tests. They were scored according to predetermined methods which assign patients to the nonADC or ADC groups. Results were then compared to an overall neurological clinical rating score of cognitive or motor (or combined) impairment. Results. MICRO (n=103) SCREEN (n=89) Clinical Rating nonADC ADC nonADC ADC Cognitive: (% of subjects) 'Normal' 79 21 90 10 Mild 20 80 29 71 Mod.-Severe 0 100 0 100 Cog. & Motor: 'Normal' 84 16 96 4 Results of correlations using clinical Motor impairment were similar to the Cognitive score shown. Conclusion. Both instruments provide useful screening methods, but suffer both 'false positives' and, in the mildly demented group, 'false negatives'. They provide a first step in an iterative strategy to: 1) evaluate markers for subclinical disease, 2) asses individual test components and 3) modify the scoring systems. 7032 NEUROLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDRCME: ANALYSIS OF 40 PATIENTS Guillermo Garcia M.D. Enrique Huerta M.D. J.Roberto Trujillo M.D. Neurology Service of the Instituto Nacional de la Nutricion \"Salvador Zubiran\" Mexico City,Mexico. Forty patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome had complications affecting the central or peri pheral nervous systems or both.The risk from 23 -67 (mean 34 years).Neurological complications were of five kinds(l) Infections included subacute encephalitis possibly attributable to viral infection in 13 patients and due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 3.Cryptococcal meningitis in in 3.and Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in 1 patient (2) Tumors consisted of primary lymphoma of the brain - in 1 patient.(3) Mielopathy in 1 patient.(4) Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 6 patients,postherpetic neuralgias in 2,palsy of the 70c.n. in 4 and palsy of the 60 c.n.in 1.(5) Others conditions included 6 patients suffered retinitis possibly attributable to CMV infection labyrinthitis in 1,parkinsonism in 1 and psychiatric - disorders in 7 patients.This series shows that 33.2/o - (40p) of patients with AIDS(total:120) have neurologic illness the representing manifestation. A-25 of Neurology* and Medicine**, Harlem Hospital Center, and the HIV Center for Behavioral and Scientific Studies, Columbia University, New York, USA. To date studies of HIV-related neurologic disease have been retrospective and have included mostly homosexual patients. We prospectively evaluated 194 consecutive adult in-patients with either AIDS (122), ARC (69), or positive HIV antibodies (3). 154 (79%) were parenteral drug abusers (DA). 176 patients (91%) had neurologic symptoms or signs. Presentations included focal cerebral lesions (CL), non-focal altered mentation (AM), cerebellar ataxia (N), and cranial neuropathy (CN). No significant differences were evident in the prevalence of neurologic presentations between subgroups: TOTAL AIDS ARC/HIV DA Non-DA No (%) No(%) No (%) No (%) No (%) CL 89 (46) 56 (46) 33 (46) 71 (46) 18 (45) AM 46 (24) 31 (25) 15 (21) 37 (24) 9 (22) CA 4 (2) 3 (2) 1 (1) 3 (2) 1 (2) M 11 (6) 11 (9) 0 8 (5) 3 (8) N 24 (12) 10 (8) 14 (19) 19 (12) 5 (12) CN 2 (1) 0 2 (3) 1 (1) 1 (2) Conclusion: (1) Neurologic disease in HIV infection is more common than previously reported, and (2) the prevalence of different HIV-related neurologic presentations is similar in drug abusers and non-drug abusers and is independent of the stage of HIV disease. 7034 NEUROLOGIC ABNORMALITIES AND EXPRESSION OF Marguerite, Institut Paoli Calmettes***,Marseille-France. Objective. To determine a possible correlation between HIV related neurological manifestations and the evidence of intra-blood-brain barrier (IBBB) synthesis of HIV specific antibodies (HIVAb) and/or the presence of HIV antigen (Ag) compared to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the IBBB synthesis of IgG. Methods. We assayed 26 matched serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 20 patients with various neurologic symptoms. 19/20 were seropositive at time of the first lumbar punctur. One patient presented with accute meningoencephalitis coincident with seroconversion. IBBB synthesis of HIVAb was determined by comparing serum/CSF IgG ratio to CSF/serum ratio of the dilution giving the name optic density with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HIVAg were determined of HIVAb HIVAg Patients CSF I Subacute encephalopathy 1 1 1 1 II Peripheral neuropathy 5 0 4 5 III Tumor or infection of the CNS related to HIV infection 6 3 5 8 IV Myelopathy 1 0 1 1 V Aseptic meningitis 4 0 3 5 VI Normal neurologic examination 4 0 6 6 VII Total 21 4 20 26 Conclusion. Among patients with neurologic symptoms there is no significative difference for the IBBB synthesis of HIVAb between those with known neurologic disease and the others. IBBB synthesis of HIVAb and detection of HIVAg in the CSF seem to be necessary but not sufficient criteria for the causative role of HIV. Notes: 7035 MULTIMODAL EVOKED POTENTIAL STUDIES IN PATIENTS WITH HIV INFECTION. G. Farnarier-, H. Somma-Mauvais-, H. Objective: of multimodal evoked potentials (MEP) to detect neurological subclinical lesions in 70 HIV subjects. Methods. 4 modalities were used: flash-visual evoked potentials (F-VEP); pattern-visual potentials (SEP) and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP). Patients were seen at different stages of the infection: 11 asymptomatic subjects, 20 AIDS-related complex (ARC), 13 AIDS without neurological signs and 26 AIDS with neurological signs. Results. 1) Abnormalities in latency and in morphology were found with the different modalities: F-VEP in 33% cases; 39,6% and BAEP in 40.5%. 2) Abnormalities were found in all the HIV groups: 63,6% of the asymptomatic group; 60% of the ARC group; 84,6% of the AIDS group and 88,4% of the neurological group. These results were compared with clinical and paraclinical data. Conclusion. we emphasize the interest of MEP in the discovery: - of new neurological locations in AIDS with neurological signs, - of subclinical neurological symptoms in AIDS or ARC and also in asymptomatic HIV positive patients. 7036 A NEUROLOGIC LONGITUDINAL \"La Sapienza',' Rome, Italy. Objective A longitudinal study of 60 HIV-patients in different clinical stages of HIV-1 infection was carried out to evidence the pre-clinical and early CNS involvement. Methods All the subjects (20 AIDS, 25 ARC and 15 LAS) were submitted to the following examinations: clinical neurological evaluation, EEG, multimodal evoked potentials (MEP), psychcmetric tests (Wechsler-Bellevue and Benton), CT scan and/or NMR. The follow-up lasted 5 to 12 months. The above-mentioned examinations were periodically repeated at fixed intervals and every time a clinical stage worsening occurred. The results of each evaluation were related to the clinical stage of HIV infection. Results The MEPs proved to be the most sensitive diagnostic tool to reveal a pre-clinical CNS involvement. Psychometric tests and neuroimaging showed a positive correlation with the clinical evaluation and with the stage of HIV infection. Nevertheless, a few exceptions were found. Conclusions Our results suggest the existence of an asymptomatic CNS impairnent during HIV infection. The expediency for a strict neurologic surveillance of HIV-infected subjects from the earliest stages of the infection and the therapeutical resuIl/outccme will be discussed. 386 [Page 387](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/385) PATIENTS: J Neurology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, **Department of Psychology New York Hospital, New York Objectives. Clincally detectable eye movements abnormalities (EMA) are comnon in HIV infection at various stages. We therefore attempted to: 1) document and quantify the EMA, 2) relate this finding to the degree of clinical neurological involvement. Methods. 31 individuals, who had not taken any medication in the previous 24 hours, were studied with an infrared recording technique, the results of which were then digitized on line at 250 Hz. 16 neurologically normal controls and 15 HIV-infected patients, 8 of whom were demented, were clinically staged according to EMA (0-2) and dementia (0-3). The corrective saccade (CS) frequency and the overall accuracy of pursuit (root mean square error or RMS) were computed. Results. 2 controls had abnormally high CS rates, 1 of whom also had an abnormal RMS. 11 HIV infected patients had abnormally high CS rates and of these, 6 had abnormal RMS scores. CS rate was significantly correlated with clinically detectable abnormalities and the degree of dementia. Conclusions. CS occur frequently in HIV seropositive individuals and are usually clinically detectable. It seems likely that these are related to HIV infection, either directly or indirectly, and as such they may serve as markers of early HIV-related neurological disease though their prognostic importance is uncertain. 7038 NEURORADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS IN HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS RELATED TO NEUROLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION AND INTRATHECAL HIy-ANTIBODY SYNTHESIS Irina E ovaara, E J Lah evirta Departments of Neurology and Radiology, University of Helsinki, and Kiveld and Aurora Hospitals, Helsinki MRI and/or CT findings of 47 HIV-infected patients were related to neurological dysfunction and intrathecal HIVantibody synthesis. Ventricular enlargement, brain stem atrophy, and cortical atrophy predominantly on temporal lobes were more frequent in patients with cognitive and/ or behavioral abnormalities than in non-neurological patients (p< 0.05-0.01). Periventricular white matter changes and lesions in both lentiform nuclei were found in MRI of only 2 demented patients. Among the patients with intrathecal HIV-antibody synthesis all but 2 neurological subjects had MRI/CT abnormalities, while none of the non-neurological subjects showed such changes. Central and cortical brain atrophy correlated positively with the severity of general HIV infection (p<0.05-0.01). In addition, both central brain atrophy and cognitive impairment showed positive correlation with intrathecal HIV-antibody synthesis (p<0.01). The results show that central and cortical brain atrophy as well as brain stem atrophy are frequently found in HIV-infected patients with cognitive and/or behavioral abnormalities. These changes correlate positively with the severity of HIV infection. However, intrathecal HIVantibody synthesis found earlier than neuroradiological alterations may indicate subclinical HIV disease of the brain. Notes: 7039 NEUROLOGICAL PROGNOSIS 1 YEAR AFTER RETROVIRAL EVALUATION OF CSF IN 60 PATIENTS INFECTED BY HIV D. Yittecoq*, JF. Mettetal*, Necker, ** I.Pasteur, Paris, FRANCE.) The central nervous system is frequently involved by HIY in AIDS. Isolation of HIY in the CSF may be helpful to confort diagnosis, however, such isolation has been sporadically noticed in healthy patients. Its significance is unclear. Objective: To evaluate prognosis (follow up>l year) of HIY isolation in CSF (reverse transcriptase activity)(RTA) in 60 patients at various stage of the disease staged according to the CDC criteria. Results: Among 21 cases staged 2 or 3, RTA was detected once (5%) and among 4 staged 4A, it was detected once (25%). Those 2 patients are still healthy 1 year later. Among 7 staged 48, RTA was detected in 3 cases (42%) and 1 reached to an AIDS dementia. Among 11 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma as the only manifestation of AIDS, RTA was detected in only 1(9%) who is still safe neurologically. Among 4 patients with AIDS without neurological involvment, RTA was detected twice (50%). One died a few months later, the other is safe neurologically. Among 13 patients with AIDS and neurological symptoms, RTA was detected in 7 (53%) who died in all cases with an AIDS related dementia. In 6 patients (4 AIDS and 2 KS) without CSF detectable RTA, AIDS related dementia occured later on. Conclusion: Isolation of HIY in CSF is of a poor neurological prognosis in patients with AIDS. However isolation of HIY is not always linked to a poor neurological prognosis in the following months particularly in patients with a better immunological status. AIDS related dementia may also occur in patients without CSF detectable RTA. Other markers of CSF involvment have to be searched. 7040 Im logical changes in CSF in HIV-1-positive patients - Sparaleters for predicting the development of neurological disorders (ND) A.Rolfs*,H.Htmpl*,G.Hffken***,G.Curio*,B.Zorr*,U.Junghan*,A.Krra* B.Trapenau*,M.Deppermaw *,P.Marx*. Steglitz.**Inst.for Clin.and Experimen. Virology. *** Department of Internal Medicine Because of the high orevalence of ND in the acquired imnunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) it is of great interest to find predictive factors whether and when a Derson will develop ootentially treatable disturbances of the central nervous system. Methods: Within the scoDe of a prospective study, we examined the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of clinically normal HIV-1-oositive oatients (n=42, Walter-Reed-classification I-III) every 6 months for HIV-1-cultivation, o24 antigen, antibodies against HIV-1 (Elisa, Western blot), cytology, determination of T-cell-surface phenotypes (OKT3,OKT4,0KT8,OKT11,OKB2,Leu-7,Leu-15,Leu-M1.), and the usual physical examination,cerebral carputer tmography and EEG were done. Results: During the last 19 months, 11 of the 42 investigated patients developed to the patients without ND (I) this group (II) showed in CSF a significant reduction of the T4/T8-ratio (0.21+ 0.08,-rean+ SD), a significant in-CSF, in 4/30 patients (13%) a positive cultivation. In the peripheral blood there were no significant differences for the T-cell-subsets and the cultivation results between the two groups. Conclusion: Since the determinations had been done 4 - 7 months before developing the ND, in other words in a clinically healthy state, the investigation of the T-cell-subsets, o24-antigen seems to be of value in predicting ND. It is necessary to proof in a randomized study whether patients with a low T4/T8-ratio and elevated Leu-7+cells in CSF profit by a drug prophylaxis against tox., the most frequent potentially tretable infection of the central nervous system in europe. 387 [Page 388](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/386) 7041 NEUROLOGICAL AND EEG FINDINGS HIV-INFECTION Ralf Schnurbus*, Virchow, Charlottenburg, Free University, Berlin Objective.

Lange, M.D., C.B. Britton, M.D. A.P. Hays, M.D., D.S. Younger, M.D. College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University, NY (USA). Objective: Clinical study of Neuromuscular disorders and HIV infection. Methods: Electrodiagnostic studies and histologic findings were correlated with clinical data in 16 patients. Results: Six patients with distal, symmetric painful neuropathy had AIDS and secondary opportunistic infections (01) at onset of symptoms. Electrical studies showed non-diagnostic mixed axonal and demyelinating features.In two, biopsies showed axonal degeneration. Two of three patients who had chronic progressive, symmetric polyneuropathy with leg weakness died of AIDS/OI within 7 months. In all, electrical studies were charateristic of demyelination. In one serial study, axonal features supervened. Pathology in this case showed epineural inflammation, primary demyelination and axonal loss while in another, pure axonal loss was found. Two of three patients with isolated mononeuropathy (1, cranial-VII; 2, peroneal) were otherwise aymptomatic and one had AIDS/OI. In one, EMG showed generalized neuropathy; nerve biopsy showed necrotizing vasculitis. Symptoms of multiple radiculopathy occurred in one patient, confirmed by electrical studies. One of three patients with myositis had self-limited recurrent myoglobinuria Conclusions: Except for the neuromuscular junction, the entire neuromuscular system may be involved in HIV infection. Electrical studies may not accurately predict the site of pathologic involvement which is often multiple. 7044 THERAPEUTIC APHERESIS IN THE MANAGEENT Neuropathology, Copenhagen 3: Institute of Neurophysiology, Copenhagen Autoantibodies against various nerve tissue components may cause peripheral neuropathy in some HIV infected patients. These antibodies can be removed by plasma exchange (PE). Indirect imnunofluorescence technique (IIF), using monkey nerval tissue sections as antigen, incubated with patients serum and counter stained with a rabbit antihuman IgG conjugated with flourescein isothiocyanate was used for screening. Neuropathologic, neurophysiologic and electron microscopic examinations were conducted to evaluate pathologic changes in sural nerve biopsies. Antimyelin, antiaxonal and antiendothelial cell antibodies were detected by IIF. Demyelination, axonal degeneration and cellular infiltrations were seen in sural nerve biopsies. A total of 10 sessions of PE were carried out every second day. Following PE treatment 3 of 5 patients were symptom free, one improved remarkably while no effect was noted by the last patient; these last two patients had extensive damage of their sural nerve. PE has proved to give encouraging results in patients with HIV peripheral neuropathy having autoantibodies against nerval tissue. 388 [Page 389](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/387) 7045 RESULTS OF FOR NEEROPATHY IN HEALTHY HIV-1 INFECTED HOMOSEKUAL MEN: THE MULTICENTER AIDS COHORT STUDY (MACS) Justin C. McArthur, DR Cornblath, JW Griffin, JH McArthur, RT Johnson, BF Polk. The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore MD, USA Objective. A longitudinal study is underway to determine the incidence and prevalence of HIV-1 related neurological disorders, including peripheral neuropathy among participants in the MACS. Methods. 148 HIV-1 seropositive (SP) and 100 HIV-1 seronegative (SN) homosexual men were screened for the presence of peripheral neuropathy using a standardized symptom checklist and an electronic device measuring vibration thresholds (Optacon). Individuals with ARC or AIDS were excluded from this analysis. 6llMltf. No significant differences were noted between HIV-1 infected and uninfected individuals in the prevalence of neuropathic synptoms. Optacon abnormalities were detected in 6% of both the HIV-1 SP and SN groups. Subsequent detailed clinical and electrophysiological testing disclosed no cases of peripheral neuropathies anmong HIV-1 SP individuals, although 2 had minor electrophysiological abnormalities. Among SN men, 2 had peripheral neuropathies attributed to alcohol or diabetes mellitus; 1 from undetermined causes. Conclusions. These results suggest that the prevalence of HIV-1 related peripheral neuropathy is low in healthy homosexual men. Sequential testing of this cohort will determine the incidence of peripheral nerve disorders. 7046 Comparison of HIV to Alzheimer's (AD) and Huntington's (HD) Differential Neuropsychological patterns. Pim Brouwers, E. Mohr, M. Hendricks, C. Cox, M. Young, I. Baron, P. Fedio, P. Pierce. Georgetown University Medical Center and National Institutes of Health, Washington, USA. One of the concomitants of HIV infection is the occurrence of central nervous system (CNS) disease even in patients without other opportunistic CNS infections. Although attempts to characterize the profile associated with the encephalopathy have been made, specific differential studies have not been conducted. Seventeen outpatients with HIV infection, not associated with IV-drug use and without a history of opportunistic CNS infections, were given a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. A similar battery was given to 13 AD and 13 HD patients as well as to 17 normal controls (NC), The groups were matched on education, and the AD and HD groups were also matched on Full Scale IQ (age corrected scores were used). A stepwise discriminant analysis was performed to obtain a rule which would classify patients as AD, HD, or NC, based on the data from these 3 groups. A classification function was obtained which had a 90.2% predictive accuracy (AD 84.6%; HD 84.6%; NC 100%) which is highly significant. This same function was then used to classify the HIV patients. Twelve (71%) were classified as NC, while 5 (29%) were classified as HD. No HIV patients were classified as AD. Measures of depression did not discriminate between HIV patients classified as HD or as NC. Variables which had the highest predictive value in discriminating between the groups measured memory (e.g. Memory Quotient and story recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale), and attention, concentration and speed (e.g. Digit Symbol test of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale). These preliminary data indicate that the neuropsychological profile of HIV patients with dementia is most similar to that of HD patients. This suggests that the HIV dementia has a subcortical (HDlike) rather than a cortical (AD-like) character which has been postulated previously.

Notes: 7047 7048 NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL IMPAIRMENT IN RELATION TO NEURORADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS IN HIV INFECTION SPECIFICITY OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IN HIV INFECTION. JK Levy*; F Fernandez+; FP Pirozzolo+. *The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research; +Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is known to affect the central nervous system. This infection not only can produce a profound impairment in neurologic status, but it has been implicated in the development of varying organic mental disorders (OMD) including dementia. We will outline patterns of cognitive and emotional disorders in one hundred and twenty eight HIV infected patients (LAS/ARC/AIDS). The occurrence of OMDs was 37% for all diagnostic groups. Dementia was diagnosed in 8% of patients. Of the demented patients six (67%) were demented at the time of the initial evaluation and three (33%) became demented during the study. Significant cognitive impairment of insufficient severity to warrant the diagnosis of dementia was found in a considerable portion of HIV patients. The nature of these patient's impairments was compared with that found in other neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. This comparison was made-in order to investigate the specificity of certain neuropsychological test marker variables for differentiating HIV primary dementia from other dementing conditions. Our results indicate that tasks which tax memory span or speed of cognitive information processing are significantly impaired in HIV related cognitive impairment. Unexpectedly visuographic, constructional and visuospatial abstract reasoning tasks (which are affected early in other dementing conditions) were spared. The nature of these patient's impairments will be presented. 1 1 2 tiainen, I.Elvaara, R.Rain and Radiology, University of Helsinki, KivelN and Aurora Hospitals, Helsinki. 41 patients at various stages of HIV infection were examined neuropsychologically and with MRI and CT. 11 of them had prominent neuropsychological abnormalities including moderate dementia in 4 subjects. Cognitive defects were found more frequently in patients at advanced infection(ARC,AIDS) compared to those at early infection(ASX, LAS) (9/14,2/27;' p<0.0005). The severity of cognitive decline correlated positively with the degree of central atrophy in both MRI and CT and cortical atrophy in MRI (p<0.001, respectively)but the less with cortical atrophy in CT (p0.01) and with parenchymal lesions in MRI(p<0.05). In addition, significant correlation was found between the cognitive defects and brain stem atrophy in MRI and CT (p<0.05,respectively) and lesions in cerebellum in CT( p<0.05). Correlation with brain atrophy was found most frequently in tests measuring language comprehension, speed of information processing and visual reproduction. Additionally several other tests including measuresjof verbal memory, visuomotor performance and visuospatial ability as well as voluntary motor movements of hands revealed correlation with atrophic changes of the brain. All the test results correlated most frequently with central atrophy of the brain. These data show that cognitive impairment is common in HIV infected subjects. The correlation of brain atrophy with cognitive defects further cogfirms the presetie of organic brain invo vement in HIV infection. 389 [Page 390](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/388) 7049 NEUROPSYCHOLOGY & MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING IN HIV **, J Hesselink**, Neurol, Univ of & St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, UK; **Univ of Calif, San Diego, La Jolla, USA; ***Univ of Michigan, Detroit, USA OBJECTIVE: To examine evidence for brain involvement early in the course of HIV infection. BACKGROUND: We recently reported rate of neuropsychologic (NP) impairment rises from 9% in HIV seronegative (HIV-) homosexual men to 44% in HIV positive (HIV+), relatively asymptomatic men. Rate for ARC was 54%; AIDS, 87% (Grant et al., Ann Int Med 107:828-836, 1987). Also, 9/13 AIDS patients and 5/10 ARC patients had MR abnormality. Here we report preliminary findings from a second cohort of HIV+ men. Of particular interest are MR data not available in the earlier study, on HIV+, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic men. METHODS: As part of an ongoing longitudinal study of NP, MRI, and psychopathology in HIV we now have data from comprehensive NP exams of 14 gay men in CDC class II/III, 5 in class IV, and 5 HIV- homosexuals. MR results are available for 14 class II/III and 3 in class IV. RESULTS: NP data were rated by a neuropsychologist blinded to group membership. Rates of NP impairment were 1/5 (20%) (IV). MR scans rated by a neuroradiologist blinded to group membership showed all 3 ARC/ AIDS patients had some atrophy and 2/3 had scattered high signal intensity lesions. Among HIV+, 10/14 had mild atrophy and 5/14 had parenchymal lesions. MR for seronegatives will be available in June. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data support our initial observations suggesting possible early brain involvement in HIV infection. 7050 NEUROLOGIC AND NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF EARLY HIV INFECTION Ann C Collier, R Coombs, W Longstreth, K Claypoole, D White, K Marivella, F Bahls, V Murphy, R Gerlach, H Handsfield University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA Obiective. To determine prevalence and characterize neuropsychological (NP) manifestations of Stage II/III HIV infection in the absence of overt neurological disease, compared to subjects without HIV. Methods. Comprehensive standardized history (hx), neurologic exam, and extensive blinded NP tests on all subjects; MRI scans and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HIV cultures and CSF p24 assays were done in HIV+ subjects. Results. To date, 32 homosexual men (21 HIV+, 11 HIV-), mean age 36.0 have been enrolled. The minimum duration of.IIV infection in HIV+ was 16-63 mo. Mean CD4 507 mild abnormalities (P-NS). NP tests showed impairment for HIV+ and HIV-, respectively, in: memory 3/9 vs vs 2/6. In HIV+ subjects, disease in 11/18 (61%), ventricular enlargement in 3/18 mg/dl, and 12/16 (75%) had positive HIV CSF cultures. Conclusion. CSF HIV infection, other CSF abnormalites, white matter lesions on MRI scan, and subclinical neurological and NP abnormalites are common in homosexual men with asymptomatic or clinically mild HIV infection. Determination of the significance of these findings will require additional case control and cohort studies. Notes: 7051 ROLE OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING IN HIV 705 jAND AIDS - CLINICAL MANAGEMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF ABILITY TO PERFORM WORK SKILLS A.E. Kocsis, J.Mann, V.Kitchen, J.Green St Mary's Hospital, London, England OBJECTIVE. Neuropsychological testing of HIV infected individuals has two roles: First, in clinical management, aiding diagnosis of AIDS Related Encephalopathy (ARE) and evaluating drug effects. Second, in predicting the extent to which sub-clinical cognitive impairment affects work skills - motor and intellectual. Decision making in these two areas require different information. Results from our prospective study of ARE are used to inform both areas. METHOD Using a comprehensive Neuropsychological test battery and measures of intelligence, anxiety and depression, 140 subjects (AIDS/ARC, Persistent Generalised Lymphadenopathy (PGL), Asymptomatics (AAP) and Controls) are monitored at 6-monthly intervals. Findings are correlated with Neurological Investigations, HIV antigen and antibody levels. Data was drawn from cross-sectional and first re-test data. RESULTS The battery shows highly significant group differences (p<.0001). Percentages of impairment within groups depend on criteria chosen and these must be considered carefully. A criterion of only 2% controls impaired gives PGL=21% AAP=30% AIDS/ARC = 44% impaired. However some tests, (e.g. Rey Auditory Verbal Learning, Digit Symbol) are influenced by anxiety, several by intelligence (Word Fluency, Trail-Making, WAIS Vocabulary) and onA (Trail-Making) by depression. Although large sample data can be statistically corrected, this finding reduces the value of such tests for individual diagnostic assessment. Data are presented on tests (e.g. CANTAB computerised battery) unaffected by any of the above variables, which show clear group differences and provide a reliable measure of change both for the effects of Zidovudine (N=30) over time and of change in state of individuals. CONCLUSION Tests showing differences between groups may be of little value in individual assessment if they are influenced strongly by mood and intelligence. Not all tests are influenced by these variables and careful selection of tests for clinical use is essential. In contrast, where work skills need to be predicted, both cognitive impairment and anxiety are relevant. 7052 EUROPSYCHOLOGICAL FIDINGS IN RELATION TO IJ4NOLOGICAL PARAMETERS S Medicine, *Medical Department A,Rikshospitalet, Oslo Objective.To study the association of different parameters of immune function with measures of CNS-functioning in persons with HIVinfection. Methods.36 HIV-positive persons seen at Medical Department A,Rikshospitalet, during 1986-87 were referred for neuropsychological testing. They were classified into 3 groups based on CDC,AIDS(n=14, 13 IV-C1 and 1 IV-D) ASYMPTOMATIC (n=17, 12 II and 5 III), and SYMPTOMATIC(n-5, 3 IV-A, 1 IV-B, and 1 IV-C2). Tests measured perceptuo-motor speed, attention, memory, verbal ability and nonverbal abilities. Immunological parameters included T4 and T8 cell counts in blood, and presence of HIV-antigen in serum. Results.Neuropsychological test results indicated that persons with impairment of CNS-function were found in all groups. Analysis of variance showed significant differences between clinical groups, with the AIDS-group scoring lower than ASYMPTOMATIC for perceptuo-motor speed, attention and memory. T4 cell count showed no significant correlation with performance neither in the total group nor in clinical sub-groups. Asymptomatic individuals with HIV-antigen perform worse than asymptomatic with negative antigen-test. High T8 cell count correlated with good test results for perceptuo-motor speed and memory, and this was seen both for ASYWPTOMATIC and for AIDSsubjects. Conclusion.The results indicate no relationship between degree of imnune deficiency (T4) and impairment of CNS-function. We found, however, a significant correlation of impaired T8 cell count to increased risk of impairment in CNS-function. HIV-antigen in serum may be associated with higher incidence of CNS-dysfunction in otherwise asymptomatic persons. 390 [Page 391](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/389) Immunology Dept. Policlinico H.-Milano, Italy. Objective.The evaluation of early clinical alterations in CNS from a direct HIV viral action in seropositive subjects without evidence of established AIDS. Methods.23 Asimptomatic HIV infected homosexual males were investigate using multymodality evoked potentials. Moreover the patients were subjects to: 1)Neurological objective examination;2) DSM III criteria diagnosis; 3) Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). Drugs -addicts and subjects with metabolic diseases known to affect the Evoked Potentials were not included. Results.No significant change of subcortical somatosensory conduction times was found in any patients. Cortical components of Somatosensory Evoked Potentials, and of a Pattern Reversal Visual Evoked Potentials appeared, at the opposite, to be frankly abnormal in 7 out of the 23 subjects. Finally, minor alterations affecting Brainstem Acoustic Evoked Potentials were identified in 7 other cases. Conclusion.These data suggest the subclinical functional impairments in the CNS of HIV infected subjects that seems to affect predominantly the cortical structures. 7054 NEUROLOGIC AND PSYCHIATRIC MANIFESTATIONS IN CENTRAL AFRICAN PATIENTS WITH AIDS DUE TO HIVI AND HIV2 L. Belec*, National Hospital Center, Bangui C.A.R. Objective. To describe and evaluate the frequency of neurological and psychiatric manifestations in African patients with AIDS. Methods. 93 African patients at the National Hospital Center, Bangui, were chosen according to the WHO clinical definition of AIDS and were confirmed to be HIV-1 positive (92/93) or HIV-2 positive (1/93) by Western blot. Patients were given both neurologic and psychiatric examinations. CSF analysis was performed in case of neuro-psychiatric signs. Results. 11 patients presented neurologic symptoms: 5 had focal processes associated in 2 cases with profound coma, 4 had cryptococcal meningitis, 1 demonstrated peripheral facial paralysis, and there was 1 case of abnormal movement. 4 patients presented psychiatric symptoms with behavioral disturbances which were manifested most commonly as apathy or withdrawal. A frank organic psychosis was observed in one case and the HIV-2 positive patient exhibited a stereotyped picture of severe dementia, mutism, incontinence, and paraplegia. CSF analysis was only helpful in the etiologic diagnosis of cryptococcal infection. The mortality rate in these 15 patients was 60 % during the 2-month study. Conclusion. In this series, neurologic and/or psychiatric symptoms were detected in 16 % (15/93) of African patients with AIDS. The frequency of neuro-psychiatric symptoms appears to be significantly lower in African AIDS patients than in Europe and the U.S. Notes: 7055 PEVAEN HIV ANTB and of \"Infectious Diseases, Niguarda Hospital - Milan - Italy. Objectives. We think that the presence of mental illness could be a supporting factor of typical behaviour of risk to contract the infection therefore giving this population exposier than the general population to HIVab+. Methods. In our psychiatric ward we routinely performe the VDRL and the HBSAg tests and,since the l-10-'87,we have been testing to HIVab all consenting hospitalized pts.. Results. We could carry out the HIVab test to 82% (97/118) of hospitalized pts. in our ward of which the 44% males and the 5/o females,the average age was 45,5 (range 20-86). The 7,2% (7/97) of pts. showed HIVab+ of which 5 were males and 2 females and their average age was 28,1 (range 20-36),all these pts. used intravenous heroine and only one had had homosexual intercourse too,2 of them (29%) were seropositive to the VDRL and the HBSAg tests too while the other psychiatric pts. showed the same situation only in the 1,1% of cases. These pts. were hospitalized for schizophrenia in 3 cases,for psycotic decompensation in borderline in 2 cases and for an attempt of suicide in 2 cases. Conclusions. The most important datum is,even if on preliminar results, the prevalence of the 7,2% of HIVab+ which is much higher than what has been found in the blood doners population in Milan that is the 0,1%. Therefore we believe that the HIBab test in a psychiatric ward must be suitably given to all consenting hospitalized pts.. 7056 Severe HTLV-I associated myelopathy in a of Neuroloay, Los Angeles, CA 90026. A 52 year old bisexual male was evaluated at UCLA for a ten year history of proaressive lower extremity weakness. In recent months the patient's motor weakness increased, accompanied by proqressive mental deterioration and intermittent urinary incontinence. In 1/88 the oatient developed a necrotizinn pneumonia and was noted to be seropositive for HIV. Physical examination showed asymmetrically decreased motor strennth, diffuse hypereflexia, decreased vibration and Position sense in both lower extremities. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid showed a nlucose of 39 mo/dl, total pr9tein of 78 mn/dl and a white blood cell count of 5/mm. (74% lymphocytes). Flectromyographic studies showed florid denervation in extremities, and nerve conduction studies showed decreased motor/sensory responses. The patient's serum and CSF was tested for antibody to HTLV-I an recoonized crossreacted with HTy-II and nan proteins, but not with the PTLVII p37 protein. Lymphoid cell lines established from the patient's peripheral blood are beinn characterized for HTLV-I and/or HIV production. The severe myelopathy in this patient may be a consequence of combined infection with HTLV-I and HIV. AIDS patients with unusual motor findings should be tested for concomitant HTLV-I infection. 391 [Page 392](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/390) 7057 LOWER LIMB SOMATOSENSORY EVOKED POTENTIALS IN PATIENTS WITH HIV INFECTION. McAllister RH, Griffin GB, Fowler CJ, Weller IVD, Harrison MJG, Departments of Neurology & Genitourinary Medicine, The Middlesex Hospital Medical School, London. Objective: To evaluate neurophysiological abnormalities as markers of subclinical neurological disease in HIV infection. Lower limb Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP) are said to be particularly sensitive for the detection of early myelopathy in these patients (1). Methods: The patients were the first 27 in a prospective neurological study of homosexual men with HIV infection. None had neurological symptoms. SEP to tibial nerve stimulation at the ankle were recorded at the level of the LI spinous process & at the vertex. There were 13 seronegative controls & 14 patients in CDC Groups II & III: these groups did not differ significantly in height. N20, P40 & inter-peak latencies were all within the reference ranges for our department, with no significant differences in mean latencies between groups. 7 of 8 patients in Group IV who were referred for investigation also had normal latencies, including 2 who were demented. One symptomatic patient had a significantly prolonged central latency: myelography showed spinal cord atrophy. Conclusion: We have not so far detected any subclinical myelopathy by this method, nor a trend towards increasing latencies in patients with more advanced disease. The study continues: additional results will be presented & this technique will be compared with others in the investigation of patients with HIV infection. Reference: (1) Helweg-Larsen S et al.

Michaels, S. Weiss, J. Oleske, R. Kapila University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ, USA Objective: To describe the first case of HIV-2-associated AIDS in the US, with cryptococcal meningitis and cerebral toxoplasmosis. Methods: 41 year old woman with recent pulmonary tuberculosis presented with severe headache 11 months after immigrating to New Jersey, USA, from Cape Verde Islands. A diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis was made based on CSF antigen titer of 1:64 and a positive culture. Brain biopsy of contrast-enhancing ring lesion (on CT) revealed Toxoplasma HIV-1 Western blot (DuPont) was indeterminate, with faint banding in the p25-26. region and definite banding in the p34 and p65 regions. Result: A clinical diagnosis of AIDS in a weakly HIV-1 seropositive Cape Verde native suggested the possibility of HIV-2 infection. Serum was sent to the CDC AIDS Group (Atlanta, GA), where HIV-2 EIA and HIV-2 Western blot (Genetic Systems) were positive. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first case of HIV-2-associated AIDS in the US, and it documents multiple CNS infections that have not been previously reported with HIV-2. The presence of HIV-2 in the US has important epidemiologic implications for our population. Notes: 7059 3 Hopital La Meynard, Fort de France. FRANCE Objective. To evaluate subclinical pulmonary involvement in patients with HTLV-I associated TSP. Methods. 21 black patients originated from Martinique (mean age: 48 years; 16 female, 5 male). Serum antibodies to HTLV-I were detected by ELISA and Western Blot assays in all cases. All patients were seronegative to HIV-1. Results. All patients were free of pulmonary symptoms and had normal chest X-ray. Thorax CT scan showed normal pulmonary parenchyma (9/10 cases) or mild interstitial pneumonitis (1/10 cases). Pulmonary function tests were normal (13/15 cases) or demonstrated a restrictive syndrome (2/15 cases). Blood T-lymphocytes subsets were within normal values in all cases. Type of cells recovered by broncho-alveolar lavage: (21 cases) + Cells/ml x 10 225 14/21 patients. Lymphocyte increased mainly consisted of T8 cells with decreased T4/T8 ratio (10/11 in 4/21 patients. Special staining for pathogens were negative in all cases. Conclusion. T8 lymphocyte alveolitis was detected in #SUNY Albert Einstein College of Medicine, N.Y. Objective: T) further characterize spinal cord pathology in infants and children with AIDS. Methods: We studied the spinal cords of 15 consecutive postmortem cases (ages 6-77 months). The children had been followed in a longitudinal study assessing CNS involvement in children with symptomatic HIV infection. Results: Clinically corticospinal tract (CST) signs had been a prominent feature in 14 of the patients. However the age of onset, rate of progression, severity of dysfunction and duration varied among patients. At postmortem ten patients had lateral CST degeneration; in 3 the anterior CST was also affected. Tract degeneration in 4 children was characterized by loss of both myelin and axons. In 6 children there was disproportionate loss of myelin relative to axons. Conclusion: Spinal cord pathology occurs in children with symptomatic HIV infection (67% in this autopsy series). Unlike adult patients with AIDS, this is not a vacuolar myelopathy and posterior columns are not involved. CST degeneration in some children may represent an axonopathy that is tract specific, and in some, there was evidence of developmentally-delayed myelination. The latter finding may reflect vulnerability of glia and newly formed myelin to direct or indirect affects of HIV infection. (NIH A120671) 392 [Page Stony Brook, NY Objective:To describe the spectrum of cerebrovascular involvement in 68 pediatric patients with symptomatic HIV infection. Methods:Longitudinal clinical evaluation, CT and MRI scan, arteriography, postmortem examination. Results:Strokes were documented 6 children. Diagnoses included: intracranial hemorrhage(2), and ischemic infarction(4). Two infants with catastrophic stroke [1], clinically silent event[1]. Ischemic infarctions occurred in a child with recurrent episodes of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection who developed hemiparesis and dysarthria. Autopsy documented VZV arteritis with multiple infarctions. A 2nd child presented with aphasia and right hemiparesis and subsequently developed left sided findings. Serial CT & MRI showed multiple infarctions; multiple infarctions of various histologic ages were seen at autopsy. A 3rd child with coexisting \"AIDS encephalopathy\" and quadriparesis developed CT evidence of thalamic infarction shortly before death. Infarction was noted at autopsy in a child with coexisting \"AIDS encephalopathy\" and hemorrhages and watershed infarction. Conclusion:6 of 68 children with symptomatic HIV infection had strokes(8.8%). Two children with hemorrhage had immune thrombocytopenia. Of 4 children with infarctions, 2 had arteritis & had vascular ectasia. (NIH A120671) 7062 PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY IN AN AIDS PATIENT Gerald L. Stoner*, S Lucas**, W Wamukota***, Inst. of Health, Bethesda, **London Sch. of Hygiene & Tropical Med., London, ***Makerere Univ. Med. Sch., Kampala, ****Univ. of Wisconsin Med. Sch., Madison Objective. To confirm the first diagnosis of PML in an African AIDS patient and to compare with PML elsewhere. Methods. Autopsy tissue was obtained from 22 AIDS patients dying in Kampala, Uganda. Onc was identified by conventional histology as probable PML complicated by both CNS cryptococcus and toxoplasmosis as reported previously (Lucas & Wamukota, 1987). A new double-label method was used to identify simultaneously glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of reactive astrocytes, and viral capsid proteins of the polyomaviruses. Serial sections were stained with luxol fast blue/H&E and Bodian to assess primary demyelination. Results. The immunocytochemical methods confirmed the first PML due to a polyomavirus in an African dying in Africa. Numerous focal demyelinative lesions were observed in subcortical white matter, sometimes with extension into gray matter. The GFAP staining showed a strong glial reaction which was present throughout the subcortical white matter, but was most intense in the polyomavirus-containing lesions. The agent responsible for the additional glial activation remains to be identified. Conclusion. PML is a complication of AIDS in Africa as it is in the USA and Europe. Further studies will be required to assess its prevalence, the identity of the polyomavirus involved (JC, BK or SV40), and the role of the intercurrent fungal/protozoan infections, as well as of HIV infection, in the reactivation of the DNA virus. Notes: 7063 TREATMENT OF CANDIDAL INFECTIONS WITH FLUCONAZOLE IN PATIENTS WITH AIDS OR ARC Henri Taelman, D. De Clercq, W. Avonds, D. Swinne & C. De Vroey. Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium Objective. To assess the efficacy, safety and toleration of fluconazole in AIDS or ARC patients with oro-pharyngeal candidiasis with or without oesophagitis. Methods. 12 patients with oro-pharyngeal candidiasis and 8 patients with oro-pharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis were treated with fluconazole at daily doses of 50 mg for 28 days. Patients were weekly examined for signs, symptoms, side-effects and haematological and liver toxicity of the drug. Mycological assessment included weekly microscopical examination and culture (cfu/ml) of mouth washings. Results. Resolution of symptoms and signs was obtained within the first 3 days of treatment in 18 patients. In 2 patients no clinical response was observed. Full clearance of yeasts was achieved in 14 patients and substantial clearance in 4 patients. No change of yeast load was observed in 2 patients; one had a dental device and the other was treated concomit antly with corticoids. Reversible alteration of liver tests was observed in one case. Conclusion. Fluconazole at daily doses of 50 mg for 28 days is a highly effective, often curative, safe drug in the treatment of AIDS or ARC-associated candidal oro-pharyngitis and oesophagitis. 7064 PATIENTS B. DUPONT, E. DROUHET, Xavier NASSIF Pasteur Institute, Paris, France Objective. oropharyngeal candidosis (OPC) and meningeal cryptococcosis in immunosuppressed predominantly HIV positive patients. Methods. OPC: 71 patients (61 HIV +) received FCZ 50 mg once daily for 5 days and then every other day for 10 days. Clinical and mycological control were done every 5 days. Results. In 100% of 42 symptomatic patients, clinical resolution thrush, glossitis, esophagitis and perleche occurred within 7 days. A marked reduction or eradication of oral yeast occurred in 74,6% of all patients. Conclusion. FCZ could be the treatment of.choice for OPC in AIDS, comparative studies are required. Methods. Cryptococcal meningitis: 16 patients with CSF positive culture for Cr. neoformans were treated: AIDS, 12, kidney transplantation, 3,none, 1. Oral FCZ was given at a dose of 50-400 mg daily (mean: 150-200 mg) for 10 to 135 days (mean 56 days). Results. Four patients failed to respond with positive CSF culture after 50 to 60 days of daily dosage with 150 to 400 mg. Two patients are not evaluable: one on a low dose of 10 days duration, one who died at day 18 with acute intracranial hypertension. Five patients converted to negative CSF culture: 3 AIDS patients, including 2 with relapsed meningitis and 2 kidney transplants. Five AIDS patients are under treatment with negativation of CSF culture at day 30 or 60. Longest follow-up periods are 3 to 11 months with a FCZ maintenance therapy. Conclusion. We think that fluconazole may be an alternative therapy to intravenous amphotericin B in cryptococcal infections.Optimal dosage, duration, and maintenance therapy remain to be defined. 393 [Page 394](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/392) 7065 LOW INCIDENCE OF EARLY RELAPSE IN CRYPTOCOCCAL MENINGITIS AFTER EXCLUSION OF PERSISTENT SYSTEMIC & GENITOURINARY INFECTION. S BOZZETTE, R LARSON, J CHIU, J TILLES, J LEEDOM, JA UCI). the a 12-wk double-blind study of fluconazole to prevent relapse of cryptococcal meningitis. Method: AIDS pts who had clinically recovered from CM were entered in the study & randomized equally between arms. All had received >2gm amphotericin wks amphotericin B (2.lmg/kg/wk) plus flucytosine (150mg/kg/day). Cerebrospinal fluid, blood & urine were cultured at entry & exit. Results: 25 pts have been observed for 204 wks. 3 of 19 entry urine cultures were + for crypto & these 3 pts were removed from study. 4 pts withdrew. One had proven recurrence of CM at 4 wks; his entry urine was sterile but his CSF Ag was 1:256 (mean for all ptsl1:60). 4 pts remain on study. 13 have completed 12 wks. 2 of 10 developed + urine cultures on study. One of these pts refused further therapy and later had recurrent cryptococcemia. A 3rd pt, who did not have urine cultured, died of PCP & had cryptococcal prostatic abscesses at autopsy. 4 of the 5 pts with + urine cultures had prostatic fluid examined; all were india ink +-. Conclusion: The genitourinary tract is a common and clinically important site of persistent cryptococcal infection. Early relapse of CM is less common than previously thought when vigorous treatment and screening for persistent infection are employed. Determining the appropriateness and effectiveness of maintenance therapy will therefore require longer and larger trials. 7066 FLUCONAZOLE IN THE TREATMENT OF CRYPTOCOCCAL M.R.G. Leeming Central Research Sandwich, U.K. Cryptococcal meningitis is the second most common life-threatening infection in AIDs patients and without treatment is uniformly fatal. Fluconazole, a novel triazole, achieves significant cerebrospinal fluid levels and is being evaluated as both a primary and a maintenance treatment for cryptococcal meningitis in several different studies in Europe, the USA and Africa. Of 36 analysable primary cases treated to date with greater than 100mg fluconazole daily, 24 achieved a clinical and mycological cure, 6 were treatment failures and a further 6 improved clinically but CSF remained mycologically positive. Among 19 patients being treated with 100mg fluconazole daily for maintenance treatment after successful primary therapy, there have been no recurrences. To date 6 patients have been treated for >6 months. The overall results of this interim analysis indicate that oral fluconazole appears to provide a safe, well tolerated and convenient alternative therapy to the established regimen of intravenous amphotercin B+5 -fluorocytosine. Notes: 7067 PATIENTS USING ORAL FLUCONAZOLE L. Petrin, P. Jones, D. Marriott and A. Mijch, Pfizer Pty. Ltd., Prince Henry Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital, NSW and Fairfield Hospital, Victoria, Australia. The clinical and laboratory response of 14 patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis to oral fluconazole therapy was reviewed. Fluconazole was used in 3 patients as first-line therapy and in 11 patients when standard courses of amphotericin B alone or combined with flucytosine were ineffective or caused neutropaenia, precluding the concurrent use of AZT. Fluconazole dosage was 400mg on Day 1 and 200mg/day thereafter. All patients have shown an improvement in clinical, serological and/or mycological results. Seven (7) patients who were clinically cured have entered a maintenance phase of 100mg/day to prevent meningitis relapse. One (1) patient died from AIDS-related illness after 3 months treatment whilst in this phase. No major effects were reported, although the superimposed illnesses associated with AIDS made assessment of adverse effects difficult. 7068 FLUCONAZOLE THERAPY FOR FUNGAL INFECTIONS IN AIDS AND ARC Richard D. Meyer, VIT1W Ching Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. Objective. To determine if fluconazole, an experimental azole antifungal agent, is effective in therapy of fungal infections in AIDS and ARC patients. Method. Fluconazole (100 mg orally) was given for 3 to 5 months in an ongoing study to 13 patients with 14 separate fungal infections: 8 oral candidiasis, 4 cryptococcal meningitis (after traditional therapy), 1 pulmonary coccidioidomycosis and 1 disseminated histoplasmosis. Results. Response rates were for candidiasis, 5 of 8 (3 others relapsed with Candida glabrata), for cryptococcal meningitis 4/4 (but antigen and 1/1 coccidioidomycosis; the histoplasmosis case was not evaluatable. Therapy was discontinued in two patients and temporarily held in 3 others because of side effects (mostly commonly gastrointestinal complaints or abnormal liver function test results). Seven of 12 patients overall had abnormal liver function test results and fluconazole therapy may have been a contributing factor. Four patients complained of abnormal taste sensation. Conclusion. Fluconazole merits further evaluation in this patient group but careful monitoring for toxicity and emergence of resistant strains is warranted in these complex clinical situations. Consideration of administration of higher doses to some patients is also warranted. 394 [Page 395](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/393) 7069 AMPHOTERICIN B OUTPATIENT THERAPY. J.Slim, G. Tonnessen, P. Johnson, G. Perez, E. Johnson. St. Michael's Medical Center, Newark, NJ, USA Objective: Analysis of safety and efficacy of lona term outpatient amPhotericin B administration for patients with crytococcal meningitis. Methods: 24 charts of natients receivina outpatient amphotericin B were reviewed retrospectively. Side effects were recorded as well on total dose administered. All the patients received remedication consistinr of benadryl and hydrocortisone. Patients were monitored during infusion by a trained intravenous nurse theraoist. Therapy was usually three times per week with an average of 35 mg dose. Results: 24 total patients' charts were reviewed, 3 female and 21 male. The mean time for the Datients on therapy was 18 weeks with a total mean outpatient rosaoe of 1850 ma ('a range of 1-1.5 gram administered in the hospital orior to outnatient therany). Side effects included rigors (not and reversible azotemia in 17%. None of the natients complaints with therapy reouired hospitalization for treatment of exacerbation of underlying cryntococcal meningitis. No cures were documented however. Conclusion: Prolonged administration of outoatient amphotericin B was well tolerated with easily reversible side effects. Although no cures were documented hospitalizations were eliminated in comnlaint natients. 7070 SPECIFIC MYCOLOGICAL CONTROL OF CRYPTOCOCCOSIS IN 15 AIDS PATIENTS Friedrich Staib and M. Seibold Mycology Unit, Robert Koch-Institute, Federal Health Office, Berlin (West) Objective. In view of an effective treatment of cryptococcosis in AIDS with amphotericin B + flucytosine, early detection of the fungus in clinical specimens is needed. Methods. Cultural examination of specimens for Cryptococcus neoformans with the Latex agglutination test for the detection of C.neoformans antigen in body fluids. 15 cases were studied. Results. In all 15 cryptococcosis cases diagnosed, the C.neoformans strains could be differed from other yeast-like fungi with the help of Staib's specific brown colour effect (BCE). The count of colony-forming units with the BCE, in combination with the detection of C.neoformans antigen in the latex agglutination test have made it possible to differ between primary stage (sole infection of the lungs) and secondary stage (disseminated infection of CNS, spleen, liver, kidney, bone marrow, etc.). Out of 15 cryptococcosis cases, only 2 were diagnosed in the primary stage. In addition, the efficacy of the treatment with amphotericin B + flucytosine could be evaluated in 12 cases with the help of this differential culture medium. Conclusion. For the mycological control of AIDS and HIV-infected persons as well as their environment (fecal matter of birds), Guizotia abyssinica creatinine agar can be proposed for the selective isolation of C.neoformans from clinical specimens and from bird manure as possible source of infection. Notes: 7071 IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL AND IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION ANALYSIS OF CELLULAR INFILTRATE OCCURRING IN TOXOPLASMIC ENCEPHALITIS AND AIDS B. J. Luft*, F. Fromowitz**, Eilbott*, and Pathology**, SUNY at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York. Objective. To characterize the dense reactive infiltrate with highly atypical mononuclear cells associated with Toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE). Methods. Brain biopsies from 6 patients with TE and 2 with B-cell lymphoma (BL) were immunohistochemically studied for expression of CD4, CD8 and cell surface immunoglobulins as well as presence of lysosomal enzyme. In situ hybridization for HIV was also performed and was correlated to the atypical cellular response. Results. The cellular infiltrate in TE was characterized predominantly by lysosomal positive and CD4 or CD8 positive cells. The number of cells bearing the CD4 marker was proportionally greater (CD4/ CD8,I) than would be expected from peripheral blood. The cellular infiltrate in the neoplastic process was a population of transformed immunoblastic B-lymphocytes. In situ hybridization for HIV demonstrated that co-infection occurs but that the intense atypical cellular response seen with TE is morphologically independent of the presence of HIV. Conclusions. The cellular infiltrate in TE may contain highly atypical histiocytes and lymphocytes which contain high numbers of CD4 positive cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of the cellular infiltrate distinguishes it from the atypical B-immunoblastic population found in BL. Further studies to determine whether the high number of CD4 positive cells in TE lesions offers a more optimal milieu for HIV infection. is necessary. 7072 CNS-MANIFESTATIONS IN AIDS-PATIENTS. NEUROPATHOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL FEATURES IN 52 CASES. JR Iglesias1, B Ruf2, HD Pohle2. Departments of Neurosurgeryl and Internal Medicine2, University Hospital Rudolf Virchow, Free University Berlin, FRG. Obiective. The neuropathological findings of 52 AIDS patients were described and compared with neurological features. Methods. Complete cross-cut brain sections in the frontal plain and spinal cord sections were embedded in celloidin and investigated. Distribution and localization of lesions were evaluated to find out a correlation with neurological symptoms. Clinical data were analysed and compared with the neuropathological confirmed etiologies. Results. We found focal found in 26 (50 %) cases (bleedings, necrosis, vacuolisation), and degenerative processes (demyelinisation, Wernicke encephalopathy) were seen in 14 (27 %). No neuropathological lesions were seen in 4 patients only. Glia nodules were present in 23 (44 %) cases, in which toxoplasmosis, viral infections, secondary lesions or no CNS lesions were found. Clinical data were not as specific as to allow a diagnosis to be made, but CT scan can be helpful in diagnosing focal toxoplasmosis. In 12 cases brain atrophy was documented by CT scan, but only 4 cases showed reduction of nervous cells in cortical areas. Conclusions. Toxoplasma gondii was the most important opportunistic agent. Glia nodules are probably unspecific reactions of brain tissue. The dementia complex was mostly related with toxoplasmosis, viral infection and secondary lesions. 395 [Page 396](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/394) 7073 TOXOPLASMA St For a case of primary toxoplasma infection (PTI) in a AIDS patient, placing in position a prevention policy of central nervous toxoplasmosis in HIV+ patients with negative toxoplasmosis serology.

This situation could be increased in regard of decrease of toxoplasmosis seroprevalence in France and the incrase of HIV infection. Our observation incite to a prevention policy of toxoplasmosis as in T seronegative pregnant women (food and serologic survey). We also think that every T seroconversion should be treated with the association adiazime-malocid before clinical or radiological abnormalities. 7074 PATHOLOGICAL STUDY OF EXTRANEUROLOGICAL TOXOPLASMIS (ENT) Infectieuses, Hopital Claude-Bernard, Paris. Objective. To evaluate the incidence and describe the, pattern of E.N.T. in AIDS. Methods. 160 autopsies from AIDS patients (pts) are systematically analyzed. Paraffin-sections are studied by HES, Grocott, Ziehl stains and immuno-histochemistry. Results. ENT as found in 9 patients: 7 homosexuals and 2 alrian females (mean age: 39 years; mean duration of disease: 8 months). Toxoplasma gondii (TG) was demonstrated in 2 cases, suspected in 1; these 3 pts received specific treatment for toxoplasmosis. Kaposi's sarcoma was associated in 4 cases, other opportunistic infections in 6. The following sites were affected by TG: myocardium lymph nodes (1/9); encephalitis due to TG was associated in 8 cases. Grossly the most impressive lesions were: a miliary dissemination in both lungs of micro and macronodular lesions (1 case), acute pancreatitis (2 cases), ulcerative colitis (1 case), lymphomatous-like thickening of stomach (1 case), pericarditis (1 case), cardiac hypertrophy (1 case). Microscopic examination revealed TG in both enkysted and free forms in necrotic and/or inflammatory areas, as well pseudocysts in healthy tissues Conclusion. ENT is not exceptional (5,6 % in autopsies from AIDS patients). TG must be carefully searched for in cytologic and biopsic specimens from all HIV + patients Notes: 7075 THE VALUE OF SEROLOGY IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF TOXOPLASMOSIS IN AIDS. G. MUNK, J.F.LLENA AND I.SPIGLAND MONTEFIORE MEDICAL CENTER-THE ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE. NEW YORK, NY. USA Objective:Active Toxoplasma gondii(TG) infection is perhaps the most common opportunistic infection of the CNS in AIDS patients. We would like to report the results of TG serology studies on 100 patients with neurological findings consistent with CNS toxoplasmosis. 75 of these patients were diagnosed as having AIDS. Methods:Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques for the demonstration and titration of IgM and IgG antibodies to TG were carried out on sera and CSF specimens in patients with CNS of toxoplasma Conclusion:From this data, serology appears to be an extremely valuable and consistent indicator of CNS TG especially in conjunction with other diagnostic modalities. It should be emphasized,however, that the absence of TG immunological markers may require reevaluation of the patient for the possibility of a non-toxoplasmic etiology. 7076 CNS-TOXOPLASMOSIS IN AIDS PATIENTS INCIDENCE AND RESULTS OF TREATMENI WITH PYRIMETHAMINE AND MACROLIDE ANTIBIOTICS. HD Pohle1, B Ruf', Eichenlaub3, JR Iglesias2. Departments of Internal Medicine' and Neurosurgery2, University Hospital Rudolf Virchow, Berlin, and Institute of Tropical Medicine, University Munic3, FRG. Objective. Incidence of CNS-toxoplasmosis and efficacy of a modified therapy were determined in a prospective study. The sulfonamide component of the commonly employed combination with pyrimethamine was replaced by two macrolide antibiotics in order to avoid sensitization to sulfonamides. Methods. Diagnosis based on suggestive clinical findings, CT changes and neuropathological examinations. Drug regime: mg pyrimethamine/d, 2.400 mg clindamycine/d, 9 Mill. IU spiramycine/d for three weeks, followed by 50 mg pyrimethamine and 1.000 mg sulfadoxine once weekly as prophylaxis. Folinic acid was substituted. Results. Toxoplasmosis was found in 40/125 (32 %) patients, 6/40 cases at autopsy only. Modified therapy was given in 29/34 cases and was effective in 23 (79,3 %) patients. Relapses (n=6) occured in five cases, four had omitted prophylaxis. Even in relapse therapy was effective. Seven had to be discontinued completely in no case. Residual lesions were found in all effectively treated cases at autopsy. Prophylaxis prevented a pneumocystosis in all cases. Conclusions. Toxoplasmosis was the most frequently found CNS manifestation. The modified drug regime proved to be effective. The prophylaxis was shown to prevent relapses and is apparently able to protect against pneumocystosis. 396 [Page 397](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/395) 7077 MANAGEMENT OF DELIRIUM Tx. Delirium is the most comnon neuropsychiatric complication of hospitalized patients with HIV disease. Typically, delirium is multifactorial in etiology and a complete evaluation to rule out all treatable, contributable medical conditions should be the first stage in the approach to any delirious HIV patient. While search for probable cause is underway, the next goal of treatment should be sedation. We prospectively studied 206 hospitalized AIDS patients referred for psychiatric consultation. One-hundred ninety-three (93.6%) were homosexual/bisexual men, 3 (1.2%) transfusion related, (0.04%) heterosexual and 7 (3.2%) were not One-hundred individuals had PCP, (21%) AIDS-KS, PCP and (19%) had anothet opportunistic infection. One-hundred eighteen patients (57%) met criteria for an organic mental disorder (OMD); 65 (55%) had delirium (DEL), 42 (36%) had DEL plus dementia (DEL/DEM) and 11 (9%) had DEL plus another OMD (DEL/OMD). Sixty-eight patients were admitted to an open trial sedation with intravenous haloperidol and lorazepam (IV-H/L). Thirty-eight (55%) patients died during the study secondary to complications stemining from their underlying disease. The remaining 30 patients were treated per our IV-H/L protocol with 86% having significant improvement as measured by the clinical global improvement scale. Twenty-one patients (75%) achieved a moderate-marked level of improvement. Side-effects were notable for their rarity with no significant changes in respiratory function, arterial blood gases or cardiovascular markers noted. However, extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS) were notable in nearly half of the treated patients with DEL/DEM and DEL/OMD suffering greater EPS than those with DEL alone. 7078 TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH AIDS AND AIDS RELATED COMPLEX WITH ZIDOVUDINE the use of zidovudine in AIDS and ARC. Methods 85 patients were treated with zidovudine 200mo four hourly.Haematologicai and CD4+ lymphocyte counts,p24 antigen and lung function tests were done monthly. Neuropsychological tests were done when possible. Results There was a reduction in the number of opportunist infections;overall well-being was improved as assessed by regression analysis of a visual analogue score(p<0.01);recovery from PCP,assessed by gas transfer and forced vital capacity,was faster and there was an improvement in neuropsychological tests; I Group IFirstTestlSecond 217 latency!Grouo I I (o=0.008) Response is more likely in slow onset encephalopathy not associated with motor features.Peripheral and autonomic neuropathv do not respond.There has been a significant reduction in HIV p24 antigen and a transient rise in CD4+ lymphocytes.Anaemia was seen in 591. and neutropenia 40%; these are more likely with concurrent dapsone and DHPG but not Fansidar nor co-trimoxazole.An acute encephalitis occured in 3 patients following dose reduction. Conclusion. Zidovudine reduces morbidity due to infection and reverses physiological dysfunction but may cause mvelosuppression and encephalitis if dose is reduced. Notes: 7079 A STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF ZIDOVUDINE ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING IN PEOPLE WITH AIDS/ARC. Mary Burgess, M.Callaghan The Maudsley/St. Giles Hospital, London. OBJECTIVES: i) To develop psychometric battery to assess and monitor cognitive function before and during zidovudine treatment. ii) To isolate other psychological factors influencing psychometric performance. METHOD: Earlier test results indicate significant levels of cognitive, impairment in a high proportion of people with AIDS/ARC particularly as regards information processing and attention span. These tests are known to be affected by other psychological factors, most notably anxiety and depression. A pilot sample of 12 male clients with AIDS/ARC was assessed psychometrically prior to the start of zidovudine treatment. This battery comprised a global measure of current and pre-morbid intellectual functioning and tests designed to measure attention and information processing. A GHQ 30 was administered along with an anxiety and depression inventory. During zidovudine treatment follow up assessments are given at three-monthly intervals. RESULTS: Preliminary findings based on pre-zidovudine assessments will form a base line for future evaluation purposes. Three month follow up currently in progress; six month follow up scheduled for May 1988. 7080 SURGERY IN THE AIDS PATIENT R. Zelnick, G. Vretakis, J.B. Poulard, I.B. Margolis Queens Hospital Center, Jamaica, New York, U.S.A. Objective & Methods. There is much controversy and emotion regarding the propriety of surgical therapy in the AIDS patient. To assess risks and benefits, 73 operations on 65 AIDS patients between 1982 & 1987 were reviewed. Results. Fifty-two of the operations were therapeutic, 13 were diagnostic and 8 supportive. The adults included 38 males and 18 females (mean age of 33). Forty had a history of I.V. drug abuse, 6 were homosexual males, 4 were from countries where risks are unclear and 1 was a homosexual male I.V. drug user. By the CDC classification, none were in Group I, 8 in Gp II, 5 in Gp III and 43 inGp IV. The 30 day mortality was 10%(4/40) following major surgery with none after minor surgery. There were 14 complications(19%), 11(27%) after major surgery and 3(9%) after minor surgery. At this time, 30(55%) are alive 18 (32%) are dead (mean survival 7.4 mos) and 7(13%) are lost to follow-up. The pediatric group consisted of 6 males and 3 females (mean age of 8.8 mos). All were congenital. Three major and 8 minor procedures were performed One(33%) of the patients undergoing major surgery died. There was 1 complication in the major surgery group and none in the minor surgery group. The most common complications were wound-related and included 2 instances of wound dehiscence without infection, felt to be related to poor nutritional status. Conclusions. In spite of higher mortality & morbidity rates, patients with AIDS can be treated for coexisting or complicating surgical problems with expectation of a favorable result. There is no justification for denying the benefits of indicated operation to the AIDS patient. 397 [Page 398](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/396) 7081 BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT OF HIV National Cancer Institute of Genoa - ** Dept. of Infectious Diseases - San Martino Hospital of Genoa - ITALY From June 1985 to January 1988, 48 lymph nodes biopsies were performed on L47 patients (pts.)(42 male and 5 female age range between 21 to 38 yrs. old, average age 27, 7 yrs). Pts. were scheduled for excisional biopsy if extrainguinal lymphadenopathy persisted at least for 3 months in two or more sites. Pts. were homosexuals, bisexual and heterosexual in 4, 6, and 36 cases respectively. Fortyfour pts. were drug abusers (heroin) for more than 4 yrs. The definitive diagnosis was of AIDS in 10 pts.(21%) Three of which had an associated Kaposi's Sarcoma with cutaneous and visceral localizations. Other 37 pts. were classified as LAS - ARC (79%) two of wich had associated pulmonary TBC. Biopsy was performed in outpatients surgical dept. an informative conversation with the pts. in the ward preceded the diagnostic investigation and a careful explanation about the prognostic meaning of hystologic findings followed thereafter. The surgeon - patient relationship presented different problems. In mood and behavior have been reported to occur with increasing frequency in AIDS pts. with central nervous system (CNS) complications. Some authors suggested that 70 to 80% of AIDS pts. have CNS involvement and that one third to two thirds of these pts. manifest neurological symptoms. AIDS pts. showed reluctance at the beginning but, in the end, they presented greater complicance withe the bioptic approach in consideration of the possible contribution to therapeutic management of histologic results. In LAS -ARC pts. continuous drug abuse dependence and higher social and health indipendence contributed to reduce patient's compliance and sometimes biopsy was not performed, as it could have interfered with their life - style behavior. 7082 Steep Increase in Pneumococcal Bacteremia At Harlem Hospital From 1982-1987: Probable Role of Early HIV Infection. W. Mandell, A. Adimora, J. Dobkin. Harlem Hospital and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, N.Y. Over the five years spanning the AIDS epidemic (1982-1987) the annual incidence of bacteremic disease due to S. pneumoniae (SP) in adults rose 262% from 42 to 110 cases per year at Harlem Hospital. Although the number of patients with known risk factors for pneumococcal disease(SP Risk), like alcoholism or old age, but no risk for AIDS rose moderately, those with risk factors for AIDS increased dramatically from 13 in 1982 to 57 in 1987. The number of patients with no risk for either pneumococcal disease or AIDS increased from 1 case in 1982 to 15 in 1987. 1982 1985 1986 1987 Total SP Risk Only 28 30 40 38 136 AIDS Risk 13 27 50 57 147 No Risk 1 9 12 15 37 Of 147 patients at AIDS risk, 137 (93%) were drug abusers and 81 (55%) were alcohol abusers. Only 23 (16%) had clinical AIDS or ARC at the time of SP bacteremia. Patients in the \"No Risk\" group were younger and more likely to be female than in the SP and AIDS Risk groups (36 vs 48 years; 51% vs 33%). Conclusions: Bacteremic pneumococcal disease may be a frequent early reflection of infection with HIV; concommitant alcohol abuse could be a co-factor; SP bacteremia in young patients without other recognizable SP risk factors may be a marker of heterosexually transmitted HIV infection. Notes: 7083 Bacterial Infections in AIDS Patients. K. ROLSTON, S. RADENTZ, S. RODRIGUEZ, P. MANSELL AND G. P. BODEY. The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Hospital, Houston, Texas. Bacterial infections (BI) are occurring frequently in AIDS pts. B lymphocyte and neutrophil dysfunction and interleukin-2 administration have been implicated. Objective - To determine incidence and predisposing factors for (BI) in AIDS pts. Methods - The records of 444 HIV-infected persons admitted over 1 year were reviewed. Results - 136 episodes of BI (31/100 admissions) occurred. Bacteremia (33), central venous catheter site (24), cutaneous abscesses (23), pneumonitis (18), urinary tract infection (14), and hepatic abscess, meningitis, periorbital aureus (38), P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis (17 each) were isolated most often. Neutropenia was present in 74 (54%) (17%). This may account for the increase in BI. In addition 25 (18%) were on corticosteroid therapy. Also, increased usage of CVC's may in part account for the increase in Staphylococcal infections. Most patients responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Conclusions - A large number of AIDS patients are receiving antineoplastic, and antiviral therapy. Our data indicate that they are at risk of developing BI with Staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli. Appropriate and prompt therapy is usually effective. Empiric broad-spectrum therapy may be necessary in these patients before a specific diagnosis is made. 7084 BACTEREMIAS IN AIDS PATIENTS, J. Slim, M.D., Patricia Yeh, M.D., George Perez, M.D., Edward Johnson, MoD., Saint Michael's Medical Center, Newark, NJ, U.S.A, Objective: Analysis of bacteremias in AIDS natients with diaanostic sianificance. Methods: A retrosnective of 764 consecutive admissions to a 14 bed AIDS unit at a city hosnital in Newark, NJ during a neriod of 2 years, startina January 19R6. 75 (10.2%) had nositive blood cultures excluding Mycobacterium. 13 had cryntococcus and 19 were considered contaminants. We reviewed the hospital course of 43 natients with true bacteremias; we nresent here the analysis of these charts. Results: There were 30 men and 13 women; aces ranaed between 25 and 56 with a mean of 35. Risk for HIV infection: 32 IVDA, 6 homosexual, 3 heterosexual, 2 blood recinients. 7 had hosoital acauired bacteremias, the source was a central live in 5: the oraanisms included: 4 Stanhylococcus Aureus and 2 Pseudomonas Aeruainosa. The outcome was death in 6/7, only 2 deaths were directly related to the sensis. Of the 36 community acauired bacteremias, 47% were due to an endovascular infecti6n, 30% were due to unner or lower resniratorv tract infection. 41 nathoaens were isolated from these 36 enisodes of bacteremia, they included 75% aram (+) Aerobic aram (-) bacilli with Salmonella beina the most frequent (5), 3 Escherichia Coli, 2 Pseudomonas Aeruainosa, and 1 Acinebacter. The overall in hosnital mortality was 3R% 10/14 directly due to Sebsis. '. Conclusion: Higher mortality was associated with BACTEREMIA (SAB) AND RECURRENT STAPHYLOCOCCAL INFECTION IN PATIENTS WITH AIDS AND ARC. Mark A Jacobson, H Gellermann, H Chambers. UCSF and S. F. General Hospital (SFGH), San Francisco, CA USA Objectives: To determine the incidence of SAB and frequency of SAB complications in AIDS/ARC patients (pts). Methods: We reviewed all cases of SAB that occurred in pts at SFGH during a 3 year period between 1984 and 1987. We excluded pts with a recent history of intravenous drug use (IVDA) or neutropenia. Results: 22 cases of SAB occurred in 18 pts who had an underlying diagnosis of AIDS or ARC. Based on 1986 outpatient clinic records, we calculated a yearly SAB incidence of 5.4 episodes/ 1000 pts in male AIDS or ARC pts, 18-44 years old, who visited the AIDS clinic compared to 0.27 episodes/1000 pts in control male pts, 18-44 years old, with no risk factors for HIV infection who visited any other hospital outpatient clinic (relative risk > 20). 11 AIDS/ARC-associated SAB episodes were communityacquired; 11 were nosocomial. The source of SAB was an IV catheter (16 episodes), skin or soft tissue infection (3), psoas absess (1), parotitis (1), or unknown (1). Even after excluding SAB episodes attributed to an IV catheter source, the relative risk of SAB occurring in AIDS/ARC pts was > 6. 17 AIDS/ARC pts with SAB survived initial antibiotic therapy for a median 4 months. Late metastatic complications of SAB occurred in 6 (35%) of these 17 pts: pneumonia (2), endocarditis (1), recurrent SAB (1), osteomyelitis (1), soft tissue absess (1). Conclusion: AIDS and ARC pts without risk factors for SAB such as IVDA or neutropenia have an increased incidence of SAB with a higher late metastatic complication rate than that reported for recent historical controls. 7086 Community-Acquired Bacteremia in AIDS Patients: Presentation and Outcome HM Krumhoiz, B Lo, K Hadley, MA Sande Department of Medicine, San Francisco General Hospital University of California, San Francisco Objective. To describe the clinical course of AIDS patients admitted to the hospital with bacteremia. Methods. AIDS patients admitted to San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) with bacteremia between August 1986 and December 1987 were studied. Patients' charts were reviewed retrospectively for demographic data, relevant past medical history, clinical admission information, laboratory data, and discharge status. Results. Forty-two AIDS patients were admitted to SFGH with bacteremia. All were male homosexuals. Eight were also intravenous drug users. Most patients presented with a temperature greater than 38.4 C (23), a pulse above 110 (24), and more than 8% band forms on peripheral smear (27). Twelve patients had less than 1000 neutrophils/mm3. A spectrum of organisms were responsible for most of the bacteremias: S. aureus (8), E. coli (8), S. pneumoniae (7), and Group A Streptococcus (6). Four patients had polymicrobial bacteremia. Three of the 42 patients died during the hospitalization. Two of the patients who died did not receive appropriate antibiotics for their gram negative sepsis. The third patient died of fulminant pneumococcal sepsis despite proper antibiotics. Conclusion. Patients in our series presented commonly with fever, tachycardia, and a left shift. They did well with appropriate antibiotics. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of bacteremia and the need for broad spectrum empirical antibiotics. Notes: 7087 BACTERIAL INFECTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH HUMAN 7088 FREQUENCY OF SINUSITIS IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS Infectious Disease, *Whitechapel Clinic and **Department of Microbiology, Foundation, Cleveland, OHIO USA The London Hospital, England. IN AIDS PATIENTS (PTS) Longworth, TF Keys, Cleveland Clinic Objective. To determine the prevalence and type of \"non-opportunistic\" bacterial infections in patients infected with the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Methods. 92 patients infected with HIV were analysed retrospectively with respect to age, sex, risk factors, stage of HIV infection and microbiologically proven bacterial infection. Follow-up was from 3-29 months. Results. 22 episodes of bacterial infection were identified in 16 (17%) patients: four of 24 patients with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), three of 10 patients with AIDS-related complex, one of 17 patients with persistent generalised lymphadenopathy and eight of 41 patients in the \"asymptomatic\" group of HIV infection. Six patients had skin infections: ecthyma (one), erysipelas with abscess (one), otitis externa (two), impetigo (one) and furunculosis (one). Five patients six episodes of pneumonia: Streptococcus pneumoniae (three), Haemophilus influenzae (one), Staphylococcus aureus (one) and beta-haemolytic Streptococci (one). Other infections included bacteraemia (two), one with associated osteomyelitis, urinary tract infection (five) and gastrointestinal infection (two). Conclusions. Bacterial infections occurred in 17% of HIV antibody positive patients and these were seen in all stages of HIV infection. It is important to consider \"non-opportunistic\" bacterial as well as opportunistic infection in these patients. Objective. Unexplained fever, headache, and variable upper respiratory complaints are commonplace in AIDS pts, especially in the outpatient setting. Since these pts are at an unknown increased risk of common bacterial infections, an analysis was undertaken to estimate the incidence of radiographically documented sinusitis in our AIDS population. Methods. The charts of all AIDS pts followed at the Cleveland Clinic were reviewed with attention to the clinical suspicion of sinusitis and interpretation of of sinus radiographs. Results. Of 94 pts followed since 1981, 18 (19%) have been clinically suspected of having sinusitis prompting sinus x-rays. 8/18 sinus films were normal. Four demonstrated maxillary mucoperiosteal thickening, suggesting mild disease. Six had more severe sinusitis by sinus opacification or air-fluid levels on plain films. Three of these pts required surgical drainage, one dying of refractory infection and bacteremia, despite antibiotics and surgery. Two pts had pansinusitis which was also confirmed by CT scan. No pt had a predisposing nasopharyngeal mass lesion. Conclusion. The incidence of sinusitis in our population is at least 10%. Since sinusitis is a relatively common occurrence in AIDS pts, clinicians should have a heightened awareness of this complication. 399 [Page 400](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/398) 7089 HOSPITALIZED FEBRILE EPISODES (HFE) IN HIV-1 INFECTED (HIV1+) LARGELY INTRAVENOUS DRUG USING (IVDU) PATIENTS (PT). DC Perlman, M Fenn P Nyquist, C Harris. Bronx Municipal Hospital Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Bronx, New York,USA Objective. Analysis of prospective series of HFE in HIV1+ PT on medical services. Methods. Inclusion required: l)oral temp (T) >38C twice in 24h or T>38.5C once and 2) known AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC), HIV1+ or clinical suspicion of AIDS/ARC with subsequent confirmation. Results. During first 125 days, 172 HFE occurred in 153 PT. Sex: 75% male, 25% IVDU & H. Of HFE, 34% occurred in known AIDS PT, 28% in ARC PT, 39% in previously asymptomatic HIV1+ PT. Clinical diagnoses (DX) were made in 92% of HFE, with 33% of HFE had >1 bacterial DX. Multiple DX were made in 12% of HFE. Repeat HFE occurred in 11% of PT. Mean stay for HFE was 19.1 days vs. 7.25 overall on medical services. Inhospital deaths occurred in 15% of HFE (21% in HIV1+ PT (25% female, 77% IVDU), most frequent DX were pulmonary. Potentially treatable bacterial processes were frequent. Multiple DX were common. HFE were associated with prolonged hospital stays and substantial in-hospital mortality. 7090 NON OBSTRUCTIVE CARDICMYOPATHY (NOCM) AND * H8pital Antoine B&cl6re, Paris-France. Despite little clinical suspicion, cardiac abnormalities are frequent in AIDS. Myocarditis is the most canron finding. Opportunistic myocardial pathogens are seen in only one third of cases, in the remaining cases no cause could be found. Viruses such as cytcmegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus may be responsible of nyocardial dcmage. Undernutrition with trace elements or vitamines deficiency may be associated with NOCM, especially Selenium (Se) as in Keskan Disease. We evaluated the improvment of left ventricular shortening fraction (LVSF) by echocardiography 2 D during Se supplementation (Sodium Selenate 800Aug/day during 15 days, 400,og/day during 8 days) in 10 AIDS pts with NOCM (LVSF<29 %). Plasma Se and Glutathione peroxidase (GSHpx) in red blood cells, were determinated before and a week after treatment. Results: the mean weight loss was 15,7 + 2,6 % of the usual body weight. Plasma Se (Control: 1,15 + 0,161mnol.1-1) was significantly reduced before supplementation (0,75 + 0,27 pmol.1-1 p <0.01) and normalized after a week. GSHpx was in the range of control. Clinically, 2 pts with NOCM had normal plasma Se and cardiopathy sustained. Among the 8 remaining pts, 6 normalized their LVSF in 15 days, one died the 12th day after improvment and one had a thiamine deficiency. Conclusion 8/10 AIDS pts with NOCM are Se deficients. Supplementation is associated with recovery in 6 pts.1 double blind randcmized study is performing. Notes: 7091 CARDIAC MANIFESTATION OF PEDIATRIC HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTION Steven E. Lipshultz, Stephen Chanock, Stephen P. Sanders, Steven D. Colan, Antonio Perez-Atayde, Kenneth McIntosh; Children's Hospital, Boston, MA. Methods. We studied 33 pediatric patients with HIV using Holter monitoring and 2-D/m-mode echocardiography. Left ventricular (LV) performance was evaluated with shortening fraction, afterload with end-systolic wall stress (ESWS) and contractility with the ESWS-velocity of shortening relation. Results. High-grade arrhythmias were observed in some patients, including sustained symptomatic ventricular tachycardia in one. Pericardial effusion without tamponade was seen in 8 patients. LV performance, afterload and contractility varied widely. Infants tended to have hyperdynamic performance with reduced afterload. Diminished contractility was noted in 10 patients, including 3 patients with symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy. Results of echocardiographic evaluation provided valuable data for management of several very ill children. Of six infants where myocardial histologic studies were performed, 4 had focal myocarditis. One of these died suddenly at home with no other apparent cause. 2 patients with severely dilated, hypocontractile left ventricles showed myopathic changes rather than myocarditis. Viral, bacterial and parasitic opportunistic myocardial infections were looked for and not found. Conclusion. Cardiac abnormalities, detected by noninvasive methods, were common in children, and, while often not clinically obvious, may cause symptoms or even death. Precise diagnosis is frequently helpful in management. 7092 CARDIAC ABNORMALITIES IN HIV INFECTION, WS Chung, RB Himelman, David N. Chernoff, NB Schiller, H Hollander, Univ. of California, San Francisco, CA. Objective: To determine the incidence of cardiac abnormalities in homosexual pts with AIDS or ARC by echocardiography. Methods: Of the 40 study pts, diagnoses were AIDS in 29 and ARC in 11; 19 had a history of PCP and 19 were on AZT. 34 were consecutive ambulatory pts with no suspected heart disease and 6 were hospitalized with opportunistic infections. Measurements included planimetered left ventricular mass (LVM), ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic volume and atrial (LAV); and (PPSP) by Doppler analysis of tricuspid insufficiency. Results: Of the 34 ambulatory pts, 30 were normal, 3 had mitral valve prolapse, and 1 a small pericardial effusion (PE). Of the 6 hospitalized AIDS pts, 4 with suspected heart failure had cardiomyopathies (CM) and 1 a small PE. The table compares the 4 CM pts to the 36 others (* p < 0.05 vs CM). LVM (gms) EDV(m) echocardiography are uncommon in unselected ambulatory homosexual pts with AIDS and ARC. Myocarditis or cardiomyopathy may be more common in pts who are hospitalized and acutely ill. 400 [Page 401](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/399) 7093 CLINICALLY SILENT CARDIAC ABNORMALITIES IN PATIENTS WITH HIV INFECTION. Warren S. Levy, Gary L. Simon, Allan M. Ross, Richard S. Schulof, Jorge C. Rios. George Washington University, Washington, D.C., U.S.A. Cardiac abnormalities have been noted at autopsy in AIDS patients (pts), but the frequency of clinical or preclinical cardiac abnormalities across the spectrum of HIV infection has not been established. We surveyed 60 HIV seropositive pts by 2-D echocardiogram, electrocardiogram (50 pts) and 24 hour Holter monitor (44 pts), none of whom were suspected of having cardiac disease. Thirtyfive pts had AIDS including 24 with active opportunistic infection (+ 0.I.) and 11 without (- 0.I.), and 25 pts had lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms or were asymptomatic (LAS). Echo abnormalities were present in 21 pts (35%) including left ventricular (LV) dilation (9 pts), pericardial effusion (9 pts) and LV hypokinesis (9 pts). The ECG was abnormal in 21/50 (42%) including gross repolarization abnormalities (13 pts), bundle branch block (4 pts) or an infarct pattern (4 pts). The frequency of these findings by HIV clinical status was: LAS AIDS + O.I. studies, 3 pts had unexpected ventricular tachycardia, all of whom had abnormal echos. Conclusions: 1) 50% of HIV infected pts have unsuspected cardiac abnormalities; 2) The frequency of abnormalities is higher in pts with more advanced disease (AIDS v. LAS, p < 0.05, but unrelated to concurrent 0.I.; 3) This data suggests a role for HIV as a cardiac pathogen. 7094 HIV AND HBV MARKERS IN CONGENITAL COAGULATION DEFECT (CCD) PATIENTS The Transfusion Safety Study Group represented by Louis M. Aledort* *Mount Sinai Medical Center and other participating centers, New York and other cities Objective. To assess the impact of HIV infection upon the expression of HBV infection and immunization. Methods. A total of 876 CCD patients treated with clotting factor concentrates and single donor components have been evaluated and followed for anti-HIV, HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs status every 6 months. Results. Concentrate administration was associated with HBV markers in 98% of 504 anti-HIV(+) and 90% of 201 anti-HIV(-) subjects. Treatment restriced to components was associated with HBV markers in 79% of 24 antiHIV(+) and 51% of 147 anti-HIV(-) patients. Overall, 12% of treated subjects had no HBV markers. Persistent HBsAg positivity was seen with equal frequency (8%) in all groups. Anti-HBs positivity was seen with equal frequency (90%) among anti-HBc(-) subjects given HBV vaccine. Conclusion. Many treated CCD patients remain at risk of HBV infection and should be immunized. For recipients of concentrates and components, with or without HIV infection, the outcome of HBV infection and immunization is similar.

Englund*, M HH Jr.* *AIDS Clinical Trials Unit, U of Minnesota, **U of St. Louis (USA) Objective. To assess the sensitivity to acyclovir (ACV) of HSV isolates from HIV-infected patients (pts), cancer and immunocompetent pts. Methods. Consecutive HSV isolates obtained from HIV-infected pts, cancer and immunocompetent pts at the U of Minnesota between August, 1986, and 1987 were evaluated for ACV sensitivity using DNA hybridization with a 125-I labelled probe. Isolates were screened at 2 and 4 uM ACV and tested at higher concentrations as necessary. Isolates with a 50% inhibitory dose > 10 uM ACV were considered resistant (R-HSV). Results. 120 HSV isolates were evaluated. (25 from 16 HIVinfected pts, 40 from 38 cancer pts, and 55 from 54 immunocompetent pts). Infection with R-HSV (5 isolates) was demonstrated only in 1 pt with AIDS. 62% of HIV-infected pts, 8% of pts with cancer and 7% of immunocompetent pts had used ACV prior to the isolation of HSV. The R-HSV isolates were found to have thymidine kinase activity with altered substrate specificity. The pt with R-HSV had been on intermittent low dose ACV for 1 year and high dose oral and IV ACV for >4 months; physical examination revealed severe perirectal disease. Clinical response to continuous infusion of IV ACV, with plasma levels maintained at 20 uM ACV, was noted within 2 weeks. Conclusion. Emergence of HSV resistance was demonstrated in 1/16 ACV-treated HIV-infected pts. R-HSV infection in HIVinfected pts may present as a progressive and severe disease. Infection with R-HSV in cancer or immunocompetent pts does not appear to be clinically important. 7096 HERPES VIRUS INFECTION PRESLNTING AS GIANT HERPETIC NASAL ULCERS IN AIDS C. Daniel Sooy, M.D., John Mills, M.D. San Francisco General Hospital (University of California, San Francisco), San Francisco, CA Herpes virus (HV) infection is a common viral opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. We report five patients who all presented with virtually identical giant nasal ulcers. The appearance is of a large ulcer with a crusting eschar that starts intranasally and extends out of the nasal vestibule up on the ala and out on the upper lip or cheek for a distance of up to 4cm. All four patients had biopsied and/or culture proven horpetic infections. One patient had cultures initially positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV), but biopsy and later cultures confirmed herpes etiologic agent. Large herpetic ulcerations of the perianal area are not uncommon in AIDS. However, the predilection of this infection for the nose is new. Digital trauma and contamination.of the nasal mucosa may play a role in the development of this lesion. All but one patient responded to 400mg of PO or IV acyclovir given five tines per day. The patient that did not improve was also unresponsive to IV adenine arabinaside. Conclusion. Giant herpetic nasal ulcers are a unique nasal expression of herpes virus infection with a typical and diagnostic appearance.

Nephrotic syndrome and chronic renal failure have been reported. Methods: Kidneys of 19 children with AIDS were studied. Results: Two children (Ilmo, 4yr) had significant GS (14% and 33% respectively). The yr old showed dilatation of tubules, acellular casts, dilatation of had interstitial infiltrates mononuclear leukocytes, in the absence of significant GS. Nephromegaly was found in 9 cases, the cause of this was not apparent though glomeruli of 5 children appeared enlarged as compared with those of age-matched controls. Other findings were tubular calcification in 11 and focal mesangial expansion in 5. Conclusion: We have documented GS and/or tubulointerstitial changes in 10 of 19 cases of pediatric AIDS. The children were hospitalized for infectious complications of AIDS and renal disease was not the focus of their illness. 7098 NEPHROPATHY: AS THE INITIAL (ONLY?) SIGN OF (HIV) DISEASE. TKS Rao, LR Mallis, EA Friedman. State University of NY Health Science Center at Brooklyn, New York. AIDS-associated nephropathy (AAN) is characterized by nephrotic syndrome (NS), enlarged kidneys, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), progression to uremia in weeks, and persistent normotension in patients with AIDS. During 1987 however, we have studied 12 confirmed HIV seropositive patients (aged 18 to 40), 3 black women and 9 men (1 white, 8 blacks) who manifested a syndrome similar to AAN but lacked evidence of AIDS. The risk factors for HIV were: 2 homosexual men, 3 Haitians, 5 with infected sexual partners, 1 IVDA, and unknown in 1. The presenting clinical feature was a NS in all 12 along with severe renal failure in 4, moderate azotemia in 3, and normal renal function in 4. In 2 patients (wife of an IVDA and a white homosexual man), HIV antibody had been detected 4 and 3 months, prior to the onset of protelnuria, and in others, at the time of renal evaluation. The kidneys were large in all patients, and biopsy showed FSGS in 8, membranous glomerulonephritis in 2, and 2 others declined the procedure. All four with severe renal failure and two additional patients who progressed to chronic uremia in 6-9 months, were treated by maintenance hemodialysis. Only 2 manifested an opportunistic infections, 3 have MTB and the remaining 7 have no clinical signs of AIDS or ARC after 3-18 months of HIV positivity. We suggest that the term HIV-Associated Nephropathy replace AAN to encompass a rapidly progressive renal syndrome which may be an initial or the only manifestation of HIV disease. Notes: 7099 HIGH HIV SEROPREVALENCE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE Keith Chirgwin, TK Rao, SH Landesman State University of New YorkHealth Sciences Center at Brooklyn, New York Objective. The percentage of hemodialysis (HD) patients at our center with a history of IV drug use (IVDU) increased from 6% in 1979 to 35% in 1987, while the estimated total IVDU population in Brooklyn remained constant during this period. The role of HIV infection in this recent epidemic of renal failure was studied by assessing HIV seroprevalence in our HD patients. Methods. Voluntary HIV antibody testing was offered to all patients in our HD unit. Symptoms or signs suggestive of HIV infection and risk factors for HIV infection were also assessed. Results. 64 of 83 patients consented to testing. HIV risk factors were present in 41% of consenters and 44% of refusers. 25/64 (39%) were positive by EIA and WB. There were no false positive EIA. All positives had HIV risk factors: 21 IVDU, 2 had multiple blood transfusions prior to 1985, 1 homosexual, 1 Haitian. 21/22 (95%) of IVDU's tested were positive. All positives with renal biopsy (N=5) had focal segmental sclerosis including 2 pts without a history of IVDU (1 homosexual, 1 Haitian). None of the positives met CDC criteria for AIDS. Conclusion. Renal failure with a history of IVDU is highly predictive of HIV infection. We can anticipate that the number of HIV infected dialysis patients will continue to increase. In view of the reluctance of many dialysis centers to provide HD to HIV positive persons, provisions must be made for the care of these patients. Despite the high seroprevalence rate in our unit there was no evidence of patient to patient spread of HIV. To assess health care worker risk in this setting HIV testing of the dialysis staff is planned. 7100 A.I.D.S. ASSOCIATED NEPHROPATHY - Omar da Rosa Santos, Guilherme Santoro Lopes, Francisco Fialho, Luiz To study HIV nephropathy in 99Pts. with HIV disease (950) (56 homo/bisex., 32 hemophiliacs, 2 blood Tx.1VH addicted & 8 with unknown risk factor)clinical & lab. usual methods and post-mortem histopathology (32)were done. ~ 21 ARF episodes occurred, due to common determinants. Age, risk factors for HIV, presence of opportunist infection and clinical pictures (AIDS or ARC) did not influence ARF occurrence;89,5% died in 1 mo. (longest survival 7 mo.) ~ We didn't find clinical/lab manifestations of glomerulopathy. Histopathology showed Mesangial 15/32 (11 light, 4 moderate); Segmental Focal Glomerular Sclerosis was found in 3. In spite of the similarity of these lesions to those reported, they were less severe. Absent clinical glomerulopathy may be due to the epidemiologic profile in this series (no haitians and heterosexual contacts, few drug addicts). Conclusions-1)ARF occurrence is a marker of poor prognosis. 2)Genetic and environamental co-factors seems J.S. Greenspan*. *Oral AIDS Center, **Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, +University Hospital, Copenhagen. Objective. To investigate the clinical features and histopathology of labial salivary glands in HIV-infected patients showing parotid gland enlargement (PGE). Methods. Five adults and one child with PGE were seen among patients referred for oral examination at the Oral AIDS Center at the University of California, San Francisco. Five of the patients were subjected to labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsy. Results. The child was a 4 year old girl with pediatric AIDS and persistent bilateral PGE. The adults were HIV-seropositive homosexual males (mean age 43 years, range 27-57), who had persistent (3) or recurrent (2) bilateral parotid gland enlargement. Subjective dry mouth, dry eyes and joint symptoms were noted in 5, 2 and 3 of the 6 patients respectively. LSG showed atrophy of salivary acini in 4 cases and replacement with a lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate. The infiltrates varied in intensity and were mostly diffuse but focal in some areas. Conclusion. Parotid gland enlargement in HIV seropositive children and adults is labial salivary gland sialadenitis which is somewhat Sjogren's syndrome-like. The possible role of HIV, Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus in the development of PGE is as yet unknown. 7102 \"LYMPHOEPITHELIAL LESION\"- A MANIFESTATION OF HIV INFECTION. J Vieira, J Terry, J Astraloa The Brooklyn Hospital, Brooklyn, NY, USA. A number of conditions have been identified as early markers of immune suppression due to human inmunodeficiency virus, eg hairy leukoplakia, oropharyngeal candidiasis, progressive generalized lymphadenopathy, etc. During the past 48 months seven (7) patients have been identified with unilateral or bilateral parotid swelling. Histology of the tumors revealed lymphoepithelial lesion. All patients were HIV antibody positive by ELISA and Western Blot analysis. Four were men, two women. All were black or Hispanic. Two of the men were gay, two were intravenous drug users. Both women acquired HIV through heterosexual contact. T-cell subset analysis performed on five of the seven revealed a mean T4 cell count of 325/mn3. Tissue cultures for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus and DNA:DNA hybridization for EBV were negative in those specimens tested. Electron microscopic examination failed to reveal viral inclusions or free virions. Patients were treated with excision of tumor masses. Recurrence was observed in two patients requiring repeat surgery in one patient. The effects of AZT therapy is now under investigation and will be reported on. Conclusions: Lymphoepithelial lesion should be considered an early manifestation of HIV infection. Notes: 7103 CARDIAC INVOLVMENT Infectieuses, Hopital Claude-Bernard, Paris. Objective. To evaluate the incidence and describe the pattern of cardiac lesions in AIDS. Methods. Systematic hearth autopsic analysis of 160 AIDS patients (pts) (146 males, 14 females; mean age: 36,3 yearsl: 129 caucasian, 31 african or haitian pts; 123 were homosexuals, 6 I.V. drug abusers and 3 had been tramns fused. Paraffin-sections are studied by HES, Grocott, Ziehl stains and immuno-histochemistry for Tcxoplasma gondii (TG). Results. AIDS related lesions were demonstrated in 100 pts (62,1 %): a) pericarditis in 59 pts (37 %), isolated in 25 (15,6 %), associated with myocardial involvment in 34. b) myocarditis in 64 pts (40 %), with inflammatory infiltrate and/or edema in 59, an extensive fibrous endomyocarditis in 5. Cardiac clinical symptoms were observed in half the pts. A pathogen was identified in 19 pts of the 64 pts (n: 1), Histoplasma capsulatum 1). In other cases, one or several pathogens (CMV, MT, MAI, fungi, TG, HIV) found in other sites might be responsible for myocarditis. c) Tumors in 11 cases: Kaposi's sarcoma (n: 10) and lymphoma (n: 2). d) no pts presented with isolated endocardic lesions. Conclusion. Cardiac involvment in AIDS pts was frequent (62,1 %) with predominant myocardial lesions; the significance of myocarditis without evidence of a pathogen in unclear and might be related to HIV infection. 7104 MYOCARDITIS AT NECROPSY IN PATIENTS WITH AIDS FROM MAINLAND UNITED STATES AND PUERTO RICO David Anderson*, M De Vinatea*, A Macher*, E Lopez**, G Lasala**, R Virmani* *Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC, USA **Puerto Rico Medical Center, San Juan, Puerto Rico Objective. Compare the frequency of myocarditis at necropsy (MYO) in patients dying with AIDS in mainland United States (mUS) and in Puerto Rico (PR). Methods. Histopathologic cardiac findings at necropsy were retrospectively evaluated in 91 mUS and 46 PR patients dying with AIDS between 1981 and 1986. Results. Myocarditis occurred in 54 (40%).cases (42 mUSA and 12 PR). MYO was due to opportunistic pathogens in 25 cases (mUS/PR): T. gondii - 10 (4/6), capsulatum was less 26%) than in mUS (42/91, 40%), PR MYO (9/12, 75%) was histologically associated with opportunistic infection, most T. gondii (6/9, 75%). Most PR Pts (6/9, 75%) with T. gondii infection of lung or brain also had MYO due to T. ondii. In contrast, MYO was more likely idiopathic in mUS (26/ 42, 62%), p<0.03. MYO was found with similar frequency in IV drug abusers in PR (11/33, 33%) as in mUS (4/7, 57%). When mUS and PR Pts were taken together, MYO was found with similar frequency in IV drug abusers (14/40, 38%) as in homosexuals or bisexuals (35/73, 48%). Conclusions. MYO is a frequent finding in both mUS and PR AIDS Pts. MYO is more likely idiopathic in etiology when found in mUS Pts, whereas an infectious pathogen can be identified in most PR cases. Myocarditis due to T. gondii should be suspected in all AIDS Pts with toxoplasmosis. 403 [Page 404](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/402) M.D., Christian PERRONNE, M.D., Serge Witchitz, M.D., Bernard R6gnier, M.D., Francois Vachon, M.D. H1pital Claude-Bernard, Paris - France Objective. To correlate the cardiac autopsy findings and antemortem clinical data from patients dying with AIDS. Methods. Fifty cases of myocarditis were selected by histologic examination of heart from 137 consecutive autopsied AIDS patients, between 1983 and 1987. Myocarditis was defined by histologic evidence of an interstitial inflammatory infiltrate (4lpts) or an interstitial edema (15 pts) with or without an opportunistic agent. During their last stay in hospital the patients were divided into 3 groups according to the presence and severity of cardiac signs on the basis of clinical, echocardiographic (12 pts) or hemodynamic (11 pts) criteria. Results. Cardiac signs were absent (group I: n = 29), mild (group II: n = 13) or severe (group III: n = 14). Cardiac involvement led to death in 10 out of 14 patients in group III. A pathogen was identified in myocardium in 14 patients (25%): group I: n = 7, group II: n = 2, group III: n = 5. These pathogens were: Cytomegalovirus (2 pts), Candida pts), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1 pt) and Histoplasma capsulatum (1 pt). A pathogen was found among 5 of the 10 patients who died of cardiac failure. The mean duration of AIDS was 7,2, 6,1 and 3,1 months in the 3 groups respectively. Conclusion. Myocarditis is frequent but often asymptomatic in patients with AIDS. Severe myocarditis can lead to death in some cases. However there is no relation between the presence of a pathogen and the severity of myocardial involvement. The significance of myocarditis with no demonstrable pathogen is still unclear. 7106 ABNORMAL BLOOD RHEOLOCIC FACTORS IN PATIENTS WITH HIV-ASSOCIATED CONJUNCTIVAL AND RETINAL MICROVASCULOPATHY. W.D. HARDY, R. Engstrom, G. Holland, J. Meiselman. UCLA AIDS Research Ctr. Los Angeles, CA USA HIV infection is associated with conjunctival changes (capillary dilatation, microaneurysms, sludging of blood flow) and retinal microvasculopathy similar to diabetic retinopathy. The most common retinal lesions in patients (pts.) with HIV infection are cotton-wool spots (CWS) areas of ischemic focal nerve fiber layer swelling. The pathogenesis of the microvascular disease, and its relationship to ocular ischemic lesions renains poorly understood. To determine whether rheologic changes are related to HIV-associated microvasculopathy and ischemic disease, laboratory evaluation of factors that would alter blood flow (zeta sedimentation ratio (ZSR), ESR, fibrinogen, CIGs, QICs and plasma viscosity) were determined in 22 HIV-infected individuals with conjunctival abnormalities. The severity of conjunctival disease was determined to be mild, moderate, or prominent based on capillary dilatation, microaneurysms and blood flow sludging. CWS were more common in patients with prominent conjunctival disease (p<.02), suggesting that common pathophysiologic mechanisms may be involved. Plasma viscosity was elevated in most pts. (mean 2.4, range 1.5-1.9). ZSR (mean 0.65, nl 0.52+/-0.03) and ESR, (mean 32 nl, range 0-15) were used as measures of red cell aggregation. There was a correlation between the severity of conjunctival vascular disease, ZSR (p<.01), ESR (p <.05), and level of fibrogen (p<.01). There was a trend toward increased red cell aggregation in pts. with CWS. Abnormal blood flow may contribute to ocular ischemic disease and vascular damage in pts. with HIV infection. Notes: 7107 INFECTIOUS GASTROENTERITIS IN AIDS-PATIENTS. Asuncion Moreno, J. Gatell, M. Miro, J. M. E. Valls*, J. Gonzalez*, T. Ribalta**, E. Soriano Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Microbiology (*) and Department of Pathology (**). Hospital Clinic. University of Barcelona. Spain. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the characteristics of the infectious gastroenteritis (IG) in 100 cases of AIDS. METHODS. Since 1983, 100 patients fulfilled the CDC criteria for AIDS and were prospectively followed. Forty two were homosexuals (HMS), 51 drug addicts (DA). RESULTS. Thirty six episodes of IG (defined as the isolation of one (29 episodes) or more (7 episodes) microrganisms in the feces or in the intestinal mucosa) were identified in 28 of the 100 AIDS cases (28 %). All but one were males and the mean age was 36 years (range 24-59); seventeen were HMS (60,7 %) and 9 DA (32,1 %) (p<0.05). The IG alone or associated with other opportunistic infection was present at the moment of performing the diagnosis of AIDS in 19 cases. The microrganisms were: G. lamblia (11), Cryptosporidium (8), Cytomegalovirus (6) (necropsy finding), I. belli (5), C. jejuni (4), Salmonella sp. (4) (two with concomitant bacteremia), Entamoeba coli (4), S. stercoralis, E. nana, T. trichiura, Y. enterocolitica and MAI one case each. All patients had diarrhea and 14 also fever (54 %). All episodes of IG but 2 caused by Cryptosporidium were self-limited or responded to treatment. Two of the 5 episodes of I. belli gastroenteritis relapsed. The IG was the main or an associated cause of death in 4 of the 15 patients who have already died. CONCLUSION. IG is very common among AIDS-patients (mainly HMS) and may be the first manifestation of AIDS. 7108 EFFECTS OF DRUGS ON CRYPTOSPORIDIUM IN CELL CULTURE IN VITRO Annick Datry, 0. Brandicourt, Bellane, N. Pajot, C. Danis, M. Gentilini Department of Public Health, Parasitology and Tropical Medicine, Hopital de la Salpetriere, Paris, FRANCE. Protozoan parasites of the genus Cryptosporidium cause a short term, flu-like, gastrointestinal illness in immunocompetent persons and a severe, persistent life threatening diarrhea in immunodeficient patients. No effective therapy is available for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in the immunodeficient host. Complete development (from sporozoite to sporulated oocyst) of Cryptosporidium was achieved in cultured hunan colon cancer cells (CAC02 cells) which in vitro acquired the enterocyte's characteristics. The growth of Cryptosporidium in CAC02 cells provides a novel means for research in the field of drug screening. Spiramycin seemed to have some effects in vivo and at first, the authors tested this drug. Initially, Spiramycin's toxicity and its penetration in CACO2 cells were evaluated; then its activity on cultured Cryptosporidium was tested. Spiramycin revealed itself to be completely ineffective. The same negative results were observed with eflornithine, of Public Health, Parasitology and Tropical Hopital de la Salpetriere, Paris, FRANCE. **Diagnostic Pasteur, Marne-la-Coquette, FRANCE. Objective. Evaluation of the diagnosis of Cryptosporidium oocysts in faeces by a direct immunofluorescence method, using a monoclonal anti-Cryptosporidium antibody. Methods. 114 faeces concentrates from an equal number of HIV seropositive individuals have been examined for Cryptosporidium oocysts. A direct immunofluorescence method, which uses a monoclonal antibody directed against the oocyst cell wall (Monofluo(R) kit Cryptosporidium)** was compared with a modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining method which reveals acid-fast organisms. Results. Compared with the nonspecific Ziehl-Neelsen procedure, in which false negative results are sometimes obtained because of unstained thick walled oocysts, the immunofluorescence method appears to be perfectly specific and more sensitive. It is also simpler and more rapid to perform and permits an easy detection of the oocysts. Conclusion. The simplicity and accuracy of a direct immunofluorescence method for the detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in human faeces make it an appealing alternative to older methods. 7110 CONTROLLED TRIAL OF SPECIFIC IMMUNE BOVINE TRANSFER FACTOR THERAPY FOR CRYPTOSPORIDIOSIS IN AIDS PATIENTS. A McMeeking*, W Borkowsky*, PH Klesius**, Bonk*, DA Cross*, and HS Lawrence*, Medical Center, New York,**USDA, ARS, Auburn, Alabama. Objective: Cryptosporidia cause severe diarrhea in patients with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). There is no effective therapy. We determined the effect of oral bovine transfer factor (TF) on the course of documented symptomatic cryptosporidios is. Methods: In a prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial, 6 AIDS patients with cryptosporidiosis received immune bovine TF, from lymph nodes of calves immunized with cryptosporidia. 5 patients received a nonimmune TF from unimmunized calves. TF was administered weekly for 8 weeks. Body weight, stools/day, and stool smears were examined weekly. In vitro cellular immune function was measured at entry and end of study. Results: TF group immune nonimmune P Average change in weight(Lbs) +5.6 -7.0 < 0.05 Average number of stools/day at entry 6.3 7.0 ns at 8 weeks 2.0 8.0 < 0.03 Decreased stool frequency 6/6 0/5 < 0.003 Eradication from 0.07 Four patients given non-immune TF were then treated with immune TF. 3 had a decrease in stools/day and gained weight. Oocytes were eradicated from the stool in 1 patient. Conclusion: Cryptosporidium-specific bovine Transfer Factor can be effective therapy for cryptosporidiosis. Notes: 7111 USE OF TRANSFER FACTOR (TF) IN A PEDIATRIC AIDS PATIENT WITH DISSEMINATED Pathology.*** Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA 30912 USA Objective. To determine if transfer factor has clinical utility in treatment of AIDS patients with MAI. Methods. 1)Patient: An 8 year old white male who acquired HIV1 from one neonatal transfusion. At age 5~ he developed chicken pox. Four months later he presented with P. carinii pneumonia and persistent thrush. He was diagnosed to have AIDS. At age 6~, he developed disseminated MAI. Treatment with isoniazid, ethambutol, cycloserine, ansamycin and streptomycin was unsuccessful and positive cultures have persisted. Liver function declined. 2)TF: Because of a report that indicated that TF elicited improvement of MAI infections and increased mitogen responses (JAMA 257:651) we prepared TF, as described in the report, from lymphocytes of the patient's mother. The mother was selected since she showed a specific, moderate, in vitro MAI response, and under the assumption that she was exposed to the same environmental pathogens as the patient. Results. Although MAI cultures have remained positive and mitogen stimulation results show no definite increase, he showed signs of improvement and remains well. No adverse effects of TF have been noted. Conclusions. Our donor only had a moderate response to MAI, TF produced from donors strongly positive to MAI or primed to MAI in vitro may provide a better source of TF for use in AIDS patients. 7112 Upper Gastrointestinal (UGI) Disease in HIV Infected Patients. S. RODRIGUEZ, A. RIOS, K. ROLSTON, R. RANCE, F. BUTT, P. MANSELL. Institute for Immunological Disorders, Houston, Texas. Objectives - To evaluate the etiology and nature of UGI disease and the diagnostic value of endoscopy. Methods - Sixty symptomatic HIV infected patients underwent UGI endoscopy. Smears, cultures (bacterial, viral, fungal) and biopsies were obtained in all. Results: All patients were homosexual males - median age of 33 yrs. Forty seven had AIDS, 11 ARC and 2 PGL. The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (40%), dysphagia (35%) and nausea/vomiting (32%). Esophageal disease occurred more frequently (57%) than gastro-duodenal disease and was often (53%) an infection. Gastro-duodenal disease was usually non-specific (KS). Esophageal (#34) Gastro/Duodenal % Candidiasis 14 41 Kaposi sarcoma 8 31 Cytomegalovirus 2 6 Bile reflux 3 11 Herpes simplex 2 6 Non-specific 11 42 Bile reflux 5 Cryptosporidiosis 2 8 sarcoma 1 Cytomegal ovirus Barrets esophagus 1 3 Mycobacterial 1 4 Non-specific 9 26 Except for KS, patients responded to specific Ampnhotericin B, ganciclovir, acyclovir) or non-specific (antacids, H2 blockers) therapy. No procedure related complication occurred. Conclusion: UGI disease in HIV infected patients is caused by a variety of conditions. Endoscopy is a safe procedure and provides a specific diagnosis in the majority (67%) of patients. 405 [Page 406](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/404) 7113 AIDS Quadros, Ph.D., S. Beidas, M.D., M. Elsakr, M.D., Winston Tom, M.D., D.E. Wilson, M.D. H.P. Dincsoy, M.D. and E.W. Straus, M.D. Department of Medicine and Pathology, SUNY-HSC Brooklyn, NY Gastric secretory dysfunction may account for the frequent enteric infections in AIDS. We studied pentagastrin stimulated acid, pepsin and mucus secretion in AIDS patients. The pH of fasting gastric juice in 29 AIDS patients, 5.9+0.3, was significantly higher than in five control subjects, 2.9+0.04 (p<0.0005). Maximal acid output in 23 AIDS patients, 7.4+1.7 mEq/hr was significantly lower than the controls, 17.9+1.5 mEq/hr (p < 0.0005). Pepsin secretion was significantly lower compared to controls (150.5+13.2 mg/hr; p<0.001). In contrast, mucus concentration was significantly higher AIDS patients, 177.4+23.4 ug/ml than controls, 39.1+6.8 ug/ml (p<0.01). One or more microorganisms were cultured from fasting gastric juice in 11 of 12 AIDS patients but none of the controls. Cytomegalovirus and Herpes simplex virus were cultured in five of ten gastric biopsy specimen. In summary, gastric secretory failure is common in AIDS. It is associated with the recovery of multiple viable microorganisms in gastric juice and may play a part in the frequent enteric infections in these patients. 7114 DEFICIENT HUMORAL RESPONSE TO *VA Medical Denver, CO., **WRAIR, Washington, DC Objective. To investigate humoral responses to enteric pathogens in AIDS. Methods. For 13 patients antibody responses to pathogen-specific antigens by ELISA, and correlated with outcome of infection. Results. All patients had marked deficiences in T-cell number and function. All Gl-infected patients cleared their infection with antimicrobial treatment but 3/4 Cj and 1/1 Sf had persistent or recurrent infection despite therapy. Although healthy homosexual men have high Gl-antibody levels reflecting prior Gl infection, AIDS-G1 were unable to develop de novo antibody responses. High pre-existing antibodies to outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharide were not protective for the Sf patient, nor could he boost his titers. The 3 Cj patients with persistent infection each had deficient antibody responses to Cj cell-surface proteins and erythromycin-resistance developed in 2 strains following treatment. The Cj patient who cleared infection with treatment was the only subject who developed appropriate antibody responses in all 3 classes. Conclusions. Cj and Sf infections may persist in AIDS patients. Antibody response to Cj, Sf, and Gl infections usually are deficient, but pathogen-specific differences exist in the significance of these deficiences. Notes: 7115 The Prevalence of Enteric Pathogens in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection. D.L. CHURCH, M.J. GILL and M.-C. POON, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. To determine the incidence of colonization/infection by enteric pathogens (e.g., enteric bacteria and parasites) during HIV infection, stool culture and sensitivity (C&S) and stool ova and parasite (O&P) tests were done on HIV seropositive patients attending Infectious Diseases/Hemophiliac clinics at the Foothills and Alberta Children's Hospitals. 50 patients submitted stool samples for analysis on at least one occasion. 36 patients were homosexual men, 13 patients were blood product recipients (8 hemophiliacs and 5 patients who received packed RBCs), and 1 patient was an I.V. drug abuser. The majority of these patients were asymptomatic with regards to their HIV infection. 35 patients were CDC class II (a or b) (70%), while a smaller number were CDC class III (a or b) and had AIDS. 19 gay patients (52.8%) had enteric parasites including 4 (11.1%) Blastocystis hominis ( than 5/hpf), and 5 (13.9%) with more than one parasite. Only one patient in the blood product recipient group was colonized with Endolimax nana. None of the patients had positive stool cultures. These studies show that homosexual men have an increased incidence of nonpathogenic and pathogenic enteric parasites compared to patients in other high risk groups with HIV infection, and not cleared because of underlying host immunodeficiencies. Further studies need to be done to determine not only the natural history of gastrointestinal colonization/infection in this population, but also the role of gut infection in concert with HIV in bringing about a more rapid progression to AIDS. 7116 RODRIGUEZ, The Univ. Texas. Sputum Induction (SI) Versus Bronchoscopy (FOB) for Evaluation of Pneumonitis in AIDS Patients. K. L. MCRORY, S. R. MORICE, G. URIBE-BOTERO, P.W.A. MANSELL. of Texas M. D. Anderson Hospital, Houston, Objective - To evaluate the usefulness of (SI) for diagnosis of infectious pneumonitis in AIDS pts. Methods - Forty AIDS pts. with pneumonitis underwent SI and FOB. The first 30 had 1 sputum sample obtained at SI. The remaining 10 had 3 samples each. Smears and cultures for bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens were obtained. Biopsy specimens were processed in a standard manner. Results - Eighteen pts. (45%) had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) diagnosed by FOB. Of these 4 of 6 (67%) were seen on SI in pts. with 3 sputum samples compared to 1 of 12 (8%) in those with 1 sample. Other infectious causes were present in 9 (Histoplasma (1), mycobacteria (2), viral (2), pyogenic bacteria (4)) and all were diagnosed by both procedures. Procedure No. Pts.

Donald E Kot1ler A Francisco, AR Tierney, F. Clayton, JV Scholes. St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hosp, Columbia U, New York, NY, USA Objective Small intestinal dysfunction is common in AIDS. We evaluated jejunal biopsies to determine the prevalence of mucosal injury and the relationship to specific pathogens. Methods We reviewed 66 jejunal biopsies from 50 AIDS patients, 21 with other diseases (DC) and 6 normal controls (NC). Villus and crypt dimensions were measured as were the presence of selected histopathologic abnormalities and microorganisms. Results Villus heights and column counts were lower in AIDS than in DC or NC (p<0.001). The most striking histopathologic findings were the occurence of intracellular bodies in epithelial cells. Three types were noted. One type, seen in 21 biopsies from 14 patients, resembled Isospora belli and was associated with villus atrophy. Stool examinations typically failed to identify this organism. A second type, seen in 11 biopsies, was diagnostic of cryptosporidium, and also was associated with villus atrophy. A third type of intracellular body was seen only in the crypt cells of 7 patients, and was not associated with villus atrophy. Intracellular bodies were not seen in DC or NC while 27 of 50 AIDS (54%) had at least one type. Conclusion Small intestinal mucosal injury in AIDS is common and appears to be due to intestinal parasites in many cases. Jejunal biopsy may be a valuable tool in the evaluation of diarrhea and weight loss in AIDS, especially if stool examinations are negative. 7118 DEMONSTRATION OF HIV INFECTION OF THE IN AIDS PATIENTS: RELATION WITH SYMPTOMS AND OTHER DIGESTIVE INFECTIONS. E.Rene*, A. Jarry**, N. Brousse**, Pasteur. **** H6pital Claude Bernard. The severe deficiency in cell mediated immune fonction, due to Human Immuno deficiency Virus (HIV) induces, characteritic of the full blown AIDS, opportunistic infections during which diarrhea is frequently present. We have previously shown the high frequency of unexplained diarrhea during AIDS. This raises the question of the direct digestive cyto pathogeneicity of HIV, 134 AIDS patients were stratified according to the existence of digestive infections (I) and/or chronic diarrhea (D) in three groups I+D+ (N = 38) 1-D+ (N= 30), I-D- (N= 34). In samples of each group (10 I+D+;7 ID+; and 6 I- D-) rectal and duodenal biopsies were studied in regard of HIV proteins (immunohistochemical determination using monoclonal antibodies against viral proteins: p 18, p 25, gp 41 andgp 1 10 (Genetic System)). HIV proteins were found in the three groups ( 5/10, 3/7, 2/6 respectively), HIV positive ia lymphocytes and/or macrophages. No positivity was found either in intra epithelial lymphocytes or in epithelial cells, In 7 out of 23 patients, HIV proteins were looked for both in rectal and duodenal mucosae:3/7 were positive in both musocae, 3/7 were negative, 1/7 was positive only in the duodenal musocae, We observed an important reduction of CD4 mucosal lymphocytes in the two groups either HIV + or HIV-(9/10 and 11/13 respectively). The frequency of digestive symptoms and the frequency of digestive infection or Kaposi Sarcoma were not different in the two groups, HIV+ and HIV-. In Conclusion: 1 - this is the first demonstration of HIV protein determinants in the gut musocae. 2 -Neither digestive infections nor diarrhea were associated with the presence of HIV+ cells. 3 -The HIV is suspected of being carried into the gut by immune cells (CD4 lymphocytes Zambelli. Institute of Infectious Diseases, University of Pavia, Italy. Objective. To establish the sensitivity and specificity of endoscopy in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases associated to AIDS. Methods. We submitted to endoscopy (GIE) all our HIV patients with symptoms of gastrointestinal localization of AIDS-indicative diseases. The working protocoll includes use of fibre-optic endoscopes strictly reserved to AIDS patients or disposable endoscopes; effective program of sterilization and safety clothes; performance of multiple biopsies for microscopy and microbiological cultures. Results. Of 72 AIDS patients (56 males, 16 females) 43 (59%) presented enteropathic infection (s) and 16 (22%) gut localization of neoplasia. We identified oesophageal candidiasis in 33 (45%); four single patients; Giardia, Cryptosporidium and MAI respectively in 3 of 9 patients. Six (8%) patients had appearance of KS in the gut and other six had lymphomas. Atypical mucosal lesions of the anorectum were found in four (5%) cases. Conclusion. In AIDS, GIE is a reliable approach not only to diagnose directly the gross pathology of alimentary tract, but also to furnish specimens for microscopy and microbiological confirmation of infections and neoplasia. 7120 GASTROINTESTINAL of Clinical Medicine, St. James's Hospital and Trinity College, Dublin Objective. To examine the use of gastrointestinal endoscopy in the management of HIV antibody-positive patients. Methods. 82 Endoscopic procedures performed on HIV antibody-positive patients were monitored prospectively between July 1985 and the present. Data recorded included referral source, indication, risk-group, diagnostic/ therapeutic yield, time, expense, dislocation of normal unit routine and negative impact on non-HIV antibodypositive patients. The endoscopic practices and yield in our unit uniquely reflects the national situation in Ireland as it serves the entire adult population. Results. Most referrals were haemophiliacs and homosexuals with relatively few being drug-abusers. The main indications were the investigation of gastrointestinal symptoms and signs. Approximately 50% of endoscopies yielded significant findings and were diagnostic of AIDS in 8 cases. Repeat endoscopies were useful in establishing efficacy of therapy. The average endoscopy lasted 30 minutes and required twice the usual staff complement. Dislocation of the unit's normal routine was initially severe but with time such endoscopies were accommodated with greater efficiency, less staff stress and without compromising services to other patients. Conclusions. Endoscopy is a useful investigation in HIV antibody-positive patients. Careful planning is mandatory for optimal patient benefit and staff safety. 407 [Page 408](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/406) MANIFESTATIONS IN looo BERLIN 41 The gastrointestinal(GI)tract is a major target organ of opportunistic infections and tumours in AIDS.98 HIV-patients underwent a prospective study including 173 endoscopies of the upper and lower GI tracts.5o/98 patients had weight loss, 48/98 diarrhea and 48/98 abdominal pain as the leading symptoms.Cultural investigations of all biopsies for mycobacteria,cytomegalovirus, herpes and cryptosporidia weredone.

Conclusions: 1.More than 5o% of our AIDS patients presented with GI-symptoms. 2.Gastrointestinal infections were identified by cultures of biopsies in 62% of our patients. 3.Endoscopies of the GI tract should be done to detect mucosal lesions,histological changes and intestinal infections. 4.The variety of pathological microorganisms of the GI tract does not coorelate with the magnitude of intestinal lesions and clinical symptoms. 7122 BLASTOCYSTIS HOMINIS DIARRHEA IN TWO HIVINFECTED L.J. Eppolito, and J.M. Leedom Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA USA Objective. Description of Blastocystis hominis as a pathogenic cause of severe diarrhea in two HIV-infected persons and successful treatment with iodoquinol. Methods. Two patients presented with histories of 6-10 loose watery stools/day for 4-6 weeks. Stool samples were cultured for bacterial pathogens and examined microscopically for ova, parasites, acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and cryptosoridium. CD-4 count and HIV antibody were measured. The patients were treated with Iodoquinol 650 mg orally three times per day for 21 days. Results. Both patients had negative stool cultures for Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. Special stains for AFB and cryptosporidium were negative. Microscopy revealed > 5 B. hominis organisms per high power field and no other ova or parasites. HIV antibody was present in both patients. Patient #1 had a history of oral/esophageal candidiasis and 188 CD-4 cells. Patient #2 had persistent generalized lymphadenopathy and 355 CD-4 cells. After 7-14 days of therapy, both patients reported normal bowel movements. Repeat stool studies were negative for B. hominis and other pathogens. The patients were followed for 2-3 months with no sign of relapse and stool examinations remained negative. Conclusions. B. hominis may produce a chronic diarrhea in HIV-infected persons. Iodoquinol was curative in two patients. Notes: 7123 THE VALUE OF RECTAL BIOPSY HISTOLOGY IN HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTED PATIENTS WITH DIARRHOEA. G M Connolly, J N H-Webster, B G Gazzard St Stephen's Hospital, London, England. Objective. To assess the value of rectal biopsy histology in HIV antibody positive patients who have diarrhoea. Methods. 73 patients with diarrhoea were investigated by repeated stool examination, sigmoidoscopy and rectal biopsy. In 10 patients in whom no cause for diarrhoea was uncovered, rectal biopsies were also examined by electron microscopy. Results. A potential cause for diarrhoea was identified in all but 13 patients. 7 had cytomegalovirus colitis (CMV) confirmed by multiple inclusions and 4 had infestation of the rectal biopsy with acid fast bacilli and stools grew Mycrobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI). In 5 of the 12 patients with cyrptosporidial diarrhoea only 3 showed organisms in the rectal mucosa. All but 2 of the other patients in this series had non-specific inflammation which was severe with frank ulceration in the 3 with herpes simplex infection and the 2 with campylobacter. In 4 of the 10 patients with no infectious cause of the diarrhoea, microtubular structures were seen on electron microscopy and 2 other patients had prelymphomatus changes, frank lymphoma subsequently developed in 1. Conclusion. Non specific rectal inflammation is present in most HIV antibody positive patients and rectal biopsy is helpful in the diagnosis of CMV and MAI infection, but less so with cryptosporidium. Microtubular structures are common on electron microscopy. 7124 IDENTIFICATION OF GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) PATHOGENS IN Spech*, SJ Rehm, DL Longworth, TF Keys, MC McHenry. Department of Infectious Disease, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OHIO USA Objectivw. Diarrhea and other GI symptoms are exceedingly common in AIDS pts, and the identification of a causative pathogen is often difficult. We undertook a study to assess the frequency of diagnosis of enteric infections by stool examination, culture, and lower GI endoscopy. Methods. The charts of all 94 AIDS pts followed at the Cleveland Clinic since 1981 were reviewed with attention to stool cultures, ova and parasite (O&P) examinations, and results of lower GI endoscopy. Results. 165 routine stool cultures for Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter were performed on 55 pts. In only 3 cases a pathogen was demonstrated (2 Shigella, 1 Campylobacter); all were isolated on initial presentation with AIDS and never later in any pt's course. 205 specimens from 65 pts were examined for O&P (often specifically for cryptosporidia). Six parasitic infections were identified (2 E. histolytica, 2 G. lamblia, 2 cryptosporidia). 38 pts underwent one or more lower GI endoscopies yielding 9 diagnoses proven by histopathology: cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis (7), mycobacterial infection (1), pseudomembranous colitis (1). Cultures from endoscopic biopsies suggested pathogens in 9 other instances: mycobacteria (5), CMV (2), herpes simplex (2). Conclusion. The low frequency of common bacterial and parasitic pathogens in our population could reflect regional differences in prevalence or decreased pt exposure after AIDS diagnosis. Biopsy was particularly helpful in demonstrating viral or mycobacterial infection. 408 [Page 409](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/407) 7125 TREATMENT OF PERSISTENT DIARRHEA IN AIDS WITH THE SOMATOSTATIN ANALOGUE SMS 201-995 Hermann Persistent diarrhea is a major problem in the clinical management of AIDS. The cause of diarrhea remains obscure in many cases and treatment has to be purely symptomatic. SMS 201-995 (Sandoz, Basel) is a long acting analogue of somatostatin inhibiting intestinal luminal secretion. We have studied the effect of SMS 201-995 in two patients with AIDS and diarrhea. Case 1: A 40-year-old male homosexual with PGL reported increasing diarrhea, initially loose stools gradually becoming watery. Stool examinations for bacteria, parasites and fungi were not diagnostic. After admission we observed up tp 80 bowel movements/day. The stool volume was 4-5 1/24 h. Treatment with high doses of loperamide, sulphasalazine and spiramycine did not influence the diarrhea. On 40 mg morphine/day the motion frequency could be reduced to 10-15, however, stool volume remained unchanged. Within 4 months the patient had lost 22.5 kg. On 2 x 50 mcg SMS 201-995 s.c. a prompt reduction of stool volume and frequency was observed. Ten days after starting the SMS-treatment the patient had one bowel movement/day. After 20 days of continuous SMS-treatment well-formed stool occurred. Case 2: A 29-year-old male homosexual with cytomegalovirus enteritis had 10-12 bowel movements/day with a total stool volume of 2000 ml. After failure of conventional treatment including opium tincture we put the patient on 3 x 100 mcg SMS 201-995/day s.c. Stool volume was promptly reduced to 50% and bowel motions normalized. Long acting somatostatin analogues may play an important role in the management of diarrhea in AIDS. 7126 SPIRAMYCIN THERAPY FOR IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PATIENTS Pharmaceuticals, Division of Rhone-Poulenc Inc., Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.A. Objective. To provide spiramycin (S) under \"treatment\" use conditions for the therapy of chronic diarrhea due to Cryptosporidium (C) in immunocompromised patients. Methods. Immunocompromised patients with chronic diarrhea due to C were eligible for treatment. Chronic diarrhea was defined as three or more liquid/semi-formed bowel movements daily for at least two weeks and documentation of C in stool. Patients received two S capsules 3 times daily (9 MIU) for a minimum of four weeks. Stool was examined for the presence of C at least monthly and the frequency of bowel movements was assessed between weeks 3 and 4. Outcomes were assessed as \"favorable response\" (FR) (reduction in stool frequency to 50% of baseline AND <5 stools per day regardless of whether C was eradicated) or \"no response\" (NR). Results. As of 15 January 1988, 52 patients have been treated. Forty-nine had AIDS and 3 had immunosuppressive therapy. Six patients were lost to follow-up, 4 died before efficacy was assessed and 42 were evaluated. Thirty-three had a FR and 9 had NR. Sixteen of the patients with a FR reportedly had C eradicated. S was well-tolerated. Conclusion. The clinical improvement (reduction in the frequency of bowel movements) among immunocompromised patients with cryptosporidial diarrhea following S therapy is encouraging. Additional studies to confirm this clinical improvement and to further assess the ability of S to eradicate C should be performed. Notes: 7127 HEPATIC PATHOLOGY IN changes in children with HIV infection we reviewed tissue from 7 biopsies and 16 autopsies performed in 19 children. Methods.The median age at time of biopsy or autopsy was 22&34 mos.respectively.IV drug abuse was the most common risk factor.Bacterial infections and certain opportunistic infections i.e.Herpes simplex(10),PCP(10)&Candida(6) were common.CMV,MAI & M.tuberculosis(MT)occurred less often. common(5/7).Endothelialitis&bile damage degeneration&hepatocellular necrosis were either absent,mild or patchy.In contradistinction,CAH was seldom seen in autopsy specimens.The most prominent changes were extensive fatty degeneration &ischemic necrosis.Kupffer cell hyperplasia,with or without hemophagocytosis,was common to both biopsy & autopsy material.MAI & MT were noted only at autopsy. Conclusions.The hepatic pathology of children with AIDS differs in biopsy & autopsy material.CAH is characteristic of liver biopsies,whereas at autopsy,there were nonspecific changes such as fatty degeneration & ischemic necrosis.Generalized pronounced lymphocytic depletion in the more advanced stages of the disease might explain this morphologic variance.Biopsy&autopsy performed 2 yrs. apart in 1 patient supports this contention. Morphologically CAH may represent the hepatic equivalent of LIP. 7128 XE BRIGHT B3I ujardin HNPl AL de CIIEZ - CHU - NICE - RANCE In 1152 patients (68 % heroin addicts) with positive H.I.V. serologic test (96 A.I.D.S.) we proceeded to 104 liver biopsies. Contrarely to those reported by other authors, all samples were taken in alive patients. Biopsy was indicated mainly in case of sustained high transaminases level (65 patients) or in search of and opportunistic infection in case of unexplained fever (17 patients). - Chronic hepatitis (CH) lesions were observed 68 times. Only 9 patients showed no serological markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV). 19/32 carriers of HBs Ag had an over infection by Delta virus wich was involved in all of our cirrhosis (6 patients). We report 14 cases of dissociated serologies (anti Delta antibodies with no HBs Ag) often associated to C.H. histologically (7/9) and anti HBs antibodies (8/14). 8 patients with Delta C.H. were treated with recombinant o 2 interferon. This treatment were effective in 2 of them. - Other lesions found were 11 liver granulomatosis most often associated to opportunistic infections. We observed no tumoral lesion. Involvment of H.I.V. or C.M.V. in vascular abnormalities (3 in our report) is discussed. - We conclude that liver biopsy is necessary to the prognosis of C.H. (especially Delta) in these particular patients and to diagnose A.I.D.S. onset by searching and opportunistic infection in case of unexplained fever. 409 [Page 410](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/408) 7129 o Dept. oo Dept. Paris ooo Dept. THE SPLEENS IN HIV INFECTED PATIENTS WITH PGL, ARC OR EARLY AIDS. HISTOLOGIC, IMMUNOHISTOCHEMIC AND ULTRASTRUCTURAL STUDY OF 30 CASES J was done for either severe thrombocytopenia or splenomegaly with suspicion of malignant lymphomas. Only one case had Hodgkin disease. We never found Kaposi's sarcoma involvement. Two groups of spleen changes can be recognized. In the Ist, only 2 modifications were disclosed: an increased number of intrafollicular CD8 ~ lymphocytes, significantly higher than in control spleens and the presence of HIV particles in the germinal centres. All the patients had thrombocytopenia with or without PGL. In the 2nd group (patients with long standing thrombocytopenia, PGL, ARC or early AIDS), in addition, atrophy of the T dependant lymphoid tissue, progressive follicular atrophy with sometimes Castleman disease like modification, plasmacytosis and granulomas were observed. The spleen changes seemed to be more intense in patients with the most severe stage of the disease. 7130 THE VALUE OF THE CHEST X-RAY (CXR) IN ASSESSING THE PROGNOSIS AND AETIOLOGY OF RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH THE ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) M Anderson, M Youle, J A Gleeson, D A Hawkins, B G Gazzard. St Stephen's Hospital, London, England Objective. To assess whether the chest X-ray on admission of patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive and have a respiratory infection is correlated with outcome or with the type of infection. Methods. The initial CXR of 60 HIV antibody positive patients presenting with respiratory symptoms was assessed without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis on 2 occasions by an expert radiologist (JG) and graded into 4 categories of increasingly extensive abnormalities. A clinical diagnosis was made as a result of clinical response, broncho-alveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy. Results. The CXR could be reliably graded into minor abnormalities (17 patients) or extensive changes (43). There was progression of CXR changes in only 4 patients. The diagnosis of the type of opportunistic infection was not distinguishable on the CXR, however only those patients with extensive changes died ( 9 patients) and those patients had a much lower arterial partial pressure of oxygen on admission and were much slower to recover. All patients with an opportunistic infection in addition to Pneumocystis carinii (15) had extensive lung changes. Conclusion. Although the CXR is not of value in determining the cause of respiratory infection it is closely correlated with outcome, speed of response and the chances of more than one opportunistic infection being present. Notes: 7131 CYTOMEGALOVIRUS INFECTION IN HIV INFECTED PATIENTS: CLINICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL FEATURES WITH EMPHASIS ON PULMONARY AND GASTROINTESTINAL MANIFESTATIONS. B Ruf1, G Jautzke2, H Timm3, I Schwanz-Pfitzner3, Lange3, HD Pohle1' Departments of Internal Medicine1 and Pathology2, University Hospital Rudolf Virchow and Robert Koch Institute3, Berlin, FRG. Objective. Because of the high prevalance of CMV in HIV positive patients, its role as etiological agent in organ complications is often unclear. The clinical relevance of CMV was evaluated. Methods. Screening was made by serology (ELISA) and culture from clinical and autoptically obtained specimens. Tissue sections were examined using routine stains and immunohistochemistry (APAAP). Results. 120 patients were examined. 101 (84.2 %) cases, showed elevated IgG titers, 3 (3 %) of them also IgM titers. CMV was isolated in 44 (37 %) cases from clinical specimens, whereas CMV inclusions were seen in 5 cases only: liver 1/9 and GI tract 4/39. In 22/50 (44 %) autopsied AIDS patients CMV was CMV inclusions were seen (n=11), pancreas (n=2), brain (n=l). Inflammation with clinical symptoms was found in 5 cases (3x GI tract, lx liver, lx brain, lx pancreas), and without clinical symptoms in adrenal glands (llx). Pneumonia due to CMV was seen in no case. Using APAAP method all cases with CMV inclusions were also positive, but no additional cases were detected. Conclusions. For estimation of the clinical relevance of CMW, aside from CMV inclusions and isolation inflammatory lesions have to be demonstrated. According to these criteria disease due to CMV is by far lower than the rate of isolation may suggest. 7132 PULMONARY ROLE, PREVALENCE AND PATHOGENICITY OF PULMONARY CRYPTOSPORIDIOSIS (P.CR.) IN DANISH HIV-POSITIVE PATIENTS. METHODS, BRONCHIAL LAVAGE MATERIAL AND BRUSH BIOPSIES FROM '4 BRONCHOSCOPIES IN 36 HIV-POSITIVE PATIENTS WERE EXAMINED FOR CRYPTOSPORIDIUM OOCYST USING AN INDIRECT IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE TECHNIQUE, RESULTS, ALL 36 PATIENTS HAD RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS FEVER 69%, DYSPNOE 70%, COUGH 81%. CLINICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN PATIENTS WITH OR WITHOUT P,CR, WAS NOT POSSIBLE, SIX CASES OF P.CR, WAS FOUND. IN FOUR OF THESE PATIENTS (67%) CRYPTOSPORIDIUM WAS THE ONLY PULMONARY PATHOGEN FOUND, IWO PATIENTS (33%) HAD A CONCOMITANT PULMONARY PATHOGEN, WHEREAS 30 (81%) OF THE 37 BRONCHOSCOPIES FROM PATIENTS WITHOUT P.CR, HAD AT LEAST ONE PULMONARY PATHOGEN. THIS DIFFERENCE IS SIGNIFICANT, P<0,03. ALL FOUR PATIENTS WITH P.CR. ALONE ARE STILL ALIVE 9, 9, 12 VS 21 MONTHS AFTER BRONCHOSCOPY, WHILE THE TWO PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE PULMONARY INFECTIONS DIED 1 WEEK VS 1 YEAR AFTER BRONCHOSCOPY, THREE PATIENTS WITH P.CR, HAD A HISTORY OF DIARRHOEA, BUT CRYPTOSPORIDIUM WAS NOT FOUND IN THEIR STOOLS. CONCLUSION, PULMONARY CRYPTOSPORIDIOSIS IS PREVALENT (b/Sb=17%) AND CRYPTOSPORIDIUM IS OFTEN THE ONLY PATHOGEN FOUND IN DANISH HIV-POSITIVE PATIENTS WITH RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS, THE POTENTIAL PATHOGENECITY OF CRYPTOSPORIDIUM OOCYST COLONIZING THE LUNG APPEARS TO BE LOW HOWEVER STILL REMAINS A MATTER OF CONJECTURE, 410 [Page 411](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/409) 7133 INCREASING PNEUMONIA MORTALITY IN NYC, 1980-1986:EVIDENCE FOR A LARGER SPECTRUM OF HIV-RELATED DISEASE IN INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS Rand Stoneburner*, S Laussucq*, D Benezra*, J Sotheran** D Des Jarlais** Dept Health*, NYS Div of Subst Abuse Serv, NY, NY** Objective To describe the relationship of increasing pneumonia deaths(PD) and the epidemic of HIV infection. Methods We reviewed: PD from vital statistics data; pathologic findings of lung tissue in 84 PD from 1980-83, 100 clinical records of 269 PD from 1986 and the incidence of non-AIDS PD in a cohort of 475 intravenous drug users (IVDU) who were tested for HIV-Ab and followed from 1984-87. Results Between 1980-86, PD rates/100,000 increased 308% from 3.4 to 13.2: males aged 25-44 increased from 4.9 to 17.7; females aged 25-44 increased from 2.0 to 9.2. No similar change occurred in other age groups.

Clinical records revealed: gay of these had bacteremias on admission); 7% had an AIDS diagnosis. Of 475 IVDUs, 4 non-AIDS PD occurred in the 230 HIV-Ab+ and 0 in the 245 HIV-Ab-(p=0.05). Conclusion The increase in PD is associated with HIV-1 infection, and suggests a larger spectrum of HIV-related disease in minority IVDUs. 7134 CLINICAL APPROACH TO THE DIAGNOSIS OF PULMONARY INFECTIONS IN HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS. J.P. Chave, J. Bille, M.P. Glauser, P.Francioli. Div. Institute of Microbiology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland. Objective. To determine if episodes of pneumonia due to common (Com) and opportunistic (Opp) pathogens can be differentiated without invasive procedures in HIV positive patients. Methods. Review of all HIV-infected adults who presented with pneumonia between April 1985 and November 1987. Results. 37 episodes (31 patients): 23 episodes due to Opp (Pneumocystis carinii 18, Mycobacterium avium complex 3, Mycobacterium to Com (Streptococcus pneumoniae 8, Haemophilus influenzae 1, unidentified but cured with broad spectrum antibiotics 5). Clinical and radiological presentation Pathogens (episodes) Duration of symptoms Fever Focal A 39.5~C infiltrates Opp (23) 5-35 days 5/23 2/23 Com (14) 1-7 days 10/14 13/14 Conclusion. Simple clinical and radiological data may help to differentiate between Com and Opp pulmonary pathogens, and could be used in selected cases to spare invasive procedures and to start empirical antimicrobial treatment. Notes: 7135 DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES IN LUNG BIOPSY INTERPRETATION IN AIDS. William D. Travis, EE Lack, FP Ognibene, AF Suffredini, J Shelhamer. Critical Care and NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA Objective. To present difficult and newly recognized problems in lung biopsy interpretation from AIDS patients seen at the National Institutes of Health. Methods. 261 lung biopsies were performed on 174 AIDS patients to evaluate 234 episodes of pneumonitis. Results. The pulmonary pathologic findings fell into 3 major categories including infectious interstitial pneumonitis (36%), and neoplasms organism by cytomegalovirus and revealed Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in 14 cases. In one patient a primary pulmonary lymphoma was diagnosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NIP) with no other apparent cause occurred in 13% of patients. NIP biopsies showed diffuse alveolar damage or degrees of inter -stitial chronic inflammation, perhaps related in some cases to early KS or lymphocytic IP (LIP). NIP is presented in the context of other forms of interstitial pneumonitis known to occur in AIDS such as LIP, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and alveolar proteinosis. Conclusions. Awareness of the unusual histologic manifestations of pulmonary infections, neoplasms, and recently described noninfectious forms of interstitial lung disease is essential for the accurate diagnosis of pulmonary complications of AIDS. 7136 Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Antigen in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid from Adult Patients with AIDS. C.C. Linnemann, R.P. Baughman, P.T. Frame, and R. Floyd, Ph.D., Depts. of Med. and Path. and Lab. Med. UC Coll. of Med., Cinti., OH, U.S.A. Published reports indicate that humanr imfmuodeficiency virus (HIV) is recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of AIDS patients with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP), but not with other AIDS-related pulmonary disease. Our experience has been different. Ten BAL specimens from nine AIDS patients were cultured directly in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and all ten cultures were positive for HIV as indicated by examination of the culture supernatant by reverse transcriptase assay and enzyme immunoassay for HIV antigen. These patients had been diagnosed as having AIDS for up to 14 months prior to the BAL, and all measured peripheral blood T4 counts were less than 150 cells/mm. Five patients were receiving AZT at the time of the BAL, and had been treated for periods ranging from 1 to 33 weeks. Five of the specimens were positive for Pneumocystis carinii, and other pulmonary diagnoses included histoplasmosis, lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and aspiration pneumonia'. The chest x-rays were normal (1), or showed hilar adenopathy'(l), old scars (1), focal infiltrate (1), or diffuse infiltrates (6). Five additional BAL specimens were cultured after freezing at -700C, and two were HIV culture positive (P=0.022), FET). This study indicates that HIV can be recovered in culture of the BAL fluid in most AIDS patients, unrelated to the type of pulmonary disease. In contrast to cultures, HIV antigen was detected in the BAL fluid of only one patient and that patient had LIP with noncaseating granulomas. Therefore, HIV antigen detection may be useful in the diagnosis of LIP, but not HIV culture. All BAL fluids should be considered potentially infectious. 411 [Page 412](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/410) 7137 SIGNIFICANCE OF CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) ISOLATION FROM Spech*, SJ Rehm, DL Longworth, TF Keys, MC McHenry. Department of Infectious Disease, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OHIO USA Objective. Compared with the high frequency of isolation of CMV from BAL fluid, a definitive premortem diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis is uncommon in AIDS pts. We examined the relationship between CMV-positive BAL cultures and CMV infection demonstrated on transbronchial biopsy (TBx). Methods. Results of all bronchoscopies (Brs) on AIDS pts at the Cleveland Clinic were retrospectively reviewed with attention to TBx histopathology and viral cultures. Results. Sixty-seven pts underwent 100 Brs since 1983. BAL fluid from 95 Brs was cultured for CMV, and was positive in 45 (47%). TBx was also performed in 89 of these 95 cases. Pathology revealed multiple inclusion bodies typical for CMV in only 3 instances, one with a negative CMV culture. Once CMV was isolated from BAL it was usually cultured again if Br was repeated (8/9). CMV was isolated frequently whether or not Pneumocystis carinii (PCP) was present - 35/66 (53%) and 12/29 (41%), respectively. CMV isolation was not more frequent in cases of refractory fatal PCP (3/10). Conclusion. In AIDS pts pulmonary CMV shedding is both a frequent and chronic occurrence; it poorly predicts the diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis on TBx. 7138 FIBEROPTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR DIAGNOSIS OF PULMONARY DISEASE IN ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) Nadja Heurlin, Department of Lung Medicine, Huddinge University Hospital, Christer Lidman, Department of Infectious Diseases, Roslagstull Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Objective. Between December 1983 and November 1987, 82 fiberoptic bronchosocpies were performed on 68 patients, all with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this investigation our purpose was to: I Determine the presence of pulmonary disease, infectious and non-infectious in Swedish patients with AIDS. II Evaluate the fiberoptic bronchoscopy methods bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), transbronchial lung biopsy (TBL) and brushing. III Compare the results with those of other studies. Methods. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy including BAL, TBL and brushing was performed. When there was risk for haemorrhage or the patient's condition was poor only BAL was done. Results. A large number of infectious agents, in particular opportunistic agents, were found. The most common microorganism was pneumocystis carinii (55/82=67%) and the next most common was cytomegalovirus (36/82=44%). Non infectious lung complications were diagnosed in 4 patients (5%). The combination of BAL, TBL and brushing gave the most comprehensive result. BAL was the method, that gave the best result for infectious diseases, while TBL gave the best result for non-infectious conditions. Notes: 7139 COMPARISON OF SECOND EPISODES OF PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA BETWEEN AIDS PATIENTS TREATED AND NOT TREATED WITH AZT. Susanne Wise Campbell, MJ Carrow, JWM Gold, D Armstrong Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY USA Objective. To determine whether AZT treatment delays the occurence of second episodes of Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia (PCP) in AIDS patients. Methods. We compared the intervals between the first and second episodes of PCP in 16 AIDS patients treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center with AZT following first episodes of PCP and 55 AIDS patients who did not receive AZT. Five patients not on AZT and one on AZT received Aerosolized Pentamidine. None were known to have received Trimethoprim Sulfamethoxazole. Results. The mean time to second episode in patients on AZT was 28.2 ~ 18.5 weeks and was 35.8 + 24.9 weeks for those not on AZT. (P=.21) Conclusion. Although patients treated with AZT had improved function and quality of life. AZT did not appear to delay recurrence of PCP. 7140 Clinical Benefits of Concurrent Administration of Zidovudine and Therapy for the Suppression of Pneumocystis carinii John C. Andrews*, Mildred McManus*, Gail Rogers*, and the AZT Collaborative Working Group. *Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Triangle Park, NC, U.S.A. Objective: To examine the effect of prophylactic therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in combination with zidovudine administration on clinical outcome. Methods: Two hundred and twenty-nine of the original 281 patients with severe ARC or AIDS enrolled in a multicenter placebo-controlled trial of zidovudine elected to receive open-label zidovudine in a continuing trial of long term efficacy and safety. All patients were closely monitored and PCP episodes were recorded. Results: Forty-four of the 144 patients originally randomized to receive zidovudine had received concurrent suppressive regimens of therapy for pneumocystis disease for at least 60 days. Nine of these patients (20%) have experienced 10 breakthrough episodes of PCP, none of which were fatal. The remaining 100 patients from this group did not receive suppressive therapy for pneumocystis disease. Seventy-two of these patients (72%) have experienced 101 episodes of PCP. Eight of these episodes resulted in death. Survival estimates using data gathered through October, 1987 indicate that mortality after one year of study is 9.3% in patients who were treated with zidovudine and received concurrent PCP suppressive therapy for at least 60 days and 18.5% in patients who received only zidovudine. Conclusion: The use of antibiotics for the suppression of Pneumocystis carinii with zidovudine therapy in patients with severe ARC or AIDS improves clinical outcome. 412 [Page 413](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/411) 7141 ABSENCE OF SUBCLINICAL PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII INFECTION IN HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) POSITIVE PATIENTS. Anthony F. Suffredini, H Masur, FP Ognibene, W Travis*, P Rogers, JA JE HC Lane**, JH Shelhamer. Clinical Center, NCI*, and NIAID**, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. Objective. To assess the incidence of subclinical Pneumocystis carinii infection in asymptomatic HIV seropositive patients. Methods. Nineteen HIV seropositive male patients without 1) previous pulmonary opportunistic infections, 2) active pulmonary symptoms, or 3) abnormal chest radiographs were evaluated with lung spirometry, single-breath diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (Dsb), arterial blood gases, gallium 67 citrate and bronchoalveolar lymphocyte counts ranged from 6 to 871 cells/mm3 (mean 212 + 57 cell/mm3). Sixteen patients had < 250 CD4 lymphocytes/mm3. Lung spirometry volumes were normal. Dsb was 23.8 + 1.5 ml/min/mmHg or 75 + 4% of predicted. Nine patients had 0 lung uptake of gallium 67 citrate, 8 had 1+ uptake, and 2 had 3+ uptake. Resting partial pressure of arterial oxygen was 89 + 3 mmHg and alveolar -arterial oxygen gradient was 13 + 2 mmHg. No patient had Pneumocystis carinii cysts detected by (10), in bronchoalveolar lavage (19), or transbronchial biopsy specimens (19). Conclusions. No evidence of Pneumocystis carinii infection was detected in 19 asymptomatic HIV positive patients. This suggests that the presence of pneumocystis organisms in a respiratory secretion or biopsy from an HIV infected patient is usually related to active disease even if only rare organisms are found. 7142 PERIPHERAL CD4 LYMPHOCYTE COUNTS ARE PREDICTIVE OF THE CAUSE OF PNEUMONITIS IN HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTED PATIENTS (PTS). Henry Masur, FP Ognibene, JA Kovacs, BF Baird, AS Fauci, HC Lane. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Objective: To determine whether the peripheral CD4 lymphocyte counts in HIV infected pts with pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) have prognostic or diagnostic value. Methods: CD4 lymphocyte counts measured within the 60 days prior to pulmonary diagnosis were correlated with the results of evaluation of sputum and bronchoscopy specimens. P24 antigen levels during the same time period were also correlated with the results of pulmonary evaluation. Results: Pts with opportunistic infection (pneumocystis = 41 pts, cytomegalovirus = 3 pts, cryptococcus = 7 pts, and pts with mycobacteria in their lavage = 16 pts) always had a CD4 count less than 255/mm3, except for one pt with one single pneumocystis cyst; 90% of these pts had counts less than 100/mm. In contrast; pts with pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma (7) and non-specific pneumonitis (49) exhibited a wide range of CD4 counts (10-700): 2/7 and 13/49, respectively, ware 9/49 were above 400/mm. Serum P24 antigen results did not correlate with diagnosis. Conclusion: Measurement of peripheral CD4 lymphocyte counts has diagnostic value in monitoring HIV infected pts with pulmonary dysfunction. Pts with peripheral CD4 counts > 255/mm rarely (PCP) HOSPITALIZED AIDS PATIENS. Steven Grover, L Coupal, T Szentveri, J Falutz, R Battista, N Gilmore et al. Departments of Medicine, and of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, MoGill University, Montreal, Canada. Objective. To determine the independent predictive value of elevated serum IfH for diagnosing PCP among hospitalized AIDS patients (PIS). Methods. We reviewed the hospital charts of 77 AIDS PTS (without a prior history of PCP) who were admitted to hospital for various HIV complications. PCP confirmed by bronchial washings was found in 42 PIS (55%) while the remaining 35 PTS (45%) did not appear to have PCP, or had negative washings. The routine admission IEH and the presence of dyspnea (SOB) in each group were campared using receiver operating curves (ROC). Results. ROC analysis demonstrated that elevated liH levels (>220 U/L) or SOB were both associated with PCP but the positive predictive value (PV+) of either finding was only.73 -.78. However, the presence of SOB and rIlH220 together was highly specific (.94) for PCP with a PV+ of.94. Variable Sensitivity Specificity PV+ IAH220.83.63.73 SOB.76.74.78 SOB + IfLH220.71.94.94* Conclusion. Among hospitalized AIDS patients, the combination of SOB and ULLH220 may be highly predictive for PCP *(95% Confidence Interval =.79 - 1.0) among patients where PCP prevalence is high. Additional independent validation of these predictors is required to ensure their cotimal clinical use. 7144 BRONCHOSCOPY OF HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS WITHOUT PULMONARY CARINII. JD Lundgren, M Orholm, TL Nielsen, J Iversen, J Hertz, JO Nielsen. Department of Infectious Disease and Microbiology, Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen University, Hvidovre, Denmark. Objective: To estimate the incidence of latent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) among HIVpositive patients. Methods: Eight male patients, average age 37.4 (range 30-45), with HIV infection (all HIV antibody positive, 1 patient with Kaposi's sarcoma) and no history of respiratory symptoms were evaluated with bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and brush biopsies (BB). Instillation of 10 ml. saline aliquots was repeated 8 -13 times, with recovery of 55-82% of the volume. Segmental BB followed BAL. The specimens were handled in the Department of Microbiology as a routine procedure without special notification of participation in the project. The specimens were stained with methenamine silver & giemsa, & examined under a light microscope for evidence of PC. Results: All patients had normal chest radiographs. The average CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.92 (range 0.19-1.57). Three patients had CD4/CD8 ratios below 0.80 (normal >0.80). The mean total CD4 count was 530 cells/mm (range 70-810 cells/ mm3). Three of the eight patients had less than 500 CD4 cells/mm (normal >500 cells/mm3). Three of the eight patients had HIV antigenaemia. BAL and BB material from all patients failed to show PC. Conclusion: We could find no evidence of PC in a group of HIV infected asymptomatic patients. This finding suggests that the presence of PC from BAL 'r BB is indicative of an 7145 Lung 99mTc DTPA Hospital, London, U.K. OBJECTIVE To compare lung 99mTc DTPA transfer in antibody (A/B) positive and negative patients with and without chest infections. METHOD Inhaled 99mTc DTPA aerosol was used to measure transfer time in 3 groups: 111 HIV A/B positives (70 smokers, 41 nonsmokers); 18 HIV A/B positives with PCP; and 13 (5 HIV +ve, 8 HIV-ve) with other infections (7 mycobacterial, 3 streptoccal, 1 staphylococcal, 1 legionella, 1 unidentified). RESULTS HIV A/B status did not affect DTPA transfer but in all 18 patients with PCP, the DTPA transfer curve became uniquely biphasic with a rapid first component - T50 (half time of transfer) being 2 minutes. T50 values were greater than 14 minutes in all other infections. CONCLUSION Lung 99mTc DTPA transfer distinguishes between PCP and other bacterial infections with high sensitivity and specificity. The technique is easy and cheap and can obviate the need for bronchoscopy in many high-risk patients. 7146 OXIMETER EXERCISE TESTING IN THE EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA D E Smith, D A Hawkins, A McLuckie, B Gazzard St Stephen's Hospital, London, U.K. Objective. To assess the value of exercise oximetry in the diagnosis of early PCP, with particular reference to those patients presenting with a normal partial pressure of oxygen on air (PaO2). Methods. The degree of oxygenation of capillary blood haemoglobin as assessed by oxygen saturation (Sa02) was measured using an Ohmeda Biox 3700 Pulse Oximeter. Exercise was performed on an exercise cycle set at a constant resistance (2 kP) and Sa02 was measured each minute for a ten minute period in four groups of patients Group 1 had biopsy proven PCP with a normal resting Pa02 (10 patients). Group 2 had proven PCP with a reduced resting PaO2 (8). Group 3 were HIV antibody positive patients with other respiratory diseaes including atypical pneumonia and CMV pneumonia (6). The fourth group were a number of normal controls (10). Results. None of the noraml controls or other respiratory disease group had a positive oxygen desaturation test (SaOs 90% or less). However 7 of the 10 patients with proven PCP and normal Pa02 had a positive result, as did 7 of the 8 patients with proven PCP and hypoxia. Conclusion. Oxygen desaturaiton is readily measured at the bedside using portable and inexpensive equipment. It is a non-invasive technique which does not require a specialised operator for use. We believe this is a helpful adjunct to making the early diagnosis of PCP, particularly in patients with a normal resting Pa02. There was significant difference in Sa02 between both controls and other respiratory disease and those with proven PCP. Notes: 7147 DETECTION OF Sweden. Objective: The diagnostic value of specific immuncytological detection of Pneumocystis carinii (PC) was evaluated. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavege (BAL) was performed on 25 anti HIV-positive patients with clinically suspected PC pneumonia (PCP), and 40 non-HIV patients presenting interstitial lung disorders. Sputum samples were collected during 43 episodes of clinically suspected PCP in HIV-positve patients. 3F6-lmmunofluorescense (3F6-IFL): Indirect detecting antibody and FITC conjugated sheep-antimouse IgM was performed on ethanol fixed and trypsinated centrifuged smears of sputum and BAL. Resultes: BAL was positive for PC only among the HIV patients. The parasite was detected in 19/25 patients by 3F6-IFL and in 17/25 patients by silver methenamine. Saline induced sputum samples were positive in 6/10 PCP suspected episodes whereas routine sputum samples were positive in 8/33 such episodes. Silver methenamine was positive in 3/43 episodes. In 17 patients sputum collection was followed by BAL within two weeks. In these patients the sensitivity of PC detection in sputum in comparison to BAL was 8/14 = 57%. Conclusions: The 3F6-IFL method is applicable to ethanol fixed specimen, it appears highly specific and more sensitive than the standard cytochemical stain. Sputum is easy to obtain, safe and relatively sensitive and can thus be used for PCP screening. Sensitivity in sputum would increase when applied to hypertone saline induced samples. 7148 EARLY DETECTION OF ASYMPTOMATIC PNEUMOCYSTIS PNEUMONIA Hospital, H6tel-Dieu, France Objective. To evaluate 99mTc-DTPA ALC in HIV asymptomatic patients. To determine his value in detecting PC pneumonia. Methods. HIV patients were enrol led in this prospective study if: (1) they had no symptoms suggestive of PC pneumonia (fever, cough, dyspnea), (2) chest X-rays were normal, (3) Pa02 was higher than 90 mm Hg, and (4) they were non smokers. AIDS patients were excluded. Alveolar permeabil ity (AP) was measured with 99mTc-DTPA ALC over 10 minutes. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was analyzed for the presence of bacteria, virus, parasites and for cell count and differential. Results. Among the 66 patients tested so far with 99mTcDTPA, 17, who had a BAL within the next 48 hours, were selected for this report. 7/17 patients had a normal AP. BAL was normal in all of them, with normal differential cell count (macrophages: 9314%), and with no pathogen. In 10/17 patients, AP was increased. BAL demonstrated PC in 5/10, CMV in 2/10 and no (LIP), in 3/10. Conclusion. 99mTc-DTPA ALC is a sensitive method to detect lung disease, especially PC pneumonia, in.asymptomatic HIV patients. Thus, thi!procedure should be part of the follow-up of all HIV paltients, for the possible early diagnosis of PC pneumonia, before clinical signs, chest X-rays abnormalities or hypoxemia occur. Increased AP should lead to BAL examination. 414 [Page 415](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/413) 7149 VALUE OF TK AND TPA IN OF PATIENTS WITH PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA.

We evaluated the change in the coefficient of diffusi patients when measured in the sitting and the supine coefficient, dKco). We measured the dKco in 24 patients complex (ARC), 27 with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia further subdivided into pre and post treatment groups), Sarcoma (KS) for a total of 67 HIV positive patients. These control group as well as between the HIV positive groups group had a sex distribution of 64 males and 3 females an had a distribution of 2 males and 7 females.

There was also a marked between the PCP (sub group Pre treatment) vs the KS group, group vs the Pre PCP sub-group. In addition there were tetween the PCP sub groups (pre and post treatment). consistently different and easily separated.

Feigal, R Edison, GS Leoung, AB Montgomery, M Clement, PA Volberding. San Francisco General Hospital, (SFGH )University of California, S.F., USA. Objective: To describe the natural history of PCP recurrence before AZT or prophylaxis and a method for selecting historical controls time intervals. Methods: 201 patients were randomly sampled from a list of all hospital discharges at SFGH with first PCP diagnosed at SFGH between 1981 and 1985. Kaplan-Meier curves (with death not due to PCP treated as a censored observation) were used to calculate time to relapse. These observations were used as controls for hypothetical clinical trials with a uniform start date after onset of first episode, and uniform follow-up, to estimate the number of relapses which would be observed. A pt was eligible to be a control if he had remained disease free long enough to have started the trial. His relapses would counted if it occurred during the follow-up period. Results: Kaplan-Meier curves estimate median time to relapse to be 301 days. Because of the censoring due to competing mortality the number of relapses was much smaller than 50%. The number of events for hypothetical trials were found to be: 7154 SURVIVAL IN PATIENTS WITH PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA (PCP) AND AIDS: CORRELATION WITH CLINICAL AND LABORATORY FEATURES. Per A. Lier, J.N.Bruun. Department of infectious diseases, Ullevaal hospital, Oslo, Norway. Objective: To estimate survival in a group norwegian patients with PCP and AIDS, and to correlate survival with some clinical and laboratory features. Methods: The records of 22 subjects with their first PCP treated 1983 - October 1987 were studied. Median cumulative survival was estimated by life table technique. Results: The over all median cumulative survival was 5.3 months from start of symptoms and 2.3 months from diagnosis. 11 patients (group A) died during the first hospitalization. 11 patients (group B) were discharged alive. 5 patients who needed mechanical ventilation and 5 patients where a change in treatment from cotrimoxazole to pentamidin was necessary were all in group A. Admission white blood cell count (xlO /1) was 7.9-1.4 (mean-SD) in group group B (p<0.001). Serum albumin (g/l) in group A was 22.4 3.5 and 25.7~2.0 in group B (p<O.05). All but one of the patients in group A had albumin levels<24. Only one patient in group B had levels <24. We found no significant difference in arterial blood gases at admission (mean Pa02 7.5-1.5 kPa) or duration of symptoms (median 32 days). Conclusion: Survival in our patients is considerably poorer than reported from USA and UK. Low serum albumin and high white blood cell count at admission was found to indicate high in-hospital mortality. The values for serum albumin and PaO, are lower than in previous studies from USA. More advanced disease in our patients at the time of diagnosis may explain the low survival rate. Days after initial PCP Study Started: 100 day follow-up 365 day follow-up Number of Relapses / 100 pts 0 100 200 300 400 500 6 21 21 7 23 0 28 43 32 20 23 0 Conclusions: Apparent efficacy of prophylaxis trials compared to historical series is sensitive to the time the participants remain relapse free before recruitment Prophylaxis started at time of first episode would spuriously look more efficacious than trials started later due to changing hazard. Notes: 7155 PROGNOSTIC FACTORS OF PNEUMOCYSTIS pneumonia (PCP) is one of the most common opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. A very high index of suspicion is required to achieve an early diagnosis and therapy. Methods: HIV-1-infected patients with pneumonia were contracted in this study. Results: During observation period of this study (15 mo.) 40 patients with AIDS and first episodes of PCP were identified. 28 patients had contracted other bacterial and/or viral infections. All patients with PCP had an decreased T4/T8 ratio (below 0.2). In our study survival from PCP is 75% per the first episode during observation period. The prognosis of PCP depends on the appearance of other concomitant infectious agents such as CMV, bacterials and funqis. 8 out of 40 patients have had more than one episode of PCP. Furthermore the prevalence of specific HIV-antibodies to core and envelope proteins corresponds to the incidence of PCP. Conclusion: The prognosis of PCP depends on an early diaqnosis, the appearance of other concomitant infections and the evidence of HIV-antigen and decrease of serum anti-p24 antibody affinity. 7156 OUTCOMES OF TREATMENT OF P. CARINI I PNEUMONIA (PCP): ROLE of oral TS (TSPO) in AIDS patients with PCP and to compare it with that for recipients of intravenous TS (TSIV) and pentamidine (PENT). Methods: 250 patients with proven PCP at BMC were studied retrospectively, and patients with mild disease were compared to an equivalent group at SVH. Results: At BMC, where TSPO is recommended for patients who can take medicines orally, the initial treatments were TSPO in 171, TSIV in 60, and PENT in 19. The groups were similar in age, race, sex, AIDS risk factors, prior PCP episodes, and symptom duration. The patients initially treated with TSIV had the highest A-a gradients (47.6 vs 39.6 for TSPO and 39.0 for PENT, p<0.01), and those initially given PENT were more likely to have a prior diagnosis of AIDS. 20% of patients initially given TSPO, 43% given TSIV, and 32% given PENT LDH, albumin (ALB), pO2, WBC, and prior history of AIDS, by logistic regression, did not reduce the relative risk of death for those given initial TSIV vs TSPO. Patients at BMC with mild PCP, defined as ALB>=2.8, p02>=56, LDH<=600, and WBC<=8.5, were compared to similar patients at SVH, where the IV route is used to administer TS. At BMC 76 patients with mild PCP received initially TSPO, 11 TSIV, and 5 PENT compared with 49 patients initially given TSIV and 9 PENT at SVH. Mortality was 11% for those given TSPO at 10% for TSIV at SVH. Conclusion: When TSPO is recommended for treatment of PCP, clinicians administer TSPO to patients with milder disease. When used in this way it is an acceptable mode of treatment. 416 [Page 417](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/415) 7157 SUCCESSFUL CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS FORPNEUMOCYCTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA WITH DAPSONE IN PATIENTS WITH AIDS AND ARC Craig E Metrokas*, N Braun*, H Josefberg, D. Jacobus** *St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center, New York, NY **Jacobus Pharmaceutical, Princeton, New Jersey Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of dapsone for the presention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Methods. 221 patients with a prior history of PCP, other opportunistic infections (OI), Kaposi's sarcoma All received 25 mg po qid of dapsone, and were followed for a mean of 16 months. Results. Only 2 patients developed PCP. In contrast, 19 of 26 patients who refused treatment with dapsone and who were clinically matched with patients in this study developed PCP. Discontinuation of dapsone in 2 patients led to the development of PCP within 3 weeks. Dapsone led to a decline in red blood cell mass, a rise in serum LDH, and the development of methemoglobinemia. 41 patients required 1 or more transfusions of packed rbc's. However, temporary discontinuation of dapsone in 11 patients decreased the transfusion requirement but did not eliminate the need for transfusions. Complications included nausea (2) and skin rash (6). 10 patients developed KS while receiving dapsone. 93 patients developed other OI or malignant complications; 70 of these have died. QConcusions. Dapsone is well tolerated, highly effective in the prevention of PCP, and probably prolongs survival by preventing PCP. 7158 Lung 99mTc DTPA transfer and its St Thomas' Hospital, London, U.K. OBJECTIVE To assess changes in lung 99mTc DTPA transfer before, at and after an episode of PCP in HIV antibody positive patients. METHOD 12 patients were studied using an inhalation of nebulised 99mTc DTPA (diethylenetrianine pentacetate) and measuring the half time of transfer from the lung. 7 patients had been studied before development of PCP and all 12 were studied at presentation of PCP and 4-6 weeks after treatment with co-trimoxazole. RESULTS Mean whole lung T50 (half time of transfer) values for the 7 patients before PCP was 49 mins +/5.5 (SEM); at presentation with mins after treatment 22 mins +/- 4.7. The DTPA transfer curves were monophasic before and after PCP and biphasic during infection. CONCLUSION The scan is sensitive to PCP and mirrors response to treatment. It can be abnormal when the CXR is 'formal and becomes normal when the patient is clinically improved but the CXR is only resolving. It is sensitive and specific for PCP and can be useful in assessing patient progress. Notes: 7159 PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA:OUTCOME AND RECURRENCE IN C Lidman, A irtquist.P Lundbergh, I Departments of diseases and Danderyds Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in AIDS patients has a high mortality and recurrence rate. We reviwed the records of all first episodes of PCP in patients treated at the hostpials during the period 1983-86. Thirty-two of the 33 patients were initially treated with i.v. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with a mean dose of 16~ 3.2 mg (SD) mg trimethoprim/kg/day. Because of adverse reactions the drug was discontinued in 20/32 cases. In 11 of these 20 cases treatment with i.v. pentamidine was initiated. The patients were divided into two groups, one receiving antipneumocystis therapi <14 days (x=11.2 days) and one receiving therapy >14 days (x=19.9 days). No No Mean time until Deaths Recurrence* recurrence months 7160 PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII Maggiore & Bellaria Hospitals,Bologna - Italy. 24 of 61 patients (ps) with AIDS had PCP. 15 wre dug addicts (DA),5 h,1rsexxals,l seual partner of a setpcsitive IA, 1 received factor IX for B haemophylia, 2 were promiscuous heterosexuals. P.carinii was demonstrated by by trla~dbrtial lug biopsy 80%. Chest X-rays were (mean 63.4), CD4/CD8 ratio in the recoered BAL fluid from 0.05 to' 0.45 (mean 0.42),peripheral CD4 from O to 426 (mean Initial Chotrimoxazole (CTX),TMP 20 and Pentamidine (PMD) 4 mg/Kg,q.d.,i.v. in 3 ps. Because of side effects,2 ps had to be turned rpetively from CTX to Eflornithine (DFMO) and to PMD; and 2 ps from PMD to DFMO and CTX. Seven ps died during their first episode, before completing 21 days of therapy. 14 underwent serial BAL and TBB every 21 days after starting appropriate therapy. Of these, 6 were found to have cleared P.carinii from lungs after 21 days, 7 after 42 days and 1 after 63 days of continuous treatment; 1 refsed cntrols and 2 are still under follcw-p. Recurrencies were observed in 4 of 5 ps who received the shortest course of therapy and were not put on prthylactic maintene, and in nrne of the ps ho received longer treatment and/or were on prophylaxis. Duration of therapy for PCP seems to be not establismd. <14 days *with'in first 12 months Twenty-six of 28 discharged patients were given PCPprophylaxis of whom 24 received pyrimethamine (50-175 mg weekly) in combination with folin acid (50-105 mg weekly) Seven of the 9 patints with recurrences during the first 12 months had been given pyrimethamine prophylaxis. In this study we could not find that anit-PCP therapy>14 days was more efficacious than therapy <14days. A-27 417 [Page 418](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/416) 7161 \"HOSPITAL AIDS EXPERIENCE Medical Systems, Malvern, PA; #U.C.S.D. Hospital, San Diego, CA. Objective. To evaluate the relationship of mortality in AIDS patients with first episodes of PCP to structural factors (such as hospital's AIDS experience level). Methods. Computerized longitudinal patient records of 200,000 discharges were evaluated; 257 patients with initial PCP infection from 15 hospitals in metropolitan areas of California were identified. Results. The 218 patients treated at high AIDS-experience hospitals (30 AIDS discharges/10,000 general discharges) were more likely to survive their first PCP hospitalization than 37 patients at low AIDS-experience hospitals (12% mortality vs 33%, p<.005). The two groups had no significant differences in bronchoscopy usage, insurer types, or ICU/usage. Logistic regression using an adaptation of an existing mortality model (DuBois, 1987) revealed that other factors significantly associated with death included ICU usage (p<.005), admission from an emergency room or another hospital (p<.05), and omission of bronchoscopy for diagnosis (p=.05). Factors not associated with death included total hospital days, age, and insurance status. Conclusions. Patients treated at low AIDS-experience hospitals were significantly more likely to die inhospital (even after adjusting for severity of illness). These outcome differences might be due to structural and procedural characteristics. Better understanding of these factors will be obtained by ongoing chart reviews. 7162 EMPIRICAL THERAPY FOR PRESUMED PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA IS JUSTIFIED. R.F. Miller, A.B. Millar, S.J.G. Semple. Medical Unit, University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London. Objective. To show that initial empirical therapy for patients presenting with symptoms and signs suggestive of Pneumocystis Carinii pneumonia (PCP) is justified. Methods. We prospectively studied 73 HIV-1 antibody positive men. After clinical history, examination, arterial blood cases and chest radiogranh patients were assigned at nresentation to either Group 1 - typical PCP, to receive empirical therapy without further investigation or Group 2 - atypical PCP, needing Fibre Optic Bronchoscopy (FOB) for diagnosis. Subsequently all patients underwent FOB. Results. Group 1, 49 patients, 4 were excluded (1 refused, 3 were too ill for FOB) 39 had PCP and one PCP + S. Aureus, 3 were not PCP, (1 S. Aureus + Shaemolytic streptococcus Interstitial Pneumonitis (LIP)). In two cases no organism was identified (but complete recovery was seen with intravenous Co-trinoxazole). In Group 2, 24 patients, 7 had PCP (1 also had AAFB), 10 had negative FOB (and subsequently soontaneously recovered), 2 had LIP, 1 Actinomycosis, 1 BHS, 1 H. Influenzae + S. Aureus + AAFB, 1 chronic inflammation, 1 Str. rneumoniae + C'.V nneumonitis. Conclusion. In 39/45 (86%) of patients presenting with typical PCP empirical therapy was the correct decision. Empirical therapy in typical PCP will avoid FOB in 39/73 (53%) cases, but should be bronchoscoped. Notes: 7163 7164 STEROIDS IN AIDS PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA PROPHYLAXIS WITH INHALED PENTAMIDINE D E Smith, D A Herd, D A Hawkins, B G Gazzard St Stephen's Hospital, London, U.K. JURGEN SKdRDE,W.HEISE,M.L' AGE AUGUSTE-VIKTORIA-HUSPFITAL, D looo BERLIN 41 Pneumonia due to pneumocystis carinii is the commonest opportunistic infection occuring in patients with AIDS.In spite of early diagnosis and therapy complications(respiratory insufficiency,mechanical ventilation)and mortality are still high. METHODS:14/21 adult patients who had PCP (p.carinii found in the bronchoalveolar lavage) and a PaO below 65 mmHg zole they were given methylprednisolone 240mg intravenously daily for 7 days.The results were compared with 7 patients with severe PCP treated earlier with co-trimoxazole alone. RESULTS:The use of steroids in association with co-trimoxazole lowered mortality from 71,4% to 21,4% and shortened the hypoxic and febrile period.An accelerated recovery of respiratory insufficiency and abnormal chest radiographs could be documented.Severe side effects of the steroid therapy did not appear.Viral infection, especially CMV,and mycobacteria may be a problem however. CONCLUSIONS:Additional therapy with steroids in severe PCP with respiratory insufficiency offers promise to lower mortality from 71,4% to 21,4%.Because of the insufficient results in patients requiring mechanical ventilation this scheme seems to be a successful alternative. Objective. To assess the efficacy of inhaled Pentamidine as a prophylactic regime to prevent relapses of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Methods. HIV + patients with a proven episode of PCP were commenced on maintenance therapy with inhaled pentamidine after treatment of the acute episode with any of the standard treatment regimes. The pentamidine was given every 14 days in a dose of 300 mg, dissolved in 5 mls of water, via a nebuliser (Inspiron Mini-neb). A bronchodilator was given prior to the pentamidine. Inhalation was continued until 'dryness' (approx 15 mins) The results of studies conducted to determine the optimum delivery system for Pentamidine to alveolar spaces will be presented. Peak flow was measured pre-treatment, after the bronchodilator, and after the pentamidine. Results. 12 patients have been studied to date. The medium length of treatment is 16 weeks (range 2-25 weeks) No relapses of PCP have occurred. One patient died from disseminated CMV infection after 17 weeks. The other 11 are alive and well (updated figures will be presented). No systemic adverse reactions were seen. Localised reactions were: cough (4 patients), transient bronchoconstriction (5 patients), unpleasant taste (10 patients) The bronchoconstriction was found to be minimalised by pretreatment with a bronchodilator. Conclusion. Inhaled pentamidine administered fortnightly appears to be an effective prophylaxis against PCP relapses. As a result of this study, a randomised trial comparing co-trimoxazole with inhaled pentamidine is now underway. The first 30 patients will be presented. 418 [Page 419](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/417) 7165 ONCE MONTHLY INHALED PENTAMIDINE FOR THE PREVENTION OF PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA (PCP John Conte, Jr,* D Chernoff,* D Feigal,*HH Hollander,* Jeff Golden,* University of California, San Francisco, CP Objective. To evaluate inhaled pentamidine for the prevention of PCP. Methods. Since March 1987, 103 patients at risk (85.5% AIDS; 14.5% ARC) for PCP have been treated with once monthly pentamidine, 300 mg, by inhalation using the Mallinckrodt nebulizer. This incidence of PCP, major toxicity, and death was retrospectively compared with 132 historical controls derived from the San Francisco Bay Area. Results. Ten patients were omitted because of treatment (9 patients) or relapse (1 patient) within 30 days of initiation of prophylaxis. Of the 93 remaining patients. 48 had at least one previous episode of PCP. Two-thirds of the patients were taking AZT at the onset and during prophylaxis. The median and maximum duration of prophylaxis at the time of analysis was 3.1 and 5.2 months. In patients wh( had a single prior episode of PCP, inhaled pentamidine prophylaxis delayed relapse by at least 5 months and decreased the number of observed cases from 10, based on 132 historical controls, to 3 in this cohort (P < 0.01). No major pentamidine related toxicity was observed. In order to confirm these preliminary observations the analysis will continue for 6 months and a prospective, randomized blinded study of 300 mg versus 600 mg once monthly pentamidine has been initiated. Conclusion. Once monthly inhaled pentamidine proDhylaxiP was relatively free of toxicity and reduced but did not completely prevent PCP in patients with AIDS or ARC. PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII (PCP) PATIENTS. AB Montgomery, DA Abrams,K Korkery, L Wardlaw, DW Feigal and the SF Consortium Physicians. San Francisco General Hospital, Univ of California, SF, USA Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of aerosol pentamidine for PCP prophylaxis in AIDS patients. Methods: 438 participants (pts) were randomized to three treatment arms: 30 mg every 2 weeks, 150 mg every 2 weeks, and 300 mg every four weeks of aerosol pentamidine (AP) delivered over 30 minutes with a Respigard II nebulizer (Marquest) which delivers a particle size of MMAD of 1.42 microns. 67 physicians referred patients to 12 treatment centers. Randomization was stratified into groups with prior PCP (n= 250), Kaposi's sarcoma (n = 59), or ARC (n = 129). Results: AP was well tolerated; there was 1 treatment withdrawals due to hypoglycemia. Some minor side effects were dose related: 30 a 2wk 150 q 2wk Combining all three doses there were 12 relapses at 108 days mean f/u (relapse rate= 7% by the Kaplan-Meier method.) 10 occurred in the post PCP strata and 2 in the ARC strata. Historical case-controls were available for 152 pts post 1 episode of PCP, matched for time from prior PCP. The number of relapses in the controls = 37 compared to 6 in the 152 pts on AP. (Odds ratio = 7.8, p<.01). Conclusion: The comparison to historical controls suggests that the clinical trial should be successful in demon-strating a dose response of efficacy. A second double blind study for efficacy and safety is underway. Notes: 7167 CHANGING PATTERNS OF PNEUMOCYSTIS Montgomery*, J Berge*. * Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center. ** San Francisco General Hospital., USA. Objective: Prevention of PCP using PAP has been increasingly used, but clear evidence of effectiveness has not yet been shown. An unusual radiologic finding in relapses of PCP on PAP suggest prophylactic effectiveness. Methods: 255 AIDS patients received 30 to 150 mg pentamidine from baffled nebulizer every two weeks from 1 to 12 months (mean 139 days). Patients breathed tidal breaths from FRC in sitting position. Chest radiographs (CXR) of 26 cases of PCP prior to PAP and 24 relapses after starting PAP were read by staff radiologists unaware of PAP. Results: CXR of 24 patients with 26 bouts of PCP prior to PAP showed diffuse pattern in all cases. 10 of 24 relapses had infiltrates only in the upper lobes; 5 others were predominantly in the upper lobes; and only 9 had the typical diffuse pattern. Only 1 of 24 relapses failed to respond to therapy; most were considered mild cases. Of the 15 cases with bilateral upper lobe relapses, only 1 progressed to a diffuse process including the lower lobes. Radioisotope labeled aerosol delivered by the same method has shown relatively less upper lobe distribution. Conclusions: (1) The change in distribution and extent of PCP in patients on PAP to upper lobes where aerosol delivery was less suggests pentamidine is effective, particularly in areas of high deposition, the lower lobes. (2) More effective prophylaxis may be achieved with inhalation from residual volume, or in the supine position, or by using higher doses. 7168 D. **Henry L. Poscher,M.D. *Medical Director, Special Care Center Century City Hospital, Los Angeles, Ca. U.S.A. Objective: To prevent pneumocystis pneumonia in high-risk immunocompromised patients. Methods: 60 mgm of Pentamidine Isethionate was delivered at 50 Ibs/square inch through a Respirgard 11 (Marquist) Nebulizer weekly for four weeks, then every other week. Results: Of 150 patients with AIDS, ARC or severly depleted lymphocyte T4 cells, only one case of acute pneumocystis pneumonia developed in eight months. There were no significant side effects. Conclusion: Effective, safe prophylaxis of pneumocystis pneumonia with nebul ized Pentamidine has been demonstrated at cost. 419 7169 PREVENTION OF PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA WITH E M Bernard, H J Schmitt, A Lifton, M Seltzer, M S Dickmeyer, D Armstrong Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Ctr, New York Objective. To test the safety and effectiveness of aerosol pentamidine. Methods. A total of 162 patients were treated for periods ranging from 1-8 mos (mean 7.1); 97% of patients had AIDS; 88% had had PCP; 66% received AZT. A dose of 60 mg of pentamidine isethionate was administered weekly for four weeks and then biweekly using an ultrasonic nebulizer (Fisoneb; MMAD 4.7 micron; SD Based on radioaerosol studies (n=10) this nebulizer deposited 9.4% of the dose in the lung periphery, Results. Pulmonary diffusion capacity improved in 25%, remained stable in 69%, and declined in 6% of patients. A total of 14.7% of patients required pretreatment with a bronchodilator. No other significant adverse reactions were seen. Four mild cases of PCP occurred. The rate of PCP per 100 patient months was 0.35 among patients treated with this regimen; the rate per 100 patient months was 3.4 in an earlier trial using the same dose and a less efficient nebulizer, and was 4.6 in other studies among patients post first episode of PCP who were treated with AZT and received no prophylaxis for PCP. Conclusion. This regimen of aerosol pentamidine was well tolerated and it appeared, in these uncontrolled trials, to be at least partially effective. Controlled trials are underway. 7170 THE EFFECT OF INHALED PENTAMIDINE ON THE SUPPRESSION OF PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA IN PATIENTS WITH THE ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS). K.P Van Gundy, 8. Akil, R. Bill, C.T. Boyler Los Angeles County Medical Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California. We have enrolled a total of 35 AIDS patients with proven prior episodes of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) into a study to attempt to prevent the recurrence of PCP, as well as to identify any toxic effects of the drug when administered by nebulizer. Each patient had PFT'S, CXR, SMAC, CBC, ABG prior to entry as well as periodically throughout the study. All patients were male with an average age of 33 years. All subjects were either homosexuals or bisexuals and all but one were receiving concomitant AZT. Each patient received 2mg/kg body weight of pentamidine mixed in approximately 7-14 cc of sterile water which was then given by compressed air nebulizer (IPPB) every other week for an average of 26 weeks. Average time free of pneumonia was > than 44 weeks. Of the 35 patients that were enrolled in the study 4 patients dropped out for personal reasons. 2 patients expired from diseases other than PCP, leaving 29 patients to be evaluated, of this group, 4 developed PCP while on the study (recurrence rate of 13.7%). All four patients had mild disease with an uneventful recovery from there pneumonia. The side-effects noted with the treatments included cough and a metallic taste in over 90 percent of the patients. Less common complications of treatment were fatigue, nausea, rapidly reversible bronchial spasm, and dizziness. Due to the high side-effects and the need for a more desirable particle size all patients currently in the study have now been converted to a hand held nebulizer with a 2 micron average particle size generator. We have noticed a marked decrease in side-effects, with minimal cough and metallic taste being the only major complaints. The predicted rate of recurrence of PCP in untreated patients is 35% within 24 weeks, the observed rate was 13.7% (p < 0.01) over the 44 weeks average time that the patients have been free of pneumonia. There has been no significant decline in the patients TLC, VC, RV, DLCO during the study period that can be attributed to the inhaled pentamidine. In conclusion inhaled pentamidine at a dose of 2mg/kg biweekly seems to offer short term protection against the recurrence of PCP with no detectable decline in pulmonary function studies. Notes: 7171 COMMUNITY STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF INHALED PENTAMIDINE ON THE PREVENTION OF PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA IN HIV POSITIVE PATIENTS. K.P. Van Gundy, C.T. Boylen, J. Weisman, E. Rogolsky, P. Rothman, A. Scarsella, L Eppolito. Los Angeles County Medical Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California. We retrospectively evaluated the first 150 HIV positive patients that were enrolled in a community study to test the effectiveness of pentamidine to prevent the occurrence of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) when given by aerosolized form biweekly. At the time of enrollment 97 patients had AIDS and 53 patients had ARC. Of the AIDS patients 41 were lost to follow-up leaving 56 patients to be evaluated in the study. The average age of the patients were 37.3 +/- 9.5 years all were male and bisexual or homosexual. The patients were on the study an average of 29 weeks. At the beginning of the study all patients were started on 60mg of pentamidine given by hand held nebulizer every other week, but after the first 100 days of the study all patients that remained in the study were converted to 150 mg every biweekly due to high recurrence rate of PCP. We found that the recurrence rate while on 60mg was 24%, and the recurrence rate on the 150mg dose was 6%. The average duration of time patients were on the 60 mg dose was 70 days while the average duration of time the patients were on the 150mg dose was 147 days. The average combined recurrence rate is 16.1 %. With an average time in the study of 217 days. The historical control predicted rate of recurrence with out treatment is approximately 35% within 180 days. We also evaluated the patients FEV1 during the study period looking for evidence of toxicity and found that the FEV1 declined during the study an average of 0.190 liters +/- 0.029. In conclusion, there appears to be a protective effect against the recurrence of PCP with the use of inhaled pentamidine although because of the small number of patients followed for a short period of time we were unable to show statistical significance. There also is the suggestion that the higher dose of inhaled pentamidine offers greater protection against the recurrence of PCP. The evaluation of the pulmonary function studies in patients receiving the inhaled pentamidine showed, no significant decline in the FEV1. 7172 AEROSOLIZED PENTAMIDINE (PM) FOR PROPHYLAXIS Girard*, Hopitaux Claude Bernard* et Bichat**, Paris, France Objective. Evaluation of feasibility, tolerance and efficacy of PM aerosols in prophylaxis of PCP. Methods. 92 AIDS patients whose 75/92 had a prior episode of PCP were delivered aerosolized PM mesylate (4 mg/kg) every two weeks during the first month then monthly by an ultrasonic De Vilbiss device. Tolerance was appreciated on clinical data, biochemical tests done every 2 weeks and pulmonary function test (PFT) every 3 months. Results. On 20/01/88, mean follow up was 12.1 weeks (2-26). 6 patients were dead, none of PCP. 2 pts were lost for follow up. Side effects during the aerosols were: cough (56/92) occuring only during the first administration in 9 pts, bronchospasm (11/92), vomiting (9/92), fever (3/92). They required interruption of prophylaxis in 3 pts. No biological abnormality or worsening of PFT required discontinuation of prophylaxis. Only 3 bouts of PCP were observed and occured less than 6 weeks after the initiation of the prophylaxis. Conclusion. (1) PM aerosols are safe. Bronchial irritation during the inhalation is the main side effect.(2) Efficacy seems promising but longer follow-up is required (actualized data will be reported). 420 [Page 421](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/419) 7173 NEBULISED PENTAM1IDINE IS NOT AN PNEUMONIA. R,F. Miller, P. Godfrey-Faussett, S.J3.G. Semple. Medical Unit, University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London. Objective. To assess the efficacy of nebulised Pentamidine in treating Pneumocystis Carinii pneumonia (PCP). Methods. We studied 13 homosexual men HIV-1 antibody rositive with PCP confirmed on Fibre Optic Bronchoscopy (FOB) and on induced sputum 1 natient. Pentamidine Isethionate was given once daily via an Acorn nebuliser (System 22 Medic-Aid) at 8 litres/min. Patients 1 - 6 received 4 mg/kg Pentamidine, 7 - 13 8 mg/kg, Mass median diameter of particles measured by a Malvern 2400 laser diffraction sizer was 3.6 um (range 3.0 to 6.2 pm). Response to treatment was determined by symptomatic improvement, defervescence of fever, rising PaO,,, clearing of chest radiograph (CXR). Results. 2 patients responded. Treatment was discontinued in the remainder. The reasons for stopping treatment were persistent/worsening fever in 7 patients, hypoxia/worsening PaO in 4 patients, CXR static/ worsening in 4 patients, symptomatically worse 3 patients, severe cough 2 patients (1 of whom bled profusely at FOB). Another patient died of massive haemorrhage at FOB having received 2 doses of Pentamidine. Conclusion. Treatment with nebulised Pentamidine cannot be recommended as effective therapy for PCP using delivery systems available in Europe at present. This failure in treatment may be due to a difference in particle size generated by the nebuliser. 7174 ADVERSE REACTIONS TO TRIMETHOPRIME-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE HD Pohle Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Berlin, FRG Objective. The increased toxicity to sulfonamides in AIDS-patients prompted us to evaluate the number and severity of side effects seen in the treatment of PcP in our AIDS-patients. Methods. We examined the side effects of 52 episodes of PcP treated with TMP-SMZ, which could be ascribed to the medication. Drug toxicity was graded as either mild or severe according to a standard protocol modified from Gordin et al (1). Results. In 43 of 52 patients (49 males, 3 females, median age 41 years) drug toxicity occurred and in 10 treatment was changed or stopped due to adverse reactions. 42 patients were able to complete treatment and often displayed minor side effects. (Table). reaction any toxicity leucopenia 48,9 % hepatosis % 8,5 % 2,1 % 12,7 % Other side effects included azotemia and fever. Gastrointerstinal symptoms occurred first, compared to cytopenias which usually developed after 2 weeks of therapy. Conclusion. A high toxicity limitates the beneficial effects of PcP therapy with TMP-SMZ. It is therefore useful to avoid a sensitization against sulfonamides in HIV-patients. (1) Gordin et al. Ann Int Med 100 (1984), 495. Notes: 7175 TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE PHARMACOKINETICS IN and **Medicine, University of Southern California, LAC/USC Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA Objective. To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of intravenous trimethoprim (TMP) and sulfamethoxazole patients being treated for PCP. Methods. Serum samples were obtained from 11 patients treated with TMP 20mg/kg-SMX 100mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses. Concentrations of TMP, SMX, and N4-acetyl SMX were measured by PK parameters were estimated by nonlinear, least-squares regression using a one-compartment model. Results are given as mean + SD. Results. Age and weight were 35.7 + 8.9y and 58.2 + than those found in normals. Serum SMX to TMP ratio serum was 16.1 + 4.8. N4-acetyl SMX was 14 ~ 8% of the corresponding SMX concentration. Serum concentrations of both drugs accumulate until steady state occurs (60h for SMX, 40h for TMP). For an 8 hour dosing interval, simulated, steady-state, peak-trough ratios were 1.4 + 0.2 for SMX and 1.5 + 0.2 for TMP. Conclusion. Significant drug accumulation during the first few days of therapy supports the use of a loading dose. Prolonged halflives and low peak-trough ratios for both drugs suggest that an 8 or 12 hour IV dosing interval may be used without compromising therapy. 7176 ORAL DESENSITIZATION(OD) TO TRIMETHOPRIM/ SULFAMETHOXAZOLE(T/S) IN CARINII PNEUMONIA(PCP) Dan Gluckstein, J Ruskin, D Nielsen Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Los Angeles, California Objective. To show that OD is a safe and effective means of initiating T/S prophylaxis for PCP in AIDS pts with prior hypersensitivity reactions to the drug. Methods. 7 pts were selected for OD to T/S based on a history of significant T/S toxicity during therapy for PCP. Untoward reactions included rash and fever in all pts and drug-associated hepatitis in 2. In each case T/S had to be stopped. 4 pts were later rechallenged with T/S (160mg/800mg) and all experienced an immediate anaphyTable 1 lactoid reaction characterized by Time Dose T/S hypotension and fever. OD to T/S was these rant pts using T/S suspension accor2hr 0.4mg/2mg ding the schedule in Table 1. Af3hr ter OD, pts were given as PCP laxis and observed for toxicity. Results. The OD procedure was well tolerated by all pts. Toxicity was limited to a brief rash after the 3 hr dose in 1 pt. The 7 pts have now been followed for 2-4 months. 1 pt has had a mild rash and all are continuing T/S prophylaxis. Recurrent PCP has not developed in any of these pts. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that OD to T/S is a safe and effective means of starting T/S prophylaxis for PCP in AIDS pts with Calif, tNIH, **G Wash Univ; Los Angeles and Washington, DC, United States. Objective. Determine the best combination of trimetrexate(TMTx) and leucovorin(LVN) for PCP. Methods. 52 AIDS patients (pts) were treated with TMTx/LVN at a daily dosage (mg/M ) platelets <75K. halved for neutrophils <750 or platelets <50K and suspended for counts <500 or 25K, respectively. Results. At entry the average (A-a)D02 for the 4 Gps was 30, 25, 33 and 34 mm Hg. All 52 pts received a full 21 doses of TMTx over 21-25 days, though TMTx was suspended briefly in 10 pts for 1-4 days. Despite a predicted mortality of 35-40%, survival in the 4 Gps Drug associated fever, rash and abnormal liver tests occurred in 19%, 21% and 31%, respectively, of the 52 pts and were more common in Gp 1. PCP recurred in 15 (36%) of the 42 responders within 21-66 days and 1 pt 7 months after treatment. Conclusion. The best combination TMTx 45/LVN 80 produced high efficacy and minimal toxicity. The relapse rate for PCP was similar to other therapies but relapses occurred earlier. 7178 GANCICLOVIR BY INTRAVITREAL INJECTION IN OF RETINITIS M. A Conklin, L Pope-Pegram, P Salvato, J Gathe Jr, J Hart. Park Plaza Hospital, Houston, U.S.A. Objective: To develop a method for treating CMV retinitis in patients in whom (A) myelosuppression precludes intravenous ganciclovir therapy or in whom (B) does not respond adequately to intravenous ganciclovir. Method: Two hundred micrograms of ganciclovir were injected directly into the vitreous of 13 eyes of 8 patients (Group A) unable to receive intravenous ganciclovir due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and into 16 eyes of 12 patients (Group B) who demonstrated lack of control of the retinitis by intravenous ganciclovir alone. A total of 123 injections were performed in 29 eyes of 20 patients; the mean follow-up interval was 69 days. Of the 29 eyes, 24 required periodic re-injection for satisfactory control of the retinitis. The mean number of injections per eye was 4.2, and the mean interval between injections was 11 days, with a range of 2 to 167 days. Results: In Group A, 54% of the retinas improved by ophthalmoscopic grading criteria, 38% stabilized, and 8X deteriorated. By final visual outcome, 23% improved, 62% stabilized, and 15X deteriorated. In Group B, 44X improved by ophthalmoscopic grading criteria, 44% stabilized, and 12% deteriorated. By final visual outcome, 12% improved, 75% stabilized, and 12X deteriorated. Conclusion: Direct injection of 200 micrograms of ganiciclovir into the vitreous on a periodic basis is an effective and safe method of treating CMV retinitis in the myelosuppressed patient and in the patient in which intravenous ganciclovir alone is ineffective. Response rates are similar in both patient groups. Notes: 179 TOLERANCE AND EFFICACY OF INTERMITTENT, INTRAVENOUS (IV) FOSCARNET (PFA) THERAPY FOR CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) RETINITIS IN AIDS PATIENTS. Mark A Jacobson, JJ O'Donnell, J Mills. UCSF and S.F. General Hospital, San Francisco, CA and AIDS Clinical Trial Group, NIAID, Bethesda, MD. USA Objectives: To assess the tolerance and efficacy of intermittent IV PFA therapy for CMV retinitis in AIDS. Methods: 10 AIDS patients (pts) with newly diagnosed CMV retinitis treated with a 14 day induction regimen of IV PFA, 60 mg/kg, as a 2 hour infusion repeated q 8 hours. Results: At the end of induction, 9 of 10 pts had stabilized (no new retinal lesions and stable old lesions [7 pts]) or improved (decreased retinal opacification [2 pts]). All 8 pts with CMV in urine or blood at study entry had negative urine and blood cultures at end of induction. After induction therapy (Rx), 7 pts continued maintenance PFA Rx, 60 mg/kg/day, 5 days/wk. 5 pts had retinal lesions increase in size after 2-11 wks of maintenance Rx. One was inevaluable (retinal detach-ment), and one remains stable at 6 wks. Only 4 of 33 blood and urine cultures during maintenance PFA Rx yielded CMV. PFA toxicity was mild in serum creatinine (Cr) by 0.5-1.3 mg/dl over baseline (2 pts), muscle twitching (3 pts), hemoglobin decrease by 1 gm/dl (2 pts), nausea (2 pts), absolute neutrophil count decrease by 50% (1 pt), serum phosphorus > 5.5 mg/dl (4 pts). Elevated Cr was reversible in one pt and persisted (0.8 mg/dl higher than baseline Cr) in another patient who received 19 wks of PFA Rx. Conclusion: Intermittent IV PFA induction Rx for CMV retinitis was as effective and better tolerated than reported in pts given continuous IV PFA induction Rx. Trials of higher or more frequent maintenance dosing regimens to prevent retinitis progression are indicated. 7180 PHOSPHONOFORMATE TREATMENT AND MAINTENANCE IN M. Gentilini* *Department of Public Health, Parasitology & Tropical Medicine & INSERM Research Unit 313, H6pital de la Salpetriere, Paris, FRANCE.**ASTRA Pharmaceuticals, FRANCE. Objective. To study efficacy and safety of Foscarnet(R) in maintenance therapy (MT) to prevent relapses after treatment of CMV retinitis in AIDS. Methods. AIDS patients (pts) were included from 10/87 if they have completed a course of Foscarnet(R) given on continuous infusion (200 mg/kg/day) during 3 to 4 weeks with a good ophtalmologic response. After this acute phase therapy (AT) MT was immediately started with Foscarnet(R) (70 mg/kg/day) given by a two-hour infusion, 5 days/week, and during 12 weeks. Complete ophtalmologic examination was performed weekly. Results. At this time, 6 MT courses are evaluable for 5 pts. All had residual scarring retinal lesions after an AT with 200 mg/kg/day in 5 pts and 130 mg/kg/d in one for a mean duration of 23 days (12/28). The only side effect was a mild hypophosphoremia (1). During MT, 5 pts had received 4 g/day of Foscarnet(R) and 1 had 2g/day. No side effects were observed. On 5/6 cases, relapses occurred 2 weeks (1 pt), 3 weeks (2 pts), 5 weeks (1 pt) and 11 weeks (1 pt) after starting MT. In one case, first relapse occurred after 5 weeks (with 4 g/day). A second AT course was successfull and followed by second MT (4 g/day); a second relapse occurred earlier (3 weeks). Others patients are under evaluation. Conclusion. Foscarnet(R) was safely effective in treatment of CMV retinitis in 6/6 patients but, through these preliminary results, unable to prevent relapses in 5/6. Efficacy of higher dosages should be studied. 422 [Page 423](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/421) 7181 gained with DHPG (Ganciclovir) for treatment of CMV retinitis with the aim of optimizing therapy procedure. Methods.Different therapy models were applied ( 8 patients). Results.Progression of retinitis could be stopped due to administration at an early stage, functional loss of the affected retinal area was irreversible despite good regression of exsudative inflammarory fundus changes. While after discontinuation of massive-dose mg/kg bodyweight/day) a recurrence ocurred,maintenance therapy (5 mg/kg/d) resulted in maintaining visual acuity over months. Side effects were seldom serious. In single cases optic atrophy and drug failure occurred. Conclusion. Given at an early stage and over a long time period, DHPG is an effective means of therapy to prevent blindness caused by CMV retinitis in AIDS patients. 7182 INCIDENCE OF EYE Objective. Pathogenic significance, occurrence and frequency of ocular symptoms in patients with HIV infection, diagnostic problems in retinochoroiditis. Methods. Ophthalmologic examination of 259 patients with HIV infection in various stages. Vitreous body aspiration to identify pathogens in the case of retinochoroiditis. Pathohistologic and immunhistochemical examination of the eyes in 15 autopsy cases. Results. l.Fundus changes (microangiopathy, retinochoroiditis) are mostly found at a late stage (AIDS,50 %), seldom in earlier stages (LAS,ARC, 10 %), never at the stage of symptomless HIV seropositivity (0 %). 2.The identification of pathogens in the vitreous body failed. We try to establish typical ophthalmoscopic criteria of some pathogens. 3.A survey will be given on findings concerning the anterior eye segment and on neuroophthalmologic findings, their relation to HIV infection is examined. Conclusion. The ophthalmologist plays an important role in the diagnosis of vasculopathy, opportunistic infections and CNS involvement. Notes: 7183 A COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN OPHTHALMOSCOPIC EXAMINATION AND FLUORESCEIN ANGIOGRAPHY IN INTRAVENOUS DRUG ABUSERS WITH HIV INFECTION. P. Pivetti-Pezzi (*), S. Tamburi (*), F. Bozzoni (*), I Mezzaroma (**), G.P. D'offizi (**), F. Aiuti (**). (*) Institute of Ophthalmology and (**) Dept. of Allergy & Clinical Immunology, University of Rome \"La Sapienza\" Rome, Italy. Objective. To clarify the pathogenesis and facilitate the differential diagnosis of ocular manifestations in these patients. Methods. 180 intravenous drug abusers infected by HIV were examined for ocular changes and 20 of them were submitted to fluorescein angiography. The infection appeared as AIDS in 20 patients, ARC in 38 patients, PGL IN 94 patients. 28 of them were asymptomatic. Results. Ocular changes were discovered by ophthalmoscopic examination in 10% of patients with PGL, in 25% with ARC and in 56% with AIDS. Fluorescein angiography showed retinal changes in 10% of patients with PGL, in 50% with ARC and in 80% with AIDS. Retinal vasculitis was found only in 2 cases with ARC and in 2 with AIDS. Conclusion. Ocular changes may be divided into 3 main types: infectious, non infectious and neoplastic. Fluorescein angiography is more sensitive in the early diagnosis of retinal changes. 7184 ORALMI Italy Objective. To study the ocular abnormalities in symptomatic HIV Ab positive subjects. Methods. 44 HIV Ab positive patients (14 AIDS, 13 ARC and 17 PGL) underwent direct and indirect ophthalmoscopyand, if lesions were detected, fluorescein angiography. Results. Retinal findings in 37 patients (34 of them with out ocular symptoms) included hemorrhages,cottn wool spots, acute retinal necrosis. Retinitis by Cytomegalovirus were diagnosed in three cases (OI-AIDS with disseminated CMV infection). Cotton wool spots are the most frequent ocular abnorralities, found in 86% HIV Ab positive patients. The fluorescein angiography show a frequent pattern of diffuse microvascular retinopathy (microaneurysms). Conclusion. Retinal abnormalities are common during HIV infection in patients without symptoms of ocular disease. The cotton wool spots as the most common findings, and the related microaneurysms seen by fluorescein angiography led us to suppose that the first damage might be a microangio pathy with focal ischemia and disruption ofhemato-retinal barrier. The possible role of HIV in that type of lesions is under investigation. 423 [Page 424](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/422) 7185 EYE INVOLVEMENT IN HIV INFECTED PATIENTS R Maserati, G Vandelli*, A Ghisolfi*, A Tafi*, Depts., I.R.C.C.S.

Retinitis was due to CMV (2) and toxoplasma all in the WR6 group; uveitis cases seemed aspecific and healed with topical steroids. Other therapeutic measures encompassed anti-toxo therapy (which proved to be effective) for 1 retinitis case, while the unavailability of DHPG did not allow the ethiologic treatment of CMV-induced lesions. Early diagnosis of all ocular changes and the demonstration of their nature (in multiple-infected pts.) may result a difficult task in these individuals; serial ocular exams may enhance their recognition in initially normal pts. 7186 OCCURENCE AND TREATMENT OF RETINITIS IN AIDS - PATIENTS I.Nieuwenhuis,G.Hoffken,W.Heise,L.L.Hansen Klinikum Steglitz of the University: ***Dept. Medicine, D-1000 Berlin Objective: The occurence treatment of retinitis in patients with AIDS (WR 3-6) was studied. Methods: HIV-infected patients were staged using the Walter-Reed-Classification and underwent a complete ophthalmological examination and, if possible, were treated by specific chemotherapeutic agents. Results: Of 85 patients (WR 3-6) 17 (20%) showed signs of retinal infection. Toxoplasmic retinochorioiditis occured in 4 eyes of 3 patients, two times as the initial manifestation of AIDS. 2 patients were treated by a triple therapy (Sulfadiazine, Pyrimenthamine,Clindamycine) wich led to complete regression and cicatrization of the fundus lesions. Of 14 patients with Cytomegalyretinitis 11 sohwed bilateral disease. 9 eyes that could not be treated became blind 3-24 weeks after the first sign of the disease. 14 eyes were treated with Ganciclovir (4weeks, 10 mg/kg daily, 2 infusions). This led to a slower progression rate in 4, a regression in 8 and a retinal scar without visible active lesions in 2 eyes. Cessation of the treatment caused a relapse within 2 weeks. All patients now get a maintenance therapy of 5-10 mg/kg five times a week. The longest observed survival time was 15 months. Conclusion: Early blindness due to retinitis is a frequent complication in AIDS that can be prevented or postponed be immediate and vigorous chemotherapy. Notes: 7187 DETECTION OF HIV IN OCULAR TISSUES FROM PATIENTS WITH AIDS Herbert L. Medicine, St. Paul Ramsey Hosp., St. Paul ***Dept. of Lab Medicine, Univ. of MN, Minneapolis Objective. To detect HIV in ocular tissues from patients with AIDS. Methods. Eyes from two patients were dissected and placed in tissue culture medium immediately postmortem. Mitogen stimulated mononuclear cells from HIV-negative donors were added to the culture. The supernate was periodically assayed for HIV antigen (P-24) by enzyme immunoassay. Both patients had CMV retinitis treated by intravitreal injection of ganciclovir. Both patients also received intermittent treatment with zuidovudine. Results. HIV IMMUNOASSAY Conj. Cornea Iris Lens CMV RETINITIS WITH INTRAVITREAL GANCICLOVIR Minneapolis **Dept. of Medicine, St. Paul Ramsey Hosp., St. Paul ***Dept. of Lab Medicine, Univ. of Minn., Minneapolis Objective. To treat AIDS - associated CMV retinitis in patients unable to take ganciclovir systemically. Methods. Patients with active CMV retinitis ineligible for systemic ganciclovir because of leukopenia (less than 1500 WBC) or other systemic antiviral therapy (AZT, ACV) received intravitreal injection of ganciclovir (200 ugm) twice weekly for 3 weeks. Maintenance treatment consisted of weekly injections continued indefinitely. Treatment response and ocular toxicity were monitored by weekly clinical examination and monthly fundus photography. Results. Seven patients (10 eyes) have been treated with follow-up of 49-144 days (mean 108 days). Each eye received between 10 and 23 (mean 18) injections. All eyes showed an initial favorable response to treatment. Three eyes showed reactivation on weekly maintenance treatment, but responded to more frequent injection. Two eyes reactivated when lost to follow-up. Vision remained stable in eight, improved in one and deteriorated in one. CMV could not be cultured from the retina in four eyes studied postmortem. Intravitreal therapy was extremely well tolerated with no complications associated with over 175 injections and no evidence of ocular toxicity. Conclusion. Intravitreal injection of ganciclovir is a safe and effective treatment of CMV retinitis in patients ineligible for systemic treatment. CaseI + Case 2 + + Cultures of all ocular tissues except the conjunctiva were negative for CMV. Conclusion. The finding of HIV in multiple ocular tissues is consistent with the neurotropic nature of the virus and may explain some of the ocular manifestations of AIDS such as AIDS retinopathy. 424 [Page 425](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/423) 7189 CMV -,e Houston Neurological Center, Houston Texas U.S.A. This report discusses CMV viral infection and it's relations to the Central Nervous System.Data is deri ved from 45 cases at Park Plaza Hospital in Houston Texas.These 45 patients were selected out of 130 patients seen for neurological consultation for CNS in volvement.There is included 23 cases of encephalopathy associated with CMV retinitis or gastritis.Also inclu case of cardiomyopathy associated wtth encephalopathy.There are 8 cases of polyneuropathy and 2 cases of myelopathy. These CMV infections were treated with Gangciclovir. One third of the patients obtained stabilization or sustained improvement with continued Ganciclovir for the remainder of their lives (1-3 years).This empirical data from clinical experience suggests a correlation of CMV retinitis with encephalopathy,myelopathy and polyneuropathy.Throughout the time the patient had CMV infection it was required to continue Ganciclovir with only brief periods of cessation secondary to side effects. 7190 GANCICLOVIR (GCV) RESISTANT STRAINS OF CYTOMEGALOVIRUS Jordan.* *AIDS Clinical Trials Unit, U of Minnesota, **U of Oregon, and ***Burroughs Wellcome Co. (USA) Objective. To determine whether resistance occurred during GCV therapy (Rx), we studied early (E) and late (L) CMV strains from 3 patients (pts) persistently viremic and clinically failing to respond during Rx. Pt A and B had AIDS and disseminated CMV infection. In pt A, 6/8 blood cultures before and 22/23 during 171 days of GCV Rx were positive for CMV. CMV was recovered from all 19 blood samples from pt B obtained before (8) and during (11) 139 days of GCV Rx. Pt C had leukemia and CMV retinitis; 12/12 blood cultures during 88 days of GCV Rx were positive for CMV. Method. CMV susceptibility to GCV was determined by plaque reduction. Restriction mapping of viral DNA was performed after endonuclease digestion and Southern blot hybridization. Results. Pt A B C Isolate AD169 Early Late Early Late (uM) Isolate E from pt A was GCV-sensitive. L isolates from all 3 pt were GCV resistant. Susceptibilities of the E isolates from pt B and C are pending (pd). E and L isolates from pt A were genetically different. All isolates from pt B and C were identical. Conclusion. To our knowledge this is the first report of CMV resistance to GCV developing in vivo. The possibility of selecting GCV resistant CMV strains needs to be considered when treating pt with AIDS who often require prolonged courses of GCV Rx. Notes: 7191 GANCICLOVIR IN THE PATIENTS. B. Steiner, V. Groh, K. Wolff and G. Stingl. Depts. of Medicine II and Dermatology I, University Hospital, Vienna, Austria. Ganciclovir was used in the treatment of CMV infection in 25 anti-HIV-antibody positive pats. (3 in group 3, 22 in group 4; CDC-classif.). 12 pats. had CMV-related clinical symptoms (7 pats. with pneumonia, 2 with hepatitis, 1 with retinitis, 6 with fever). Ganciclo vir was given for 10 days, 3-15 mg/kg body weight/day. While, in asymptomatic pats., repeated CMV-testing frequently revealed an increase in anti-CMV IgM antibody before the start of ganciclovir, this was never observed in symtomatic patients in whom virus isolation was regularly successful. After ganciciovir therapy, all clinical, sero logical and virological signs of CMV infection disappeared in 21 of 25 pats. (84%). A recurrence of infection was diagnosed in 2 of 13 primarily asymptomatic pats. (15.4%) and in 7 of 12 primarily symptomatic pats. (58.3%) witnin the observation period of 2-10 months. 2 pats. died in the ascute phase of CMV infection. Although many pats. entered the study with borderline numbers of leukocytes or thrombocytes or elevated serum transaminase levels, the dosage of ganciclovir never had to be modified because of side effects. We conclude that first, the diagnosis of CMV infection was mainly based on virus isolation rather than on a demonstration of anti-CMV antibodies, and second, that ganciclovir was effective in the immediate control of CMV infection in the majority of pats. However, in most instances of symptomatic pats. the discontinuation of therapy resulted in a recurrence of disease. 7192 GASTROINTESTINAL CYTOMEGALOVIRUS.INFECTION IN AIDSENDOSCOPIC FINDINGS AND THERAPY WITH HEISE,P.MOSTERTZ,K.ARASTEH,M.L'AGE AUGUSTE-VIKTORIA-HOSPITAL,D looo BERLIN 41 Infections with Cytomegalovirus(CMV)are a major feature of AIDS causing serious complications in gastrointestinal involvement. METHODS:We prospectively examined the upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI)tracts of 98 AIDSpatients with abdominal symptoms.Histological examination and cultural investigation for CMV were done.The response of severe GIT lesions to the therapy with DHPG was documented. RESULTS:28/98 patients with abdominal symptoms were found to have CMV lesions in the GI tract. CMV caused inflammatory bowel disease,gastritis, colitis,polypoid,erosive lesions and severe ulcerations with perforation and bleeding. DHPG was successfully used to treat serious CMV infection. CONCLUSIONS CMV infection with manifestation in the gastrointestinal tract causes a huge variety of clinical symptoms,endoscopic findings and gastrointestinal complications like bleeding and perforation in 28,6% of our AIDS patients with abdominal symptoms. DHPG offers promise for the therapy of severe CMV gastrointestinal (CMV) 183 AIDS PATIENTS (PTS). D. DIETERICH, M Dugan, K Blank, A Chachoua. Kaplan Cancer Center, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY. Objective. To determine the effects of DHPG treatment of CMV infections in AIDS pts. Methods. Between 1985 and 1988, 183 pts were treated with DHPG at NYU on a compassionate use protocol. Diagnosis was made by CMV culture, biopsy, or fundoscopy. Responses were measured clinically and virologically by objective criteria including endoscopy. DHPG was given at a dose of 5 mg/kg iv q 12h x 14 days. Upon relapse pts were retreated and placed on maintenance treatment of 5 mg/kg iv q d. Results. 176 (96%) were male (m) and 7 (4%) were female (f). 170 (93%) were homosexual, 1 m and 1 f had transfusion AIDS, 5 m (3%) and 1 f were iv drug abusers. 5 f (3%) were sex partners of IVDA. Mean age was 38 years (21-65). 93 (53%) pts had Kaposi's sarcoma, 117 (64%) pts had PCP. 16 pts were treated with AZT. Sites of CMV were lower GI 77 (42%), CNS and retina 71 (39%), upper GI 20 (11%), lung 10 (5.5%), liver 4 (2%) and heart 1. Clinically 135 (74%) improved, 16 (9%) stabilized and 26 (14%) worsened. 6 (3.3%) were not evaluable. Virologically of the 70 evaluable pts 64 (95%) were responders, 6 (9%) non re.sponders 113 (62%) were not evaluable. reversible leukopenia 4 1,500 in 12 (6.5%) thrombocytopenia 4 25,000 in 7 (4%), skin rashes in 4 (2%). 58 (32%) pts are surviving. Overall median survival was 5.6 mos (mn 6.76). Survival of ptc on M was 8.0 mos compared to those who received no M ( p-.001). In pts with PCP, survival from date of PCP on M was 15 mos and not on M was 9.5 mos (p 4.01). Conclusion. DHPG is effective in the treatment of CMV infections in AIDS pts and relatively safe. Maintenance treatment appears to significantly prolong survival. 7194 DETECTION OF CMV AND HIV DOUBLE INFECTION IN THE SAME CELLS IN AIDS PATIENTS SchipperJlEIvan den Berg FM,Dingemans KP,Rook R,Tigges AJ AcademicaP Medical Centre, Department of Pathology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Human Immunodeficiency Virus(HIV) has a strong affinity for T- helper cells and other cell types,expressing the CD4 epitope on the plasma membrane.Cytomegalovirus(CMV) infected cells are mostly of endothelial or epithelial origin.A high percentage of HIV infected individualssuffering full blown AIDS,have a latent or active CMV infection.Ultrastructural examination demonstrated the presence of double infected cells with active HIV and CMV replication.In order to confirm these different viral infections and to determine exactly which cell types were infected,in situ hybridisation(ISH),immunophenotyping and electronmicroscopy were applied following standard procedures on sections of several organs,fixed in formalin,glutaraldehyde and frozen in liquid nitrogen.ISH revealed CMVDNA in the nuclei of endothelial and epithelial cells and some diffuse staining in the cytoplasm.Ultrastructural examination of the same cells demonstrated the presence of both CMV and HIV particles intermingled in the nuclei,while only HIV was observed in the cytoplasm.Immunoperoxidase labeled antisera for Immediate Early Antigen(IEA) of CMV and HIV envelope protein(p25) confirmed these findings,interestingly only a subset of CMV positive cells expressed HIV p25. Immunophenotyping results were difficult to interprete because of the desintegration and the consequently altered membrane properties of the double infected cells.However lightmicroscopical examination revealed that these double infected cells all show characteristic CMV inclusion bodies in the nuclei and red-eosinophilic staining globules of different size in the cytoplasm.The different cytopathic effects of these two virusestheir reciprocal influence and the consequences for the cell metabolism are discussed.Active replication of two different viruses in the same cell appears to be in contradiction with the general conceptions of the viral life cycle. Notes: 7195 EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF DISSEMINATED AND VISCERAL M. Grasso, M.Zavattoni L. Minoli1 Virus Laboratory, Institute of Infectious Diseases, and Institute of Pathology, University of Pavia, 27100 Pavia, Italy. Objective. Disseminated human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections with visceral involvement are often life-threatening and diagnosis may not be obvious. We developed protocols for an early diagnosis of HCWV infection from buffy coat and other clinical specimens (urine, saliva), as well as from bioptic samples. Methods. Using IFA and monoclonal antibody (MAb) to immediate early, (IEA), early (EA) and late antigens (LA), HCMV identification was achieved in cell cultures 24-48h p.i. using MAb to IEA and EA, and 72 p.i. using MAb to LA. In parallel, \"in situ' DNA hybridization detected viral DNA simultaneously to LA detection. Bioptic samples were partly frozen, and partly paraffin-embedded. Results. Cryostatic sections of lung, liver, kidney from patients with disseminated infection or organ pathology showed presence of both EA and LA as well as presence of a lower number of cells positive for HCMV DNA. Deparaffinized sections of organ samples from the same patients revealed presence of cytoplasmic inclusions, but not s-cructural HCMV antigens. Conclusion. Early and rapid diagnosis of HCi\\V infection in AIDS patients allows timely treatment with antiviral drugs (DHPG). Partially supported by Min. SanitA, THE LARYNGEAL NERVE PRESENTING AS HOARSENESS IN AIDS PATIENTS Peter M. Small, L. McPhaul, C.D. Sooy, C. B. Wofsy, M. A. Jacobson San Francisco General Hospital (University of California), San Francisco, CA. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most common viral opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. We report two patients with AIDS, peripheral neuropathy, and CMV colitis who developed hoarseness with left vocal cord paralysis on indirect laryngoscopy. One patient underwent post mortem examination and had extensive CMV infection of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and multiple dorsal root ganglia. Histologic examination of the laryngeal nerve showed edema and marked infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils in association with numerous cells containing amphophilic intranuclear and eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of CMV. Although both had completed a 10 day induction course of ganciclovir, neither patient was receiving an optimal maintenance dose at the time hoarseness developed. It is unknown if full dose ganciclovir maintenance (25-30 mg/kg/week) or induction (70 mg/kg/wk) therapy would improve this condition. Conclusion. CMV involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerves causing paralysis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hoarseness in patients with AIDS. 426 [Page 427](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/425) 7197 CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF CMV VIREMIA (CMV.V) PATIENTS. Dominique Salmon, Bricaire, J.L. Vild4. H6pital Claude Bernard, Paris, France. Objective. To determine the frequency of positive CMV.V in AIDS patients (pts) and its predictive value for CMV infections. Methods. CMV.V was detected by culture of blood leucocytes buffy-coat on human fibroblasts, in 78 AIDS pts followed for at least 3 months from 1/85-10/87. CMV infection was defined by fundoscopic and angiographic findings for retinitis, by macroscopic lesions and viral inclusions for biliary, digestive or lung involvement. Results. At least one CMV-V was positive in 43/78 (55 %) pts. The percentage of pts with positive CMV-V was related to the number (N) of CMV-V performed per pt = 42 % for N = 1 or 2, 59 % for N = 3 or 4, 93 % for N k 5. 36 CMV localisations, retinitis (9), biliary and digestive infection (18), pneumopathy (9), were found in 25/78 (32 %) pts, during life (n = 22) or at autopsy (n = 3). At the time of the first CMV localisation, CMV-V was positive in 21/24 (87.5 %) pts. Of 58 pts who had early CMV-V research (~ 3 months before or after diagnosis of AIDS), 21 were positive (group 1) and 37 were negative (group 2). CMV visceral infection was more frequent in grp 1, 11/21 (52 %), than in grp 2, 7/37 (18 %) (p < 0.01) and occurred earlier (1.8 ~ 1.6 versus 8.3 ~ 6.1 months) (p < 0.01). Death rate and time of survival were not different in the two groups. Conclusion. These results show (1) the high frequency of positive CMV.V in AIDS (2) the relative predictive value for proven visceral involvement of early positive CMV.V. 7198 NATURAL HISTORY OF UNTREATED CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV) INFECTIONS IN AIDS PATIENTS. VIBEKE STRAND*, Douglas T. **, Abraham Chachoua** and *DHPG Collaborative Study Group. *Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA, **New York University Medical Center, New Yo-k, i1. Objective. To study the course of CMV infections in AIDS patients before the use of ganciciovir (DHPG) and AZT. Methods. A retrospective study was performed in six centers in the DHPG Collaborative Study Group. Data war collected on patients (pts) with AIDS and CMV infections who were not treated with DHPG or AZT. Pts were grouped by site of infection at presentation. Evaluation was based on fundoscopic exam, biopsy or autcpsy. The site of CMV infection was noted to be resolved, stabilized oprogressed within the same organ system as the diagnosis. Results. Detailed information wan obtained on 40 pta. 20 had retinitis, 12 had gastrointestinal CMV, 7 had pneumonia and 1 had CNS disease. 39 were male and 1 female. Mean age at CMV diagnosis was 38.1 years. Prior manifestations of AIDS were PCP in 29, candidiasis in 19, M. avium in 11. Kaposi's sarcoma was found in 14 ptr. Progression of CMV occurred in 35/40 pts (88%). Median survival was 2.3 months and median time to progression of CMV disease was 0.8 months. Although the numbers are small, there was no difference in survival between the different sites of disease. The dissemination of CMV to a distant organ system was documented at autopsy in 9/9 (100%) pts. Conclusion. While this is a retrospective review, it indicates that CMV is a devastating opportunistic infection in AIDS ptc. The survival without treatment was 2.3 months and time to relapse or progression was 0.8 months. This data can be used as a historical control group for other studies of CMV treatment. Notes: 7199 SIGNIFICANCE OF DIRECT CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (CMV)IMMEDIATE EARLY ANTIGEN (IEA) DETECTION IN BLOOD LEUCOCYTES DURING FEBRILE CONDITIONS IN AIDS PATIENTS Herman G Sprenger, J Weits, JT Anema, W van der Bij, J Schirm, TH The University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands. Objective. Is detection of CMV-IEA in peripheral blood leucocytes useful in establishing the role of CMV activity or disease during febrile periods in AIDS patients? Methods. 10 AIDS patients were prospectively followed during inpatient periods with fever. Using monoclonal antibodies CMV-IEA could be detected in cytocentrifuged blood leucocytes within 3-5 hrs after sampling. Simultaneously CMV buffy coat cultures were done (viraemia). The CMV-IEA test was expressed semiquantitatively in negative, positive and strongly positive. Results. Altogether 19 periods with fever occurred. The number of observations per period ranged between 1 and 10 (mean 2.5). Viraemia was present in 24 of 48 observations (50%). CMV-IEA was found on 33 of these 48 occasions (69%). 22 (92%) of the 24 positive blood cultures were in the 33 IEA positive samples (67%). Viraemia was present on at least 1 occasion in 11 of 19 (58%) fever periods. In 3 of 11 periods with viraemia important CMV disease was diagnosed on clinical and histological grounds. These 3 patients had strongly positive IEA tests. In the remaining 8 periods with viraemia always other febrile causes were found and the IEA test was not strongly positive. In the 8 periods without detectable viraemia important CMV activity was quickly excluded with the CMV-IEA test. Conclusion. In febrile AIDS patients CMV viraemia is often present. The CMV-IEA test on peripheral blood cells seems to be helpful in determining the clinical importance of CMV activity. 7200 REACTIVATION OF CMV AND EBV IS FREQUENT AMONG MALE HOMOSEXUALS (MHS) AND PRECEDES HIV INFECTION Z Bentwichn, R Burstein*, T. Gotlieb-Stematsky**, A. Vonsover**, ZT Ari of Clinical Immunology, Rehovot; **The Central Virology Laboratory, Tel-Hashomer; Israel Objective. To determine the role of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the pathogenesis of AIDS and susceptibility to HIV infection. Methods. The presence and level of serum antibodies to EBV and CMV in a cohort of MHS in Israel were correlated to HIV serology and immune profiles of these individuals. Results. 91% and 98% of MHS were seropositive for CMV and EBV, respectively. of Viral Serology Virus Mean Geometric Titre HIV+ HIV- Pregnant Normal CMV 167 126 99 33 EBV 42 33 30 15 No significant differences in MGT were found between immune impaired and non-impaired individuals. Conclusion. These findings suggest that reactivation of CMV and EBV is commonly present in MHS, precedes HIV infection and may contribute to increased susceptibility of MHS to HIV infection and AIDS. 427 [Page 428](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/426) EXCRETION OF EPSTEIN-BARR IN HOMOSEXUAL MEN. J Ferbas, A Rahman, R Atchison, M Breinig, J Armstrong, M Ho, D Lyter, L Kingsley, P Gupta, C Rinaldo University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A. Objective. To assess EBV reactivation during HIV infection in a cohort of homosexual men (n=308). Methods. EBV reactivation was evaluated serologically and by EBV isolation from throatwashings by transformation of umbilical-cord blood lymphocytes. HIV antibody (Ab) was determined by ELISA and Western blot. Results. Cross-sectional data established a strong association (p<0.01) between oropharyngeal EBV excretion 15% (30/199) Results from semiannual specimens from HIV Ab seroconvertors suggest that oropharyngeal EBV reactivation occurs early during the course of HIV infection, in that 48% (11/23) of subjects shed EBV before seroconversion of EBV is correlated with HIV serostatus in homosexual men. Present data suggest that increased frequency of EBV shedding begins early during the course of HIV infection, possibly due to immunologic perturbations caused by the retrovirus. 7202 CONCOMITANT INFECTION BY HIV-2, HTLV-1 and HHV-6 RELATED VIRUS IN A PATIENT FROM IVORY COAST. Denise Guetard a, C. Dauguet, J.M. Miclea Institute, A* Saint-Louis Hospital, Paris A 19-year-old woman from Ivory Coast was hospitalized for Adult T-cell Leukemia and opportunistic infections;despite therapy by deoxycoformycin and zidovudine, fatal outcome occured. HTLV-1 and HIV-2 infections were evidenced by serological ELISA and Western blot assays. Southern blotting showed monoclonal integration of HTLV-1 provirus in leukemic cells. In attemps to isolate HIV-2, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patient were grown in cell culture but no reverse transcriptase activity was ever detected. However, a cytopathic effect (CPE) made of large refractile cells was observed, quite comparable to that reported by others for human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6, previously HBLV) infections. Crude or filtered (0.45 and 0.22 um filters) medium from infected cultures serially propagated the CPE in PHA-stimulated human blood leucocytes. Conversely, appearance of CPE was completely inhibited by 100 uM aciclovir. Electron microscopy examination showed the presence of typical herpes particles in infected cells and in pellets of culture supernatants. DNA from infected cells and purified virions snecifically hybridized with the pZVH14 probe derived from HHV-6 (kindly proved by R. Gallo), confirming the close relationship of the isolate with HHV-6. Preliminary results suggest that the studied virus mostly exhibits T-lymphocyte tropism. This case emphasizes the possible interactions between lynphotropic viruses in the genesis of immune system disorders. Notes: 7203 REACTIVATION OF HERPES VARICELLA-ZOSTER VIRUS Nairobi,***Kenya Medical Research Institute,****Nairobi City Commission, Nairobi Objective. To measure prevalence and incidence of HIV infection in patients with zoster and other dermatologic conditions. Methods. Ninety-five patients with zoster or skin diseases including pruritus, psoriasis and Herpes simplex were clinically and serologically patients were reevaluated after convalescence. HIV seroconversions were re-confirmed and cases reviewed. Result. Of zoster patients 47/63 (75%) had confirmed HIV seropositivity, and 0/17 others seroconverted (p=NS). Case 1 had had recent prostitute contact and genital ulcer disease prior to zoster. Case 2 had had recent intramuscular injection for unspecified disease. Each had undergone febrile illness coincident with zoster. Conclusion. We demonstrate the known association of zoster and HIV infection. We suggest that zoster may less commonly be a manifestation of acute HIV infection. 7204 UNUSUAL HEPATITIS B MARKERS IN HIV **National Cancer Inst.,Bethesda, MD. USA Objective:To determine whether significant differences in hepatitis serological markers exist in HIV serpositive(+) patients, high risk HIV seronegative(-) patients and HIV (-) immunosuppressed renal transplant patients (RTP). Methods:Hepatitis serology, immunoglobulin levels and liver function tests were performed bi-annually for the past 3 years. Medical records were reviewed to obtain demographic data, nutritional status and underlying illness Results:One hundred and eighty-nine HIV(+), 95 HIV(-) and 30 HIV(-) RTP were HIV(-) and 2/30 HIV(-) RTP. present in 21/189 HIV(+), 46/95 HIV(-) and 14/30 HIV (-) RTP. Delta virus markers were absent in all 21 HIV(+) intravenous drug abusers (IVDA) tested. Of 28 patients tested who had persistent HBcAb only, none had HBeAg. Serological evidence of hepatitis B was present in 84% of IVDA and 82% of homosexual/bisexual men. Conclusions: HIV(+) patients had a significantly higher (p.05) incidence of persistent HBcAb alone. Patients with persistent HBcAb only may not be infectious given their lack of HBeAg. These patients also had significantly higher IgG levels (p.05) than patients with any other serological profile. Hepatitis B markers were common among homosexual/bisexual men and IVDA seropositive for HIV. Delta hepatitis appears to be uncommon among HIV seropositive patients. 428 [Page 429](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/427) 7205 * INSERM ** Unit6 Pasteur, REAPPEARANCE OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) IN IMMUNE PATIENTS INFECTED WITH HIV-1. Y. Lazizi*, L. Grangeot-Keros*, J.F. Delfraissy*, F. B6clbre, CLAMART, d'Immunologie Microbienne, Institut Paris, France. Objective. To investigate the role of HIV-1 infection on the outcome of hepatitis B. Methods. HIV-1 Ab were tested by ELISA and confirmed by Western-Blot, HBsAg anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HBe, anti-HBc-IgM, delta Ag by commercial tests. Pre-S2 and anti-pre-S2 were assayed by ELISA using a monoclonal Ab. HBV-DNA was detected by spot hybridization. Results. We observed a possible HBV reactivation in two HIV-1 patients initially positive for anti-HBs and in one negative for anti-HBs but positive for anti-HBc and anti-pre-S2. Reappearance of HBsAg, HBeAg, pre-S2 and HBVDNA was associated with a decrease in the mean CD4 + cells/ml and a disease progression in two of them. Conclusion. Several hypothesis can be made to explain this phenomenon - reinfection with another HBV subtype - activation of viral replication in low level carriers of HBV, - HBV reactivation from HBV-DNA in lymphocytes and/or hepatocytes. HEPATITIS B AS A MARKER FOR HIV Brith Christenson City of Stockholm Environment and health protection administration Stockholm, Sweden Hepatitis B (HB) is thougt to be one of the best marker to estimate the future spread of HIV. The spread of HB has been very limited in Sweden and has mainly concerned the homosexuals and the drug abusers. HB was introduced in Sweden after the Second World War when the first IV drug abuser was diagnosed. In the fifties it was spread in the big cities among young adults in the same age cohorts as the IV drug abuse accours. In 1976 outbreaks arose in many places in Sweden among drug abusers, thereby indicating that a new cohort of young, parenteral drug abusers had been recruited. The number of cases of hepatitis B decreased from 1771 in 1976 to 308 cases in 1987. This decrease indicate that the recruitment of new cohorts of drug abusers has ceased, since most cases of hepatitis are in this sub-population. A plausible explanation of the decrease, at least after 1983, may be fear of HIV infection. The second most common cause of infection is through sexual activity. An increasing number of cases have been in women. The number of males who reported homosexual activity seems to have decreased. Even though HB is much more contagious than HIV and it has been a continous addition of carries through immigrants, refugees, and adopted children from countries with a high prevalence of HB carriers the spread of HB has been limited. The conclusions drawn from HB and from the extensive testing for HIV in Sweden are that the spread of HIV will be very limited. Notes: 7207 OCCUR OF HIV+HBV AND HIV+HBV+DV INFECTIONS. A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. V. PURO, E. BOUMIS, M. OOLAIACOMD, E. GIRARDI, AND G. VISCO. \"L. Spallanzani\" Hospital for Infectious Diseases AIDS Unit. Via Portuense 292 00149 Rome Italy Prevalence of a) HIV plus HBV and b) HIV plus HBV plus HDV coinfections have been studied in 266 HIV-Ab positive subjects in which HBV markers were available. 229 of them were parenterally drug addicts (DA) and 37 were male cmosexuals (MH). Any HBV markers was detected in 29 subjects (23 DA and 6 MH) but positive HBV markers were found (one at least) in 206 subjects (90C/) into the DA group and in 31 (84%) into the MH group. Among these 237 HBV seropositive subjects, 64 (27/o) were carriers of HBsAg (56 DA and 8 MH). Among these HBsAg carriers 43 were also tested for HDV-Ab and 28 of them (69/) were positive. A few HBsAb have been also found in DA group, providing that only 42 out of 150 of them (28/o) had anti-HBc antibodies alone. The HBcAb was the only marker found in 3 out of 23 (13%) HBsAg negative MH. A liver biopsy was performed in 57 patients and among them 31 had a chronic active hepatitis (13 HBsAg+HDV Ab positive, 4 HBsAg positive), 9 had a chronic persistent or lobular hepatitis (all HBsAg negative and 5 HBsAg negative). Four patients showed a normal liver histologic pictu re. 7208 ITRACONAZOLE FOR PREVENTION OF RELAPSE IN CRYPTOCOCCAL MENINGITIS IN Medicine and *x*Microbiology, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Objective. Cryptococcal meningitis is a life threatening opportunistic infection with a prevalence among AIDS patients of 2-7.5%. Combination therapy with amphotericin B/ flucytosine for six weeks is the treatment of choice. Maintenance therapy (MT), for which weekly amphotericin B is generally used, is necessary as relapses occur frequently. Itraconazole is a new triazole antifungal agent chemically related to imidazole derived drugs l-ike ketoconazole. Methods. We treated six AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis who received six to eight weeks induction treatment with amphotericin B/flucytosine in an open study with oral itraconazole (200-400 mg daily) to prevent relapse. Results. Cryptococcal antigen titer (CAT) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prior to starting MT ranged from 1:2 to 1:2048. CAT declined in three cases during therapy with itraconazole (range 1:1 - 1:32) and became negative in two patients (follow-up 3-19 months). One patient refused CSF re-examination; he died three months later without clinical evidence of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis. One patient died after three months and one patient after 12 months of MT; in both patients CSF cultures were sterile prior to death. Three patients are alive, one after five, one after 17 and one after 19 months of follow-up under MT. No side-effects were observed during treatment. Conclusion. Long-term maintenance therapy with oral itraconazole to prevent relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS appears effective and safe. 429 [Page 430](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/428) 7209 DISSEMINATED BLASTOMYCOSIS IN HIV INFECTED S Berman*, G Tan**, J Tilles*. *Division of Infectious Disease and **Department of Pathology, University of California, Irvine Medical Center, Orange, California, USA. Objective. HIV infected individuals are at increased risk for infection with the dimorphic fungi Histoplasma Capsulatum and exists endemically in parts of N.America, it has not been previously reported in HIV infected individuals. We report here 2 cases. Methods. Retrospective case reports. Results. 1. Blastomyces dermatitidis was isolated from multiple organ sites. 2. Cutaneous manifestations were not present. 3. All individuals lived or travelled in areas known to be endemic for Blastomyces dermatitidis. 4. Disseminated blastomycosis was the only existing opportunistic infection at the time of diagnosis. 5. Antibody determination measured by complement fixation and immunodiffusion were not helpful in making the diagnosis. 6. Conversion of the isolated organism from mycelia to yeast form was extremely slow and difficult. 7. Exoantigen was not detected by conventional methods. Identification was based on conversion and morphological features with confirmation from CDC. Conclusion. Patients with HIV infection are at risk for disseminated blastomycosis. The diagnosis relies heavily on culture and tissue examination with serological detection being of little value. Since disseminated blastomycosis may be the only presenting opportunistic infection in a HIV infected patient, it should be considered diagnostic of AIDS under such circumstances. 7210 RHODOCOCCUS EQUI: THREE CASES OF LUNG-ABCESS IN B. Pangon*, G. Pialoux**, P.M. Girard*, B. Dupont**, L. J. Couderc*** et al. * Hopital Claude Bernard, 75944 Paris cedex 19, ** Institut Pasteur Paris cedex 15, Hopital St Louis, 75475 Paris cedex 10, France. Objective. R. equi is an aerobic pleiomorphic gram positive coccobacillary organism recognized as pathogen in foals. We report three cases of lung-abcess in HIV infected patients, two with AIDS. Methods. Chest radiography disclosed round pulmonary infiltrate, with an air-filled-cavity demonstrated by CT scann (2 cases) and pleural involvement (2 cases). R. equi was cultured from sputum (3), bronchioalveolar lavage (2), bronchial brushing (2), blood (1) and surgery specimen (1); it was identified on cultural and biochemical characteristics. All patients were treated by bi-antibiotherapy, associated with surgical resection in 1 case. Two patients died from associated visceral leishmaniosis (1) and Kaposi's sarcoma (1). Conclusion. R. equi infection should be included in the list of opportunistic infections occuring during AIDS. It must not be confused with other nocardioform actinomycetes particularly Nocardia, responsible for close disease, or considered as a contaminant, for it may cause severe disease in immunocompromized patients. Notes: 7211 Therapy of Isospora belli Patients. J.W. PAPE*, R. VERDIER**, GHESKIO, Haiti**. Objective. To evaluate therapy and prophylaxis of isosporiasis in AIDS patients. Methods - Results. Isospora belli is a common infection in Haitian patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). I. belli responds to therapy with trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole (TS) but the recommended duration of treatment is long (31 days) and is associated with a high rate of recurrence (50%). We have treated 32 patients with I. belli infection and chronic watery diarrhea with oral trimethoprim 400 mgm - sulfamethoxazole 800 mgm four times daily for 10 days. In all patients diarrhea stopped within 2.5 days of initiating therapy. I. belli was not detected in stool samples beyond 5 days of TS treatment. After the successful initial therapy, the patients were randomized into 3 groups for evaluation of prophylaxis: either sulfadoxine 500 mgm - pyrimethamine (SP) 25 mgm once a week (mean duration, 8 mo); trimethoprim 160 mgm - sulfamethoxazole 800 mgm three times a week (mean duration, 6 mo); or placebo. Fifty per cent (5/10) of patients on placebo developed recurrent symptomatic isosporiasis within 6 weeks.90% (9/10) of patients on TS and all those on SP remained asymptomatic with negative stool exams. No adverse drug reactions were noted in any of the 32 patients treated with TS for 10 days; one patient receiving TS prophylaxis and another receiving SP developed severe pruritis (after 12-14 weeks) requiring discontinuation of the drugs. Conclusion. AIDS patients with isosporiasis can be effectively treated with a 10 day course of TS and recurrent disease can be prevented with prophylactic TS or SP. 7212 LEGIONELLA MICDADEI INFECTION IN THREE PEOPLE WITH AIDS - SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, USA S Ostroff*, S Hopkins**, M Commons**, William E Lafferty***, J Kobayashi***, J Campbell*** *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, **Seattle-King County Department of Public Health, ***Washington State AIDS Surveillance, Seattle, Washington, USA Objective. To describe Legionella micdadei pneumonia in three people with AIDS (PWA's) and discuss implications for screening PWA's with respiratory symptoms. Methods. Case investigation. Results. Between May - July, 1987 three Seattle PWA's contracted Legionnaires' disease due to Legionella micdadei. In two, this was the only pathogen found; the third had concurrent Pneumocystis carinii. Two were diagnosed by bronchoscopy, the other by skinny needle biopsy of a lung abscess. Sputum was direct flourescent antibody positive in all; one was also culture confirmed. All survived after treatment with erythromycin. All visited the same clinic prior to illness, but the organism was not found in the clinic environment. Since 33% of bronchoscopy specimens from Seattle PWA's were tested for legionella in 1987, other cases may have been missed. Conslusions. These are the first reports of Legionella micdadei in PWA's. Since untreated Legionnaires' disease carries high mortality, screening of respiratory specimens for the organism in PWA's should be routine. 430 [Page 431](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/429) 7213 VISCERAL L.J. Couderc**, A.G. cedex 19, Hopital Saint Louis, 75475 Paris cedex 10, France. Objective. To study visceral leishmaniasis (V.L.) cases observed in HIV infected patients (pts) over a 1 year period in our department. Results. From May 1986 to May 1987, V.L. was demonstrated in 3 HIV infected pts, none with known AIDS. The 3 pts were referred with fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Pancytopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, cellular immunodeficiency were present in all of them. They had all travelled to endemic areas (South East France, Morocco, India). V.L. diagnosis was confirmed by Giemsa stained bone marrow smears examination (3/3 pts) and high specific antibody titers (3/3). Glucantime therapy was initiated in all cases. Two pts died, from V.L. (n=l) and Hodgkin lymphoma (n=l). V.L. is not frequently reported in immuno compromised pts: HIV infection was the underlying disease in 13 of the 29 reported cases. Prevalence of V.L. among HIV infected inpatients in our department over a 1 year period was 1% (3/335). Conclusion. These data suggest that all HIV infected pts having visited endemic aeras and presenting with fever with or without hepatosplenomegaly should be thoroughly investigated for V.L.. Kala Azar should be included as an opportunistic infection in the clinical and/or epidemiological AIDS definition. 7214 HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS INFECTION. Donald NY and **Vet. Adm. Med. Ctr., Univ. Calif, San Francisco, CA Objective Wasting is a frequent complication of AIDS, in the presence or absence of overt intestinal dysfunction. We examined the possibility that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or some complication of AIDS alters fuel metabolism and promotes weight loss. Methods Fasting serum triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol concentrations were determined in 32 male AIDS patients, 14 HIV seropositive male patients (7 with ARC) and 17 heterosexual male controls (C). Nutritional assessments were performed by determining total body potassium, a measure of body cell mass, in a whole body counter. Results Serum TG were higher in AIDS than in C (231~27 vs 91~10 mg/dl, p<0.001) while the HIV+ (>190 mg/dl). and non ARC HIV+. Serum TG concentrations were similar in wasted (normalized body cell mass <76%) and nonwasted subgroups of AIDS patients. Serum cholesterol concentrations were similar in all groups. Conclusion These results suggest that lipid metabolism is altered as a result of HIV infection. The occurence of hypertriglyceridemia and wasting indicates that the process is distinct from starvation and/or malabsorption. The occurence of hypertriglyceridemia in HIV+ patients without AIDS suggests that it occurs as a response to infection by HIV itself. Notes: 7215 Differentiation of opportunistic infections 215 of the CNS and chronic HIV encephalitis Virchow, Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany Objective. To evaluate methods to distinguish opportunistic infections of the central nervous system (CNS) from chronic HIV encephalitis. Methods. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 41 patients with AIDS were analyzed, 21 patients had opportunistic CNS infections (toxoplasmosis=12, PML=3, cryptococcosis=4, cytomegalovirus=3). Immunoglobulins (Ig) G, A, and M were measured nephelometric or by ELISA. Commercially available ELISA's were modified to detect intrathecally produced antibodies against HIV and Toxoplasma gondii at IgG-levels of 2,5 mg/l or less. Results. Intrathecal IgG-production was found in 26% of patients with HIV encephalitis, but no local IgA- and/or IgM-synthesis. In contrast, patients with opportunistic infections of the CNS show locally produced IgG (36%) as well as IgA (25%) and IgM (46%). Evidence for chronic HIV encephalitis was seen in 35/41 AIDS patients (88%) demonstrated by intrathecal HIV-antibody synthesis, Toxoplasma gondii specific locally produced antibodies were found in 8/12 patients with toxoplasma encephalitis, but not in patients with other opportunistic infections of the CNS. Conclusion. The quantitation of locally produced immunoglobulin fractions may be important for the diagnosis of opportunistic CNS infections. Intrathecally synthesized IgA and/or IgM indicate an opportunistic brain infection and was not seen in HIV encephalitis. The demonstration of intrathecally produced Toxoplasma gondii antibodies may be considered for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in toxoplasma encephalitis. 7216 OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS OBSERVED IN AIDS PATIENTS AT HOSPITAL UNIVERSITARIO GAFFREE E GUINLE - UNIVERSIDADE DO OBJECTIVE: To observe the incidence of opportunistic infections in AIDS patients. METHODS: Within 370 we evaluated 129 AIDS patients of both sexes confirmed by CDC criteria from Dec'83 to Dec'87.All patients were followed up for a minimum period of 6 months. RESULTS: We observed the following distribution of opportunistic infections among our 129 patients: 100 (77.5%) (0.7%) Shigella. It is important to emphasize that most of our patients had two or more opportunistic infections associated. CONCLUSION: 1 - Candidiasis represents the most common opportunistic infection similarly to observations in USA and European studies. 2 - Tuberculosis is the second most common infection observed in our patients, it demonstrates the importance of tuberculosis as opportunistic infection in AIDS patients from tropical countries. 3 - Cryptosporidium was the principal cause of diarrhea in our patients. 431 [Page 432](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/430) 7217 HYPOTHESIS: OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTION REFLECTS IMMUNE CLONAL DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO HIV INFECTION. T. E. Fehniger, S. Britton, O. Martinez-Maza+, Dept. of Infect. Diseases, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, and Dept. of Microbiol. and Immunol., UCLA, Los Angeles+ The question of why some organisms, and not others, so often cause opportunistic infections in AIDS patients remains unknown. We have considered the susceptibility to these pathogens (OP) from the perspective of 1): The specificities recognized by the immune repertoire prior to HIV infection; and 2: The process of immune dynamics predicted by the clonal selection theory. Since disseminated infections by OP rarely occur in non-immunocompromised individuals, nascent T and B cells with potential anti-OP directed reactivities must exist at sufficient high frequencies generally in the normal adult population at risk for AIDS. While antigen induced (specific or non-specific) clonal expansion enhances immune capacity that effectively limits the pathogenicity of OP, the cytopathic effects of HIV creates a special environment favorable to organisms expressing certain antigenic determinants. We propose that this is due to the selective destruction of clones which are potentially reactive with determinants expressed by OP, because of their high precursor frequency and relative clonal size prior to HIV infection. HIV can randomly infect any permissive cell expressing any given antigen receptor, but through mass action HIV is most likely to infect a cell which is a member of a dominant clone because they are represented most often in the total lymphocyte population. Because infected cells from dominant clones against frequently occuring antigens become activated more often, causing HIV release, new cycles of infection with HIV will begin. Eventually some clones will be functionally diminshed. Several such clones may need to be eliminated before clinical infection with OP is evident, which possibly explains why some variance in time between initial exposure to HIV, and development of OP infections is observed in individual AIDS patients. 7218 OPPORTUNISTIC PARASITIC AND MYCOTIC DISEASES IN ADULT AIDS PATIENTS IN BRAZZAVILLE (CONGO) B. CARME, P. MPELE, A. MBITSI, A.M. NGAPORO, M. GENTILINI. - Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire de Brazzaville, Congo. Objective. To determine the fi'equency of opportunistic parasitic and mycosis diseases in adult AIDS patients in the Congo. Methods. A study conducted at l'Hipital Universitaire de Brazzaville in 1986 and 1987 on adult AIDS patients using the WHO clinical definition for Africa (Bangui 1985) and HIV seropositive Pasteur Elisa test. Stool tests: Kato, methods, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parasitic and mycosic tests, evaluation of the toxoplasmosis antibody (TAB) level in the serum and CSF; for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia: estimation made after exclusion of all other etiological conditions causing pneumopathy. Results. 1- Intestinal parasitic diseases: parasitic profile found in 118 patients, 2/3 of whom were associated with chronic diarrhoea. Three important points are: the relative belli): 9.3%, cryptosporidiosis: of malignant strongyloidiasis. 2- Cerebral toxoplasmosis: in the absence of cerebral biopsy and a scanner, it was by comparing the serum TAB and CSF rates on 75 patients that an estimation of 20% was reached. 3- Meningitic cryptococcosis: 12 confirmed cases out of 139 patients (8,6%). carinii pneumonia: lower than 10%. 36%. 6- No cases of disseminated histoplasmosis. Conclusion. High frequency of cerebral toxoplasmosis; to a lesser extent cryptococcosis and isosporiasis; and relatively rare Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Notes: 7219 PRESENCE OF HIV ANTIBODY (Ab) IN SEXUALLY ABUSED CHILDREN (SAC) BJ Dattel, MD, K Coulter, MD, M Grossman, MD, LB Hauer, RN Univer. of CA, SF, San Francisco General Hosp., Child and Adol. Sexual Abuse Resource Cen.(CASARC) Objective: To determine if SAC are at risk for HIV infection. Methods: HIV Ab testing was offered to 316/649 (49%) - 18 years presenting to CASARC 12-1-86 through 9-1-87. Routine protocol for all SAC included: demographic, historical and HIV risk information and cultures for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Parental informed consent was obtained for HIV testing, which was done by ELISA with Western blot confirmation of positive or borderline samples. Follow-up occurred at 2,6, and 12 months. Results:HIV Ab testing was performed on 161 children (Group I), representing 51% of the sample. Parents of 155 (49%) declined testing. The groups did not differ in mean age or race distribution. Group I females had more positive STD cultures than Group II; no males had positive cultures. Group I females had a higher incidence of HIV risk factors than Group II females; males did not differ by group. One 17 year old male was HIV positive; he was from an AIDS risk group. HIV risk factors are summarized below. I: Male Female II: Male Female Chronic SAC 6% 18% 10 17 IVDU 0 6 0 3 Parent IVDU 8 22 10 17 Blood Transfusion 0 2 0 2 Multiple Sex Partners 3 24 3 9 Perpetrator at risk 3 0 0 0 Conclusions: Risk for HIV infection does exist in SAC and may be conferred by the type of abuse and/or the history or behavior of the child. HIV education and antibody testing (with informed consent) should be offered as part of the evaluation of SAC. 7220 CANADIAN PEDIATRIC HIV INFECTION: A GRAFT FROM A DEVELOPING COUNTRY Normand Lapointe, C Hankins**, K Elmslie 8, Montreal Regional STD Control, Quebec; **Federal Center for AIDS, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada Objective. To describe the influence of a developing country on the epidemiology of pediatric HIV infection in Canada. Methods. National and provincial surveillance data were analyzed and pediatric clinical records examined to highlight national contrasts, epidemiology in women, and maternal ethnic origin. Results. Comparing Canada as a whole (A) versus Canada removing Quebec (B), differences were observed for adult male:female ratio: 19:1 (A) versus 36:1 (B) (p<.01) and origin in a high prevalence country: 5% (A) versus 0.4% (B) (p<.001). Quebec female blood donors were 10 times more likely to be seroreactive than women donors in the rest of Canada (p<.001). Quebec female AIDS cases (n=43) compared with affected women in the rest of Canada (n=28) were less likely to have been infected through blood transfusion: 2.3% versus 50% (p<.001) and more likely to have originated from a high prevalence country 55.8% versus 0%. Of the 26 pediatric AIDS cases in Canada, 21 (81%) are from Quebec. In 27 families studied there were 31 HIV infected children. 22 (81%) of the mothers were of Haitian origin, 4 were Caucasian and 1 was Asian. Conclusion. These data illustrate the determinants of the concentration of pediatric HIV infection in Quebec and its relationship to maternal country of origin. 432 [Page 433](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/431) 7221 HIV SEROPREVALENCE IN NEWBORN INFANTS IN NEW YORK STATE Lloyd F Novick, D Berns, R Stricof, R Stevens New York State Department of Health, Albany, New York Objective. Determine the prevalence of HIV infection in women at time of childbirth throughout New York State. Methods. Mandatory blood specimens for detecting horeditary disorders obtained on all newborn infants are examined in standard HIV ELISA and Western Blot protocols Information including age of mother, race and zip code is placed in an unlinked data base. No identifying information such as names are abstracted. Results. As of 1/12/88, 25,804 specimens have been analyzed for HIV serologic status. The overall HIV seroprevalence rate was 0.83 percent (215 positive), with 0.19 percent upstate and 1.64 percent in New York City. Highest rates were found in the Bronx (2.29%), Brooklyn (1.56%) and Manhattan (1.98%). Rates of HIV positivity increased from 0.35 percent in the group 19 years and under to 1.81 percent in the group 40-49 years of age. Three-fifths of the seropositive newborns were detected in the highest quartile of zip codes with hospital opioid discharges. By 6/1/88, results will be available on approximately 130,000 newborns. Conclusion. Substantial rates of infection were found in women at time of childbirth in areas of New York City where IV drug abuse is predominant. The number of HIV positive newborn infants will be approximately 2,241 on an annual basis. Utilizing 40 percent as the proportion infected, an estimated 900 HIV infected children will be born in New York State this year. This figure far exceeds the number of previously reported or projected cases for 1988. 7222 IMMUNOLOGIC FOLLOW UP OF 43 CHILDREN OF HIV+ MOTHER PREDICTION OF HIV INFECTION. C. Seidel-Farnarier1, S. Kaplanskil, C. Pallix2, P. - FRANCE. Objective. A longitudinal immunologic study was conducted to evidence possible presymptomatic cellular immunodeficiency. Methods. Fourty three children aged 3 weeks to 3 years were investigated every three months. Immunologic tests included:HIV antigen and antibody detection, immunoglobulin and tetanus toxoid antibody level determination, absolute lymphocyte T subset count and lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogens and antigens. In some cases cerebrospinal fluid was studied. Results. 1) Children above 12 months often retained HIV maternal antibodies. 2) CD4+ cell number was always above 2000/mm except for children with severe AIDS. 3) The clinical status and lymphocyte proliferative responses were strongly correlated. Interestingly in some cases immunologic status was altered before clinical status and confirmation of HIV infection. Conclusion. This follow up appears of interest for children with proven infection and for those for whom HIV infection can not be confirmed. Notes: 7223 Opportunistic infection in a HIV-positive infant with normal cellular immunity in vitro. H.J. Scherpbierl, P.T.A. Schellekens2, M. Roos2, R.S. Weeningl- 1. Dept. Pediatrics, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, 2. Lab. for experimental and clinical immunology and Central Lab. Bloodtransfusion Service, Amsterdam The Netherlands. An 8 month old infant, born to a HIV-antibody (ab) positive, i.v. drug-abusing, asymptomatic mother was prospectively followed from birth. The child was HIV-ab positive and from the fourth month on HIV-antigen (P24, Abbott) was detected. The child developed well until the age of 6 months. At 6 months she developed a Pneumocystic carinii pneumonia, proven by open lungbiopsy, treated with high dosis trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol and corticosteroids. Immunoglobulins showed during the first 8 months of life no gross abnormalities. At the time of the opportunistic infection, absolute numbers of lymphocytes in the periferal blood were normal (4.7-2.1 x 10 /1). CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.77. Total CD4 declined from 2.7-0.9 x 109/1. Normal lymphocyte proliferation after with Phytohaemagglutinin and Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) was repeatedley found. Mixed lymphocyte culture showed normal responder capacity. Cell mediated lympholysis was normal as well as the natural killer cell activity against K 562 cells. In conclusion: The observation proves that opportunistic infection with Pneumocystis carinii can occur despite normal cellulair immunity in vitro. 7224 HIV ANTIBODY RESPONSE BY INFANTS I.Quinti*,C.Papetti*,M.Stegagno~,E.Carapella~, F.Aiuti*. Dpts. of Allergy and Clinical Immunology* and of Pediatrics~, University \"La Sapienza\", Rome, Italy. Objective The diagnosis of HIV infection in infants is based on the demonstration of the presence of the virus. It has been suggested that a characteristic pattern in the development of HIV-specific class and subclass antibodies (IgM and IgG3 as markers of perinatal infection) may be useful to demonstrate the production of anti-HIV antibody in infants. To verify this hypothesis we studied class and subclass specific antibodies in serial samples from 20 mother-child pairs, followed for periods ranging from 6 to 36 months, at regular intervals. Methods To measure HIV-antibodies, monoclonal antibodies to human IgM and IgG suclasses were used in ELISA and WB techniques. Results We observed: l)a wide distribution of HIV-antibodies among different subclasses in infected mothers and their offspring: the vast majority of sera show more than one isotype (mainly IgGl and IgG3); 2)the pattern of HIV specific IgM and IgG subclasses could non allow to distinguish between infants who became seronegative and infants persistently seropositive during the follow-up; 3)no differences in the behaviour of specific antibodies directed against different group of viral antigens between mother and child. Conclusions Serological methods, at present, are not useful to diagnose an HIV infection in infants.

The actual follow up is presently analyzed. 7226 ANALYSIS OF HIV INFECTION IN A CHILD TRANSSPLANTED FOR B-THALASSEMIA. Bagnarelli P.,Pauri 1 G.,Varaldo P.E. (1) and University of Trieste (3), Division of Hematology of Muraglia,Hospital of Pesaro (2). Italy. Objectives:Follow up study after bone marrow transplant (BMT) of a 5-year old,B-thalassemic,HIV-infected symptomless child. Methods:HIV-infection was monitored in sera and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) using Elisa and immuno-blotting. HIV replication was tested by p24-Ag capture assay. Peripheral blood lymphocites (PBLs) sampled BMT child's PBLs showed a chimaeric antigen pattern. The results on a second analysis, 15 days later, showed the donor pattern only. During the eight months following BMT, multiple serious viral, bacterial and mycotic infections were diagnosed, along with cerebral edema and meningo-encephalitis. Intratecal production of antibodies to HIV along with p24-Ag reactivity could be observed in all CSF samples tested. The child died from interstitial pneumonia, clinically and X-ray diagnosed. Conclusions:HIV is likely to have colonized nervous tissue in this patient after BMT, probably because of remaining HIV-infected cells, as shown by chimaeric antigen pattern. A close correlation between neurological symptoms and levels of HIV replication in sera could be observed, too. Notes: 7227 NATURAL HISTORY OF PEDIATRIC HIV INFECTION of Pediatrics,**Institute of Oncology,University of Padova,Italy Objective.To investigate the natural history of HIV infection in children born to seropositive mothers. Methods.Children born to HIV positive mothers in high risk groups were evaluated clinically,serologically and virologicallv every two months;neuromotor assessment and evaluation of mental development were also performed. Results.82 children have been studied over the last three years.Blood samples were obtained at birth or in the first six weeks of life in 71 cases.31 children,negative for viral cultures,became seronegative (at mean age 12.1 6-18 mo);using CDC criteria they were classified \"not infected\".22 children resulted \"infected\";2 of them,although their cultures were positive for reverse transcriptase activity,became seronegative.29 were\"indeterminate\". Considering only 71 children followed up from the first weeks of life,the prevalence of HIV infection in infants born to infected mothers is about 30%. 6 childedn had AIDS and 8 related conditions.Symptoms appeared in 10 out of 14 cases (75%)in the first year of life.To date the other infected children,younger than 18 mo, are clinically well and laboratory data are in the normal range.In most of the older asymptomatic children T4/T8 ratios are< 1.0 and hyper IgG is present.Neurological development is normal in all asymptomatic patients;mental evaluation is in progress. 7228 HIV DISEASE IN CHILDREN IN LUSAKA: 1 YEAR FOLLOWUP A Malek*, S Hira*, K Mukelabai*, P Perine** *University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia, **Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, U.S.A. Objective. To describe and quantify the short and long term sequelae of HIV disease in infants and children. Methods. Based on clinical suspicion of immunodeficiency 240 infants and children admitted to the paediatrics wards were screened for anti-HIV antibodies using two ELISA tests (Abbott and Welcozyme). All 53 children diagnosed with HIV disease were followed monthly for a period of one year to determine the pattern of illnesses occurring in them. Results. Of 240 children screened, 53 (22.1%) were found positive and of these, 36 (67.9%) required readmissions between 2 and 4 times during the year of followup. Their age range was 2 months to 4 years (peak between 1-2 years). The spectrum of diseases occurring (most had more than one disease at each presentation) were failure to thrive with severe malnutrition in 36 (67.9%), acute gastroenteritis in 26 (49.0%), deteriorating or reactivated pulmonary tuberculosis in 19 (35.8%); two had miliary, bronchopneumonia in 12 (22.6%), proved malaria in 11 (20.7%), in 11 severe anemia in 7(13.2%), Kaposi sarcoma in 4, measles in 2 at five and seven months of age. Seventeen (32.1%) children died during the followup. Conclusion. HIV infection in children is an aggressive infection causing high morbidity and mortality. 434 [Page 435](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/433) 7229 ASSOCIATED DISEASES IN CHILDREN WITH AIDS F. Davachi*, P. Baudoux*, K. Ndoko*, K.Ngoie*, B. N'Galy** Pediatrics, Yemo Hospital, **Ministry of Health, Kinshasa, Zaire and ~WHO, Geneva, Switzerland. Objective: To determine the incidence and type of associated diseases in children with AIDS in Kinshasa. Methods: We studied associated diseases in 115 children with AIDS, 2-12 years old. The diagnoses were confirmed by clinical and laboratory findings. Results: There were 70 (60%) cases with anemia (hemaglobin less than 10 gm%), 39 (34%) with malaria, 24 (21%) with pyoderma, 17 (15%) with urinary infection, 17 (28% of 60 cases tested) with tuberculosis, 12 (10%) with septicemia (blood culture grew salmonella in 6 cases, klebsiella in 2, E. coli in 1, staphylococcus aureus in 1, pseudomona aeroginosa in 1 and streptococcus in 1), 7 (6%) with sickle cell anemia, 6 (5%) with furunculosis, 6 (5%) with meningitis (culture grew klebsiella in 1 and no growth in 5), 2 (1.7%) with noma and one case extensive pyocyanic dermatitis. Conclusion: Excluding opportunistic infections, intestinal parasites and neurological complications, there are a significant number of complicating diseases in pediatric AIDS patients in Kinshasa which aggrevate the severity of the disease and add to its poor outcome. In our experience, these include cerebral malaria, septicemia and tuberculosis. 7230 Iw[IT VAIm C M (HIV): New Ycrk City (NYC), U.S.A.

To further delineate the HIV Embryopathy. Methods. 55 HIV infected children were assessed for features of the HIV Embryopathy. Parameters studied include growth failure, microcephaly, ocular hypertelorism, scleral color, appearance of nasal tip, philtrum, columella and vermillion border. Patients were divided according to the HIV Embryopathy scoring system into severe, moderate or not affected groups. A control group of 20 pediatric clinic patients was also studied. Results. (a) Features in patients in the non affected group do not differ from the control group; (2) Comparison of the severe and not affected group demonstrate that (a) growth failure, (b) microcephaly, (c) marked forehead, prominence, (d) \"scoped out\" nasal bridge, (e) eye prominence and (f) flattening of the columella occur statistically more often in the severe group than in the unaffected group; (3) Hypertelorism, prominent philtrum and full vermillion border does not distinguish between these two groups. Conclusion. A distinct HIV induced Embryopathy does exist. The most important features include growth failure, microcephaly, a markedly prominent forehead with a scooped out nasal bridge, eye prominence and flattening of the columella. 7232 A more effective evaluation of viral replication activity in HIV-1 positive hemophiliac children, using 2 complementary methods C. Bonfanti, Istituto Policattedra di Pediatria In order to evaluate the natural evolution and the effectiveness of therapy it is useful to test the replication activity of HIV-1 in positive patients; we therefore conducted 2 studies, comprised of double complemetary tests: 1. The first, retrospective (begun Oct.1983) included the detection, every 4 mnths., of serum Ag(DuPont/Abbott method); 2. The second, prospective (begun Jan.1986) aimed at the isolation of intralymphocytes (reverse transcriptasis markers: Temin, Baltimore and Kho method) and the identification (Ag and monoclonal Ab in culture) of the virus. The rationale for the monitoring of viral replication markers is to precociously detect their active presence, even in an asymptomatic phase, thereby permitting an immediate and effective antiviral therapy and evaluate its efficacy. In order to have sure and dependable replication marker results it is important to use parallely these 2 methods of testing. In 12 HIV + hemophiliac children a concordant positivity (Ag+/cult.+) was evident in 8 cases, 2 of which presented an initial discordancy (cult.-) not confirmed in the following test but which were probably due to independent variables. 2 other cases were discordant (Ag-/cult+) demonstrating that at the sampling time no massive replication was present. We underline the usefulness of a double comparative method, and the high incidence of replication in the hemophiliac children(10/12),HIV+ for over 4 yrs. 435 [Page 436](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/434) 7233 HIV AT RISK INFANTS: 2. CLINICAL AND LABORATORY FOLLOW UP THROUGH THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE: J.P. Johnson, P. Nair and S. Hines. University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland OBJECTIVE: To document early clinical and laboratory abnormalities in 20 children born to HIV infected women. METHODS: Twenty children born to HIV infected women were followed for 1 year. Eight had serologic evidence of HIV infection, 12 were controls. RESULTS: Clinical Abnormalities: Adenopathy was the most common clinical abnormality in the HIV infected children which was not observed in controls (p<.01). Splenomegaly was often observed but was not significantly different in the two populations (p=.17%). Skin abnormalities occurred in all of the infected and 2/3 of the non-infected. (p=0.12). Hepatomegaly was observed in 5 out of 9 of the infected children and one out of 11 of the controls (p=.018). Neurologic abnormalities, spasticity and increased tone, were observed only in the infected children (p<.01). Laboratory Observations: The most common laboratory abnormality was hypergammaglobulinemia in 6 children. Inverted T helper:suppressor ratio was found in 4 out of 8 children who later developed a deficit of T helper cells. Lymphopenia occurred only in 2 children. Infections: The two most common distinguishing infections were infectious dermatides and pneumonia. Classification: Six of the eight infected children had HIV mediated disease by one year of age, four had AIDS. CONCLUSION: The majority of HIV infected children will have distinguishable signs and symptoms of disease by 6 months of age. 7234 HIV-1 INFECTION OF THE SPINAL CORD IN CHILDREN WITH AIDS Leroy R. Sharer, L.G. Epstein, J. Michaels, B.M. Blumberg, P.C. Dowling, E.-S. Cho UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ, USA Objective: To study spinal cords from 18 children who died with HIV-1 infection and AIDS. Methods: Histologic examination using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was performed on 16 of the cords, including use of the lectin Ricinis communis agglutinin (RCA-1). In situ hybridization was perirmed on frozen sections of all 18 cords, using a S-labled DNA probe specific for HIV-1. Results: Histologically, eight of 16 cords had inflammatory cell infiltrates (with multinucleated cells in 5); five had myelin pallor in the lateral columns, with relative sparing of axis cylinders. There was a diffuse increase of microglia in the gray matter with RCA-1, which also stained multinucleated cells and many of the inflammatory cells. Two cords had vacuolar myelopathy, one with inflammatory and multinucleated cells and one without. By in situ hybridization, six of 18 cords had evidence of HIV-1 genome in spinal cord parenchyma, in both gray and white matter, usually in association with inflammatory cell infiltrates, and one further cord had signal in a leptomeningeal infiltrate. All HIV-1 positive cords had inflammatory cell lesions, on histological examination. Nerve cells and proximal nerve roots were negative for HIV-1 in all cases. Only one of the vacuolar myelopathy cases (the one with the cell infiltrates and multinucleated cells) was positive for HIV-1. Conclusion: HIV-1 commonly infects the spinal cord in children who die of AIDS, and its presence is usually unassociated with changes of vacuolar myelopathy. Notes: 7235 DETECTION OF HIV IN THE FETUS: A STUDY OF SIX CASES J F Peutherer*, S Rebus*, D Aw*, I Smith***, F D Johnstone** *Bacteriology Department, ***Obstetrics and Gynecology, Edinburgh University, **Pathology Department, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh Objective. To determine if HIV can be detected in fetal tissues. Methods. The pregnancies were terminated at 15, 23, 18, 21, 14 and 16 weeks gestation. The mothers were all positive for antibody to HIV and were drug abusers (5) or the partner of a drug abuser. Organs were removed by dissection and samples (I) fixed for histology, (2) stored at -60~C, (3) teased out and set up in culture in RPMI (10% fetal calf serum) supplemented with IL2 and PHA. Culture supernates were harvested at weekly intervals and tested for HIV p24 antigen. Culture supernates and tissues were also examined by hybridisation with a biotinylated, nick translated cDNA probe, clone BHO1 which contains bases 221-9150 of HIV. Results. Tissues from two of the six fetuses tested were shown to contain HIV. In the first case, terminated at 21 weeks, virus was demonstrated in thymus, spleen, liver, brain, and placenta. In the second case, terminated at 18 weeks, virus was demonstrated in thymus, spleen, liver, brain, peripheral blood lymphocytes and placenta. The latter mother was on Zidovudine treatment at the time of termination. Conclusion. HIV is present in many tissues of infected fetuses. It could be detected in two of six tested. 7236 IN VITRO HIV ANTIBODY SYNTHESIS: EARLY MARKER OF INFECTION IN CHILDREN AT RISK FOR AIDS A Amadori*, A DeRossi*, C Giaquinto**, L Chieco-Bianchi* of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Padova, ITALY. Objective. To improve early diagnosis of HIV infection, we studied anti-HIV antibody (HIV-Ab) synthesis in lymphocyte cultures from 37 children at risk for AIDS. Methods. Children were clinically evaluated and tested for HIV-Ab and p24 in serum and for virus isolation. According to CDC criteria, they were classified as uninfected, infected and indeterminate. HIV-Ab synthesis was evaluated by Western blot assay in culture SN. Results are summarized in the Table Conclusions. In vitro synthesis of HIV-Ab proved a more sensitive index of HIV infection than virus isolation or p24 antigen detection. Moreover, the assay showed that HIV-Ab in serum of 4 indeterminate children was partly due to autochtonous synthesis and not only to transplacental passage, allowing to re-classify these children as infected. This approach may constitute a valid support to currently used clinical and laboratory criteria in early diagnosis of HIV infection in children at risk for AIDS. 436 [Page 437](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/435) 7237 USE OF A WHOLE BLOOD LYMPHOPROLIFERATION ASSAY AND AN ANTI-TETANUS-TOXOID SPECIFIC ELISA IN THE FOLLOW UP OF HIV-SEROPOSITIVE NEWBORNS Martin.A. Mielke*, I. Grosch-Wdrner#, B. Universitit Berlin, Berlin Prospective studies on newborns of HIV-seropositive women in the USA and Europe suggest that materno-fetal transmission of the virus occurs in 50% of cases. On the individual level, however, the diagnosis of HIV-infection in children under two years of age may be difficult. Lymphopenia and reduced amounts of CD4+ T lymphocytes occur only in the very late stages of AIDS in children. Even the search for HIV antigen p24 in blood samples is not as useful as expected for an early diagnosis of virus infection. We therefore use tests of irmune function in the follow up of HIV-seropositive newborns in order to detect HIV-induced imnune dysfunctions as early as possible. In our study 53 children are enrolled. 38 out of the 53 seropositive mothers used or use i.v. drugs. From the 33 children under 2 years of age 27 are asymptomatic. Methods. Lymphocyte blast transformation in response to pokeweed mitogen and tetanus toxoid was tested in a whole blood lynphoproliferation assay in order to sunmarize many of the ascribed HIV-associated immune response diminishing factors in one assay. The humoral response to TT ( tetanus toxoid ) after vaccination was determined in serum by an ELISA. The children were seen in 3 months intervals. Virological as well as hematological examinations were done in parallel. Results. It could be shown, that children differ in the capacity of their lymphocytes to proliferate in response to PWM or TT or to secrete specific antibodies after vaccination even when other inmunologic eveluations such as CD4+ T lynphocyte counts or Ig levels show no abnormalities. It is assumed, that low responses to PWM or TT as measured by these tests are indicators of HIV-infection in children and can contribute to the diagnosis. ( This study is supported by the BMJFFG and BMA ) 7238 EARLY MANIFESTATIONS OF NEUROLOGIC INVOLVEMENT IN INFANTS WITH CONGENITAL HIV Thomas Koch*, P Weintrub*, C Rumsey*, M Cowan* *Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA USA Objective. To define early HIV-specific neurologic abnormalities in infants with congenital HIV. Methods. As part of a prospective study on congenital HIV, we evaluated the neurologic status of 30 infants born to IV drug-abusing mothers utilizing serial neurologic exams (NE), EEG, EMG, MRI/CT brain scans and brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER). Infants were placed into 3 study groups: CONT (infants of uninfected mothers), NEG (uninfected but born to infected mothers), POS (HIV infected infants). Groups were matched for maternal age and drug use. Results. Table displays # abnormal/total. For serial studies most recent results reported. NE BAER EEG MRI/CT EMG BAER abnormalities consisted of bilateral elevated hearing thresholds in infants with normal otoscopic exams who were CMV negative. Conclusion. Infants with congenital HIV are at risk for early neurologic involvement. EEG and EMG do not appear to be early predictors of disease. While NE may demonstrate early abnormalities, MRI/CT changes appear later. Early BAER abnormalities (3 mos) indicate that infants with congenital HIV are at risk for a sensorineural hearing loss, and this may herald signs of future neurologic involvement. Notes: 7239 Sensory evoked potential (SEP) correlation of HIV related neurologic disease in children: Ram Kairam, R. Emerson, M. Bamji*, J. Kline and L. Cooper. Columbia University, HIV Center for Clinical & Behavioral Sciences at the Psychiatric Institute, and NY Medical College*. NY. U.S.A. HIV Infection in children is associated with microcephaly, corticospinal tract signs and a diffuse enceDhalopathy. At autopsy, the bulk and the early locus of the injury appears to be in the thalamus and basal ganglia and adjacent white matter. Rottenberg et al (1987 Ann Neurol) described the functional pathology of HIV encephalopathy in which subcortical gray structures are primarily affected, demonstrating hypermetabolism early in the disease, whereas the cortex was affected only as the disease progresses. We utilized median nerve SEP to study the functional integrity of the somato sensory pathway in 8 children, with symptomic HIV infection, only some of whom had frank neurologic symptoms. In 7 of 8 children there was either absence or marked attenuation of the NI8 potential, a post synaptic signal generated in subcortical gray structures, including rostral brainstem and thalamus. In three cases cortical N20 response was attenuated. In all cases central conduction time was normal. These findings are coherent with the data of Rottenberg et al. SEP may offer an objective measure of the integrity of the structurs that are most likely to be affected and may help describe natural history of neurologic disease and monitor effects of intervention. 7240 GANGLIONEURITIS IN CHILDREN WITH AIDS V Anderson *, MA Greco**, *NYS Institute for Basic Research, S.I., NY, **NYU Medical Center, NY, USA Objective: To define ganglioneurits (GN) in children with AIDS. Methods: Sections and reports from 41 patients were reviewed. Results: GN was seen in 9 children. In 2 the dorsal root ganglia exhibited degeneration of neurons with loss'of ganglion cells associated with mononuclear cell infiltrates. In 1 patient cytomegalovirus inclusions (CMV) were observed in the adjacent peripheral nerves. GN with CMV inclusions in ganglion cells were seen in the resected segment of colon in a patient with chronic ulcers. In 5 patients non-specific GN was seen in the Meissner and Auerbach plexuses. Satellitosis similar to that seen in the brain of patients with AIDS was noted. Conclusion: GN involves peripheral and autonomic nervous systems. In some cases CMV was present, in others the etiology of the lesions remained uncertain. GN may correlate with chronic pain present in some AIDS patients. 437 [Page 438](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/436) 7241 7241 HIV WITHIN THE BRAINS OF CHILDREN WITH AIDS CA Wiley*, AL Belman**, D Dickson**, A Rubinstein**, J Nelson*** *University of California San Diego, **Albert Einstein College of Medicine, ***Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation Significance: Central nervous system dysfunction has been documented clinically in a high percentage of children with AIDS. In some, a neurologic deterioration followed a progressive course (24/68 with loss of cognitive skills) while in others there was a plateau course (18/68 with no further development of cognitive skills). Objective: Determine the pathogenesis of nervous system dysfunction in these two clinically different groups. Methods and Results: In only a fraction of the children (15%), was a conventional pathogen or lymphoma the primary cause of neurologic dysfunction. The remainder showed; cerebral atrophy, calcific vasculopathy, variable degrees of inflammation, and gliosis of deep white and gray matter. Probing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) showed virus within effected brain tissues of children undergoing a progressive neurologic course while virus was not detected in those children with a plateau neurologic course. Conclusion: These findings suggest that in children with AIDS, the progressive neurologic deterioration is due to continued presence of HIV within deep white and gray matter, while the plateau neurologic course is due to HIV induced damage followed by either clearance of the virus or repression below detectable limits. 7242 THE PATHOLOGY OF PEDIATRIC AIDS A STUDY OF 52 CASES Vijay Joshi*, M De Vinatea**, A Macher**, E Lopez***, C Climent***, G Lasala*** *Children' s Hospital of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey **Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, D.C. ***Puerto Rico Medical Center, San Juan, Puerto Rico Objective. To describe the pathology of AIDS in children. Methods. We studied the histopathology of 52 children with AIDS. Results. The findings included pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia and lynphoid interstitial esophageal (4), fibrosis, medial and calcification, destruction of elastic fibers and elastic lamina with calcification of media, and variable degrees of luminal occlusion of involved vessels was seen in 8 patients. An aneurysm of the right coronary artery was in 1 patient. A cardiamyopathy A nephropathy with mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis and deposition of irmune complexes was in 3 patients. Conclusion. The mrost commrron finding was PLH/LIP which occurred in 42% of the cases. A significant number of patients also had arteriopathies, cardicmyopathies, and nephropathies. Notes: 7243 THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SPLENIC PATHOLOGY IN CHILDREN WITH AIDS V Anderson *, MA Greco**, V Mahnovski***, E Kahn****, S Cho* ****, R Morecki***** *NYS Institute for Basic Research, S.I., NY, **NYU Medical Center, NY, ***University of Southern California, LA, ****North Shore Univ Hosp, Manhasset, NY, *****Albert Einstein College of Medicine, NY USA Objective: To study the histopathology of the spleen in children with AIDS (CWA). Methods: Sections of spleen and clinical summaries from 25 CWA were reviewed. Results: The architecture of the white pulp was destroyed. The T cell zones and germinal centers were absent in all cases. Depleted white pulp was seen in 10 patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Expanded white pulp with histiocytes and plasma cells were noted in patients with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (5) and with PCP (2). Cord hyperplasia, erythrophagocytosis and hemosiderin was seen in patients with thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. Other findings included acute splenitis (3), M. Avium intracellulare (3), M. tuberculosis (2), candida (1), paramyxoviral giant cells (I), infarction (2), Gamma-Gandy bodies (2), and lymphoma (1). Terminal episodes of gram negative sepsis (13), and S. aureus (2) and pneumococcal sepsis (2) occurred. Conclusion: The high incidence of gram negative and pneumococcal sepsis suggests functional asplenia in CWA. 7244 LYMPHOID INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONITIS IN THE CLINICAL SETTING OF HIV DISEASE. D. Druckman. J Casson. State Univ. of New York, Health Sciences Center at Brooklyn and The Kings County Hospital Center, Brooklyn, New York. OBJECTIVES: To describe the experience of a large metropolitan medical center in the diagnosis of Lymphoid Interstitial Pneumonitis (LIP) in patients with clinical features of HIV disease. METHODS: For the years 1984-1988 all histologic diagnoses of Interstitial Pneumonia (IP), Chronic Interstitial pneumonia (CIP) or LIP were reviewed using the SNOMED coding system for standardized criteria (Systematized coding of Medicine). Hospital charts were reviewed for clinical presentation, outcome and recovery of infectious pathogens. RESULTS: 48 cases were found in patients without a respiratory pathogen on biopsy, of these, 13 fulfilled the histologic criteria of LIP. All patients had recognized risk factors and clinical presentations consistent with HIV disease (except one who was confirmed HIV seronegative). Of the remaining 12, 7 were black male adults, 4 were black children. Features of clinical presentation consistently showed dyspnea, cough and hypoxia. Productive cough and blood tinged sputa were variably present. All adult patients had multiple negative initial studies for pulmonary AFB. 5 of 7 adults had a history of either Tb exposure or treatment and 3 of 7 had tuberculosis eventually recovered by culture (1 MAI, 2 MTb). One adult death was recorded, remaining adults were lost to follow-up CONCLUSIONS: LIP in adult patients was seen in greater frequency in adults than previously recognized and may have close association to tuberculous disease. 438 [Page 439](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/437) 7245 PULMONARY FINDINGS IN CHILDREN WITH THE ACQUIRED SYNDROME (AIDS) Adams J.A., Birriel J.A., Vernon D., Mavunda K., McKey, R.M. Department of Pediatrics and Pathology, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, U.S.A. A retrospective study was performed to describe the pulmonary pathology in children with AIDS or AIDS related complex (A.R.C.). A total of 55 cases were studied, of these 29 (53%) were alive at the completion of the study period, and 26 (47%) had died. Of the 26 deaths, 23 autopsies were available for review, in 21 (91%) the primary cause was pulmonary in nature. The age of presentation for their pulmonary disease was 3-6 mo. 31%, 7-9 mo. 18.5%, 10-12 mo. 15%, 13-18 mo. 16%. The most frequent diagnosis at the onset of their respiratory disease was lobar pneumonia (55%) followed by multilobar and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (P.C.P.). The pulmonary autopsy findings in 21 cases of whom had end-stage respiratory failure (E.S.R.F.) revealed that, 16 or the 21 cases (76%)had multiple etiological agents together as a cause of E.S.R.F., which included: P.C.P., L.I.P., cytomegalovirus, candida species and gram negative bacterias. Twelve of the 21 cases (57%) had gram negative pneumonia alone or in combination with other pathogens or L.I.P. We conclude that: 1) Multiple pathogens play an important role in the E.S.R.F. in children with AIDS. 2) Gram negative pneumonia account for over half of the pulmonary histologic diagnosis in these children. Early antibiotic coverage should include broad spectrum gram-coverage. 3) The use of systematic steroids for treatment of L.I.P. in E.S.R.F. would seem contraindicated in light of mixed pulmonary pathogens. 7246 SILENT HIV INFECTION PERIODS IN INFANTS. Dept. Pediatria. Hospital General Gregorio Maraion. Madrid.SPN. HIV infection in pediatric age is diagnosed by demonstrating serum specific IgM antibodies anti-HIV or HIV antigens. Actually these type of tests are not usual in most of laboratories. Infants seropositive for HIV antibodies (Ab) in IgG ELISA and Western blot (WB) assays have to be tested to inclusive 15th. month of age in order to differ the maternal Ab passively transmitted with the infant's own Ab. Before that age negative seroconversion is considered to correspond to an infant non infected. We reported 5 white infants, 3 males and 2 females, born to drug-abuser HIV-seropositive mothers. All had HIV Ab in cord or neonatal specimens. Infants were examined and monitored for development and blood was tested for HIV Ab (ELISA & IFI) at 3 month intervals. All HIV test were positive until 12 months of age when all sera tested were negative first time. Western blot assay was performed in new serum samples and it was negative too. Three infants were again HIV seropositive (ELISA & WEB) 3 months later, and the other two 6 months later. All infants had dysmorphic features characteristic of HIV associated embryopathy. Three infants had hypergammaglobulinemia and the other 2 hypogammaglobulinemia. All of them showed a progressive drop in T4/T8 ratio and are included in group P2 of the CDC clinical classification. This seronegative period may be explained by the immunoglobulin alterations with age in the newborn and in the infant. Results show that HIV Ab testing may be low sensitive for HIV infection in infants. Clinical follow up determine that HIV IgG Ab is not an accurate marker of HIV infection in some infants so follow up must continue for more time in negative seroconversion. Notes: 7247 IMMUNOLOGICAL FEATURES OF AIDS IN *Immunology and **Pediatric hospital.R.S.Valle Hebr6n. Barcelona.Spain. Perinatal HIV infection affects an immature immune system and destroys its capacity to respond to new antigens. Furthermore neonates have no memory cells and few preformed antibodies to common antigens.Consequently bacterial infections are the main pathogens in the evolution of the disease in these infants. Of the 7 cases diagnosed in our Hospital,2 presented with hypogammaglobulinemia and a third developed hypogammaglobulinemia at 9 m.of age and died at 11 m.Four of the 7 have already died,3 from septic conditions (Pneumococus and Haemophilus). We comment on the humoral immune response studies of 12 symptomatic HIV+ infants,the Gamamglobulin protocol used and the result of 3 infant cases treated with Retrovir. Gammaglobulin therapy must be initiated very early in the evolution of the disease,to prevent persistent antigenic stimulation and viral replication.Prophilactic antibiotics,as used in some forms of primary immunodeficient patients,could be also useful in preventing bacterial infections and thus improve the currently poor prognosis in these cases. S TREATMENT OF CHILDREN BORN TO HIV ANTIBODY POSITIVE A7 8 MOTHERS WITH INTRAVENOUS IMMUNOGLOBULIN (IV IgG) R A Hague*, P E Williams*, J Mok**, F D Hargreaves**, R P Brettle**, P L Yap*, et al***. *Edinburgh and South East Scotland Blood Transfusion Service, **City Hospital, ***Sick Childrens Hospital, Edinburgh; Inverclyde Royal Hospital, Greenock, Newcastle General Hospital. Objective: To evaluate in 43 children born to HIV antibody positive mothers and one further child infected by transfusion at 4 months of age, the incidence of infections suggestive of antibody deficiency, the benefit of IV IgG therapy and the immunological and virological effect of this therapy. Methods: Clinical review at 1-3 month intervals and laboratory tests undertaken on blood samples. Results: Over a 3 year period, 7 children had recurrent upper and lowr respiratory tract infections or otitis media and persistent lymphadenopathy. The all benefitted from IV IgG therapy (200 mg/kg/ 3 weeks) in terms of rates of infection, diarrhoea, weight gain and hospitalisation. Although serum immunoglobulin levels and other immunological parameters were not changed significantly by IV IgG, alterations were seen in some parameters including virology and it was possible to culture HIV from a number of infants. Conclusions: The main benefit of IV IgG therapy is probably to reduce the overall number of bacterial infections and the degree of lymphocyte activation, thus possibly delaying the progression from the early asymptomatic state to AIDS. 439 [Page 440](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/438) 7249 HIV PROTEINS ASSOCIATED WITH CIRCULATING IMMUNE COMPLEXES (CIC) IN HIVINFECTED CHILDREN TREATED WITH IVIG Theresa Calvelli*, M Ellaurie*, A Rubinstein* *Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY Objective. To determine the presence of HIV proteins (p17 and p24) associated with CIC in HIVinfected children treated with intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG). Methods. Serum from IVIG treated patients with demonstrable B cell dysfunction and recurrent bacterial infections was used. CIC were isolated by PEG precipitation and solubilized. HIV proteins were detected on nitrocellulose by reaction with monoclonal anti-pl7 and -p24. Positive reaction was graded from 1+ to 4+. Results. Elevated CIC were detected in 90% of patients studied. HIV p24 was found in the CIC of 46% of these patients and p17 in the CIC of 71%. The HIV protein concentration in CIC of most of the IVIG-treated children decreased or remained low (negative to e2+). These children had a stable clinical course for up to 4~ years of treatment. In contrast IVIG treated children whose HIV antigens in CIC remained high or increased had a poor outcome. Most deteriorated clinically or died within one year of appearance of high concentrations of HIV protein in association with their CIC. Conclusion. In HIV infected children treated with IVIG, persistently high or increasing concentration of p17 and/or p24 associated with CIC is a predictor for disease progression. 7250 INTRAVENOUS IMMUNOGLOBULINS (IVIG) Immunology. University 'La Sapienza', Rome, Italy. Objective The aim of this study is the control of infections and the delaying of the clinical course in ARC patients by monthly infusions of IVIG. Methods We treated 15 ARC patients with IVIG at a dosage of 200 mg/kg (Sandoglobulin) at 30 days interval. All patients were checked for clinical status (body weight, night sweats, diarrhoea, fever and asthenia). Haemoglobin, -platelets, white blood proteins, LDH, GOT, GPT, V-Z, tetanus, haemophilus, pneumococcus titres were evaluated at periodical intervals (before, 4 hrs and 7 days after each infusion). Results Preliminary results after 6 months of treatment showed no significant decrease of infectious episodes in treated patients when compared with the control group. General symptomatology improved in treated group and none of ARC patients developed AIDS. Immunological parameters (CD4+ cells, skin tests) showed no significant statistical variations. No side effects were observed. Conclusions IVIG treatment as initial and supportive therapy in ARC patients may be a useful approach to prevent infectious complications during HIV-1 infection. Notes: 7251 I.V. GAMMAGLOBULIN TREATMENT OF SYMPTOMATIC number und severity of secondary infections in patients with AIDS und ARC increase with impaired cellular and humoral immune functions. The influence of regular prophylactic application of intravenous qammaqlobulin preparations (ivIg) was studied. Methods: 40 patients (pts), randomized and stratified into 4 groups (GR1 7 pts WR 13 pts WR 5-6) have been observed for an average time of 13,8 months. Pts of GR1 and 2 were treated with ivIg 200 mg/kg bw/14 days. Incidence and course of opportunistic infections (0.I.), Kaposi's sarcoma, neurologic disorder, changes of WR stage, \"B-symptoms\" and mortality were evaluated. Results: Differences in mortality from 0.I. (p 0.025) were seen between GR2 (3/13 pts) (ivIg) and 4 (9/13 pts). in GR2 pts), in GR3 (4/1 pts) and in GR4 (38/13 pts). The spectrum of bacterial and protozoic agents were found to be comparable in GR2 and 4. Virus infections occured more frequent in GR4 (4 CMV, 1 multifocal leucenzephalopathy) than inGR2 (1 CMV). Number of hospital days was higher in the untreated GR4. A change of WR stage from 5 to 6 occured twice as often in GR4 as in GR2 (ivIq). All other parameters did not change significantly. Conclusion: The mortality from 0.I. in HIV-1 infected patients is significantly lowered by the regular prophylactic application of ivIq. 7252 Reversible Neuropsychological Deficits: The effect of AZT therapy in a pediatric AIDS population. Howard Moss, Pim Brouwers P, Wolters, J. Eddy, M. Maha*, S. Lehrman*, F. Balls, D. Poplack, P. Pizzo. Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute and Burroughs Welcome*, USA. Sixteen children with AIDS, infected through transfusion, were treated at the Pediatrics Branch, NCI on a continuous infusion AZT protocol. One of the aims of this protocol was to evaluate whether AZT could be beneficial in the remediation of the encephalopathy demonstrated by neuropsychological deficits in these children. A baseline evaluation was obtained prior to AZT administration with an age appropriate battery of standardized neuropsychological tests (Mean age at baseline was 6.4 years). For a number of these patients, fortuitously, similar data was also available from assessments prior to HIV infection or very shortly therafter. Systematic follow-up evaluations are being administered at 3 month intervals from baseline. Preliminary analysis indicates: 1) A significant decline in intelligence (IQ) at baseline compared to pre-disease onset evaluations. 2) A significant improvement in IQ, particularly in Performance IQ, between baseline and after 6 months of AZT therapy. 3) For most of the patients for whom pre-infection data was available the IQ scores have returned to premorbid levels. These results indicate the efficacy of AZT, in the pediatric population, in reversing the neuropsychological deficits. In cases in which premorbid data were available, remarkably, IQ levels obtained after AZT treatment were similar to those obtained a number of years before the diagnosis of AIDS. In order to obtain the same IQ at an older age, children with AIDS must have been acquiring new skills and abilities at a rate commensurate with their healthy peers at a time that their functioning may have been compromised by their illness. This suggests that children with IIV infection through transfusion continue to develop intellectually but may be unable to express their knowledge and skills appropriately during the time that they are not on AZT. 440 [Page 441](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/439) 7253 NUTRITIONAL AND METABOLIC EFFECTS OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTION IN CHILDREN WITH HEMOPHILIA. W. Abe Andes, R.P. Warrier, S. Kuvibidila*, B. Suskind*. Louisiana Comprehensive Hemophilia Care Center (HCC), *Louisiana State University Medical Center and Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA. Objective. To determine the nutritional status of hemophiliac children. Methods. 106 children ranging in age from 1-18 years with hemophilia A or B were evaluated using standard anthropometric measures to detect altered nutritional status. Results. Thirty-one percent were considered malnourished by at least one measure. Fourteen/106 (14%) were below the fifth percentile for height or weight. Height/age and height/weight measures indicated 26% and 12% were malnourished respectively. Sixty-six patients whose HIV antibody status was known, were similarly evaluated. Twenty-six (39.4%) of the 106 children were HIV (+) and 40 (60.6%) HIV (-). Sixteen/26 (61.5%) of the HIV (+) patients and 8/40 (20%) of the HIV (-) were in the malnourished group. The association between malnutrition and a (+) HIV antibody appears to be significant (p=0.0006). Prealbumin, considered a sensitive indicator of malnutrition, was abnormal in 14/16 HIV (+) and 11/12 HIV (-) children with abnormal anthropometric features. Conclusion. Anthropometric and biochemical evidence of altered nutritional status in children with hemophilia and HIV may further affect their immunologic balance. Detection of specific metabolic or vitamin deficiencies may help in attempts at immunologic augmentation. 7254 NATURAL HISTORY OF HIV INFECTION IN 7 CHILDREN Keith Krasinski, W Borkowsky New York University Medical Center-Bellevue Hospital Center, New York Objective. To understand how the clinical manifestations of HIV infection in children correlate with survival in order to establish prognosis and design treatment trials. Methods. Medical records were reviewed for demographic and clinical (CDC classification) data that may correlate with outcome. HIV infection was documented by antibody, antigen and/or virus detection. Survival data is based on life table analysis. Results. There were 94 children infected or possibly infected with HIV as a result of: maternal sources 89, transfusion 10, drug use or sexual transmission 2, sexual abuse 2, and unknown 1. The age of patients at present, or at the time of death, is mean (X) = 8.3Y (median 2; range 0.1-17.7)._The overall mortality is 33/94 (35%). Children have survived: X = 4.9Y (median = 5, range 0.25 -10) since HIV infection occurred; and X = 2.9Y (median 2.3, range 0.02-6) since presentation with clinical illness. There are no deaths among 4 children with PO HIV status (Y age 0.5Y) or 13 P1 (X age 0.5Y). There were 9 deaths among 37 P2A children who survived X = 3.7Y from presentation,and 20 deaths among 22 who ultimately proved to have P2D1; X survival = 0.6Y (median = 0.05, range I day-3Y) after diagnosis and X = 0.91Y (median = 0.3, range ld-4.3Y) from presentation to P2DI. Survival from presentation ranged from X = 3Y for 10 patients with P2F disease, to 2.3Y for 1 patient with P2D2 disease, 1.3Y for 2 patients with P2C, and 0.3Y for 2 with P2B disease. Conclusion. Treatment of P2DI will demonstrate short-term benefit with the least impact on survival. Treatment of other symptomatic or asymptomatic infection will require large numbers of patients observed over long periods of time to demonstrate efficacy. Notes: 7255 NEWBORNS OF HIV-POSITIVE natural course of HIV-infections in pre-/ perinatally infected children is well-known from retrospective studies. Exact prevalence rates of HIV infections and of symptomatic HIV infection in newborns of HIV antibody-positive mothers, however, have not yet been determinated. We know even less of early clinical and immunological symptoms indicating the manifestation of HIV infection. Methods. Since July 1985, all newborns of HIV antibodypositive mothers of Berlin (West) have been followed prospectively and longitudinally in 3-monthly intervals according to defined clinical, immunological and virological criteria. Results. Up to the present date, 49 newborns have been included into the follow-up study. The vertical transmission rate appears to be around 40 %. Early immunological symptoms of HIV infection proved to be the inability of the lymphocytes to react in vitro to PWM-mitogen stimulation and to form specific antibodies following exposure to antigens. Early clinical signs of HIV infection are pneumonia, retardation of the development, therapyresistant thrush and parotitis. (This study is supported by the BMJFFG and BMA) 7256 HIV PRENATAL EXPOSURE: EFFECT ON INFANT MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY Pratibha Datta*, J Embree**, J Muriithi*, M ****Univ Washington. Objective: To assess and compare morbidity and mortality in infants of HIV seropositive (cases) and seronegative (controls) mothers, a prospective study was conducted in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: Eighty-seven cases and 113 controls were followed for means of 7 and 9 (range 1 to 24) months respectively and assessed at 1 to 3 month intervals for HIV related disease. Mean birth weights (3102 vs 3241 gms) and gestational age (40.5 vs 39.5 wks) were similar. Results: Pneumonia occurred in 11 (13%) of cases and 13 (12%) of controls; measles in 4 cases and 2 controls; and otitis media in 4 cases and 5 controls. Failure to thrive (FTT) developed in 17 (19%) cases compared with 12 (12%) controls (p=0.07). FTT occurred in cases earlier and tended to preceed these infants' deaths. Death occurred in 4 cases (due to pneumonia, measles, sepsis and gastroenteritis) and in 3 controls (due to malaria in 2 and pneumonia). Infants of mothers with more advanced HIV disease tended to have poorer clinical outcomes. Three (50%) infants of 6 mothers with symptomatic HIV disease had FTT or died compared with 14 (17%) infants of 81 mothers with CDC class II or III disease (p-0.08). Conclusion: Infants exposed to HIV infection in utero tended to have increased morbidity and mortality. Poor outcome was associated with more advanced maternal HIV disease. 441 [Page 442](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/440) 7257 PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF VIROLOGIC PARAMETERS FOR INFANTS BORN TO HIV-SEROPOSITIVE WOMEN Martha Rogers*, Montefiore Medical Center HIV Perinatal Tramsmission Study Group, New York City Collaborative Study Group for Maternal Transmission of HIV. *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA, Objective. To correlate virologic parameters with clinical outcome of infants born to anti-HIV (+) women. Methods. Pregnant women and their infants are followed prospectively. Serum samples are tested for anti-HIV (HIV-ab) by EIA and Western blot and antigen (HIV-ag) by capture assay; lymphocytes are cultured for HIV and tested for integrated viral genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results To date, 40 infants of HIV (+) women have been followed for > 6 months: 7 with AIDS, 9 ill with nonspecific findings (ill-NS), and 24 well. All were HIV-ab (+) and HIV-ag (-) at birth. HIV-ab/ag results at last follow up and culture at 6 mos. were: HIV-ab HIV-ag Culture PCR + - IND + - + - ND + - ND AIDS (N= 7) 6 0 1 3 4 6 1 0 6 0 1 Ill-NS (N= 9) 0 6 3 0 9 2 4 3 4 1 4 Well (N=24) 3* 16 5 0 24 0 10 14 4 4 16 IND=indeterminate. ND=not done. *Infants < 12 mos. 5/5 HIV-ab (-) infants born to HIV-ab (-) mothers were PCR and culture (-). Conclusions. These preliminary data indicate that nearly all infants with AIDS are HIV-ab (+) and have virologic evidence of infection. Infants with non-specific findings tend to be HIV-ab (-) but 5/6 tested were either culture or PCR (+). The significance of (+) PCR in well, HIV-ab (-/IND) infants requires further study which is underway. 7258 LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF INFANTS BORN TO WOMEN AT RISK FOR AIDS. Elaine J. Abrams, The New York City Collaborative Group for the Study of Maternal Transmission of HIV; New York City (NYC), U.S.A. Objective: This study aims to determine the rate of HIV transmission from an infected mother to her child and to examine the variables for early identification of HIV infection in children. Methods: Clinical, serologic, historical data are collected prospectively on a cohort of high risk women and their children during pregnancy and for 5 years thereafter. Results: Data are compared for 48 children born HIV antibody negative (Ab-) and 27 born Ab positive (+) followed for 6 mo or until death. 12 Ab+ babies seroreverted(SR) to Ab- between 9-18 mos; 2 died of unknown causes. 8 Ab+ babies meet CDC criteria for HIV infection: 3 P2A,1 P2C, 3 P2D2, 1 P2D3. Average age of onset of symptoms was 4-6 mos., 3 babies with P. carinii pneumonia died at 12 mos. Mean birth weight for full term (FT) SR was greater than FT Ab+ babies who became ill (3460+845 vs. 2754+472), N.S. Other growth and immunologic parameters including head circumference were comparable at birth for Ab-, SR and ill babies. Mean T4/T8 appears depressed (2.5+1.1) for ill babies at 4 mo and is significantly lower than Abbabies by 6 mo (.87+.7 vs. 3.4+1.3), p.05. At 4 mo IgG is significantly higher for ill babies (976+394) than Ab- babies (443+176), p=.007. Mean IgG and T4/T8 at 4 and 6 mo are comparable for SR and Ab- babies. Conclusion: 43% of Ab+ babies have manifested HIV-related illness during year one of life. Further clinical followup along with viral cultures will clarify the status of seroreverters. Notes: 7259 HIV ANTIGENEMIA IN CHILDREN AT RISK FOR AIDS Thomas M. Mundy*, L Lieb**, J Ward***, J Faust*, F *Amie Karen Laboratories, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, **L.A. County Department of Health, Los Angeles, CA, ***AIDS Program, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA. Objective. To describe the incidence of circulating HIV Antigen (HIV Ag) in a population of HIV Antibody (HIV Ab) seropositive and seronegative children at risk for AIDS. Methods. Enzyme immuno-assays (EIA) for HIV Ag and HIV Ab (Abbott) were performed on 294 children (3 mo-14 yr; m=4 yr) at risk for HIV infection either through transfusion or by a parent at risk. Results. Sixteen children are HIV Ab positive and have been followed 2-18 months. Of the 16, 7 patients are HIV Ag positive and 7 HIV Ag negative on serial determinations. One HIV Ab positive patient converted from HIV Ag neg-> pos and one reverted from HIV Ag pos->neg. All HIV Ag positive patients have core and envelope antibody by Western blot. HIV Antigenemia does not correlate with clinical status. None of 278 EIA HIV Ab negative children were HIV Ag positive. Conclusion. In contrast to adults, half of our patients had detectable HIV Ag even in the presence of core antibody. However, adding HIV Ag screening did not increase the number of HIV infected patients identified over HIV Ab screening alone. 7260 NATURAL HISTORY OF HIV INFECTION IN NEONATAL TRANSFUSION RECIPIENTS Thomas M. Mundy*, L Lieb**, J Ward***, Pomerance*, F *Amie Karen Laboratories, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, **L.A. County Department of Health, Los Angeles, CA, ***AIDS Program, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA. Objective. To outline the natural history of HIV infection in a cohort of neonatal transfusion recipients followed 5-8 years. Methods. The cohort consisted of 25 children infected with HIV through transfusions received at various medical centers. Results. 8/25 (32%) children died at a mean age of 50 mo; 17/25 (68%) children are alive at a mean age of 72 mo. Of the 17 living children, 11 are asymptomatic meeting the following CDC classifications: P1A=6 patients, P1B=2, P1C=3. The remaining 6 are symptomatic, classified P2A. Thus, 44% of our cohort of children infected through transfusion as neonates remain asymptomatic at 5-8 years. An additional 24% have non-specific symptoms but no opportunistic infections. The mean age of both the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups is 72 months. Conclusion. Children infected with HIV through transfusion as neonates may remain clinically and immunologically normal for at least 6 years. Normal growth and development and the lack of symptomatic infections does not rule out HIV infection in neonatal transfusion recipients. 442 [Page SERA FROM HAEMOPHILIAC CHILDREN. S. Read, C. Major, B. McLaughlin, D.Fujioka, V. Blanchette and J. LeBrocq, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In HIV infections, the p24 antigen may be present in serum prior to the formation of detectable antibodies, and at intermittent intervals during the course of infection. Persistent presence of p24 antigen may be an indicator of progression to ARC or AIDS. Also, changing anti-HIV antibody immuno-blot patterns may provide information on the stage of HIV infection and disease. A retrospective study was conducted on sequential sera collected over a two year period from 55 haemophiliac children. The results of the study showed that of the 55 remaining children, 33 were HIV seropositive. The remaining 22 were HIV seronegative, and persistently p24 antigen negative. Of the 33 seropositive individuals, 10 seroconverted while under observation, and 23 were reactive at the start of the program. Of the 10 seroconverters, 3 individuals had detectable antigen at some point during observation and of the 23 persistently reactive children, 10 demonstrated transient or persistent antigenemia. Our patient showed loss of p24 antibody with presence of p24 antigen and subsequently developed AIDS. Three others have evidence of deteriorating immune status and have developed detectable p24 antigen. Further information will be gained by continuing to observe the children on a regular basis for HIV antigen and antibody and clinical changes, as well as laboratory assessment of immune function. 7262 HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) CORE PROTEIN ANTIGENEMIA IN CHILDREN WITH HIV INFECTION William Borkowsky, K Krasinski, D Paul*, R Lawrence, S Chandwani, T Moore, D Bebenroth. New York University School of Medicine, Bellevue Hospital Center, Department of Pediatrics, New York, N.Y. and *Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Illinois. OBJECTIVE: To correlate plasma HIV core antigen (p24) levels in children with clinical status. METHODS: Plasma p24 was measured by Elisa. RESULTS: Plasma core antigen (p24) levels from HIV were measured in 63 HIV infected children. The qualitative presence of p24 was found in blood samples from 53% of children who were asymptomatic at that time (group I), 70% of children with AIDS-related illness (group II), and 85% of children who had experienced an opportunistic infection (group III). When p24 levels were determined for infants below 15 months of age, 78% of blood specimens were positive. This included a prevalence rate of 66% for specimens derived from infants below 6 months of age and 92% when the infants were between 6 and 12 months of age. In addition, quantitative p24 plasma levels were determined. Group I was found to contain significantly lower mean levels (49.2 pg/ml) than either group II (384.8 pg/ml) or group III (461.6 pg/ml). Those children with antigen levels ) 500 pg/ml had absolute numbers of T helper cells and survival statistics similar to a group of HIV infected children with opportunistic infection. CONCLUSION: (1) The prevalence of antigenemia in children is higher than that reported for HIV infected adults; (2) p24 antigenemia may help detect HIV infection in those infants where residual maternal antibody may obscure the interpretation of HIV serology; and (3) hyperantigenemia may be used for prognostic HIV-ANTIGENAEMIA, CD4+ of Genova, Italy. To find predictive parameters useful for the follow-up of children born to HIV seropositive mothers, the correlation between serum HIVp24 antigen, concentration of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, serum immunoglobulin classes and age and disease stage were studied in 64 children. Serum HIVp24Ag was present in all the three children with AIDS, in 6/9 children with ARC,in 1/4 with LAS and 1/23 asymptomatic children. There was a significant negative correlation between CD4+ blood lymphocytes (PBL) and age when all the data of the children were analyzed together. The mean CD4+ PBL were significantly lower in ARC patients compared to LAS patients and in seronegative patients compared to LAS children, but asymptomatic, LAS and AIDS children were younger than seronegative and ARC patients. Serum HIVp24Ag can be used as a predictor of subsequent development of symptomatology. On the contrary CD4+ PBL data have to be evaluated considering age, since they progressively decrease with increasing age in these children, irrespectively of disease stage. An integrated evaluation of CD4+ PBL, age and immunoglobulin class concentrations might yeald improved prognostic significance. 7264 PERINATAL HIV TRANSMISSION: VALUE OF HIV ANTIGEN DETERMINATION IN SERUM S. Pahwa, M. Kaplan, W. Lim, H. Slade, N. Chirmule, A. Gupta North Shore University Hospital, Cornell Univ. Med. College, Manhasset, New York, USA Obiective. To determine the diagnostic and prognostic value of HIV antigen determination in serum of infants and children with known or presumptive HIV infection Methods. Abbott Elisa kits were used to determine HIV antigen (Ag) and antibody (Ab); ab was confirmed by western blots. 5 asymptomatic HIV ab+ infants under 15 mo. age (class P-O) and 8 children, age 3mo.-5 yrs with symptomatic HIV disease (class P-2) were tested. Results: HIV ag and ab results are indicated below: Classification Age n Aq+/Ab+ Class P-0* 1 day-5 mo. 5 1/5 Class P-2** 3 mo.-5yr. 8 4/6 * The single Ag+ infant developed PCP & CMV disease at age 3 months. Others remain Ag- but Ab+ at ages 5-15 mo.; 2 have recurrent illnesses but HIV infection status is unknown. ** Of 4 Ag+ cases, 3 are dead (ages 4 mo., 8 mo., 5 yr) and the 4th has had PCP and CMV disease. 2 Ag+ infants were Ab-, but HIV was isolated from cultured cells. All 4 Ag- cases ( ages 12mo., 15 mo., 5yr, 5 yr) are alive; one has lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis. Conclusions. 1. HIV antigenemia is associated with a poor prognosis 2. HIV Ag may be present in high titer in Ab- HIV infected cases. 3. Absence of antigen does not indicate lack of HIV infection. 443 [Page 444](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/442) 7265 The prognostic significance of persistent and transient HIV antigenemia in children Leon G.

Methods: 46 children were studied. 38 children acquired HIV-infection from their mothers, (children with only transient HIV antibodies from transplacental passage of IgG were excluded). 8 children received HIV contaminated blood products in the neonatal period. Serial serum specimens were obtained for each subject over a duration of 4 to 68 months with a mean duration of 18.1 months and a median duration of 13.5 months. Free HIV-antigen (P24) in these sera was determined using a solid phase enzyme immunoassay (Abbott) sensitive to 50 pg/ml. Results: 22 children had persistent antigenemia (mean 16.3 months), 6 children had transient antigenemia lasting 1 to 10 months, and 18 children had no antigen detected in their serum (mean 15.7 months). The mortality of each group at the end of this study was as follows: persistent antigenemia 64%, Conclusion: Persistent antigenemia predicts a poor outcome and high mortality. Conversely, the absence of detectable free HIV antigen in serum predicts a longer survival. The transient detection of HIV antigen may represent a balance between viral expression and host factors, possibly antibodies against core antigen, which limit the quantitiy of free HIV antigen. 7266 VIROLOGIC AND IMMUNOLOGIC FOLLOW UP OF NEWBORNS FROM HIV POSITIVE MOTHERS: DIAGNOSTIC AND PROGNOSIS VALUE OF HIV POSITIVE CELL CULTURE DURING THE NEONATAL FRANCE. Objective: To determine a prognosis factor of developping HIV infection in infants from HIV infected mothers. Methods: Peripheral blood(mothers,infants),CSF(infants) and ombilical cord blood are drawn and cultivated(Rev. Transc.assay) at the time of the birth.Sequencial PBL cultures are performed in children all along the 30 first months of their life. During that period of time,serologic pattern(ELAVIA and Western Blot analysis),cellular immunology(CD4+,CD8+,Leu7+),B2microglobulin and blood che mistry were evaluated versus clinical evolution. Results: 25 couples\"mother-newborn\"have been inclued in this study,and infants investigated during up to 30months (over 90 cultures):4 newborns and 8 mothers were HIV culture positive;it might not be any strong correlation between mother's positive culture and newborn's one.None of the 21 negative cultures was detected as positive during the following period.None of them seroconverted and none of them presented any specific symptoms of HIV infection. All the 4 HIV culture positive newborns developped signs of HIV infection,including 3 AIDS. Cellular immunology and B microglobulin patterns were parallel to clinical and virological evolution. Conclusion: Thought P2 antigenemia is positive in only 70 % of the positive cell cultures,identification of HIV replication in cell culture may be the most reliable diagnosis and prognosis criteria,and might be of interest in early specific therapeutic decision. Notes: 7267 15 p24 ANTIGEN(Ag)A PROGNOSTIC of p24 Ag presence in serum of HIVAb positive children in relation to clinical picture Methods:Among 14 HIV p24 Ag positive children,? came to our department when older than 15 months.They are now 18 to 48 mos.old(24.1+7)and were followed up every 3 mos.In controlled for a median period of 6 mos.At first control all were HIV p24Ag positive and had immunological abnormalities(CD4 888.6+481.7,CD4/CD8 symptomatic,while the others were,and still remain,in apparent good health (according to CDC one is P-2 and six are P-1B). Conclusions:We do not know if p24Ag detection in our chil dren is related to Ag persistence since birth or to later reappearance.Whatever the explanation,children's behavior seems to be quite different from that commonly seen in adult HIV positive patients.In fact in adults HIV p24 Ag persistence and reappearance seem to be related toa rapid disease progression.Contrarily,in our pediatric population the presence of p24 antigen does not seem to be related to a particular severity of HIV infection. 7268 Incubation Periods for Maternally Transmitted Pediatric AIDS Cases: Charles Lawrence *, P Thomas ** D Morse * B Truman *, I Auger*, R Williams **, and V DeGruttola *** * N.Y. State Dept. of Health, ** N.Y. City Dept. of Health, New York, *** Biostatistics Dept., Harvard University, Massachusetts Objective: To obtain unbiased estimates of incubation periods of pediatric AIDS cases. Methods: Due to the newness of the AIDS epidemic, children with short incubation periods (date of birth to date of diagnosis) are over represented among reported cases. We employed both parametric and nonparametri c methods of analysis designed to overcome this bias. Data were taken from pediatric AIDS registries maintained by the NYS and NYC Departments of Health. Results: Although 58% of the first 190 cases have incubation periods under one year, nonparametric methods that compensate for this bias show that 20% of children destined to contract AIDS within 10 years will do so in their first year of life. The incubation can be characterized as a mixture of two parametric distributions, one with shorter (median =.5 years) and one with longer incubation periods, similar to those previously reported for adults (median = 5.5 years). With increased observation times the longer median should increase. Conclusion: A substantially higher proportion of pediatric AIDS cases appear to have longer incubation periods than previously reported. 444 [Page 445](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/443) 7269 WOEN AIS n NEW YOK CITY.

Blac: and Hispa.nic vmen account ofwvomen who acquiredAIDS through heteroseualcontactis inciasmie(from i2% in 1982 to 30% in 1987). Despite the current and projected need for services forwomen and their families, there has been minimal planning and little systematic irspnse by the public and pvate sectos as well as by service providers. Womenwith HIV infection are alreadysocially andeconomically disadvantagedand their illness compounds theirinabilityforself-empowerment. In response to these problems, women in New Yo Cily have mobilied and formed two groups: the Women and AIDS Project(WAP) and the Women's AIDS Resource Netwo (WARN). WAP, under the auspices ofthe New Yok State Division for Women, provides an organied communication netwok or AIDS service poviders through bi-month meetings and a newsletter. WARN, a not-for-profit agency, has been started to enhance and faciliate access to resoures forwomen and childen affectedby AIDS, including a clearinghouse or educational materials and information, technicalassistance, polic development andadvocacy, This presentation ill focu on the organszthnai proces oofs governmental and community response to undeserved populations ofHIV-infectedwomen. This includes mobiliation of indigenous community helpes, forging lils to established service providers and rgeting outreach strategies.

Friedmann, Dept. of Gynecology, Free University of Berlin A group of 62 HIV pos. woman regularly attended our ambulatory service for immunological, endocrinological and gynecological examination. Following CDC criteria we have up to now 3% IV-C2, 8% 10% II-A stages in our collective. We lost 2 woman by suicid and 2 by cervical carcinoma. The maior cause of frequently visiting the gynecoligist was repeated pain of the lower abdomen (25%) especially by chronic pelvic infection (17%) regardless of the clinical staging. In 29 % we diagnosed mycosis of vagina or vulva and in 15 % unspecific 24 % developed folliculitis or papillomatous dermatitis. In 8% we found ovarian cystic tumors. One of these could be diagnose as an ovarian carcinoma. 30% were associated with suspicious cervical cytology including cervixcarcinoma (5%) and CIN III (5%). As a consequence woman with even asymptomatic HIV-infection should be regularly and carefully observed by the gynecologist to prevent the obvious risk of chronicle infection and to diagnose the development of carcinoma as early as possible. Notes: 7271 INCREASED FATALITY FROM PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA Sattler, CT Boylen. Univ of Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA, USA. Objective. Compare the clinical features and outcome of PCP in women and men with AIDS. Methods. From May 1984 to June 1987 we treated 12 women (age 34.8 yrs) with AIDS-related PCP; all were first episodes. Each was matched with 2 men with PCP (without knowledge to outcome) for age (35.0 yrs), first episodes of PCP and same initial therapy (TMP-SMX vs Pentamidine). Results. The women and men were comparable in ethnicity (4 white, 4 black, 4 hispanic vs 15W, 4B, 5H); days of cough/dyspnea (28 vs 23) and weight lose >10 lb (6 vs 15) before Rx; presence of fever (11 vs 18), generalized adenopathy (4 vs 13), oral thrush (9 vs 16); baseline WBC (5.1K vs 6.8K), CD4 lymphocytes (89 vs 139), room air PaO2 (61 vs 65 mm Hg), (A-a)D02 (49 vs 45), p>0.1 for each variable. Before hospitalization, AIDS was not considered in the 12 women and they more often received oral antibiotics (8 vs 7, p=0.04). Women had somewhat lower Hgb (10.0 vs 12.6, p<0.0001). 11 women and 22 men were treated initially with TMP-SMX for 7.5 vs 9.0 days, p=0.17. Total days of therapy were also similar (15.5 vs 17.7, p=0.14). Respiratory failure (PaO2/Fi02 < 250) occurred more often in women (8 vs 4, p=0.009) and more women died (6 vs 3, p=0.02). Conclusion. Clinical features were similar but outcome was worse in women. Earlier diagnosis and therapy may improve their prognosis. 7272 CHANGES IN RISK BEHAVIOR FOR HIV INFECTION AND TRANSMISSION IN A PROSPECTIVE STUDY OF 240 SEXUALLY ACTIVE WOMEN IN SAN FRANCISCO Judith B. Cohen, LE Poole, LE Dorfman, CA Lyons, TJ Kelly, CB Wofsy Department of Medicine, San Francisco General Hospital University of California San Francisco Objective and Methods: Through January 1988, 240 women at risk for heterosexual transmission enrolled in a prospective study had completed 6-12 month follow-up serologic testing and interviews about health and behavior change. Results: 25 were HIV+ at entry. Among 23 Ab+ women who were healthy or had LAN at entry, one had progressed to ARC. Among 215 Ab- women, one became Ab+.. Most participants reported major behavior changes toward reducing HIV transmission risk: During Previous Year At Entry Follow-up Bisexual Partner(s) 61% 25% IV User Sexual Partner(s) 36 18 More than 10 Partners 42 32 Any IV Drug Use 23 11 Vaginal Sex with Condom 38 72 Any Anal Sex 48 24 Anal Sex with Condom 5 67 Conclusions: Although risk reduction behavior changes have been substantial, many participants have yet to achieve successful changes. Among Ab- women, 22% still continue unsafe relationships with Ab+, IV drug using or bisexual men and/or personal IV drug use, and report more difficulty changing sexual behavior within them. Since HIIV transmission risk is greater in these sustained partnerships where change is more difficult, prevention programs need development that address interpersonal change strategies. 445 [Page 446](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/444) 7273 AIDS INTERVENTION IN PSYCHOTHERAPY PRACTICE WITH HIGH RISK MINORITY WOMEN Rani Eversley, Ph.D. UCSF Center for AIDS Prevention Studies San Francisco Dept. of Public Health OBJECTIVE. To describe how psychotherapists can play a critical role in reducing the spread of HIV by detecting and intervening in high risk behavior among individuals whose behavior may not be sufficiently impacted by mass educational efforts. METHOD. Presentation will cover psychological interventions for four groups of high risk female adult patients: chronic and occasional IV and non-IV substance abusing women, partners of substance abusing men, women with multiple sexual partners and repeated incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, and women with multiple sexual partners who are psychiatrically impaired. The presentation will focus on cases of Black and Latina women within these high risk groups. Intervention strategies include education, assertion training, role play exercises, self awareness, and behavioral contracts. CONCLUSION. These psychotherapeutic intervention strategies are more effective for some groups of high risk women than general public health campaigns. These strategies may be readily adapted for use by other health disciplines for an individualized approach to AIDS risk reduction with difficult to manage populations. 7274 CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF AIDS IN WOMEN IN SOUTHEASTERN NEW ENGLAND. Carpenter CCJ Fisher A, Desai M, Durand L. Indacochea F, Mayer KM. Brown University, Providence, RI. Women constitute a relatively high proportion (ca 20%) of patients with AIDS (PWAs) treated at the Brown University medical center (BUMC). Objectives. The following data were obtained to determine the natural history of AIDS in this cohort of women. Results. 78% of the 24 women PWAs were non-Hispanic Caucasians. The dominant risk factors were intravenous drug use (75%) and heterosexual relations with intravenous drug abusers (IDVAs) (17%). Mean age at diagnosis was 35 (range=26-50). The women PWAs treated at BUMC have survived for relatively long periods after definitive AIDS diagnosis (mean survival = 19 + 7 mos for PWAs diagnosed prior to 1987). In only 5 of 24 women PWAs was pneumocystis pneumonia the initial AIDS-defining opportunistic infection (0I). In concurrent studies of 18 asymptomatic HIV seropositive women who became pregnant, none developed major infectious complications during pregnancy. In 8 individuals with long-term post-partum follow-up (14 + 5 mos), none have developed OIs or other evidence of progressive disease. Conclusions. These data indicate that the clinical course of AIDS in Caucasian women may be no worse than in males, and may be more favorable than in male IVDAs. Pneumocystis pneumonia may be a less common early manifestation in female PWAs. In addition the data provide no support for the concept that pregnancy exacerbates the course of HIV infection. Notes: 7275 HIV INFECTION IN WOMEN M. FrBschl, 0. Braun-Falco Dermatological Department of Ludwigs-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany Objective. In this study we tried to find out if there are characteristics of HIV infection in women with regard to dermatological manifestations. Methods. 291 patients of our outpatient clinic were examined: 250 (85,9 %) male, 41 (14,1 %) female. Results. Women with HIV infection are younger than men (26 vs 35 years). Whereas only 16,7 % (56/250) of men used i.v. drugs, 88 % (36/41) of women were i.v. drug users. Heterosexual contacts were the probable way of infection in 12 % (5/41) of female and 2 % (5/250) of male patients. Seborrheic dermatitis seems to be a very typical sign of HIV infection in men (47,4 %) but not in women (4,9 %). 58,6 % of our female patients, however, showed acneiform eruption compared with 28,1 % of men. Conclusion. There are differences in age, transmission patterns and some dermatological manifestations between men and women. 7276 DEVELOPMENT OF A BEHAVIORAL INDEX AS A MEASURE FOR ASSESSING HIV RISK Ralph J. DiClemente* and Geraldine Oliva** *University of California, San Francisco **San Francisco Department of Public Health Objective. The predictive value of selfreported behaviors for risk of HIV acquisition was studied in 545 women attending Health Department Family Planning Clinics. Methods. Women completed a 40 item selfadministered questionnaire which assessed sexual and drug related behaviors, history of sexually transmitted diseases, use of condoms and self-perceived risk for HIV infection. Results. Women were stratified into three risk groups: No-Risk, Low-Risk (multiple partners, partners whose risk history was unknown), and, High-Risk (IV drug use, sexual partner of IV drug user, sexual partner of bisexual man). Reported history of sexually transmitted diseases was used as a surrogate biological marker for potential HIV risk as serological data was unavailable. High-Risk women were twice as likely as Low-Risk women to report STDs; 37% vs 18.5% (RR=2.0; 95% CI=1.1-3.6; P<0.03) and group; 37% vs 6.1% (RR=6.1; 95% CI=3.4-10.8; P<0.0001). Although High-Risk women were more likely to perceive themselves at high risk for HIV acquisition, relative to Low-Risk (RR=1.5) or No-Risk women (RR=3.9), they were no more likely to use condoms. Conclusion. This data support the utility of risk-behavior stratification as a measure of HIV risk when serological data is unavailable. 446 [Page 447](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/445) 7277 PREVALENCE OF HIGH RISK BEHAVIORS AMONG WOMEN ATTENDING FAMILY PLANNING CLINICS IN SAN FRANCISCO Geraldine Oliva* and Ralph J. DiClemente** *San Francisco Department of Public Health **University of California, San Francisco Objective. A survey was completed on 545 San Francisco women ages 13-49 attending Health Department Family Planning Clinics to evaluate the risk of HIV acquisition. Methods. A self-administered 40 item questionnaire assessed knowledge and attitudes about AIDS, high risk sexual and drug related behaviors, history of sexually transmitted diseases and safe sex practices. Results. The prevalence of high-risk behaviors was high among this population: 7.2% report using intravenous drugs, 10.2% report having sexual intercourse with a bisexual man, 30.1% had sexual intercourse with a partner whose sexual history was unknown, 9.1% report having sexual intercourse with an IV drug user and 33.9% reported multiple partners. Despite the high prevalence of risk-behaviors, condom use was low, with 55% and 18.9%, respectively, reporting that their sex partners \"never\" or 'rarely\" use condoms during sexual intercourse. Among women with multiple sexual partners, 41.7% never used condoms. Women at most extreme risk of HIV acquisition were significantly more likely to have had an STD (RR= 3.3; 95% CI=2.0 - 5.6; p<0.0001). Conclusion. A substantial proportion of women are engaging in high risk behaviors supporting the need for aggressive prevention programs. 7278 INTERVIEWS WITH HIV-INFECTED WOMEN In the near future, all county councils will have screening facilities made available to all pregnant women to test for the HIV virus. This knowledge together with careful consideration will hopefully enable the woman to decide whether or not to carry on the pregnancy. In order to obtain greater knowledge about what it means for a young abusing woman to be HIV-infected, and how the social services can help her in an effective way, the National Board of Health and Welfare has held intensive interviews with HIV-infected women who have had a child and also those women who have chosen to have an abortion. Interviews have also been held with treatment staff who work with these women. Obviously; there are no definite solutions as to how the treatment staff should handle each individual case, but these staff are usually very experienced, having first been confronted with the problem in its early stages among HIV-infected drug addicts. The material has been reviewed and compiled into a report\u00fd The aim of the report is to throw some light on questions dealing with sexuality. abortion and pregnancy for HIV positive female drug addicts. But of course, the questions which are described in the report are also relevant to other groups. Notes: 7279 GYNAECOLOGICAL OBSTETRICAL AND CONTRACEPTION FINDINGS gynaecological and contraception problems in HIV seropositive patients diagnosed and controlled in our Clinic. METHODS: Fifty-two HIV seropositive women were studied in our Department and checked at any time between 6 and 24 months. A complete gynaecological ad or obstetric eva luation was done including PAP smear and bacteriological study. In cases where menstrual disorders were observed, hipothalamic-pituitary activity was assessed higher rate of sexually transmitted diseases was found, with a high prevalence of PVP infection. Bad use of effective contraception was found with a high rate of unwanted pregnancies, most of them ended in legal abortions. Risk factors among these women related to unwanted pregnancies, bad use of contraception and STD are discussed. Obstetric problems and perinatal transmis sion in cases of continuing pregnancies are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection is not associated with specific pathological changes in the genital tract. In our study the risk of STD and unwanted pregnancies are rela ted to IVDA and prostitution. We emphasize the importan ce of gynaecological control related to prevention of STD, use of effective contraception, and counselling in early pregnancy in the prevention of HIV infection (heterosexual and perinatal transmission). 7280 THE PRESENCE OF ANTIBODY TO HIV-1 IN PATIENTS ON TRANSFUSION HAVING HAEMORRHAGIC SYNDROM IN OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY Milan JevrImovic6XB. aksimovic6, N, Juznic,. Moilov, B. Rosi6, and S. Pazin Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Institute of Blood transfusion School of Medicine University of Belgrade, Jugoslavia. Our investigations: The possibility of infection with HIV was investigated at female patients receiving blood transfusion as well as blood derivatives, during the time period while the blood donors were not yet tested on the virus presence. Those investigations were done in the collaboration between Clinic of Gyn./Obstr. and Institute of Blood Transfusion in Belgrade. Methodology: The presence of antibody to HIV was estimated at 307 female patients which,for medical treatments of haemorragic syndrom have been receiving higher amounts of blood and blood derivatives ( fibrinogen plasma cryoprecipitate, human albumins linked immunosorbent assay)-Behringwerke and Wellcome. Results:The presence of antibody was detected only in a very few cases,in spite the fact that the majority of patients have been receiving fibrinogen and other blood derivatives, which could be a special risk in HIV transsmision. Conclusion: Our target studings at 307 patients indicates a low transsmision of HIV. 447 [Page 448](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/446) 7281 DAPSONE-TRIMETHOPRIM Div. of Clinical Pharmacy and Infectious Diseases,San Francisco General Hospital, University of California, San Francisco Obiective:To compare levels of Dapsone(DAP) trimethoprim(TMP) and sulfamethoxazole(SMX) with efficacy and toxicity in treatment trials for initial episode Pneumocvstis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in AIDS. Methods:78 AIDS patients with episode PCP treated Results:DAP/TMP was more effective treatment,induced more significant toxicity and resulted in significantly higher Dapsone levels (33.3%) than DAP alone.DAP/TMP and TMP/SMX were equally efficacious treatment for PCP,but the TMP concentration was significantly higher(37.4%) with DAP/TMP than TMP/SMX. However, more patients had to discontinue therapy in the TMP/SMX group. Conclusion: TMP may inhibit metabolism of DAP leading to increased Dapsone serum levels which may contribute to the toxicity of DAP, and possibly to the greater efficacy of the DAP/TMP combination.The higher concentration of TMP in the DAP/TMP group than the TMP/SMX grour suggests that DAP may of Milan,Italy Objective To evidentiate,by analysis of chromosome aberrations and determination of micronuclei(MN)frequency in lymphocytes,the role of DNA damage involved in the genesis of HIV infections. Methods Chromosome analysis and MN scoring of human lymphocytes were carried out using blood cultures from 30 different donors(10 smokers,10 smoker IVDA,10 smoker IVDA HIV infected)aged between 20 and 30. Cells from whole blood cultures were incubated for 72hs in darkness at 37~C, then harvested following conventional methods, dropped on slides and stained with Giemsa solution. 100/methaphases/ subject and 3000 blast cells/3 slides/subject were scored blindly. Results A significant difference in frequency of chromosome aberrations(chromatid and chromosome gaps,breaks and other)was observed between controls and IVDA,either with or without gaps(0.5 P 0.2;0.1 P 0.0l)but not between IVDA and IVDA HIV infected. The observed MN frequency shows no significant differencies between groups. Conclusions This cytogenetic study suggests that DNA damage may be dependent on drug abuse rather than HIV infection. 8002 PSYCHOSOCIAL PREDICTORS OF AIDS HIGH-RISK BEHAVIORS AMONG INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS David R Gibson, J L Sorensen, J LovelleDrache, J Catania, S Kegeles, M Young University of California, San Francisco, USA Objective. This study assesses the alpha and test-retest reliability and concurrent and predictive validity of 6 psychosocial scales derived from the health belief model and health psychology. The scales, which measure AIDS susceptibility and anxiety, and self-efficacy and communication skill, are designed for use in epidemioloaic studies and evaluations of interventions to reduce risk. Methods. 30 IV drug users were interviewed on Days 1 and 10 of 21-day heroin detoxification treatment. They were administered the 6 scales and asked about needle sharino and condom use during the 30 days prior to.treatment. A further study of 100 IV users (results will be available at the conference) examines whether the scales predict behavior.2 months post-treatment. Results. Alpha and test-retest reliabilities in most cases ranged from.6 to.9, and most scales were correlated with needle sharing and/or condom use. Table of Results Alpha, Alpha, Test- Needle Condom Scale Day 1 Day 10 scales have generally adequate to excellent reliability and appear to be useful in predicting behavior. They will be available for distribution at the conference. Notes: 8403 IV DRUG USERS AND AIDS: CHANGING Siegel*, Davis CA., U.S.A. ** The Aquarian Effort, Sacramento CA., U.S.A. Rapid spread of HIV among intravenous drug users (IVDU) and lack of an effective HIV vaccine or treatment for AIDS have forced consideration of other methods for control of HIV in this risk group. Educating IVDU in order to modify their behavior may be effective in slowing HIV spread. From 10 to 12/86, we surveyed IVDU enrolled in drug treatment programs (DTPs) in Sacramento Co. (pop.= 1 mil.) to assess their knowledge and behavior related to AIDS high-risk activities. We conducted a followup survey one year later. In the interval we visited these DTPs frequently, tested 400 IVDU for the presence of HIV antibody, and educated them in the techniques for risk-reduction, specifically disinfection of paraphernalia (P) and safer sex techniques. On both surveys we found study subjects to be well-informed about HIV and AIDS and aware of their potential for acquiring HIV infection. They consistently underestimated the number of infected IVDU in Sacramento, however. There was significant change in their stated high-risk behavior between the two surveys. They indicated less sharing of P the last time they injected drugs (p <.005), and increased availability (86% vs 70% of IVDU, p <.005) and use (60% vs 23%, p <.001) of disinfectants such as liquid bleach, rubbing alcohol or peroxide for cleaning of P. Our program may have contributed to this change. HIV-antibody prevalence rose from 0.6% to 2.5% in this pop. during the study period. Our data suggests that reinforcing \"safe\" shooting and sex techniques at every encounter with an IVDU may slow the spread of HIV. 8C))4 REMISSION AND RELAPSE IN HEROIN USERS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT: TREATMENT CONTROL, OR RISK REDUCTION A.B.V. Bucknall, J.R. Robertson, Carol A. Skidmore, J.J.K. Roberts Edinburgh Drug Addiction Study, Edinburgh, Scotland Objective. To record patterns of drug injecting over a two year period and relate findings to HIV infection risk. Methods. Data were gathered from records of known heroin injectors of general practice consultations over a 2 year period. Patients were categorised as Abstinent, Non-Dependent Users, Dependent Users or receiving Maintenance therapy. Standard questionnaires were used to record drug taking, pattern of use, clinical problems and use of services. Results. Patterns of drug use were distinct in different groups some pursuing relentless drug taking behaviour and others persistent experimentation devoid apparently of addiction. Time spent in prison appeared to have no effect on subsequent drug taking behaviour. Conclusion. Strategies to cope with AIDS in drug users must take into account the intermittent nature of drug abuse and therefore the requirement for treatment or intervention targeted on lifestyles rather than managing the elusive addictive state. A-29 449 [Page 450](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/448) D. Chitwood**, *Department of Psychiatry, **Department of Oncology, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL Objective. To compare the relative importance of needle use and sexual behavior among street recruited intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in explaining antibody HIV positivity. Methods. Recruited through street contacts in Dade County, Florida, 220 currently active IVEUs who are not involved in drug abuse treatment volunteered for antibody HIV screening (ELISA twice with Western Blot confirmatory) and interviews about drug taking, needle use, and sexual behavior. Forty of these individuals also completed indepth interviews on their attitudes toward hypodermic paraphernalia and social patterns of needle use. Results. Prevalence rates for antibody positivity are related to frequency of injection, frequency of needle sharing, and presence of infected individuals within an IVDU's immediate social network. Conclusion. IVDUs demonstrate highly variable behaviors related to risk of HIV infection. This variability results in confusion among IViDs about the risks involved in needle using and sexual behavior. 8006 CHARACTERISTICS AND STATED AIDS RISK BEHAVIOR OF IV DRUG USERS ATTENDING DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN A MEDIUM-SIZED U.S. CITY Medical Center, Sacramento CA, USA. In an ongoing study of AIDS and IV drug use in Sacramento, CA (pop. 1 mil) we have examined 280 IV drug users (IVDU) attending a variety of drug treatment programs (DTPs). Mean duration of drug use was 11 years. Demographics: males 63%; <40 yrs. old blacks 6%; unemployed 73%; never been enrolled in a DTP before; 73% had previously enrolled in a DTP, a mean of 3.3 times. Drug of choice was heroin 63%; amphetamines 17%; cocaine 7%. 72% used one or more drugs in addition to their drug of choice, exclusive of alcohol. 93% shared paraphernalia (P) \"sometimes\" or more often, with a mean of 2.2, 3.7 and 12 other IVDU in the last month, 6 months and one year respectively. 44% disinfect P between users \"often\", Male IVDU estimated a greater number of sexual partners in the past month, 6 months, 10 years (4,17,96 respectively) than did women IVDU (2,4,28). 67% and 90% of IVDU never used condoms for vaginal or anal intercourse, respectively. All five HIV positive were male, of which one was bisexual. There was a significant difference between IVDU attending DTPs and those seen in the hospital setting which serves indigent patients. These observations provided us in developing a comprehensive AIDS prevention program for IVDU in Sacramento. Communities should consider studying drug use patterns and sexual preferences of IVDU as they develop programs to control spread of HIV in this pivotal risk group. Notes: 8007 IVDU AIDS KNOWLEDGE AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGE Joyce Jackson, L Rotkiewicz, D Wells State Department of Health, New Jersey Objective. To determine AIDS knowledge level and AIDS risk reduction behavioral change among IVDU treatment admissions in New Jersey (NJ). To compare knowledge and behavioral change among AIDS educated and non-educated IVDUs. Provide success measure for education projects. Method. AIDS education provided to IVDUs through State sponsored network of AIDS Coordinators/Community Health Educators since 1985. Sixteen inner-city methadone programs throughout NJ gave self-administer AIDS knowledge and behavioral change surveys to all IVDU admissions. Maximum 1,000 surveys completed 30 days. Surveys identified by demographic variables, including AIDS education. AIDS knowledge: transmission modes & risk groups, signs & symptoms, risk reduction. Behavioral change: IV drug use, sexual & social practice. Results. Preliminary data (N=100) indicate IVDUs highly aware of their sexual (89%) and needle sharing (93%) AIDS risk group, but only 11% believe infected. Over 60% personally knew deceased PWAs. Eighty % had previous drug treatment with mean of 2.8 attempts. Overall knowledge and behavioral change evaluated and non-AIDS educated IVDUs were compared to educated IVDUs. Only 10% indicated no behavioral changes. Change in IV drug use activities more prevalent than safe-sex practice. Conclusion. AIDS education can make significant impact on IVDU knowledge level that can potentially change high risk behavior. 8008 National AIDS TRANSMISSION RISK BEHAVIORS AMONG INTRAVENOUS DRUG ABUSERS (IVDAs) Robert J Battjes, R Pickens Institute on Drug Abuse, Rockville, MD, USA Objective. To determine at-risk behaviors and adoption of risk-reduction measures by IVDAs. Methods. Recent admissions (June-Dec. 1987) to methadone treatment in New York City (n=202); Asbury Park, NJ (n=59); Trenton, NJ (n=50); San Antonio, TX (n=149); Los Angeles, CA (n=204) were interviewed using standardized questionnaire to determine drug and sex histories. Results. Overall 93% of IVDAs reported sharing needles at some time, ranging from 84.7% in New York City to 97.3% in San Antonio. Regarding typical sharing patterns over the past 5 years, only 12.5% reported no sharing, while 25.5% reported sharing at least daily. Of those who shared needles, 37.6% reported never cleaning them, while only 10.7% reported always cleaning. Most IVDAs (86.4%) reported changing behavior to reduce AIDS-risk, with 16.8% quitting drug injection and 41.1% stopping needle-sharing. Significant differences in quitting drug injection (p.001) and stopping needle-sharing (p.001) were found among cities, with New York City reporting the highest rates of riskreduction. Few were taking steps to protect their sexual partners from possible transmission, with only 14% reporting they have started or increased condom use. Conclusion. IVDAs are at high risk for HIV since needles are commonly shared in cities across the U.S. Reports of behavior change to reduce AIDS-risk, especially in New York City, are encouraging, but change by IVDAs entering treatment may not be representative of other IVDAs. Sexual transmission is of concern since few IVDAs are protecting their sexual partners. 450 [Page 451](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/449) 009 CHANGES OF BEHAVIOR IN FRENCH IV DRUG (IVDA). W.A. Lowenstein* H. Durand* HIV Study group. Hopital Laennec. Paris (France) Objective: Evaluate changes among IVDA since free sale of syringes and information on HIV disease. Methods: Between September 1987 and Januray 1988 questionaries were submitted to 200 IVDA in Paris. 3 points were evaluated: 1 -behavior towards the syringe. 2 - sexual behavior. 3 -personal position and awareness of the HIV infection. Results: 172 questionaries were obtained, 126 were exploitable (98 men, 28 women; mean age 26.1 y.; mean length of IV intoxication: 4.1 y.; number of injections per day: 2.8). 1-now, 65Zlend their syringe to one person (452) or more than one (200 compared to 92. in 1986. 2 - only 13'/.systematicaly use condoms. 3 -- 927,are aware of the HIV disease and fear it but only 25/know their HIV serology. 791claim to have changed their IV drug behavior but only 22>.their sexual behavior. Conclusion: Regarding syringes significative (P<0.01) modifications are observed in this population in Paris. Free sale of syringes must be continued. A model of usuable only once syringe needs to be investigated. Information about HIV sexual transmission must go on. Key words: IVDA; behavior; syringe; sexual information. 8010 Sexual Activity and HIV-1 Infection Rate in Intravenous Drug Abusing Women JOYCE I. WALLACE*, H.S. SACKS**** and S. on Sexually Transmitted Diseases, NY, NY; **New York City Department of Health, NY, NY;***St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center, NY, NY; ****Mount Sinai Medical Center, NY, NY and *****New York Hospital - Cornell Medical Center, NY, NY. A group of 106 women who had formerly been intravenous drug abusers were questioned as to their lifetime numbers of sexual partners, types of sexual activities, use of contraceptives, and histories of infection. This information was used for a major evaluation correlating HIV-1 serology with behavior, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation. There was a relationship between contraception and HIV-1 infection. The highest percentage of positive results was in those who used condoms, or no contraception, with 67% positive for anti-HIV-1 antibodies. Use of the pill accounted for the second highest group with 55% positive. The lowest numbers of positive results, 30% positive, were found among those having IUD insertions, tubal ligations and diaphragms. Sperm antibodies were higher in the anti-HIV-1 antibody positive group (by Student T test, p=0.0002). (Sperm antibodies were not significantly correlated with number of sexual partners.) Evidence of chlamydia, herpes, CMV and hepatitis B were all found to be higher in the anti-HIV-1 antibody positive group. The mean number of lifetime sex partners in the anti-HIV-1 antibody positive subjects was 3,062 ~ 9,130, and 1,047 ~ 2,721 in the antiHIV-1 antibody negative (p < 0.02). It appears that large numbers of sex partners add to the risk of HIV-1 infection in women who are already at risk through drug abuse. Notes: 8011 DRUG-USE PROFILE, RISK PARTICIPATION, AND 1HIV EXPOSURE AMONG INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS IN SAN FRANCISCO. John K. Watters*, D. Lewis**, Y-T Cheng***, M. Jang****, J. Carlson*****. Study, Institute, University of California at **Santa Cruz, at ***Berkeley, at *****Davis. Objective. To examine the role of different drug use profiles in HIV infection among IVDUs in San Francisco. Method. A cross-section of IVDUs in-treatment and not-in-treatment (N=427) was sampled in 1987. Cases were cluster analyzed to produce an empirically derived typology of drug profiles. These profiles were examined with regard to demographic characteristics, risk behavior (needle-sharing, needle-hygiene, sexual hygiene, frequency of injection), and exposure to HIV. Results. Drug profiles included patterns predominated by injectors of: (1) diacetyl (n=34); hydrochloride (n=60)? (4) combined heroin with cocaine (\"speedball\") (n=128); and (5) no clear drugpreference (n=47). Both the cocaine and speedball profiles were differentially associated with exposure to HIIV when compared with other non-cocaine profiles (p<.00007). No significant differences existed with respect to frequency of injection or needle hygiene. Differences did exist in ethnic composition of the cocaine profiles which contained disproportionately high representation by black IVDUs (who are at higher relative risk for HIV exposure than are other ethnic groups of IVDUs in San Francisco). Conclusion. In San Francisco, differences in HIV exposure exist between cocaine and non-cocaine drug profiles. This appears, however, to be a function of their ethnic composition rather than behavioral differences between members of profile groups. 8012 Intravenous Drug Use and Sexual Intercourse With Intravenous Drug Users as Risk Behavior: Similarities, Differences and Population Impact S.O. Aral, L. Magder, and G.S. Bowen Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia Objective: To assess the frequency of intravenous drug use (IVDU) and sexual intercourse with intravenous drug users (SIIVDU), both risk factors for human iimmnodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, and their association with other risk behaviors among reproductive age women. Method: We analyzed responses to a self-administered questionnaire from all 16,631 consecutive clients attending Pennsylvania family planning clinics, over an eight-week period in the fall of 1987. Results: The overall response rate was 99 percent; item specific rates ranged between 95 and 99 percent. Almost 1% of all respondents reported IVDU, 3% reported SIIVDU, and 1% reported both IVDU and SIIVDU over the past five years. Compared to women who engaged in neither risk behavior, IVDU and SIIVDU significantly more frequently reported other risk behaviors. The relative risk of having engaged in other risk behaviors was consistently highest among women reporting both IVDU and SIIVDU; followed by those reporting only SIIVDU and those reporting only IVDU. For these three groups, respectively, relative risks were: for sexual intercourse with a person known to be infected with HIV (RR=122, 12.7, and 0); for sexual intercourse with a known bisexual (RR=23.2, 12.5, 2.3); for history of sexually transmitted disease (RR=3.12, 1.86,.90); for sexual intercourse with more than 9 partners over the past 5 years (RR=7.06, 4, 2.41); for sexual intercourse with more than 9 partners over the past year (RR=14.6, 12.3, 2.2) and for never using condoms with casual sex partners (RR-1.91, 1.54, and 1). Conclusion: Among women attending family planning clinics, SIIVDU is a sizeable risk behavior associated with other risk behaviors which increase risk of HIV transmission to non-drug using populations. 451 [Page 452](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/450) 8013 RISK REDUCTION AMONG INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS IN AND OUT OF TREATMENT Samuel R. Friedman,* DC Des Jarlais,* P Kleinman*, JL Sotheran,* M Marmor'*, *Narcotic and Drug Research Inc., \"NYS Div. of Substance Abuse Services, \"*New York University Medical Center, New York City Objectives. To assess the extent of injection risk taken by IV drug users recruited in methadone maintenance programs and by IV drug users recruited in street settings (some \"street users\" are enrolled in treatment and some are not), and to assess how the risks taken by high risk IV users in these categories change over time. Methods. 208 methadone (MMTP) clients were interviewed in 1986. 147 IV drug users recruited off the street for HIV antibody testing were interviewed in 1987; 75 were in drug treatment, 72 were not. Comparisons were made in terms of whether members of each of the 3 groups were injecting in high-risk ways (sharing injection equipment, using potentially contaminated equipment, or injecting in shooting galleries); injecting, but not in any of these high-risk ways (\"safer\" injecting); or no longer injecting. Change was determined by comparing responses for the most recent period and for the preceding 2 year period. Results. Non-treatment street subjects were significantly more likely to be injecting at each time period than was true for either treatment sample (p<.05). Among non-treatment street users, few (7%) injectors became non-injectors, but 50% became \"safer\" injectors. When the behavior of subjects who were high risk injectors at time 1 is examined, those in the non-treatment street sample were significantly more likely to be \"safer\" injectors at time 2 than those in the MMTP sample (p<.05). MMTP subjects who were high risk injectors at time 1 were significantly more likely to be non-injectors at time 2 than subjects in either of the other groups. Conclusions. 1. Since subjects' behaviors differ by source of recruitment, this should be taken into account in designing studies of AIDS among IV drug users. 2. Among IV drug users who are unable or unwilling to enter treatment, \"safer\" injection practices are a feasible goal. 8014 HIV INFECTION IN INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS IN NEW YORK CITY:THE RELATION OF DRUG USE AND HETEROSEXUAL BEHAVIORS AND RACE/ETHNICITY Ellie E Schoenbaum*, PA Selwyn*, D Hartel*, GH Friedland* *Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York, USA Objective. To examine the relation of HIV antibody(Ab) to drug use and heterosexual behaviors in Black, Hispanic and White intravenous drug users (IVDUs). Method. During 6/85-4/86 452 IVDUs in a methadone treatment program in New York City were tested for HIV Ab and interviewed about drug use and sexual behaviors for the period starting 1/78. Factor analysis was performed on inter-correlated drug use variables to derive independent profiles. Association with HIV Ab for drug use and sex variables was determined by logistic regression. Results.HIV Ab was present in 35%(160/452).The prevalence was higher in Blacks(44%,48/110) and Hispanics(42%,92/220) than Whites(16%,20/122) (p.0001) and not different in males(37,87/233) and females(33%,73/219). Factor analysis revealed three independent drug use profiles: sharing needles with strangers in shooting galleries(Gallery Sharing), sharing needles with close Friends and relatives (Social Sharing) and high number of average injections/mo. (Heavy Using). Gallery Sharing and Heavy Using were associated with HIV Ab(p<.0007 and p<.05, respectively and not Social Sharing (p>.05). Gallery Sharing was associated with Black and Hispanic race/ethnicity (p<.05) and Social Sharing was associated with White race (p<.05). Heavy Using distributed equally among race-ethnicities. Year of last injection was associated with HIV Ab (p<.03) and Whites stopped using needles earlier in the AIDS epidemic than Blacks or Hispanics (p(.05). Number of IVDU and paying sex partners were associated with HIV Ab in females only(p=.05 and p<.005, respectively). When analyzed with drug behaviors, number of IVDU sex partners retained significance only in IVDUs who stopped injecting before 1983 and IVDUs with low average injections/mo. Whites reported more IVDU partners since 1978 than Blacks and Hispanics (p(.05). Conclusion. Differences in dru$ use and heterosexual behaviors among Blacks, Hispanics and Whites contribute to the excess risk of HIV Ab in non-White IVDUs. Culturally sensitive AIDS prevention strategies are indicated to address high risk drug use and heterosexual behaviors. Notes: 8015 THE RANGE OF SEXUAL BEHAVIORS INTRAVENOUS ABUSERS J Primm*, LS Brown Jr.*, Gibson*, A Chu* *Addiction Research and Treatment Corporation, Brooklyn, New York OF BS Objective. To determine the range of sexual behaviors of IVDAs and the potential these behaviors offer for the sexual transmission of HIV infection. Methods. During the Fall of 1986, 100 IVDAs were recruited to anonymously complete a standardized questionnaire of their sexual behaviors during two time periods: 1977-1985 and 1985-1986. Results. These 100 IVDAs admitted to 767 and 378 sex partners, respectively between the 1977-1985 and 1985-1986 time periods. Sixty percent of these sex partners were non-IVDAs. In both time periods, males were more likely than females to have a sex partner who was not a parenteral drug user. Condoms were used an average of 35% of the time by the 5% of the study subjects who reported condom use. No differences between the two time periods were appreciated in the propensity to have a non-IVDA sex partner or in frequency of condom use. Conclusion. The sexual activity, the considerable number of non-IVDA sex partners, and the low frequency of condom use suggest why this study population represents a significant vehicle for sexually transmitted HIV infection. 8016 IMMUNE ABNORMALITIES IN STREET INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS. N.Klimas*+, B.Page*, M.Ashman*, M.Fletcher*. *University Center for the Biopsychosocial Study of AIDS, +Veterans Administration Medical Center, Miami, FL Objective: To determine immunologic parameters in South Florida active street IV drug abusers (IVDA). Methods: Blood samples from 171 consecutive IVDA for anti-HIV, lymphocyte subsets, immunoglobulin (Ig) function in both T cell subset distribution and in lymphocyte function, with particular depression of PWM response and NK cell toxicity (despite normal numbers of NK cells). The HIV- population showed a suprising degree of immune dysfunction. One third of the seronegatives displayed a significant depression of NK cell activity, despite an elevated % of effector cells. PWM response was also depressed. These abnormalities may affect disease susceptability and progression, a focus of ongoing investigation. 452 [Page 453](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/451) 8017 HIV-ANTIBODY PREVALENCE, HIV SEROCONVERSION RATE AND MORTALITY RATE IN A GROUP OF IV. DRUG USERS. Christian Schlberg, Georg Petersen, Oslo Board of Health Norway, Jan Ulstrup,UllevAl Hospital, Oslo. OBJECTIVES From Aug. 1985 to Jan. 1988 we tested 600 IV. drug users for HIV-antibodies. The sero-prevalence in this sample will be presented as well as the sero-conversion rate among retested individuals. A comparison of the mortality rate in seropositive and seronegative IV. drug users will also be presented. The objective is to test whether known seropositivity is associated with a higher rate of nonHIV related death than known seronegativity in this group. METHODS The 600 IV. drug users tested represent between 1/3 and 1/5 of the IV drug population in Oslo. All individuals who seek the clinic for testing and retesting are recruited voluntarily. All informations regarding death and couses of death are based on statistics obtained from The National Institute of Statistics. RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS Results, statistics and conclusions will be presented. 8018 MULTIPLE INCIDENT COHORT STUDY ON I.V. DRUG ADDICTS AND HIV INFECTION AIDS (NIH) and Dpt. of Social Medicine (Ministry Health),Roma,Italy Objective. To describe the natural history of HIV infection in i.-v drug abusers(d.a.) after seroconversion,and to evaluate risk factors associated with the disease progression. Methods. A multiple cohort study has been con ducted to follow d.a. for whom the seroconver sion period was identified(availability of a negative test preceding the positive confirmed one).Clinical evaluation was performed each 6 months.Data collection on demographic and beha vioural features,laboratory and clinical fin dings was made by means of individual case reports.The disease progression was analized according to estimations based on survival curves (Kaplan-Meier). Results. 150 subjects fullfilling criteria were enrolled.Male/female ratio was 3:l;mean age was 26 years for the males(19-37) and 24 for the females(18-34).All the subjects were positive for any marker of hepatitis B.The period of follow-up until January 15,1988 was 12.5 monthperson.Prospective follow-up is in progress. Notes: 8019 ITALIAN PSYCHO-SOCIAL INVENTORY ON HIV+ DRUG ADDICTS Di Giannantonio M., Di Giulio C., Antonucci G., Weisert A., Faccenda A., and Tempesta E. Drug Addiction Unit, Institut of Psychiatry, Catholic University, Rome, Italy Objective: Inquiry on the psycho-social and behavioural characteristics of an Italian drug addicted population after the HIV-infection epidemic. Methods: We created a specific questionnaire with 62 items capable to investigate some crucial areas in addiction behaviour: 1) addictive substances; 2) needle sharing; 3) sexual behaviour; 4) medical conditions; 5) subjective evaluation of AIDS-related risks; 6) source of medical and general information; 7) change of habits. Results: 1) all patients were polydrug abusers, both I.V. and oral utilized; 2) 85,7% of the HIV+ and 58,4% of the HIV- drug addicts were needle sharers; 3) no significant differences about sexual behaviour of both HIV+ or HIV- populations; 4) 55,7% of the HIV+ and 51,2% of the HIV- drug addicts were infected previously by HBV; 5) no significantly different consciousness of infection possibility in both HIV+ or HIV- groups; 6) most information taken by mass-media; 7) it is remarkable that both populations declared more frequently modifications into the addiction patterns and not into sexual behaviour and that HIV+ patients affirmed oftener changes of habits than HIV- patients. Conclusions: - most of patients were infected at the beginning of HIV-spread - the patients tested had averagely 8,6 years of addiction and that is connected to the incapacity to change their pathological condition - the infection was mostly transmitted by sharing of needles - Italian Public Policies were not successful to prevent HIV-spread. 8020 INFECTION WITH HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) AMONG INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS (IVDUs) IN THE U.S., Robert A. Hahn, I.M. Onorato, T.S. Jones, J. Dougherty, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga., U.S.A., NIDA, Rockville, Md., U.S.A. Objective: To estimate HIV seroprevalence among intravenous drug users in the United States. Methods: In October and November of 1987, the CDC gathered all available data from published and unpublished HIV seroprevalence surveys conducted in IVDU treatment programs. We estimated the numbers of IVDUs in the U.S. population infected with HIV, based on assumptions about the characteristics of IVDUs. Results: Rates of infection among IVDUs in treatment were significantly higher among blacks and Hispanics than among whites, and varied widely in different parts of the country. Seroprevalence was generally high in Northeastern cities (10-65%), with higher rates closer to New York City; highest seroprevalence was found in New York City (50-65%) and Puerto Rico (45-58%). In the rest of the country, while several cities (Atlanta, San Francisco, Detroit, Denver, Los Angeles, and Miami) reported rates of infection between 5 and 10%, many areas (Ohio, New Orleans, Dallas, Albuquerque, and Tacoma) reported rates of 1-2%, and some (St. Louis, Cheyenne) found no cases of infection. Cohort studies indicate an annual rate of HIV seroconversion among IVDUs in treatment of between 0 and 21%. Estimates of currently infected IVDUs in the U.S. ranged from 61,000 to 398,000 (from 5 to 31% of the IVDU population). Conclusion: The high rates of HIV infection among IVDUs in the Northeast and among minority IVDUs, and the possibility of further spread to IVDU and other populations, indicate an urgent need for innovative programs to reduce the further spread of HIV infection. 453 [Page 454](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/452) 8021 MORPHINE-INDUCED MODULATION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTIE: Prince K. Arora*, E. Fride*, Neuroscience, NIDDK, **Comparative Pathology Section, DRS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A. Objective. To investigate the effect of opiates on immune functions that are related to the cellular abnormalities present in AIDS. Methods. B10.BR mice were implanted subcutaneously with a single 75 mg morphine pellet. At different time points, the immune organs (spleen, thymus, lymph node and bone marrow) were examined for size, weight and viable cell number. These organs were also examined for histopathology. Cells from these organs were stained with fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by flow cytofluorometry. Results. There was marked atrophy of spleen, thymus, lymph node and bone marrow. Lymphocyte populations in these organs as well as in the peripheral blood were markedly reduced. Flow cytofluorometric analysis of spleen cells indicated changes in T/B cell ratio. Among the T-lymphocyte subpopulation, there were changes in Th/Ts cell ratio. These alterations in the immune system were observed within 24 hr following implantation of the pellet. Maximum effects of morphine were observed at 48 hr. These organs recovered completely: bone marrow within 3 days; spleen within 10-14 days; and thymus within 15-20 days. Conclusion. Opiate(s)-induced degeneration of immune competence may be a predisposing factor to the higher incidence of AIDS in intravenous drug abusers. 8022 AIDS AND LESBIANS: IV-DRUG USE IS THE RISK D. Peter Drotman, Mitzi A. Mays Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, USA Objective. To compare the epidemiology of AIDS in lesbian and bisexual women with AIDS in heterosexual women in the United States. Methods. All AIDS patients reported to the Centers for Disease Control by January 6, 1988, were reviewed for information regarding sex, sexual orientation, route of presumed exposure to HIV, state of residence at onset of illness, age, race or ethnicity, and vital status. Results. Of the 3653 women with AIDS, sexual orientation could be determined for 3233 (89%). Of these, heterosexuals accounted for 3164 were lesbians; and 42 (1%) were bisexual. Lesbians with AIDS were more likely to reside in New York, New Jersey, or Florida than heterosexual women with AIDS (85% versus 67%, p = 0.043). The mean age for each group was 35 years, and both had similar racial/ethic distributions (about 29% white, 52% black, and 18% hispanic). Almost equal proportions of lesbian and heterosexual women had died (59% and 56%, respectively). However, lesbian and bisexual women were more likely to be IV-drug users (74% and 83%, respectively) than heterosexual or other women (51% and 43%, respectively). The other risk factors for lesbian AIDS patients were transfusions and immigration from a Caribbean or African nation of high AIDS incidence (3 cases [11%] each); or not determined (1 case [4%]). IV-drug use is significantly more frequently reported as the mode of transmission in lesbian than heterosexual women with AIDS (p = 0.016). Heterosexual transmission was reported in 27% of the heterosexual women and 12% of the bisexual women. Conclusion. Lesbians are at risk for AIDS mainly through IV-drug use. Notes: 8023 THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF AIDS RISK BEHAVIOR AMONG INTRAVENOUS DRUG USING LESBIANS IN SAN FRANCISCO Patricia Case* **, M Downing*, B Fergusson*, J *Lesbian AIDS Project **Urban Health'Study Qbective. To investigate the social context of AIDS risk behavior among lesbian intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in San Francisco. Methods. Using ethnographic methods, behavioral, demographic, and HIV serology were obtained from a sample of lesbian IVDUs between 1987-1988. Both qualitative and quantitative measures were used. Results. Specific sub-groups of lesbian IVDUs within this population have been identified, such as lesbian prostitutes, ethnic minorities, and the occasional IV user or \"weekend warrior\". Result include data on needle-sharing behavior, social networks, sexual risk activity previously implicated in woman-to-woman sexual transmission (such as sex during menstruation), sexual risk behavior such as sadomasochism that takes place in the context of injection of methamphetamine, HIV serology, and practices and beliefs specific to lesbian IVDUs. Data are compared to heterosexual San Francisco IVDUs in terms of AIDS knowledge, AIDS risk behavior and HIV seroprevalence rates. Directions for further research will be discussed. Conclusion. Despite a low perceived risk within various sub-groups of lesbian 1VDUs, high risk sexual and drug using activities occur, placing this population at risk for HIV infection. Appropriate safer sex and needle hygiene educational efforts should be tailored to lesbian IVDUs as a specific population. 8024 ALCOHOL AND THE ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME IN INTRAVENOUS DRUG ADDICTS. G. Lake-Bakaar, M.D, Neelam Gupta, M.D., S. Beidas, M.D., Eugene W. Straus, M.D. SUNY-Health Science Center at Brooklyn, New York. Alcohol and the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) are both toxic to T-cells. Alcohol might thus exacerbate HIV disease. We therefore compared lifetime alcohol consumption in intravenous drug addicts, (IVDA), with and without AIDS. A total of 78 IVDA, aged 24 to 60 years, 26 F, were prospectively studied. Nineteen of these, 6 F, had been diagnosed as suffering from AIDS. A short questionnaire and interview detailed their drug and alcohol histories. Reliability of response was validated by repeat random interviews. Alcohol abuse predated or coincided with drug abuse in all but four subjects. Thirty of 60 (50%) non-AIDS IVDA subjects admitted to moderate or heavy drinking compared to 11 of 14 (58%) IVDA subjects with AIDS. Twenty six of 54 (48%) non-AIDS IVDA subjects drank in excess of 80g of alcohol daily, 12 (22%) between 40g and 80g and 16 (30%) less than 40g daily. Of 19 AIDS IVDA subjects, 10 (53%) drank over 80g daily, 3 (10%) between 40g and 80g and 6 (32%) less than 40g daily. These differences, are not statistically significant. Alcohol does not play a significant role in HIV disease progression. 454 [Page 455](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/453) 8025 NATURAL HISTORY OF HIV INFECTIOiN E. (I).

T. Blaney, N. G. Klimas, M. A. Fletcher, and R. 0. Morgan, Center for the Biopsychosocial Study of AIDS, University of Miami, Miami, FL Objective. To describe the relationship of immune function to mood state and social support in an AIDS risk group, IV drug abusers. Methods. Both HIV- and HIV+ IV drug abusers from a Veterans Administration outpatient methadone treatment program are being studied longitudinally to determine the influence of immune dysfunction, psychosocial status and behavioral risk on immunocompetence and the course of HIV infection. The assessment battery includes mood states and social support as well as immune function parameters. Results. The mood states of vigor and fatigue (from the Profile of Mood States), and Loneliness were associated with immune function. Specifically, fatigue appeared to be immunosuppressive regarding lymphocyte, B cell and T8 cell numbers; vigor appeared to enhance immune function (associated with interteukin-2). Loneliness was associated with diminished T4 cell and lymphocyte numbers, as well as with T8 cell number and abnormal NK cell activity. In addition, several social support variables were associated with immune function parameters (T4 cell and lymphocyte numbers, and interleukin-2), a particularly interesting finding given the dearth of immunologic research on social support. Conclusion. These preliminary findings suggest that mood state and social support are associated with immune function in an AIDS risk group, and thus may possibly influence the course of HIV infection. Notes: 8027 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF BACTERIAL ENDOCARDITIS in HIV(+) and HIV (-) INRTRAVENOUS DRUG ABUSERS. J. Slim, J. Boghossian, G. Perez, E. Johnson, St. Michael's Medical Center, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.A. Objective: To comoare the outcome of Endocarditis in HIV (+) and HIV (-) Intravenous Drug Abusers. Method: Retrosnective chart review of 50 enisodes of bacterial Endocarditis was conducted. Twenty five enisodes in HIV (+) and 25 eoisodes in HIV (-) natients were evaluated for: Age, sex, oroanism, Echocardioaram, Valve (s) involved, Morbidity, Mortality and Surcical Intervention. Results: The mean aoes and sex breakdown were similar in both grouns. Stanhlococcus aureus was the etiolocical aaent in 72% of HIV (+) enisodes and 59% HIV (-) enisodes. Valve involvement by echocardioaranhv revealed: Tricusnide involvement in 52% HIV (+) natients and 54% HIV (-) natients; mitral valve was involved in 40% of HIV (+) and 65%- of HIV (-) natients. More than one valve was involved in 2 HIV (+) and 7 HIV (-) natients. Major nerinheral emboli occurred in 5 HIV (+) natients and 2 HIV (-) Datients. Pulmonary emboli occurred in R HIV (+), but only 3 HIV (-) natients. Mortality resulted in 6 HIV (+) and 1 HIV (-) natients. None of the mortalities in the HIV (+) aroun was due to an onnortunistic infection. Imnortantly, 4 of the HIV (-) natients had vascular suraery as comnared to none of the FIV (+) individuals. Conclusion: Both morbidity and mortality were creater in the HIV (+) oatients. The severity of the immunoloaical ysfunction, more freauent embolization, less aggressive surcical intervention the nredominant ifferences, Mortaliy in the HIV (+) aroun was not related to oroanism, valvular involvement or onnortunistic infection, 8028 Changing Patterns of Infectious Endocarditis (IE) in Parenteral Drug Abusers (PDA) with S.S. SATHE, M.D.; KAPILA, M.D., Division of Infectious Diseases, UMDNJ-New Jersey Cedical School, Newark, New Jersey USA 32j cases of IE in PDA with HIV infection were prospectively followed from January 1, 1987 to January 1, 1988 at University Hospital, Newark, New Jersey. Of the 32 cases, 5 had asymptomatic HIV infection and 27 had AIDS Related Complex (ARC). All 32 had chills, multiple positive blood cultures, heart murmur, embolic lesions and positive echocardiogram showing vegetations in 15 of the 32 cases. Significant differences in clinical and laboratory parameters were seen in 32 patients with HIV positive IE compared to 33 patients with CIV negative IE with similar clinical backgrounds. These included: 1. diversity of unusual pathogens such as E. corrodens(l), B. cereus(l), E. cloacae(l), S. pneumoniae (1), and Methicillin-resistant Staphyloccoccus aureus(3). 2. prolonged duration of fever with a mean average of 11.5 days in HIV positive patients with IE compared to 5.5 days in HIV negative IE. 3. persistent bacteremia with a mean average of 9.26 days despite adequate antimicrobial therapy in 12 of the 32 cases(37%). 4. poly-- bacteremia in 4 of the 32 cases(12.5%). 5. higher rate of embolic abscesses including myocardial abscesses in 3 of the 32 patients resulting in death in all 3 patients. 6. increased mortality in 12 of the 32 patients associated with persistent infection. 7. significant reduction in T4/T8 ratio with a mean average of.42 in HIV positive IE compared to normal ratios in HIV negative IE. We conclude that IE in patients with HIV infection is associated with higher morbidity and mortality related to persistence of infection inspite of adequate therapy. 455 [Page 456](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/454) 8029 HIV-1 RELATED SYNDROMES IN INTRAVENOUS FOLLOW-UP AM Pesce, I Mezzaroma, F Aiuti Dpt of Allergy and Clin Immunology - University of Rome \"La Sapienza\", Rome, Italy Objective To study the clinical evolution of HIV-1 infected intravenous drug addicts (IVDA), with the main purpo se to identify immunological parameters as prognostic ele ments. Methods 161 selected IVDA were admitted at a two year follow up study to evaluate clinical evolution according to CDC classification and to find immunological alterations as prognostic elements. Results After 24 months the 35% of IVDA had a IV,C2). A decrease of CD3+ T cells was observed in worsened patients (p<.02), as well as CD4+ T cells (p<.O01). In additi on skin responses were depressed in all the clinically evoluted patients. Conclusions Evaluation of CD4+ cell decrease seems to be relevant as a prognostic parameter and in addition skin tests can be a consistent diagnostic support in IVDA. In fact reclassified IVDA HIV-1 pos patients expressed a precocious and constant alteration of the immunological balance. It can be concluded that a prognosis may be evaluated when CD4+ cell abs number and skin tests are applied during the course of the disease. 8030 FREQUENCY OF CLINICAL SYMPTOMS IN IMPRISONED DRUG ADDICTS P. ESPINOZA, I. BOUCHARD, J. POLO DEVOTO THE FRESNES HOSPITAL - PARIS - FRANCE The aim of our study is to determine the frequency of the various clinical symptoms of the HIV infection in drug addicts entering prison for these patients. The prison of Fresnes, receives 8000 prisoners a year. The number of drug addicts admitting to the use of drugs upon arrival represents 18% of the prison population: 1700 in 87. The growth rate in the number of drug addicts between 82 and 87 amounted to 350%, this broke down into 2/3rds IV drugs addicts and 1/3rd sniffers. From june 86 to april 87 we received 385 drug addicts (340 IV - 45 sniffers) in consultation. The doctor individually informed the patients on the risk of sharing syringes, the prevention methods, the questioning being terminated by a clinical examination (hepatic complications, evidence of HIV infection). Biological examinations are prescribed in function of the clinical findings and with the consent of the patients. A biological evaluation was carried out in 68% of cases. 10% refused the tests, 22% were freed or transferred to another establishment. The prevalence of HIV seropositivity represented 53% of the IV drug addicts (130/243) and 13% of the sniffers (3/22) (occasional use of syringes or sexual contamination). Amongst the 133 seropositive patients, the examination showed isolated polyadenopathies in 10% of cases. These were associated with other symptoms in 24% of cases (thrombopenea, diarrhea, sweating). Only 20% of the drug user population was seen. Notes: 8031 ADENOSINE DEAMINASE (ADA) VALUES IN DRUG ADDICTS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF AIDS Claudio Casoli*,G.Magnani**,F.Fiaccadori**,I.Scovassi***, U.Bertazzoni***,R.Starcich* Evoluzionistica del CNR,Pavia, Italy Objective. To assess the utilization of the ADA as diagnostic and prognostic marker in HIV-I serum-positive subjects. Methods. Measurement of ADA enzymatic activity in erythrocytes of 93 patients with history of drug abuse. One unit of enzyme activity is Inmol of inosine formed in 1 min. Results. The ADA activities were significantly higher (p<.05) in asymptomatic HIV-I-seru-positive individuals (12 cases,13.4 U~1.2) groups of patients (LAS,54 cases,28.3U~ll.6; ARC,10 cases,29.1U~3.2) than those found in controls (30 cases,9.5U~1.8) and in HIV-I-serum-negative subjects (10 cases,l0.1U+~.2). In AIDS patients (7 cases) the mean ADA activity was of 34.6U~6.8. The ADA marker remained constant over a period of a year in patients at different stages of AIDS. LAS subjects who discontinued drug abuse presented ADA values (median=13.4U) that are lower than for addicts (median=30.5). Conclusions. The ADA values are significantly higher in HIV-I-serumpositive individuals and show a tendency to increase with the progression of the disease. Two distinct subsets of ADA values are observed in the LAS group,falling below and above the cut-off line of 15U/10 erythrocytes,and subjects with elevated ADA activities present higher probability of developing AIDS. 8032 HIV-1 INFECTION IN ITALY: SEROPOSITIVITY AND AIDS RELATED SYNDROMES G Luzi (*), D Greco (~), H Sasse (~), G Rezza (\"), F Aiuti (*). - (*) Dpt Allergy and Clin Immunology Univ Rome \"La Sapienza\"; (~) Nat Inst of Health - Rome; (\") The National Min of Health - Rome Objective This is the first national effort to establish a picture of the HIV-1 spread in Italy. A retrospective study on 52900 individuals tested in 177 Med Centres has been performed to provide knowledge on seropositives and HIV-1 related syndromes during the period thoughout Sept 1985-March 1987. Methods Each Centre was sent a questionnaire which included a series of data about clinical and serological obsepvations of at risk categories. Asymptomatic individuals, PGL and ARC were included in the classification of seropositives. Results 47.9% of the seropositive individuals had clinical symptoms and 9.8% of them presented ARC. The AIDS cases present a good correlation with the distribution of serpos subjects (rS=.74; p(.05); furthermore the regional geographic distribution of seropositives and AIDS cases have a strong correlation (r,=.93; p(.Ol). The intravenous drug abusers represent about 60% of the Italian AIDS cases. Symptomatic cases are more frequently found in the North of Italy. Conclusion This study confirms the spread of HIV-1 among Italian IV drug addicts and reveals the unexpected observation that 47% HIV-1+ individuals K.A. Muirhead, A.L. Landay* & P.K. Horan. Smith Kline & French Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA and *Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, IL USA Objective: develop a method for lymphocyte subset monitoring applicable to small (e.g. fingerstick) specimens and/or severely lymphopenic patients. Methods: the method of Horan et al. (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 8361, 1986) was adapted to lysed whole blood samples and monoclonal cocktail composition optimized for accuracy of CD4 lymphocyte frequencies of CD3+4+, determined by dual in one laboratory (A.L.L.) and by 5-part immunodifferential in a second (K.A.M.) gave excellent agreement in single-blind studies on healthy and HIVinfected individuals. 100 pl of whole blood sufficed for 5-part immunodifferential staining in individuals with lymphocyte count >103/mm3, and discrete staining patterns were maintained even in patients with <1% CD4+ or CD19/20+ lymphocytes (see figure). Healthy control AIDS IN INTRAVENOUS DRUG ABUSERS Santosh K. Chaturvedi* M.D. * Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore-560 029, India. Objective: To study the perception of risk of AIDS in patients who abuse intravenous drugs. Methods: A semi-structured proforma was devised to tap information pertaining to the perception of risk of AIDS in a group of intravenous drug abusers. The proforma also inquired about their knowledge, attitudes towards AIDS and how it has affected their drug abuse pattern. Results: The intravenous drug abusers were found to have adequate information about AIDS, but were ignorant about the risk of AIDS by heterosexual transmission. They employed precautionary methods on their ownlike, use of disposable syringes, and avoiding sharing syringes and needles. Conclusions: The intravenous drug abusers are at high risk to contract Aids, not primarily due to sharing of syringes and needles or homosexual contact, but due to indiscreet heterosexual activity. Drug abusers should be regularly educated about risk of AIDS by different routes and methods to prevent them.

Objective: To describe geographically the spread of the HIV epidemic among the intravenous drug abusers (IVDA) in the Stockholm area. Methods: Since November 1987 the detained at the central prison in Stockholm, who agree to participate in an HIV study, are asked where geographically they take their drugs. The number of participants are approximately 100 per month. The study is still running. Results: Will be presented at the conference. We will show where in Stockholm the various IVDA (mainly amphetamine and heroin abusers) dwell, and where the HIV-pos abusers are most abundant in order to map risk-prone areas. Robert Olin, Kerstin Kall Department of Social Medicine, Karolinska Institute/Kronan District Health Centre, 172 83 Sundbyberg, Sweden. Objective: To describe the HIV status and risk behaviour among imprisoned intravenous drug abusers (IVDA) in Stockholm. Methods: In 1987 539 IVDA detained at the central prison in Stockholm participated, voluntarily in a study of HIV status and risks inherent in their sharing of syringes etc. and their sexual behaviour. Results: The overall seropositve rate was 15 per cent, ranging from 4.2 per cent among 334 users of amphetamine, 12.2 per cent among 123 using multiple drugs, and 63.4 per cent among 82 IVDA of heroin. As 350 had previous negative HIV test results - two of them have seroconverted now - the present incidence of seroconversion is calculated to be 1 per cent per year. Conclusion: Several explanations to this window will be disCussed at the conference. Concerning the future of the HIV epidemic among IVDA in Sweden there is no reason to relax since the dangers of sharing syringes etc, and of their sexual behaviour - anal sex, many partners and rare use of condoms - are still prevalent within subgroups. 457 [Page 458](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/456) 8037 ADOLESCENT AIDS IN NEW YORK CITY SEXUAL & DRUGRELATED compare cumulative prevalence patterns of NYC adolescent (adol.) AIDS cases to other age groups in NYC and the rest of US. Methods: Surveillance data from the CDC and the NYC Dept. of Health (1979-1987) were used to compare NYC adol. cases to US adol. and others by sex and risk behaviors. Calculations include: 1) doubling times in months for log cumulative prevalence. 2) % drug & sex-related AIDS (D&S), excluding cases with unknown risk. 3) male:female (M:F) ratios by age. Results: Doubling time for adol. AIDS is 10.9 mos in NYC and 9.5 mos in the US excluding NYC. NYC adolescent cases are more likely to have D&S than adol. from the rest of US. AGE | CASES % D&S M:F yrs | NYC US NYC US NYC US 0-12 | 250 557 -- -- 0.8 1.2 13-21 I 111 503 88 * 77 3.0 7.4 >21 111143 39378 99 96 7.1 15.2 *p<0.02) Conclusion: Despite the small number of NYC adol. AIDS cases to date, the rapid doubling time, proportionately high D&S risk in NYC, & comparatively low M:F ratio indicate the importance of behaviorally-related risk in NYC youth. 8038 DEMOGRAPHIC AND SEXUAL TRANSMISSION DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ADOLESCENT AND ADULT AIDS PATIENTS, U.S.A. H Gayle*, M Rogers*, S Manoff*, E Starcher* *Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To determine differences in demographic features and modes of sexual transmission of HIV in adolescents and adults with AIDS in the United States. Methods. We compared demographic and transmission features of adolescent (13-21 years old) with AIDS to those of adult (>21 years old) with AIDS reported to CDC. Results. One percent (614) of all reported U.S. AIDS patients were 13-21 years old. A greater proportion of adolescents than adults were female (14% vs. 7%), black and Hispanic (53% vs. 38%) and had acquired AIDS through heterosexual contact (9% vs. 4%). Homosexual/bisexual males (49% vs. 65%) accounted for a smaller proportion of adolescents than adults. When stratified by sex and race, greater differences were found between adolescents and adults for females, blacks, and whites as follows: females (heterosexual contact, 48% vs. 29%); blacks vs. 1%; homosexual/bisexual males, 51% vs. 80%). All the comparisons were significant (p<.001) using the chi square test. Conclusion. Although adolescents currently compose only 1% of AIDS patients, given high rates of other sexually transmitted diseases, they are potentially at high risk for HIV infection. The findings of demographic and transmission differences can be useful to focus prevention and education interventions in the adolescent population. Notes: 8039 IMPROVING TEENAGERS' KNOWLEDGE OF AIDS - THE NEED TO GET \"STREETWISE\" Pamela A. Gillies and Ann Stork Department of Community Medicine & Epidemiology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2UH, U.K. Objective: Evaluate the impact of an AIDS education comic on the knowledge, attitudes and behavioural intentions of 14 year old school pupils. Methods: A controlled trial of the 'Streetwise' comic involved two pairs of matched experimental and control schools in Nottingham with 122 and 162 pupils in each group respectively. Data were collected by a confidential self-completed questionnaire administered prior to the intervention and again two weeks later. Results: Pupils who took part in the project had increased knowledge levels post-test, relative to the control group. No differences between groups were recorded at pre-test (x scores = 32.5 and 32.9). Mean knowledge levels at post-test GROUP N Post-test SD t df P x score (paired) Experimental 107 37.8 5.2 5.56 226 p<O.001 Control 121 33.3 6.6 (max. knowledge score = 37) Knowledge was gained in 4 key areas: 1) it is safe to give blood and receive blood transfusions in developed countries, 2) the condom offers protection against AIDS transmission, 3) using/sharing needles increases the risk of AIDS transmission, 4) T cells protect the body against disease and the AIDS virus destroys their function. The materials had a small impact upon attitudes and behavioural intentions. Conclusion: The 'Streetwise' AIDS education comic can significantly improve knowledge and understanding of AIDS transmission in teenagers. 8040 BLACK AND WHITE AMERICAN \"TEENAGERS\" BELIEFS ABOUT THE CAUSE AND PREVENTION OF AIDS Mary K. Kirkpatrick, RN, Ed.D. and Gaye Poteet RN, Ed.D. East Carolina University School of Nursing, Greenville, North Carolina, U.S.A. Objectives: 1) To compare the attitudes, beliefs, locus of control, and knowledge level of American teenagers re: AIDS and 2) To develop an AIDS model educational prevention program for teenagers. Methods: 30 subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental and control group. Kosko's 43 item attitude/ belief questionnaire, Metropolitan Life's 55 item Knowledge and Assessment Test, and Wallston's Locus of Control scales and demographic data questionnaires were administered in a pre-post test design to assess and to evaluate the effectiveness of six weeks educational, values clarification program on the prevention of AIDS. Written consents were secured from parents and students to participate in the study on a voluntary basis. Descriptive statistics were used. Differences in groups were analyzed by t-test, one way ANOVA. Correlational statistics were used to analyze relationships. Results: There are significant differences and correlationals in beliefs/attitudes and knowledge among teenagers. Conclusions: Programs are needed to clarify myths and misconceptions. Model programs need to be tested. 458 [Page 459](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/457) 0441 PERCEPTIONS OF SUSCEPTIBILITY TO AIDS AMONG ADOLESCENTS Dolcini,P., Adler, N., Irwin, C., Millstein, S., Kegeles, S., Cohn, L., & Stone, G. Departments of Psychiatry & Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco OBJECTIVE. This study examined a) the relationship between adolescent sexual behavior and perceptions of susceptibility to AIDS, and b) ethnic differences in perceived susceptibility. METHODS. Survey data were collected in San Francisco schools from 1464 students (ages 10-17) in 1986. RESULTS. Subjects reported perceptions of low susceptibility to AIDS regardless of age (M=1.36, sd=.80, scale range 1-7). Adolescents who a) were sexually active, b) had engaged in sexual intercourse with someone they didn't know well, or c) had engaged in unprotected intercourse did not perceive themselves to be at any greater risk for AIDS than those who had not engaged in these behaviors. A three way ANOVA (ethnicity x gender x school[middle school vs high school]) revealed main effects for gender (p<.001) and ethnicity (p=.03) and a gender by ethnicity interaction (p(.001). Perceptions of susceptibility were highest among white females and lowest among black males and hispanic females. CONCLUSIONS. Adolescents engaging in activities that may place them at risk for transmission of the HIV virus do not perceive themselves as more susceptible to AIDS than those who are not engaging in these behaviors. Gender differences in perceptions of susceptibility vary by ethnic group membership. Racial group differences in perceptions of susceptibility do not reflect the increased risk of HIV transmission for black and hispanic (relative to white) communities, suggesting educational efforts focus on susceptibility and be targeted to higher risk ethnic groups. 8042 AIDS-RELATED KNOWLEDGE, BELIEFS, AND BEHAVIORS OF ADOLESCENTS IN THE UNITED STATES Laura Kann, Ph.D.; Gary D. Nelson, Ph.D.; Jack T. Jones; and Lloyd J. Kolbe, Ph.D. Office of School Health and Special Projects, Div'sion of Health Education, Center for Health Promotion & Fdu:ation Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA USA Objectives: To determine the AIDS-related knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors of adolescents in the United States and the relationship between high risk behaviors and their psycho-social determinants. Methods: Surveillance systems were developed in States and cities with a high prevalence of reported AIDS cases throughout the United States. At each site school-based self-administered questionnaires were completed by a minimum of 1000 adolescents ages 13 - 18 during February and March, 1988. The questionnaires covered perceived risk of HIV infection, beliefs toward AIDS education, knowledge of HIV transmission, perceptions of peers' high risk behaivors, IV drug use, sexual activity, age at first intercourse, condom use, and behavior changes made because of the AIDS epidemic. Results: Data from more than 30,000 adolescents are presented by age, sex, race, and site. The knowledge levels beliefs, and frequency with which adolescents practice high risk behaviors are identified. Correlations are drawn between high risk behaviors and the knowledge level and beliefs of adolescents. Analyses identify characteristics of adolescents at risk for HIV infection. Conclusions: From the data analysis conclusions are drawn regarding the focus, scope, and content of school-based AIDS education. Notes: 8043 Risk Behavior for AIDS in Teenagers of Pennsylvania Family Planning Clinics G. Stephen Bowen, L. Magder, S. O. Aral, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA Objectives. To measure the prevalence of AIDS risk behaviors among teenagers seen at family planning clinics in Pennsylvania. Methods. In September and October 1987, 16,631 clients (participation rate 99%) visiting all 39 clinics of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in Pennsylvania completed an anonymous behavioral risk assessment questionnaire for AIDS/HIV infection. Results. Among all teenagers the prevalence of personal IV drug use was 1.4%; teens also had a sex partner(s) who used IV drugs (3.4%), was bisexual (0.6%), had hemophilia (0.14%) or was infected with HIV (.03%). Among all teenagers 8% had a history of 1 or more sexually transmitted diseases (STD); 4.9% had more than 9 sex partners during the last 5 years; 7.7% had 6-9 sex partners and 55.2% had 2-5 sex partners. Among girls aged 12-15 the prevalence of personal IV drug use was 2.9%; 3.3% had a sex partner who used IV drugs, was bisexual (0.5%), or had hemophilia (0.3%). Among girls aged 12-15, 6.0% had a history of STD; 2.7% had more than 10 sex partners; 5.6% had 6-9 sex partners and 46.8% had 2-5 sex partners. Older teenagers had more sex partners and a higher proportion had a history of STD than did younger teenagers but the prevalence of drug using behavior was higher among younger teenagers and the proportion having a sex partner who was an IV drug user was the same. Only 42.2% of girls aged 12-15 had only 0-1 sex partner and no other risk factors vs. 31.1% of women aged 16-19. Conclusion. Teenage girls receiving family planning services including very young ones are engaging in behavior which increases their risk of HIV infection. 3Q44 REACHING ADOLESCENTS THROUGH TEAM TRAINING OF EDUCATORS Shoshana Rosenfeld*, Janet Bath*, Louise Simons**, Cheryl Haug-Simons**, *Massachusetts Department of Public Health, AIDS Program, *kMassachusetts Department of Education. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to describe the effectiveness of an intensive three day training on knowledge and attitudes related to AIDS, as well as the impact on implementation of adolescent AIDS education within school systems throughout Massachusetts. In 1987 the Massachusetts Departments of Public Health and Education trained over 350 professionals frcm 72 school systems across the state. School systems were chosen based on incidence of AIDS in the comnunity as well as experience with camprehensive health education. School superintendents selected teams of five individuals including a school nurse, health educator, acninistrator, classroom teacher, and staff person who works with out of school youth. Experts in the area of sexuality, gay and lesbian youth, substance abuse, and minority issues were consulted and used as trainers. Both didactic and affective educational methods were used to accomplish the following goals: 1. To take steps towards implementing AIDS education in the school systems 2. To increase skill and explore personal fears, feelings, and values related to AIDS education. 3. To increase knowledge of AIDS including medical and public health information. 4. To become familiar with DOE/DPH Teaching Guide on AIDS. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the program consisted of pre and post test questionnaires measuring the change in knowledge and attitude of the 350 participants. Day three of the training consists of a systematic dialogue between trainers and teams to identify status and progress of 1)AIDS education implementation via team approach; 2)adoption of the state teaching guide. All information is documented in a written questionnaire. Preliminary review indicates positive response to team approach, and that barriers to irplementation include politics of power structures and reluctance of carmunities to integrate sexuality education in the schools. 459 [Page 460](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/458) 8045 ORGANIZATION, FUNCTION AND IMPACT OF A UNIVERSITY AIDS COORDINATING COMMITTEE. ROBERT M. SCHMIDT*# Ann Auleb*, Dorith Hertz*, *San Francisco State University, #Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center, San Francisco, CA USA Objective. To integrate HIV/AIDS education into the curricula, to determine and implement university HIV/AIDS policy and to develop resource and counseling programs. Methods. The San Francisco State University (SFSU) AIDS Coordinating Committee was formed in September 1985. Education and prevention strategies include lectures, seminars, workshops, an annual AIDS prevention week, and distribution of condoms and safe sex guidelines. Results. The Committee influenced development of a California State University non-discrimination policy mandated at all 19 campuses. AIDS education has been integrated into courses in eight departments including Black studies, ethnic studies and nursing. Campus newspaper safe sex inserts and numerous articles have been published. An interdisciplinary, graduate level course on AIDS has been offered since 1984. A summer course for high school teachers will be taught in 1988. Conclusion. Effective HIV/AIDS education, prevention and policy guidelines can be implemented on university campuses to communicate information across cultural, faculty/staff/student and other barriers. 8046 AIDS EDUCATION EVALUATION: PROBLEMS AND SUGGESTIONS Mohammad R. Torabi* and William L. Yarber Department of Applied Health Science, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana U.S.A. The purpose of this project is to examine the problems involved in AIDS education evaluation and to provide suggestions for improving evaluations. Evaluation must be an integral component of any public health education in general and AIDS education in specific for many reasons including accountability, identifying the most effective educational methods, and improving the quality of programs. Educators must be aware of the following problems in AIDS education evaluations: (1) Valid and reliable AIDS instruments in measuring affective, cognitive and behavioral domains for different target audiences are lacking; (2) the effect of mass media in providing information as well as misinformation to the public confounds the effect of any specific AIDS education programs; (3) reluctance on the part of Schools and community agencies in participating AIDS education programs cause limitations in randomizing subjects and designing conventional education evaluations. The following suggestions are made: 1. Development of valid and reliable measurement devices by a team of measurement and AIDS experts. 2. Use of Quasi-experimental design with proper statistical analyses such as ANCOVA or split-plot methods. 3. Supplementing quantitative data with qualitative data collected specially by the use of naturalistic inquiry model. It is concluded that experts in educational measurement and evaluation be involved or consulted in designing evaluation, analyzing data and interpreting the findings. Notes: 8047 TEACHING AIDS PREVENTION AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; EVALUATION OF A PROGRAM. Carlo A Perucci*, P Pantano**, M Santoli** *Epidemiology Unit, Latium Region, Rome, Italy **Local Health District 12, Rome, Italy Objective. To test the effectiveness of education programs in preventing HIV infections. Methods. Program: - basic information about AIDS prevention prepared by Epidemiology Unit; - seminars for community physicians to update knowledge; - a panel of high school teachers of 3 high schools, conducted by community physicians; - 2 months educational activity about AIDS prevention among students, run by teachers. Evaluation: - a survey was conducted using a questionnaire aimed to assess knowledge and attitudes of students about AIDS prevention before and after instruction; - study population: 900 students in 3 intervention schools and 900 students in 2 control schools without any intervention. Preliminary results. Higher proportion of correct respons following instruction; no significant differences in control schools. A significant association of levels and changes in knowledge with social class. The major product of this study was a standard curriculum for teaching AIDS prevention in high schools. 8048 AIDS PREVENTION EDUCATION IN THE HIGH SCHOOL: RESULTS FROM A STUDY OF CALIFORNIA, USA ADOLESCENTS Leon McKusick* T. Coates*, K. Babcock** *Center for AIDS Prevention Research, San Francisco, **American Social Health Association Objective: To describe levels of sexual behavior and HIV transmission behavior in a sample of High School students and cite significant psychosocial correlates of behavior risk. Methods: 1,429 Calif. adolescents were surveyed as part of an AIDS High School training in Spring 1987. Sexual behavior, HIV transmission behavior, aspects of health belief, and changes in these variables over a one month period, were assessed via intervention pretest/posttest questionnaire. Results: 23% of the sample (327 of the 1,429) was engaged in sexual activity, 20% (265) performing vaginal or anal intercourse. 13% (187) had obtained a condom, only 3% (3) had shared a hypodermic needle. Of those who had intercourse (265), 47% (123) had used a condom. However, 70% (178) had had unprotected intercourse at least once during the preceding assessment. Agreement with Behavioral Health Guidelines, perceived threat, personal efficacy, and race were correlated to level of risk activity. The educational intervention had a significant but non-remarkable impact upon behavioral and health belief variables. Conclusion: Although high school students in Calif., USA demonstrate high levels of agreement with behavioral health guidelines and many are using condoms in intercourse, some continue to engage in high risk practices. Based on these findings it is possible to describe a profile of the at risk individual with recommendations for health education and adolescent counseling. 460 [Page 461](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/459) A049 CHANGING SEX ATTITUDES USING NEWSPAPERS IN AIDS EDUCATION - A TEACHER'S HANDBOOK ON AIDS Bertil Christensson*, T Diseases, Lund, Sweden **Malm'tidningarnas Skoltjanst, Malmo, Sweden Objective. To describe how teachers, using daily newspaper articles, can discuss AIDS-related problems in the classroom with the aim of changing attitudes towards sex. Methods. The handbook (in Swedish or English) consists of one part with facts on AIDS and a second part with guidelines how to use newspaper articles. Teachers and students are encouraged to make a habit of saving articles about AIDS. A number of general questions are suggested so that the message of the article rather than the details is discussed. It is necessary to critically analyse and question the subject on several occasions to achieve changes in attitudes towards sex. Information from the teacher is not enough. Results. We have used the handbook at several workshops with more than 600 teachers in Sweden. It is our experience that Swedish and American daily newspaper articles about AIDS are generally relevant and accurate. Conclusions. The advantages of using newspaper text, apart from the continuous information provided about AIDS, are: *Students are more motivated to work with up-to-date articles than with other literature, *The students are trained to critically evaluate the source of information they will refer to when they become adults, *Newspaper texts supply messages more than precise knowledge about details, they stimulate thought and the formation of opinions, which must happen before attitudes can be changed, *A sense of democracy is developed as the students participate in public debate. 8050 AIDS EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS: INSTRUCTIONAL PRINCIPLES William L. Yarber*and Mohammad R. Torabi Department of Applied Health Science, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana USA Objective. To suggest instructional principles that will increase the effectiveness of AIDS education in schools. Methods. Research on the most effective approach to school AIDS education in lacking. However, data do exist on adolescent educational programs in other health areas, such as cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, and drug abuse. Some of the successful approaches can be applied to AIDS education, although new approaches are also needed because of the sexual aspect of AIDS. Strategies must also be drawn from social and learning theory. Results. School AIDS education should, for example: (1) provide facts about personal health behaviors -- mainly AIDS virus transmission and prevention -- in contrast to biomedical information, (2) increase acceptance of possible personal vulnerability, (3) increase self-assurance that one can successfully practice prevention, (4) provide rehearsal of social (e.g. communication) and technical (e.g. condum use) skills, (5) encourage positive role models, and (6) stimulate students to change socials norms toward greater acceptance of preventive behavior. Conclusion. Adherence to specific instructional principles dealing with conveying appropriate facts, restructuring attitudes toward being health-conducive, and providing rehearsal of preventive skills will assure greater impact of school AIDS education. Notes: 8051 OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE AIDS EDUCATION IN U.S. SCHOOLS Jack T. Jones*, L Kolbe*, A Lawrence*, L Kann*, L Daily*, C Duncan* *Office of School Health and Special Projects, Division of Health Education, Center for Health Promotion & Education, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, USA Objective. To describe barriers to implementation of AIDS education in schools as identified by national, State and local education agencies, and current efforts designed to overcome them. Methods. During the summer of 1987, 70 national, State and local education organizations and agencies identified major barriers to effective AIDS education. In the fall of 1987, 42 organizations began a variety of individual and collaborative efforts to resolve those barriers as part of cooperative agreements with the Centers for Disease Control. Results. Data obtained from these organizations provided descriptions of 1) commonly perceived barriers to effective AIDS education in schools; 2) factors that influence those barriers at various organizational levels; and, 3) actions proposed at the national, State, and local levels to reduce identified barriers. Conclusions. Barriers to effective AIDS education in schools are influenced by factors amenable to change at various organizational levels. Therefore, organized, complementary efforts by national, State, and local organizations and agencies are required to reduce common barriers. 8052 AIDS PREVENTION FOR ADOLESCENTS IN SCHOOL HJ Walter*, J Michela*, MJ Rotheram*, AA Ehrhardt* *Columbia University/New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies Objective. To describe the development of an AIDS prevention program for New York City area high school students. Methods. This five-year intervention study will develop, implement, and evaluate a cognitivebehavioral prevention program aimed at \"unsafe\" sexual practices and drug use among 10,000 low income black and Hispanic inner city and 500 middle income white suburban 9th grade students. Surveys, interviews, and small group discussions will be conducted to determine current levels of knowledge, beliefs, and skills related to preventing infection with HIV, and frequency of high-risk behaviors. The prevention program will bridge the gaps in information, motivation and skills and attempt to reduce the frequency of high-risk behaviors. Strategies also will be developed to minimize the barriers to the implementation of prevention programs aimed at teenagers. Results. Results to date will be presented. Conclusion. Preliminary data indicate the feasibility and acceptability of AIDS orevention instruction presented to high school students in the classroom. 461 [Page 462](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/460) 8053 AN AIDS EDUCATION CAMPAIGN IN PARIS HIGH SCHOOLS. EVOLUTION OF KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES AND MISCONCEPTIONS France Evaluation an Aids education campaign carried out in 11 Paris High Schools (vocational and classic training) during may 1987. This campaign was the first one among high school students. Methods. A self administred, anonymous, 15' questionnaire was fulfilled before the campaign and two months after it: 2698 students, aged 14 to 20, completed both questionnaires. Results. Before the campaign, most of the students knew the main modes of transmission: 98 %, sexual intercourse, 92 %, sharing needles with a drug user, 81 %, blood transfusion, 80 %, maternal transmission. 86 % knew that condom use during sex protects against AIDS. The campaign assessment relies on three indexes: disease knowledge, transmission and attitudes. Improvment in knowledge and transmission is associated with a decrease in misconceptions. Age, sex, previous sexual experience and vocational vs classic training are related to this improvment. Diminution of segregative attitudes towards an AIDS school-mate is associated with the increase in knowledge. Methodological issues concerning evaluation will be discussed and implications for further campaigns will be drawned. 8054 \"AIDS PROGRAM Object-An introduction about AIDS informations on scholarships between 11 and 15 years old;ade quacy of the didatic material;trainning multi - pliers on each school unit and multiplying the current concepts about AIDS in the paralel population. Methods-3 steps:1)Presenting the program to the school network and selecting the multipliers ( professors and volunteers;2)Trainning the multipliers -lOhs/class and 20hs/discussion on AIDS; introduction of the techinical and social aspects about AIDS;introduction of the theme in the Sciences program;3)Difusion from the multipliers of the acquired AIDS knowledge to the students, school staff,parents and teacher's associations and local societies.

Note: Public Schools in Brazil assist the low socioeconomic class students. Notes: 8055 School-based AIDS Education curricula in Paris area DM JAYLE*, H PICHARD\" *, W DAB* \" Paris** Insight ***Observatoire Regional de Sante Obective To provide information on AIDS to high school students which would enable each individual to evaluate his/her own risks and adapt his/her behavior in a responsible way. To raise awareness of problems linked to seropositivity. 1thods. A preliminary qualitative study was implemented by a communications research firm (Insight) in order to determine adolescents' imrpressions of AIDS and their interpersonal behavior. Teachers and school nurses/doctors who volunteered to be auxiliaries to relay information to students, attended three half-day training sessions at Tarnier Hospital. Particular emphasis was placed on the manners in which the message could be transmitted to the adolescents, how to elicit discussion, and answer questions. Following the training sessions, each auxiliary was given informational pamphlets and a four-minute film which was designed to serve as an \"ice-breaker\" for discussion. The pamphlets and film were conceived by project staff, in collaboration with a representative group of students, film professionals, and Insight. Ten schools were chosen for the evaluation of the campaigns impact. Pre and post tests were used to evaluate cognizance, behavior, and attitudes concerning seropositivity. Results. Of the 2698 students who completed both pre and post tests, 338 did not attend information sessions, thus are considered as our control group. 90% of those responding expressed a desire for information in the classroom, 75% indicated satisfaction with the education sessions, particularly appreciating the discussion format. The evaluation indicated a significant increase in knowledge of HIV prevention and marked decrease of misconceptions and fear of AIDS in everyday life. Loiclu.ton. A collaboration between medical and scholastic institutions could establish a network for the exchange of information. Communicative devices should be aimed at answering youth's questions and get them involved rather than be limited to the simple transfer of knowledge This pilot program, the rirst or 1ts kind In France, is currently being implemented throughout the country 8056 THE STRATEGY OF SEXUAL EDUCATION AND AIDS INFORMATION IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF COPENHAGEN. Merete Lindholm, Bente Hansen Objective. To give an account of the educational work concerning the AIDS problems among teachers + health visitors and pupils. (First presentation) This work relates to 70 primary and lower secondary schools, 15 upper secondary schools and 10 schools for handicapped children, totalling 30.ooo pupils and 3.ooo adults. Methods. To teachers and health visitors: a) 3-day-courses for a total of 250 persons. b) The local teaching staff's discussions about how the individual school will work out its own campaign for AIDS education. To eupils too: c) Development an'd'prioduction of educational material for primary and lower secondary schools. d) Development an production of educational material for upper secondary schools. e) Writing competition for 16-year-old pupils, total 1500, which in October 1987 resulted in publication of an anthology. Results. a) Questionnaire investigation concerning the educational work carried out in the primary and lower secondary schools in the spring of 1987. b) The opinions of the 16-year-old pupils about the AIDS problems expressed in the anthology. Conclusions. a) AIDS education shall be repeated at least once a year and shall include? knowledge, attitudes and safer sex. b) The attitudes of the 16-year-old pupils are a great encouragement in the work of AIDS education. 462 [Page 463](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/461) 8057 THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF AIDS RELATED SCHOOL POLICIES Lisa A. Daily*, J Jones*, K Fraser**, C Duncan*, L Kolbe* * Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta Georgia, USA **National Association of State Boards of Education, Alexandria, Virginia, USA Objective. To describe the role that policies play in helping schools and other organizations educate youth about AIDS and how to prevent infection with HIV. Methods. Common elements of 75 AIDS-related school policies were identified from national organizations, and State and local education agencies from throughout the United States. The impact of policies on AIDS-related school and education issues was assessed from a sample of organizations that have implemented policies. Results. An analysis of the 75 policies adopted by federal, State, and local governments, and national organizations demonstrated similarities and differences in policy elements related to admission status of students and school staff with AIDS or HIV infection; procedures used to determine admission status of students or staff; measures to assure confidentiality; and, the provision of AIDS education for youth. This analysis describes the extent to which policies are consistent with current scientific knowledge and educational principles. Conclusion. Policies play a significant role in enabling schools and other organizations to deal contructively with AIDS-related issues and implement programs to educate youth about AIDS and how to prevent infection with HIV. 8058 STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS ENGAGEMENT: A Strategy for Uorking with Resistant Patients. J. Szapocznik, W. Kurtines, S. Kaminsky, C. Millon & C. Eisdorfer. Center for the Biopsychosocial Study of AIDS, Department of Psychiatry, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA. Objectives: To present the basic concepts and strategies for work with HIV+ patients who resist desirable medical or psychosocial support. Methods: A large body of research sponsored by the National Institutes of Mental Health and Drug Abuse has been published on the effectiveness of Structural Systems Engagement (SSE) in bringing to treatment resistant individuals and their families. The SSE approach is particularly applicable to HIV infected individuals who might profit from early medical interventions and social support, and yet avoid them. In SSE, resistance is interpreted in personal as well as interpersonal terms. A map of interpersonal relations is used to make strategic decisions regarding significant others that may be encouraging or maintaining the patient's avoidant behaviors as well as identifying significant others who can be mobilized to encourage a change of behavior in the patient. Confrontation per se is rarely used. Rather, strategies of joining, tracking, the use of inherent power in the patient's life context, reframing, choreographing and shifting of boundaries and alliances are more frequently employed. Results: This work, borrowed from conventional family therapy approaches, is extended for work with the alternate family styles of gay males. Successful adaptations of the SSE approach have demonstrated their applicability to gay males presenting with lymphadenopathy. Conclusions: Basic concepts of Systems, Strategy, Structure (defined in terms of repetitive patterns of interactions) as well as specific therapeutic interventions will be reviewed. Case studies will be presented. Notes: 8059 RISK BEHAVIOURS AND HIV INFECTION AMONGST INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS IN LONDON G J HART, C SONNEX, A PETHERICK, A M JOHNSON, C FEINMANN, M W ADLER. University College and Middlesex School of Medicine. Objective To assess risk factors for HIV infection amongst drug users from north and central London attending the largest Dependency Clinic in the region. Methods Between Nov '86 and Nov '87 114 IVDU's participated in a joint programme of health screening and research. They were interviewed with regard to their drug use and risk behaviour for HIV infection, and offered counselling and testing for HIV-ab status and markers for Hepatitis B infection. Results Initial analyses indicate 80% of the study group had shared needles and syringes at scne time; 40% of these had shared in the last month. Although few IVDU's experienced difficulties in buying injecting equipment, 70% expressed willingness to participate in a needle-exchange programme. No men, but 20% of the women had used prostitution to fund their dependency. Though 60% reported positive changes in their drug using behaviour, only 18% changed their sexual behaviour. Prevalence of HIV-ab in those tested so far (n=70) is 4.3%. Conclusion There is currently a low prevalence of HIV infection in this population and a lower incidence of needle sharing than in areas in the UK where HIV is endemic. If behaviour does not change the incidence of infection will continue to rise. Further discussion of these and other findings will include the implications for service delivery. 8060 BEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PATTERNS OF PARTNERS WITH MIXED SEROLOGOICAL STATUS Leon McKusick* and C. C. Hoff* *Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, San Francisco Obiective: to describe the behavioral and psychosocial predictors of prevention of HIV infection between individuals in steady partnerships whose HIV serological status differs. Methods: Data will be summarize from three samples in San Francisco, (1) 25 heterosexual couples from a sample of heterosexual bar goers surveyed in July, 1987, (2) 5 heterosexual women from an epidemiological study, (3) 25 homosexual partnerships from a longitudinal behavioral study in San Francisco. Sexual behavior was assessed via questionnaire and psychosocial factors hypothesize to affect behavioral transmission of HIV were derived via interpersonal interview. Results: those individuals who were less likely to engage in HIV transmitting behavior were more likely to agree with behavioral health guidelines in relationships of a greater length, greater exclusivity and more likely to have evolved a behavioral strategy with their partner. Conclusion: It is possible to isolate those factors that foster an effective behavioral prevention strategy with in both heterosexual and homosexual partnerships. Implications for health educator medical clinics, patient counseling, and marital counseling will be discussed based on findings. Limits to cross cultural generalizability from these samples will be discussed. 463 [Page 464](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/462) 8061 BEHAVIORAL RISK FOR HIV-INFECTION IN E Toomey*, GW Rutherford**, LM Udall**, D Werdeger** *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, **San Francisco Department of Public Health, San Francisco, CA Objective. Because Native Americans in the United States suffer high morbidity from sexually transmitted diseases but have an unknown risk for AIDS, we assessed the prevalence of risk behaviors and HIV-infection in an urban Indian cohort. Method. We studied volunteers drawn from two San Francisco Bay Area Indian health centers. Sixty-one individuals agreed to participate by completing a risk-assessment questionnaire; 57 of these additionally underwent anonymous HIV-serologic testing. Results. Fifteen of 35 males (43%), and 2 of 26 females (8%) were homosexual/bisexual. Nineteen (31%) had used intravenous drugs. Twenty-six (43%) had been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection including 7 with syphilis (11%) and 6 with hepatitis B (10%). Thirty-one respondents (51%) felt that alcohol-use increased their high-risk sexual behavior. Seven heterosexual men (33%) had sought sex with prostitutes; 4 women (14%) and 11 men (31%) had been paid for sex. Seventeen individuals (28%), including 4 homosexual/bisexual men, had sexual partners in reservation communities as well as in urban areas. Three of 11 homosexual/bisexual men (27%) were positive for HIV-antibody. Conclusion. These results suggest Native Americans, at potential risk for AIDS due to high-risk sexual and drug-using behavior, should be targeted for AIDS-prevention efforts while HIV-seroprevalence is low. 8062 USA NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH (NIMH) AIDS PROGRAM: FOCUS ON BEHAVIOR Lyle W. Bivens, Ph.D.* *National Institute of Mental Health Objective. To review research findings on the role of behavior as a cause, consequence, co-factor, and control for AIDS. Methods. NIMH is the focal point within the US Public Health Service for research on behavioral aspects of AIDS. This session will describe the current NIMH AIDS program which consists of research grants, contracts to train health care workers about psychological/psychosocial issues relevant to AIDS, research training grants and research centers focusing on psychological response to AIDS, psychoimnunology, the behavioral consequences of central nervous system (CNS) effects of HIV, and research on prevention and behavior change. NIMH public and professional education efforts will also be reviewed. Emerging research findings will be discussed, as well as the interface between research and public policy on AIDS. The critical role of behavior will be reviewed in developing interventions to prevent the spread of AIDS and coping with the consequences of the epidemic. Conclusion. The NIMH AIDS research program provides a framework for reviewing important findings about the role of behavior in the AIDS epidemic and for analyzing important next steps in research and practice. Notes: 063 SOCIAL IMPACT OF VIH INFECTION IN SEROPOSITIVE POPULATION CONTROLLED IN CPS DE CENTRO Autores: A. Comas, Perez, Centro: CENTRO PROMOTION SALUD, AYUNTAMIENTO MADRID GENERAL OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of AIDS in the affected populations related to social life: family, health institutions, sober-up Clinics.... SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: To check the change in risk habits, life style, somatic and psychiatric morbility, and mortality, and mortality rate in the seropositive population diagnosed in our Clinic during 1985 (374 patients). The patients were followed-up by a period of time between 24 and 36 months. METHODS: A longitudinal prospective and cohort investigation was done, using quantitative and qualitative parameters of exposed population to VIH infection in two different groups: I VDA and homosexuals. CONCLUSIONS: An important group is not using any preventive measure. Most of the seropositive patients reports that they are worried about AIDS and that they feel stress or depressions. They believe that political parties had not been effective against AIDS. They think that National Campaigns are not enough, and that they are not very effective. We found a low mortality rate on the two years followup of these populations. 8064 BEHAVIORAL CHANGES IN FORMER BLOOD DONORS IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING NOTIFICATION OF HIV SEROPOSITIVITY AE Williams, KW Creedon, and The American Red Cross Collaborative Study Group, Jerome H. Holland Laboratory, Rockville, MD. Objective To measure behavioral responses following notification of HIV seropositivity so as to refine counselling stategies and reduce further HIV spread. Methods Behavioral changes were assessed by oral interview of 101 HIV seropositive blood donors at 6 months after HIV+ result notification. Sixty three of these donors were re-interviewed at 12 months. Results Changes in the frequency of overall sexual activity were noted at both interviews, including (6 mos/12 mos): reduced number of partners (22%/55%), celibacy (24%/35%), elimination of prior bisexual activity (56%/38%), and elimination of anonymous contacts (76%/80%). A significant increase in condom use (48%/50%) was seen compared to the time prior to notification (p.05). Seropositive subjects revealed HIV test results to their primary sexual contacts (64%), friends (54%), and personal physicians (56%). Results were revealed to a lesser extent to family members (35%), dentists (10%), and co-workers (8%). Additional deliberate lifestyle changes reported during the follow-up year were: less alcohol/drug use (7%), less body fluid exchange (5%); improved exercise (34%), more rest (24%) and improved diet (16%). After one year, 58% of subjects had sought medical follow-up as recommended at the time of notification. Conclusions Current counseling strategies result in behavioral changes directed towards improved health and reduced HIV transmission in a majority of HIV seropositive blood donors. 464 [Page 465](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/463) 8065 IS SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR CHANGING AS A RESULT OF THE HIV-EPIDEMIC? Inqela Lundin Kvalem, J M Sundet, R H Pape, K T0mmervik, L S Bakketeig National Institute of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, Oslo, Norway. Obiective. The spread of HIV in the population is intimately related to sexual habits. Changes in prevalence of risk-prone sexual behavior may change the rate of spread. The purpose of this paper is to report some data on trends of sexual behavior in the general population of Norway, especially during the last three years. Method. The data is mostly based on a postal anonymous questionnaire. Results from a supplementary interview will also be included. Two randomly selected samples of norwegians between 18 and 60 yrs were used. The postal questionnaire was sent to 10.000 people in november 1987 (appr. 0,4 % of the Norwegian population), and the invitation to the interview was sent to 600 people in the Oslo area in january 1988. In both cases people were asked to answer questions about their present and past sexual behaviors, such as partner turnover, sexual activity and the use of condoms. Results. The response rate of the questionnaire was well over 60 %, and the interviews were concluded by the end of march 1988. The analysis of the data and the main conclusions were clear during late spring 1988. 8066 DO KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS AIDS INFLUENCE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR OF HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS? Marion Notermans (1),Hans Adriaanse (2) University of Maastricht, NL. and Ralph Diclemente, University of San Francisco,USA In June 1987 a AIDS-questionnaire was conducted among a representative sample of 350 highschoolstudents of age 12-18 years in Maastricht, NL. Purpose of this investigation was to get a picture of their knowledge of and attitudes towards AIDS. The original questionnaire was developped in San Francisco, USA. In the Netherlands it alsD contained some items about the national AIDScampaign and selfefficacy. The percentages of right answers to the items of knowledge were surprisingly high, often far more than 80%. The attitudes towards AIDS-patients were rather postive, but those towards homosexuality on the other hand were startling negative. No less than 35% thought the best thing the Dutch government could do was to openly declare that it was against homosexuality in order to stop AIDS that way. Where selfefficacy was concerned, many students thought they could surely say \"no\" to making love with a partner who was not willing to use a condom. Female students felt significanty more troubled to buy or use condoms than males. Conclusion: However high and positive knowledge and attitudes may be, they don't explain all of the variation in sexual behavior. Especially everything about condoms asks for attention, since it seems to be a important intermediate variable in safe sexual behavior. Notes: 067 Title: Afro-American Sex Practices: An Analysis of Risk for AIDS Authors: Richard Goodjoin, Eugene Crayton,Jr., Mindy Fullilove, Robert Fullilove and Shirley Gross, Bayview-Hunter's Point Foundation and University of California, San Francisco, Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, S. F. CA, USA Abstract: As part of the development of AIDS prevention in the Afro-American community, we conducted an intensive series of group discussions with residents of an inner city neighborhood. The group discussions were designed to include a broad range of volunteer participants, including intravenous drug abusers, gay men, lesbians, and heterosexual men and women ranging in age from 18 to 45. All participants described confusion and ineptitude accompanying the initiation of sexual activity in adolescence, serial monogamy as the dominant adult mode of relationships, and awareness of risks they would face in the hiatus between ending one stable relationship and establishing a new one. Gay men and lesbians complained of rejection and homophobia in the AfroAmerican community; heterosexual men and women expressed fears, distrust and anger towards homosexuals. Based on these observations, several prevention strategies emerge, including the use of small group workshops to convey sex education to teenagers, a focus on the \"relationship hiatus\" as a high risk period, and increasing efforts to build understanding and acceptance for diverse sexual lifestyles. 8068 SEXUALITY AND FUTURE Barbro Lenneer-Axelson RFSU - SWEDISH ASSOCIATION FOR SEX EDUCATION Objective: A retrospective and prospective social-psychological analysis of sexual morality and sexual patterns in relation to education fighting HIV/AIDS. Methods. Analysis and reflections on Swedish sexuologic research 1968-1988. Future perspectives. Results. Benefits from 1960's: Less double morality towards questions of sexuality facilitate open communication about sexual riskbehaviors and detailed condom knowledge. Less taboo to seek health care for AIDS-test. Sexeducation in school and youth clinics wellestablished. Increased selfconfidence and equality in women. makes it easier to put demands on men and safer sex. Sexuality no longer on men's term alone. Negative effects. Serial monogamous polygamy. Conclusions. Future: Important to prevent a new sexual double morality. Sexeducation must continue to be integrated in a human context. Focus on realistic - not too idealistic education. Focus on personal and affective rather than general and cognitive education. Focus on psychological resistance against condom usage. Focus on lifestyles more than ages. Focus on male milieus where destructive risktaking is more commen due to the male role/male culture. Women-key persons in fighting AIDS both in sexual practice and in education in social networks to their children and in relations in social networks.

Columbia University School of Public Health, New York, NY, 10032, USA. Objective. To determine the psychological and medical impact of AIDS-related bereavement on gay men. Methods. A cohort of 745 NYC gay men were interviewed in 1985 about their health, sexual behavior and experience with close friends and lovers dead of AIDS during the first 5 years of the epidemic. Results. As of 1985, 27% (199) of the sample had lost at least one close friend or lover to AIDS. Of these, 67% had been bereaved once, 18% had been bereaved twice, and 15% had been bereaved 3 times or more. A clear dose-response relationship between bereavement and symptoms was found for severe psychological symptoms including (i) demoralization (p <.002), (ii) traumatic stress response (p <.0001), (iii) sleep disturbance (p <.01), (iv) recreational drug use (p <.001) and (v) sedative use (p <.01). Initiating or increasing professional psychological consultations increased 4-fold among those bereaved once, and 5-fold among those bereaved 3 times or more. Conclusion. A \"secondary-epidemic\" of AIDS-related bereavement is growing as the AIDS epidemic grows. Serious psychological problems resulting from losses are occurring at a rate which doubles each year. No sign of adaptation (i.e. decreasing symptoms) was found among those suffering multiple loss. The mental health care profession and primary care physicians should be aware of these problems among the non-ill but bereaved population. 8070 Dunphy, C.*, Brown, M.*** Public Health,**U. of Washington School of Social Work,***U. of Washington School of Nursing Objective: Stresses associated with AIDS care increase the liklihood of burnout among health care workers, a group already highly susceptible to burnout. This paper discusses a burnout prevention program developed for a county public health AIDS project involved in high-risk testing. The goal of the program is to increase staffs ability to find personal and professional satisfaction in their work. Methods: An educational staff support model was developed by three cooperating projects representing the county, state and federal governments. It consists of one-half hour didactic sessions followed by one-hour small group sessions. Lectures serve as trigger sessions for small groups in which individual personal feeling responses are discussed. A six-month pilot training will be completed by August, 1988. Evaluation: There will be an experimental group of 25 individuals receiving the training. A comparison control group will not be given the prevention program. Both groups will complete a pre-test and post-test on job stress and job satisfaction factors. Conclusion: This program is designed to be a prototype for other employers seeking to decrease employee turnover or attract new staff. Burnout prevention programs are becoming increasingly necessary since they are an economically efficient means of ensuring continued employee satisfaction and productivity. Notes: 8071 EXPLOITATION OF AIDS PATIENTS-TRADING WITH FALSE HOPES, PANACEAS AND PSEUDO THERAPIES Velimirovic Boris, Institute of Social Medicine, University of Graz, Austria Past experience with health fraud suggests that wherever there is a new and/or serious disease of wide public health concern, fraudulent treatment spring up. Patients or potential sufferers become prey of various kind of self-appointed therapists or even of excentric members of the medical profession. This has also happened with AIDS. Most frequently financial exploitation is behind. Motive for use can be distrust or disappointment with the progress of scientific medicine and/or the desperate wish to believe in alternative unconventional therapies by various affected groups. In 1987 about one billion US-$ has been spent in the USA on unconventional therapies by AIDS patients. Various forms noted so far, are discussed: ozon, organextracts (\"fresh healing, cure-promissing psychotherapies etc. As a historical phenomenon fraudulent therapies are not new and will not disappear as long as there is no effective treatment for AIDS. Many ethical and social problems are involved. Efforts should be made not only to monitor this phenomenon and to protect patients against financial exploitation (through legislation, establishment of Health Fraud units, information), but also through education, humanitarian care and compassion. 8072 PREVALENCE AND CHANGE IN AIDS HIGH RISK BEHAVIOR AMONG GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN Maria L. Ekstrand and Thomas J. Coates University of California, San Francisco and Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A. Objective. To document the prevalence and change in AIDS high risk behavior among gay and bisexual men in San Francisco. Methods. A probability sample of gay and bisexual men were assessed in 1985, 1986, and 1987 as part of the San Francisco Men's Health Study. Data on sexual behaviors which might facilitate HIV transmission were collected. Results. As shown in the table below, there was a significant decrease in self-reported high risk behaviors from 1985 to 1986. Behavior: Unprotected anal intercourse-active contact * * * * * (n.s.)* * * * * =data have been collected and will be analyzed and reported at the meeting Conclusion. Significant behavior change has occurred in the gay community. This suggests that the intervention models used might be useful with other populations too. 466 [Page 467](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/465) 8073 UNSAFE SEX & DRUG USE AMONG SUBSTANCE ABUSING GAY MEN AT INTAKE TO TREATMENT William J. Woods, Ph.D.*, F. Davis, J.D.**, J. De Jong *University of California San Francisco **18th Street Services, San Francisco, California Objective. To present survey results which indicate the extent to which substance abusing gay men, on intake to treatment, report engaging in activities they know to be putting them at high risk for transmitting or contracting HIV. Methods. About 100 men at a substance abuse treatment facility for gay men were recruited into this study. Each participant filled out a brief questionnaire on their knowledge of safe sex and needle use, as well as their own sexual and needle use behaviors. Results. Priliminary results indicate that, while a majority of participants were in fact knowledgable about safe sex and needle sharing behaviors, a majority of them still engaged in unsafe sex, typically under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Conclusion. Treatment with gay male substance abusers may need to include components which address their ability to make changes in their sexual behaviors which would reduce their chances of transmitting or contracting HIV. 8074 USE OF PREVENTIVE MEASURES, CHANGE OF HABITS AND MEDICAL CONTROL OF HIGH RISK HIV INFECTION POPULATION Autores: C. Merodio, C. Soldevilla, M. Centro: Centro Promoci6n Salud. Ayuntamiento Madrid The cohorts were separated by factor of exposition to HIV infection. Two different groups were studied: homosexuals and I VDA. The study was conducted to assess the actual and post health problems, as well as the use of preventive measures and changes in habits of (374) HIV infection high risk patients seen in our clinic during 1985 and followed-up between 24 and 36 months. The effect of beeing seropositive and the concern about AIDS are also analiced. The health problems were studied by means of the need of medical treatment and present health. Medical treatment was clasified as follows: routine check-up, sporadic check-up, no check-up, and hospitalization. Seropositive patients had a better follow-up. Changes in risk habits had been related to internally acceptance of preventive measures. The impact of beeing seropositive to the affected population is analized. Concern stress or depression are also analized because they can produce inmunodepression. Notes: 80 75 Psychosocial National Inst. of Psychosocial Factors and Health and National Board of Health, Stockholm, Sweden In Jan. 1988 there were altogether 94 hemophiliacs with positive HIV-tests in Sweden 90 of these had been infected in the years 1979-1982 and four in 1985. Today, half of these patients have symptoms of AIDS- related infection. An exploration of the psychosocial situation and needs of HIV-infected hemophiliacs and their families in Sweden was started in May 1986. Interviews were made and questionnaires were distributed during the period May 1986 - Dec. 1987 either at the coagulation units or at the patients'homes (altooether 70 home visits were made ). Social networks, important life events and coping mechanisms were explored. Process descriptions regarding psychosocial defence mechanism were made. Preliminary results regarding social networks based on questionnaires from 82% of the eligible adult population (65/79) are available. A comparison group of HIV-negative age-matched hemophiliacs, 66% of the selected group (33/50 randomly selected), was studied. Relatives of HIV-infected remophiliacs were also studied (90%,19/21). Results in general, social networks have been mobilized particularly in the younger HIV-infected groups. Young hemophiliacs with HIV-infection seem to have matured psyhologically more rapidly than HIV-negative hemophiliacs. The psychosocial isolation is particularly damaging among older HIV-infected hemophiliacs. The psychosocial isolation among middle-aged and older HIY-infected men may be wors than that of young HIV-infected men and boys. An illustration of this is seen in table 1, which shows that HIV-infected men 30 years and older more frequently report no ( or very few ) contacts with acquaintances than younger HIV-infected men. Such an age trend is not seen among non-infected hemophiliacs.

Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, NY, USA Objective: To describe the psychosocial benefits of home infusion therapy services delivered to a large series of AIDS patients during a recent 2 1/2 year period. Methods: During the period 4/85-9/87, 109 AIDS patients received home infusion therapy after hospital discharge. Included were 100 males and 9 females. Most were homo/ bisexual males (N=91), others were intravenous drug users partners of IVDU (N=2),and 1 child. Most (N=51) received IV ganciclovir through central venous catheters for therapy of CMV as follows: 1. 40/109 (36%) were able to remain at home for a period of 2 mos to more than 1 yr between hospitalizations. 2. 41/108 (38%) were able to return to usual employment, on a full-time basis in some cases. 3. 89/109 (82%) were able to maintain their usual living arrangements. Most of the rest lived with family. 4. In 51/109 (47%), the patient and family assumed the primary responsibility for the preparation, administration, and monitoring of the therapy. Conclusion: Home infusion therapy for AIDS patients offers valuable psychosocial benefits including the opportunity to remain at home for prolonged periods, to resume full-time emoloyment, and to take primary responsibility for aspects of their own therapy, thus preserving self-confidence, and many points of view the psychosocial situation of the relatives of HIV-infected hemophiliacs is worse than that of the patients. Wives, for instance, have few sources of support The study points at unmet psychosocial needs among older HIV-infected hemophiliacs and among relatives of these patients. 467 [Page 468](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/466) 8077 AIDS HOTLINE: COMPONENT OF COMPREHENSIVE CARE M.Cataudella, V. Pellegrino, D. Spicehandler St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center, New York, NY Objective. To describe the role of a hotline as part of a comprehensive AIDS service program. Methods. The AIDS hotline provides information/ referrals for services/resources for persons with HIV related disease and those at risk. The hotline is staffed by volunteers who have received intensive training. The hotline disseminates accurate, timely information on AIDS transmission. Information regarding risk factors is not solicited from the caller, but is noted if given voluntarily. Results. The hotline received 30,249 calls in 1987. In 1/87, 1,339 calls were received as compared to 3,987 calls in 12/87. 15% of calls were \"Worried Well\" individuals classified as persons with no symptoms of AIDS, but at high risk or people with neither symptoms nor risk factors, concerned about transmission. 12% of calls were from homosexual/bisexual men and 5% were IV drug users. 68% of callers did not identify a risk factor. Geographic distribution indicated that although it is a national hotline, 90% of calls were from New York, 7% from contiguous states (New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut) and 3% from the other states and Puerto Rico. 5% of calls were referred for medical services or HIV testing. Conclusion. The increase in number in hotline calls reflects the increase in incidence and concern about AIDS. The majority of calls were seeking information as opposed to direct medical referrals. Our hotline's success reflects the integration of volunteers into a comprehensive care AIDS program. The purpose of our hotline is to provide information and education beyond our immediate service area. ROLE OF LIFE-EVENTS AND SOCIAL SUPPORT 8078 V IN HIV INFECTION J. Mann, A.E. Kocsis, J. Green. St. Mary's Hospital,London, UK. OBJECTIVE. There is speculation as to the possible influence of psychological variables on immune functioning and hence disease progression in HIV infection. Life-events have been shown to contribute to stress-mediated weakening of immune defences, most especially in the absence of social support. This study examines the number and types of life-events and degree of social support as experienced by HIV infected individuals (N=60) compared with uninfected male homosexuals and heterosexuals (N=50). METHOD. Patients in the ongoing prospective study of neuropsychiatric effects of HIV completed a life-events/social support questionnaire relating to the previous 6 months. RESULTS. Homosexuals find their relationships significantly more distressing and perceive their social network as less supportive than do heterosexuals. They also experience more life-events. Overall there are significant differences between all groups on the following categories of life event: those relating to both sexual and family relationships, those beyond personal control, and those involving changes of habit. Amongst those infected, Asymptomatic (AAP) individuals experience a significantly greater number of life-events in comparison with heterosexuals, whereas this is not the case for people with Persistent Generalised Lymphadenopathy (PGL). In particular, AAPs experience more life-events relating to their sexual relationships than do PGLs, people with Aids Related Complex (ARC) and AIDS. AAPs also experience more events beyond personal control compared to PGLs. CONCLUSION. Homosexuals not only experience greater number of threatening life-events than heterosexuals, but also they lack the protective effect of good social support. This suggests that homosexuals, compared to heterosexuals, may be more at risk from stress-mediated effects on their immune system before, and perhaps also after, infection. Furthermore, it is possible that there are differences in pre-morbid stress through life-events between homosexuals who develop PGL and those who remain asymptomatic, and that this is reflected in their corresponding immune responses. Correlations between life-event scores and HIV antigen and antibody and p24 antibody levels are under way. The cohort will continue to be monitored. Notes: 8079 Use of Facilitated Peer Support Group To Effect Behavior Change In HIV Positive Individuals Anne C. Freeman, P. Anderson, V. Reff, Dallas County Health Department, Dallas, Tx Objective. To improve or maintain health and quality of life of individuals who are HIV Antibody + and persons with AIDS Related Complex, and to decrease the transmission of HIV. Methods. Weekly support groups facilitated by trained professionals for gay-bisexual men who range in age from 20-75 (average age about 30). The format includes education regarding HIV transmission; disease process; treatment alternatives; safer sex guidelines, including exploration of attitudes and philosophies about sex; nutrition; exercise; and stress reduction and management. Surveys of knowledge, attitudes, and behavior will be given at specified intervals. Results. Based on informal verbal and written evaluations after 18 weekly sessions, participants demonstrate healthier lifestyle practices as a result of increased knowledge and awareness. Participants have experienced improved psychological adjustment to HIV infection, and have gained a feeling of control over their lives. Conclusion. Within the supportive atmosphere of the proup, the participants make better adjustment to their HIV infection. With the increased number of HIV inEected persons, the need for support groups will grow, expanding into other populations. 8080 SELF HELP GROUPS FOR PEOPLE WITH AIDS Peter Baker, Frontliners, Terrence Higgins Trust, London. Matthew Helbert, St. Mary's Hospital, London. Objective To assess what the perceived needs of a selfhelp group for people with AIDS and ARC are and how well they have been met. Method Frontliners is a self-help group set up by and for people with AIDS and ARC. Frontliners provide fellow members with emotional support, alleviate the sense of isolation, help each other with practicalities such as claiming welfare rights and dealing with work related difficulties. They have published a booklet \"Living with AIDS\" which explains, through first-hand experience the medical problems, investigations, and treatment a patient is likely to encounter. We are collecting questionnaire data from patients in various centres in the U.K. and from all high risk groups. Results Membership has increased to 115 which represents 23% of living AIDS patients in the U.K. Most members are gay men living in London. We are awaiting more data from other groups but the gay men who have been assessed so far feel that Frontliners provides a useful service. Conclusion Frontliners serves a useful function in the support of people with AIDS. As HIV infection spreads beyond the homosexual community the group may need to re-appraise its role. 468 [Page 469](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/467) 081 HELPING THE HELPERS: A SUPPORT GROUP FOR CARETAKERS OF PERSONS WITH AIDS James J. Kelly*, Pamelia Sykes** *California State University at Long Beach and UCLA School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, Sepulveda Veterans Administration Medical Center, **California State University at Long Beach, CA, USA Objective. To describe the special needs, focus, processes and outcomes of a community support group formed under the auspices of AIDS Project Los Angeles for caretakers of persons with AIDS. Methods. Meeting bi-montly in a hospital setting, the group has served 29 family members or significant others of 19 persons with AIDS and 1 with ARC between November 1985 and February 1988. AIDS transmission was by IV drug use in 3 cases and by blood transfusion in 1 case. The remainder of cases were gay and bisexual males. While all of the persons with AIDS were males, the group served 26 females and only 3 males. The racial/ethnic composition of the group included 1 Asian, 2 Hispanics and the remainder Caucasian with 6 Jewish. Results. Findings included identification of information sharing and networks regarding medical and social services, provision of a \"safe place\" for the ventilation of feelings, sharing of respite and life enhancement techniques for caretakers, development of group cohesion despite demographic heterogenity, and the group's role in suicide prevention and crisis intervention. Conclusion. A number of needs of significant others 'are unmet, especially for blacks and children. Additional problems may also surface. Q 2 IMMUNE FUNCTION AND AEROBIC TRAINING AS A 8082 FUNCTION OF ANTI-HIV STATUS IN HEALHY GAY MALES MA Fletcher*, P Caralis*, A R Laperriere*, G Ironson*, A Perry*, M Ashmar*, N Schneiderman* *University of Miami Center for the Biopsychosocial Study of AIDS, Miami, FL ** Stanford University, Stanford, CA Obiective. To investigate the relationship between immune function and aerobic training in healthy gay males as a function of HIV status. Methods. Subjects (N=39) were randomly assigned to aerobic training (N=22) or control (N=17) groups prior to knowledge of anti-HIV status. The aerobic training group received 45 min of aerobic exercise at approximately 80% of maximum predicted heart rate 3 times per week for 10 weeks. Blood tests and aerobic fitness evaluations were performed pre and post training. Results. At pre-training HIV positive subjects were significantly lower than HIV negative subjects in a variety of immune parameters including number of white blood cells, number of CD4 cells, natural killer cells (NKH-1+), mitogen,T4/T8 ratio, and the CD4 subset, 4B4, which increases antibody response to antigen, and significantly higher in terms of number of T8 cells, and immunoglobulin G. Subjects in the aerobic training group showed a significant improvement in aerobic fitness as measured by predicted maximum volume of oxygen uptake [37.5 vs 40.5 ml kg-1 min-1, F(1, 17)=8.9, 1<.01]. In contrast, subjects in the control group showed a slight nonsignificant decrease in aerobic fitness. After the 10 weeks of aerobic training, subjects in the exercise group whose anti-HIV status was negative showed significant increases in lymphocyte response to Pi IA [52,914 vs 93,319 net counts per min (cpm), [12.0 vs 18.9, T(1, 10)=3.4, 1<.01, whereas subjects in the exercise group whose antibody status was positive, as well as controls, did not show similar significant changes in PHA, B1+ cells, or 2H4+ T4+ cells. Conclusion. These data offer evidence that the immune system of HIV positive individuals become compromised, before overt symptoms occur, to the extent that they may derive less immune enhancement from aeorbic training than do antibody negative individuals. Notes: 8083 CONFIDENTIALITY PROBLEMS IN HIV + BI-SEXUAL MALES Dena J. Seiden Union Theological Seminary, New York City Objective. To develop a policy which both protects confidentiality and limits the spread of disease. Methods. There has been widespread debate within the medical and larger community as to the protections and limitations of confidentiality as to persons with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, (AIDS), AIDS Related Complex (ARC) or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, (HIV). Is the medical tradition of absolute confidentiality between clinician and patient to take precedence over the need to disclose infectivity status to others at risk, (if the presenting patient refuses), allowing these others to be tested and/or change sexual behavior? This debate has focused largely on patients who are openly homosexual or intravenous drug abusers. Even more difficult is the bi-sexual male, married, suburban, often with children or planning children, whose bi-sexual preference is not known to his family, employer or community. For medical practitioners and the ethicists who work with them, the dilemma is painful. Often these mean belong to a family practice organizations. Hence, their wives and children are patients of the same group of practitioners, balancing the value of confidentiality for the presenting patient against the need to protect the health of the other patients also known to the practitioner. Yet, if a physician or group inform their other patients, will the presenting patients disappear, thereby losing any chance of their clinicians affecting their destructive behavior? The paper will include a sample protocol to deal with the underlying dilemma and specific problems raised by the above. It will describe the ethical and public health theories used to reach this solution. Results. With patients counseling, most infected patients will voluntarily inform their contacts where they have not done so. Where physicians have done so, these patients have not been lost to treatment. 8r084 TOWARD A NULTIVARIATE BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL OF AIDS J. Szapocznik, C. Milton, R. Morgan, N. Blaney, F. Wilkie, A. Guterman, G. Sfakianakis, M.A. Fletcher, R. Beach, G. Ramsey and C. Eisdorfer. Center for the Biopsychosocial Study of AIDS, Department of Psychiatry, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA. Objective: This paper will describe the relationships among psychosocial, immunologic, cognitive variables and CNS involvement in a six month follow up of 30 HIV+ gay males admitted with lymphadenopathy. Methods: Subjects are assessed every six months with a battery including psychosocial variables (depression, anxiety, social support, personality, coping, hostility, loneliness and stress), immunologic functioning (T4/Tg, Lymphocytes, IgG, IgA, IgM), cognitive functioning (using conventional neuropsychologic methods and assessments of information processing), electrophysiologic (EEG, Fast Fourier Transform, visual evoked potential and P300), brain imaging (cerebral blood flow with HIPDM/I123, blood/brain barrier scan using technetium 99m and gallium scans for localizing inflammations) as well as health status. Results: While results are clearly preliminary, initial crosssectional univariate and multivariate analyses tend to support the findings of other investigator. Conclusions: Preliminary results presented here represent the initial wave of subjects in a 5 year longitudinal study of 100 HIV+ gay males. The longitudinal data will serve to challenge or corroborate findings obtained from cross-sectional studies. Results from cross-sectional and cross-sequential (within and between time period) analyses will be compared. 469 [Page 470](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/468) 8085 PSYCHOSOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL PREDICTORS OF AIDS RISK REDUCTION Leon McKusick.* T. Coates, * R. Stall, * S. Morin, * *Center for AIDS Prevention Research, San Francisco Objective: To describe sexual behavior change and psychosocial predictors of change from a 3 year longitudinal analysis of a sample of 824 gay men in San Francisco, Calif USA. Methods: respondents were assessed via annual questionnaires on sexual behavior and several psychosocial constructs hypothesized to influence AIDS behavioral risk reduction from 1984 through 1987. Results: Dramatic reductions were found in HIV transmitting behavior during the 3 year period of measure. Additionally, those psychosocial correlates found to be significant in cross- sectional analysis (alcohol and drug usage, knowledge of HIV antibody status, primary relationships status, psychological depression, agreement with behavioral health guidelines and personal efficacy) were entered into a multiple regression analysis. Several psychosocial predictors(including relationship status, knowledge of HIV status and alcohol use) were found to differentiate those who persist in high risk behavior from those who maintain low or no risk of HIV transmission. Conclusion: Based on these findings it is possible to describe a profile of the risk prone gay man and sight the implications for patient counseling and health education. 8086 THE \"800 MEN\" PROJECT: A SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF AIDS PREVENTION PROGRAMS DEMONSTRATING THE EFFICACY OF EROTIC, SEXUALLY EXPLICIT SAFER SEX EDUCATION ON GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN AT RISK FOR AIDS JE D'Eramo*, Shattls*, Inc. (March-December 1985) **Gay Men's Health Crisis, Inc. Objective. To determine an efficacious AIDS prevention education program by systematically evaluating the specific efforts of four approaches to such programs on the sexual attitudes and behavior of gay and bisexual men at risk for AIDS. Methods. 619 gay and bisexual men from New York City completed an extensive test battery which assessed in detail their sexual activities and attitudes prior to participation in one of four concurrent education programs and two months following the programs: 1. safer sex guidelines (printed material only); 2. a program of lectures and discussions presenting information about the syndrome, including its transmission and pathology, and safer sex guidelines, 3. a program presenting safer sex activity in an affirmative, erotically appealing manner through verbal and printed media; and 4. a program of sexually explicit visuals--videos and slides--presenting safer sex behavior in the same affirmative erotically appealing manner. Statistical tests of significance were applied to observed change in attitudes and behavior which could be attributed to the educational programs. Results. The second program was the best in motivating at risk persons to reduce high risk behavior--it did not motivate them to have safer sex. The fourth (visual) program was best in changing to low or no risk behavior. Conclusion. Using erotic safer sex visuals is most effective for adopting safer sex. Notes: 8087 COMPARISON OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOURS OF MEN SEEKING AIDS INFORMATION AT SAUNAS COMPARED WITH MELBOURNEIS MAIN SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES CLINIC David C Plummer*, B Hatch, T Carter, P Hayes, I Denham, J Kirstenblatt, G Rennie, D Bradford Melbourne Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinic, *Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations Objective. To anaylise characteristics and sexual behviour patterns of men at risk of HIV infection. Method. Between August 1985 and November 1986 a total of 141 gay and bisexual men participated in a self-administered survey of sexual practices in conjuction with anonymous HIV antibody testing. None had been previously tested. All were recruited when seeking AIDS information from clinicians providing services at both sites. Results. Men traditionally thought to be at risk belonged to a variety of subgroups according to the characteristics surveyed. These subgroups will be of use when planning education campaigns. Of particular interest is that in all respects the sauna population tended to be safer. 8088 ANAL INTERCOURSE (AI) AMONG HETEROSEXUALS AT INCREASED RISK FOR AIDS IN ITALY. U. Tirelli, S. Saracchini, P. Riferimento a grant of the Friuli Venezia-Giulia Region. Objective: To determine the frequency of AI among heterosexuals at high risk for AIDS in Italy and its possible role in the spread of HIV. Methods: We examined 89 heterosexual couples of whom at least 1 partner was an intravenous drug abuser (ivda), looking at the spread of HIV infection either by the sharing of contaminated needles or by sexual contact. Fifty couples were made up by both ivda, the median age was 22 years, concordance in HIV seropositivity was 10/50 (54%). Results: AI was reported by 30% of the couples, although practiced occasionally. Due to the fact that in all these 50 couples the sharing of syringes was common practice, it is not possible to evaluate the influence of AI in the spread of HIV infection. However, those who practiced AI did not differ in HIV seropositivity from the other couples who did not practice AI. Among the other 39 couples made up of one ivda and one partner not belonging to any known risk group except for being a partner of an ivda, the median age was 22 years, partners not a risk were 32/39 (82%) women, concordance in HIV seropositivity was observed in 2/39 (5%) of the couples, concordance in HIV seronegativity was observed in 15/39 (38%) couples. AI was practiced by 31% of the couples. Follow-up is available at the median duration of 9 months (range 3-14) in 10/39 couples with 2/10 (20%) HIV seroconversions being observed. These couples never employed condoms and did practice AI. Conclusions: 1) AI is frequently although occasionally reported by ivda couples; 2) there is some evidence that in addition to the exchange of syringes, sexual contacts are the cause of HIV spread; 3) AI was probably implicated in HIV infection in at least in 2/10 couples. 470 [Page 471](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/469) 8089 Sexual behavior of the British: Implications for HIV transmission. S. Blower,M.Adler,R.Anderson,P.Elliott,A.Johnson D.Miller,L.Prior,J.Wadsworth, and P.Wallace. The Imperial College of Science & Technology,The Middlesex Hospital,St.Mary's Hospital,The Gallup Poll,London School of Hygiene & Tropical Med - icine, London, U.K. ABSTRACT: The rate and degree of spread of AIDS depends on a number of variables of sexual behavior. We conducted a pilot study in the U.K. to estimate population parameters of certain of these variables. We employed a 3-stage random sampling procedure to obtain a representative sample of the adult population of the U.K. Respondents (n=780) completed self-administered questionnaires on their homo- and heterosexual behavior (e.g. number of sexual partners, length of sexual relationships, and condom usage). Data were also collected on demographic characteristics and attitudes about AIDS. Sexual behavior data were stratfied by sex, age, socioeconomic class, and marital status. Variance to mean ratios were calculated to characterize the population distributions for the number of sexual partners per individual per unit time. Loglinear models were used to evaluate which variables significantly affected the number of sexual partners per individual for time intervals of 1, 3, and 6 months, 1,2, and 5 years, and life. The results of this data analysis were then used to assess the potential for the spread of AIDS in the British heterosexual population. 8090 DYSFUNCTION OF HUMAN SEXUAL RESPONSE IN PEOPLE WITH AIDS AND HIV DISEASE William Earl Wade, III, D.O. Kansas AIDS Network, Co-Facilitator Post-Graduate Training Program in Human Sexuality, The Menninger Foundation, Topeka, Kansas. Objective. To describe and evaluate the prevalance and severity of sexual dysfunctions in persons with HIV disease. Methods. Individuals with HIV disease were interviewed as to personal sexual changes since their diagnosis. Male and female participants were explicitly questioned regarding their personal sexual practices and preferences on at least two occasions. Sexual dysfunctions were determined by alterations of the Human Sexual Response Cycle, and were categorized into five areas of dysfunction. Results. HIV disease causes both direct and indirect alterations in the human sexual response cycle in many patients. Coupled with episodic transient depression, these alterations in sexual expression may become quite problematic and precipitate severe and debilitating sexual dysfunction. Conclusion. Sexual dysfunction is common in individuals with HIV disease. Sex therapy and medical intervention may provide the patient with improvement and amelioration of sexually dysfunctional problems. Notes: 8091 ADOLESCENT AIDS SURVEY AND MASS MEDIA CAMPAIGN 8092 AWARENESS OF AIDS AND ATTITUDE TO THE DISEASE AMONG SCHOOLCHILDREN IN BRAZZAVILLE (CONGO) Anne C. Freeman*, R. Hudson*, C.E. **Knape & Knape Dallas, Tx. Objective. To determine the knowledge level and opinions of adolescents about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), its means of transmission and prevention. Methods. A survey of 1,398 junior and senior high school students was conducted by the advertising firm of Knape & Knape and the Dallas County Health Department. The survey included males and females and the major ethnic groups of black (15.5%), hispanic (34.0%), white (43.5%), and other (7.0%). The survey was administered in existing classes from several schools and school districts in Dallas Co. Results. Adolescents display strong elements of denial when applying knowledge about AIDS to their life situations. Twenty percent of the junior high students felt that a young person could not get AIDS if they were in love or had sexual intercourse with an attractive person. Conventional classroom AIDS education seems to have little impact on condom usage. Two thirds of the adolescents stated they would not use a condom because they believed they would not get AIDS. Over 60 percent felt condoms were embarrassing to buy and many students thought of birth control pills as protection from AIDS. Conclusion. Survey results indicated that adolescents need an increased awareness that AIDS can happen to them. A multi-media AIDS awareness campaign was developed aimed at adolescents that includes the following strong messages: 1) AIDS kills; 2) excuses will not prevent AIDS and; 3) AIDS is preventable by making choices about B Control Committee, Congo Objectives: Assessment of the awareness and behaviour of young people from Brazzaville with regard to AIDS. Methods: A survey was conducted in November 1987 among 330 secondary school pupils between the ages of 14 and 24. An anonymous questionnaire was distributed and completed in the classroom, and immediately collected by those conducting the survey. Results: 1. The word AIDS is known to 98% of pupils. 2. 68% are very much afraid of the disease, and only 8% say they are not afraid of it. 3. 79% replied to the question on modes of transmission. 96% of them cited sexual relations, 22% blood, and 2% mother to child transmissions. 12% gave other replies. 4. Of those asked, 75% said they had been given clear information, especially by health services and the press. On these items (1-4) there was no great difference according to sex and age. 5. On the matter of protection, 88% replied. 19% thought there was no safeguard, 50% suggested limiting the number of partners, 25% the use of condoms, 8% vaccines or drugs. Boys are slightly better informed, as are older pupils. 6. Sexual relations: 93% replied. 25% said they had had sexual intercourse for the first time before the age of 14, and 61% before the age of 16. Boys would seem to be more precocious. Question 3 and 5 were open-ended. Conclusions: The young people of Brazzaville are afraid of AIDS. The main facts are relatively well known. Public information should concentrate on protective measures, beginning with 13 yr olds and preferably taking place in schools. 471 [Page 472](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/470) 8093 A PRETEST-POSTTEST EVALUATION OF AN AIDS AWARENESS WEEK C J Dommeyer*, J L Marquard**, J E Russell**, R L Taylor** *Department of Marketing, Calif. St. Univ., Northridge, **Student Health Center, Calif. St. Univ., Northridge Objective. To determine how an AIDS Awareness Week on a college campus would affect the AIDSrelated attitudes of the campus community. Methods. A four-page, self-administered questionnaire containing an AIDS Knowledge Test, a Fear of AIDS Scale, a Homophobic Scale, an AIDS Cautious Scale, and a list of potential AIDS information sources was used to survey a random sample of students, faculty, and staff two weeks prior to, and immediately after, AIDS Awareness Week. Usable questionnaires were returned by 538 students, 42 faculty members, and 50 staff members. Results and Conclusions. Although AIDS Awareness Week was successful in exposing the campus community to AIDS information, it had only marginal effects on changing AIDS-related attitudes. The ineffectiveness of the educational campaign was largely due to: (1) the pretest attitudes were already at desirable levels; (2) only a minor fraction of the campus community attended the highly motivating events of the campaign; and (3) faculty did not actively support the goals of the campaign. 8094 OCCURRENCE OF HIGH RISK BEHAVIOUR FOR HIV-INFECTION AMONG DANISH MEN 16-55 YEARS OF AGE. Denmark. Objective. To describe the occurrence of sexual behaviour involving increased risk of HIV-infection in a representative sample of Danish men 16-55 years of age in order to establish a better basis for the AIDS prevention. Method. Self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Results. 1155 men participated. Lifetime occurrence of homosexual experience was 3% and 14% for sexual contact with prostitutes. During the previous 12 months, 1% had homosexual contacts and 2% had contact with prostitutes. Furthermore, 22% had more than one female partner; these men only used condoms infrequently. Most of the men with more female partners had \"one night stands\" and the occurrence of previous STD's was above average in this group indicating that more female partners may actually be a risk factor for HIV-infection. All together, one third of the men had sexual behaviour, which may increase the risk of being infected with HIV, but half of the men did not think of themselves as being at risk for HIV-infection. Conclusion. These data indicate, that at present there is a certain potential for heterosexual spread of HIV-infection and that further health education is strongly needed. Notes: 8095 MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS' STIGMATIZATION TOWARD PERSONS WITH AIDS J. S. St. Lawrence */***, J. A. Kelly**, A. D. Owen***, I. G. Hogan*, R. A. Wilson* *Jackson State Univ., ** Univ. of Mississippi Medical Center, ***Univ. of Mississippi, Jackson, MS Objective. To assess clinical psychologists' attitudes toward persons with AIDS. Method. A national U.S. sample of 500 randomly-selected licensed clinical psychologists were mailed research packets containing a patient vignette and inventories on which impressions of the person described in the vignette were to be recorded. In a 2 X 2 completely crossed factorial design, subjects received vignettes identical except for the patient's disease (AIDS vs. leukemia) and sexual preference (heterosexual vs. homosexual). The return rate, unaffected by the type of portrayal a subject received, was 37% and subjects were equivalent across conditions in age, years in practice, and gender. Results. Subjects regarded AIDS patients, compared to leukemia patients, as more responsible for their illness, experiencing more pain, more dangerous to others, deserving of the best medical care, persons who should consider suicide and be quarantined (p<.0001). Subjects were less willing to interact with an AIDS patient even in casual interactions or to see them as patients (p.0002). However, they were more favorable toward a homosexual than toward an identically described heterosexual (p <.02). Conclusion. Mental health providers' negative attitudes reflected misunderstanding of AIDS rather than prejudice based on sexual preference. Continuing education is needed to alleviate mental health providers' unrealistic fears of persons with AIDS. 8096 PUBLIC AWARENESS AND ACCEPTANCE OF A HIV/ AIDS INFORMATION CAMPAIGN IN NORWAY. Pal Kraft*, Jostein Rise** * National Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway ** Institute of Community Dentistry, University of Oslo, Norway. Objective. To describe the public awareness and acceptance of \"The condom campaign\" in terms of individual characteristics and social processes. \"The condom campaign\" was a 100.000 $ camoaign run by the Directorate of Health. The purpose of the campaign was to increase awareness and eventually the use of condoms. The campaign was targeted towards thr general adult Norwegian population. The logo of the campaign alonng with the main educational themes formed a series of public advertisments which were displayed on 1500 billboards, 8000 posters and 6000 postcards. Methods. The empirical basis of the study stems from a nationwide interview survey of a two-stage cluster sample of 1066 persons being representative of the total Norwegian population aged 15 years and above. The data were analysed by means of contingency table analysis and Multiple Classification Analysis. Results. A total of 60 % accepted this kind of sexual information, and 70 % had noticed the campaign. The most important predictors of acceptance were in rank order: education, political preferece, age, interpersonal communication and residence, and they explained 16 % of the variance. As to awareness the most important predictors were: acceptance, age, education, interpersonal conmunication and urbanization, explaining 16 % of the variance. The results are discussed in terms of the the religious-moralistic axis in Norwegian politics, personal relevance and interpersonal communication. 472 [Page 473](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/471) 8097 PROCESSES AFFECTING THE DISTRIBUTION OF HIV INFECTION IN ICELAND, SIGRIDUR HARALDSDOTTIR, DIRECTORATE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, REYKJAVIK, ICELAND/YORK UNIVERSITY, TORONTO, CANADA. Populations conceptualized as a set of individuals linked together to form a social network provides a fruitful perspective for understanding the spread of infectious diseases, such as AIDS, where the infection is transmitted through personal relationships. Knowledge of network structures can therefore be helpful in projecting the rate and the extent of the spread of AIDS/ HIV infection. A study, using social network analysis, was carried out in Iceland in 1987. This approach requires detailed information about all (known) HIV carriers and their sexual relations. This detailed information does not normally exist. For the purpose of this study a questionnaire survey was designed. The HIV carriers were originally contacted through their physicians. Those willing to participate in the survey were subsequently either interviewed by the researcher or they completed the questionnaire themselves. The characteristics, the social and spatial mobility and sexual relations of HIV carriers were elicited. The response rate was adequate and the data gave a good image of the network through which the HIV infection has spread. This study assists in evaluating spread of AIDS through the Icelandic population and facilitates the prediction of future distribution. This study raises several general points: contact tracing, reporting of HIV cases and anonymity. 8098 AIDS AT SCHOOL, A SURVEY ON KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE CONCERNING AIDS, OF PUPILS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN AMSTERDAM. Richard Gieling (1), Andre Heuzer (1), Hans Adriaanse (2), Ralph Diclemente (3). (1) Hogeschool Holland, Diemen/Amsterdam; (2) Department of Health Education, University of Limburg, Maastricht; (3) Department of Epidemiology and Internal Health, University of San Francisco The knowledge and attitude concerning AIDS of pupils (N=533, age 12 to 19), attending secondary schools, were analyzed. This age-group was chosen since it is likely to experiment with sexuality. These students run a relatively high risk of contamination with the HIV-virus. We found out that in general the knowledge of pupils is rather high without great differences between the levels of education. Only the knowlege on how to get AIDS and certain medical information is relatively low. Furthermore, pupils are reasonably tolerant towards AIDS-patients, and don't want to exclude them from public life. Also, the more pupils know about AIDS, the less fear they have of getting the disease. Older, sexually more experienced youngsters are somewhat more frightened. By most pupils the use of condoms is accepted as a protection against AIDS, and many of them say they will use them. Most sexual experienced pupils report to have no problems using condoms. Nevertheless, one-third of all pupils feel somewhat scared for buying them. Baseline data acquired in the study are currently being used in nationwide implementation of AIDS education in secondary schools. Notes: 8099 THE STRATEGY OF SEXUAL EDUCATION AND AIDS INFORMATION IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF COPENHAGEN. Bente Hansen, Merete Lindholm Objective. As an element in the prevention of AIDS there is the borough of Copenhagen distributed free condoms to various groups of people including older school children. The attitude, of the population (school childrens), on the use of condoms is known only from comparatively few investigations. Methods. In December 1987 the borough of Copenhagen handed out questionnaires to about 400 school children, who represented 20% of fifteen year olds. They answered questions on their present sex habits and use of condoms. At the same time the investigation attempted to describe the attitudes to the compaign. Results and conclusions. The results from the questionnaires are still under process and the summary of the results will be presented in Stockholm in June 1988. 8100 Knowledge, Beliefs, Attitudes, Behave about AIDS in the age of14-20, Evaluation of an Educational Programm Bohm, W., Heckmann, W., Michel, S., Seyrer, Y. Sozialpadagogisches Institut, Berlin-W. In a special schoolprogram 52 physicians and 15 biologyteachers have been trained to inform all students older than 14 years during a one year period. The program was was implemented in all kind of schools in the city of Berlin-W. In 1987 15000 pupils have been reached, in June 1988 will be reached more than 35000. A recent study about \"AIDS in the public conciousness\" showed, that in the F.R.G. there are lacks of informations among the 16-20 years old male adolescents, especially those who are thaught in vocational school centers. We assessed the knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and behave about AIDS of 500 students in a vocational school center in Berlin-W., who are involved in the a.m. program. Knowledge about transmission, risk faktors, use of condoms, attitudes and beliefs are documented, by a preand post questionaire. During the program a high demand for more informations about sexuality and emotional problems, importance of sexuality for relationships and male and female behave in sexuality is recognized. The results of 200 students show in January 1988 significant differences in knowledge, beliefs and attitudes. Although before the campaign a high rate of students had a sufficient knowledge about transmission, after the campaign more students were willing to reduce their partners, to use condoms, and a high rate is willing to give social support to HIV-infected persons. Students trust in informations given by trainers. Study is comleted April 473 [Page 474](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/472) 8101 LONG-~'EP,. CONSEQUENCES OF AIDS ANTIBODY TESTING ON GAY AND BISEXUAL, EN Thomas J. Coates, S. I'orin, L IcKusick, C. Hoff, J. Catania, S. Kegeles, L. Pollock Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, San Francisco Objective. To describe how antibody testing affects high risk behavior, knowledge, and emotions among gay and bisexual men. Method. A cohort of 824 gay and bisexual men were recruited in SF in 1984, and have been surveyed annually ever since. As of Nov 87, 72% of the surviving members of the cohort were surveyed. In 84, we assessed desire for antibody testing. At each annual wave, we have assessed percentages being tested, and the percent in each group who continued to practice high risk behavior. In addition, we assessed stress and depression. Results. As of Nov 86, 44.5% had been tested for antibodies. About half of these had been tested by Nov 85, while the remainder were tested between 85 and 87. Antibody testing itself was associated with reductions in high risk behavior. Testing positive for antibodies was associated with further reductions in high risk behavior. As of Nov 86, 12 % of those testing positive continued to practice highrisk behavior, compared to 17 % of those testing negative and 24 % of those not receiving testing. By the time of the conference, data will be available on the acute (those tested between 86 and 87) vs the chronic (those tested between 85 and 86) effects of testing. To date, there have not been significant and long-standing stress or depression in the antibody positive group. Conclusions. Antibody testing, under conditions of anonymity and protection of civil rights, appears to be associated with reductions in high risk behavior. 8102 HIGH-RISK BEHAVIOR AND KNOWLEDGE OF HIV-ANTIBODY STATUS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CITY CLINIC COHORT Lynda S. Doll*, P O'Malley**, A. A Lifson**, L Cannon** *AIDS Program, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA **Department of Public Health, San Francisco, USA Objective. To assess the relationship between knowledge of HIV-antibody status and high-risk sexual behavior in homosexual and bisexual men. Methods. Cohort members were enrolled in 1978-80 for hepatitis B studies and were interviewed on one or more occasions in 1983-1987 for AIDS studies. Voluntary HIV-antibody testing and counseling were available from May 1985. 236 men interviewed between Oct. 1986 and Dec. 1987 were selected for analysis. Risk indices were defined as (# of partners) x (% of time practiced each activity). Results. No significant differences were found between 139 men who knew their HIV-antibody status (44% positive; 56% negative) and 97 men who did not (37% positive; 63% negative) on current; 1) numbers of steady and nonsteady partners; 2) exposure risk from all unprotected receptive anal and oral-genital contacts; 3) transmission risk from unprotected insertive anal contacts with steady partners. While only 8% of men engaged in unprotected insertive anal contacts with nonsteady partners, transmission risk through such behaviors was higher for seropositives who did not know their antibody status (p<.008). Conclusion. With the exception of transmission risk through unprotected insertive anal contacts with nonsteady partners, knowledge of HIV-antibody status was unrelated to high-risk sexual behaviors Notes: 8103 CHANGE IN SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR IN GAY MEN IN TRINIDAD. F Cleghorn*, R Waddell**, Z Cohen**, D Reidel***, W Blattner***, C Bartholomew****. *Caribbean Epidemiology Centre, Trinidad, West Indies **Research Triangle Institute, Washington, U.S.A. ***National Cancer Institute, Maryland, U.S.A. ****University of the West Indies, Trinidad, West Indies The number of homosexual and bisexual men developing AIDS in Trinidad has shown a downward trend in 1987 when compared with the previous 3 years. In comparison, the number of cases in heterosexual men and women has increased. In a study of the seroprevalence of HIV in Trinidad, 100 healthy homosexual/bisexual men were enrolled at a venereal disease clinic in Port of Spain in 1983/84. The seroprevalence of HIV at that time was 40%. In a 4 year follow up these participants were recalled and a questionnaire administered to obtain information on sexual behaviour over the past 12 months, the 4 years preceding that, the use of condoms during sex and their attitudes to the AIDS epidemic. Data on 37 participants are available thus far and revealed that the average number of partners has fallen significantly and there are trends toward more safe sex practices. 13/37 (35%) had had absolutely no passive anal intercourse in the 12 months prior to interview compared with 4/37 (10%) in the four years before that. 20/37 increased the use of condoms themselves or by their partners and 18 of these 20 related this change directly to the AIDS epidemic. 26/37 (70%) of respondents said that in 1983 they had very little or no knowledge of AIDS and were not afraid then of getting it. A similar 26/37% (70%) of respondents said that in 1987 they are extremely worried about getting AIDS and that they are now much more educated about the AIDS epidemic. 8104 Sexual Behaviors, Condom Use, and Perceptions of Personal Risks of HIV Infection reported in a national survey of American Adults. Charles F. Turner and Heather G. Miller, National Research Council--National Academy of Sciences, Washington D.C. Controlling the spread of the AIDS epidemic requires efforts to persuade an undetermined fraction of the population to modify their sexual behaviors in ways that will retard the transmission of HIV infection. The need to develop and target AIDS education and other interventions has generated a renewed appreciation of the importance of sustaining rigorous programs of research on human sexual behavior and on the relationship between cognition, risk perception, and behavior change. Results are reported from secondary analyses of data from a national sample of 2,095 American adults surveyed by a commercial survey organization during July, 1987. Preliminary results of these analyses suggest that a substantial number of Americans engage in behaviors that may place them at risk of HIV infections, e.g., unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners. For example, among 18-24 year olds, more than one-third of unmarried American men and about one-fifth of unmarried American women reported 3+ sexual partners during the previous year. A smaller (but non-trivial) proportion of married adults reported having 3+ sexual partners. Among unmarried men who reported 3+ sexual partners, roughly one-quarter reported that they had not purchased condoms during the previous year; married men were even less likely to report purchasing condoms. Nonetheless, when asked to rate their own level of risk of contracting AIDS on a 1 (Low) to 7 (High) scale, 59 percent of adults with 9+ partners rated their risk at the lowest level offered (1). Final results of these and other analyses will be presented. Implications of these results for educational and other efforts to change behavior will be discussed and methodological problems in conducting such research will be reviewed. 474 [Page 475](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/473) 8105 A PILOT STUDY OF SEXUAL LIFESTYLES IN A RANDOM SAMPLE OF THE UK POPYLATION. J. Wadsworth*, A.M. Johnson, P. Elliott*, St. Mary'T Hospital*, University College and Middlesex Schools of Medicine, Imperial College**, London U.K. Rates of sexual partner change are an important determinant of the transmission dynamics of HIV. Objective. To study sexual lifestyle in a random sample of UK population aged 16-64. Method. 2039 addresses were selected by multistage probability sampling and one person randomly selected from each household. Interviewees were questioned concerning demographic details: attitudes to AIDS, rates of sexual partner change, history of homosexuality, drug use and prostitute contact. Results. In 348 (17%) households, contact was unsuccessful. Interviews were obtained from 780 of 1271 (61%) addresses where contact was made and a person aged 16-64 was resident. Median reported lifetime heterosexual partners for men was 3 (range 0-400) and for women 2 (range 0-26) with high variability in sexual behaviour in both sexes. Lifetime rates of partner change decreased with increasing age suggesting a cohort effect in sexual behaviour. Conclusion. Valid population based data on sexual lifestyle is important to estimate the potential epidemic spread of HIV. Further work is necessary to improve response rates. 8106 CHANGES IN MALE HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOUR IN THE UNITED KINGDOM BETWEEN 1985 AND 1988. THOMAS J McMANUS* PETER DAVIES** PROFESSOR A COXON*** DEPARTMENT OF GENITO-URINARY MEDICINE, KING'S COLLEGE HOSPITAL, LONDON. SE5. ** SOUTH BANK POLYTECHNIC, LONDON. SEI ***UNIVERSITY OF WALES, CARDIFF. A survey of Homosexual Behaviour was carried out in the United Kingdom in 1985 and repeated this year. The questionnaire was self administered and distributed via gay magazines and newspapers. 1,300 replies were received in 1985 and 2,500 in 1988. Apart from basic demographic details, questions were asked about numbers of sexual partners, sexual behaviour, HIV testing, use of illicit drugs, sexual assault and condom use. Compared with 1985, respondents had fewer sexual partners, less anal intercourse (insertive and receptive), and increased use of condoms. The prevalence of HIV antibody sero positivity was less than that reported from Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinic's. Differences in behaviour were found between respondents living in London and those from outside London, but safer sex was practised by most respondents. About 20% of respondents had been sexually assaulted. This investigation is part of PROJECT SIGMA - sociosexual investigations of gay men and AIDS - which is funded by the Medical Research Council and Department of Health and Social Security. Notes: 8107 PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND DRUG INJECTION AMONG WITHIN AN EXPERIMENTAL METHADONE TREATMENT PROGRAM Don C. Des Jarlais*, R Senie**, S Yancovitz**, N Peyser**, D Mildvan**, *New State Div. of Substance Abuse Serv.,**NDRI,***NYC Dept. of Health,****NYU Med. Center, New York City, USA Objective: To examine the relationships between psychological distress and illicit drug injection among participants in an experimental methadone treatment program. AIDS is one of the many health and psychological problems associated with illicit drug injection; knowledge of the relationships among these problems will be necessary to design effective AIDS prevention programs for intravenous drug users. Methods: 339 subjects who were injecting heroin and cocaine were recruited for an experimental program that involved random assignment to a no-treatment control condition or to treatment with methadone medication but without any counseling services. 70 subjects withdrew from the study, primarily because they desired treatment but had been assigned to the control condition. Data included self-reported drug use, psychological distress (anxiety and depression) and urinalyses. Entry and one-month follow-up data are presented for 88 treatment and 121 control subjects. Results: Both psychological distress and drug injection were high at entry, but were not correlated across individuals. Drug injection declined significantly in the methadone group but showed little change in the control group. Distress declined significantly for both groups, with a greater decline in the methadone group. For the control group there again was no relationship between distress and drug injection. In the methadone group, the one-third who continued to inject reported significantly higher psychological distress (p <.01). Conclusions: There appears to be only a weak relationship between high psychological distress and drug injection-AIDS risk behavior. That distress was reduced in the control group without reduction of injection indicates the need for primary targetting of drug injection and sharing of injection equipment in AIDS prevention efforts. When pharmacologic efforts to control injection fail, however, the failure is likely to be related to pyschological distress, and more intensive services will be needed. 475 [Page 476](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/474) 9001 AIDS AND DENTISTRY: THE EDUCATIONAL ISSUES M. Andriolo, Jr., V. Pellegrino St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center, New York, N.Y. Objective. To develop an educational seminar which will address the concerns and needs of dental care providers in treating person with HIV infection. Methods. The seminar, \"AIDS and Dentistry: A Concept of Care,\" will be presented to small groups of dental care providers on site at The Spellman Center for HIV-Related Disease, St. Clare's comprehensive AIDS care facility. Results. The seminar will illustrate the recognition, diagnosis and treatment of the specific oral lesions commonly seen in patients with HIV infection, which may require biopsy, medication or other treatments. These lesions include candidiasis, hairy leukoplakia, Kaposi's sarcoma, gingival and periodontal problems and aphthous ulcerations. The initial diagnosis of AIDS/ ARC may be on the basis of oral lesions and the dental team may be instrumental in early detection. In addition AIDS has brought the dental commmunity to a heightened awareness regarding the development of practical infection control protocols. There is no need for extraordinary precautions for HIV infected patients and the concept of treating all patients as potentially infectious will be stressed. Instrument sterilization and disinfection of environmental surfaces will also discussed. Conclusion. Dentistry must be recognized as an important component of comprehensive AIDS medical care and dental care providers must be educated about the oral findings and appropriate treatment of persons with AIDS/ARC. 9002 DANISH DENTISTS' ATTITUDES AND REACTIONS TOWARDS HIV INFECTED Flemming Scheutz*, Royal Dental College, Aarhus, Denmark Disturbing reactions have been seen among dentists with regard to HIV infection. Objective. To study dentists' attitudes towards HIV infected and to look for predictor variables. Material & methods.A structured questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of all Danish dentists (n=250). Participation rate was 91%. Results. Topic (summary) Yes(90% CI) HIV positives should be treated at a special unit: 64%(58-69%) Prepared to treat HIV positives: 59%(51-62%) Afraid of becoming infected: 60%(54-65%) Problems with the employees: 50%(45-56%) Afraid of losing patients: 57%(52-63%) Uncertain with regard to hygienic precautions: 37%(32-42%) HIV positives should inform the dentist of their positivity: 93%(89-95%) HIV positive dentists should inform patients of their positivity: 59%(54-65%) Increased infection control after the appearence of HIV infection: 42%(37-48%) HIV ) Risk groups should be screened: 63%(57-68%) No predictor variables were found. Conclusion. Despite massive information, dentists seem negative with regard to HIV infected. Notes: 9003 RISK OF TRANSMITTING THE HIV TO HEALTH CARE WORKERS (HCW) EXPOSED TO HIV INFECTED BODY FLUIDS. E. Hernindez, JM. Gatell, T. Puyuelo, D. Mariscal, JM. Occupational Health Service, Infec. Diseases Unit. Haemostasy Unit. Hospital Clinic. Barcelona. Spain. Objective. To evaluate the risk of occupational transmission of HIV. Methods. We have prospectively followed a cohort of 58 HCW who reported at least one episode of direct exposure to body fluids of HIV infected patients (presence of antibodies against the HIV by at least two ELISA test and confirmed by Western Blot in 73.6 % of the cases) and who agreed to participate. Results. All 58 HCW denied risk factors for acquiring HIV infection in a confidential self - administered questionnaire. All were seronegative by an ELISA test (Vironostika anti HTLV-II Organon Tecknica), at the moment of the exposure to HIV-infected body-fluids and none of them seroconverted after a median follow-up of 6 months (range 1 month to 28 months). Conclusion. Our results as well as the findings of the other authors indicate that HCW are at minimum risk for HIV transmission from occupational exposure. 9004 EVIDENCE SUPPORTING W RISK ESTIMATES FOR HIV TRANSMISSI9N IN HEALTH ARE SET~ENGS Patrick Kelley, J Brundage,D Burke, Pomerantz, F Wann, R Miller, et al. Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington,DC; +SRA Technologies, Alexandria,VA Objective. To evaluate on a population basis the risk of HIV transmission in the health care setting. Methods. During 1985-87 active duty U.S. Army soldiers were screened for HIV infection as defined by two positive ELISA tests and confirmatory Western blots on the initial and a subsequent sample. This report covers 555,900 soldiers (including 37,738 health care personnel) on active duty on 30 Jun 86 and whose screening results were reported as of 19 Nov 87. Results. In a main effects logistic regression model controlling for age, sex, race-ethnic group, marital status, HIV endemicity, and years of service, the odds ratio associated with having a permanent medical job classification was 2.62 [95% CI=2.22, 3.10]. Risk ratios for medical vs. non-medical personnel were 0.88 [95% CI = 0.43, 1.81] for females and 2.98 [95% CI = 2.53, 3.52] for males. For male medical personnel being single (vs. married) was a major risk factor (RR = 3.20 [95% CI=2.31,4.43]). Risk ratios for male medical staff with high and intermediate level blood exposure relative to male care providers with minimal blood exposure were 0.91 [95% CI = 0.52, 1.59] and 1.14 [95% CI = 0.72, 1.80] respectively. Conclusion. Excess HIV risk among medical personnel could not be related to level of occupational blood exposure. 476 [Page 477](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/475) 9005 PERCEIVED PERSONAL RISK: IMPACT ON DENTISTS' INFECTION CONTROL BEHAVIORS B. Gerbert, B. Maguire, V. Badner, D. Greenspan, J. Greenspan, D. Barnes and R. Carlton Dental Public Health, Univ. of California, San Fran. ObJective. To assess whether the infection control behaviors of dentists are affected by their perception of potential personal risk (given the need to understand how to efficiently effect changes in the dentists' behavior). Methods. 66 San Francisco dentists were randomly selected for this pretest-posttest design. Assessments were made regarding their utilization of recommended infection control procedures. Data was collected just prior to the publication of the \"Klein Report\", and again four months later. This report described a case in which a dentist may have acquired HIV in his practice - from contact with an infected patient. The purpose of the assessments was to determine whether the dentists' greater awareness of their potential personal risks regarding AIDS-related infections would be manifested in their utilization of infection control behaviors. Results. There was a significant increase in the number of infection control practices utilized. Before the \"Klein Report\" was published, dentists used an average of 4.47 infection control procedures (out of the 8 listed). Four months later, the number increased to 5.64. Conclusion. Dentists'compliance to recommended infection control practices has been inadequate, and traditional education has been rather ineffective. These data indicate the powerful impact of single dramatic events, and suggest the potential of implementing more efficient methods to produce more satisfactory changes in dentists' behaviors. 9006 ARE UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS UNIVERSALLY NECESSARY? P. Gardner, M.D., B. Cooper, M.D. & J. Klimek, M.D., Hartford Hospital, Hartford, CT, USA Objective. Universal infection control precautions have been adopted in the USA without studies of their acceptance by health care workers (HCW). Nor has the \"universal\" component been proven to be necessary to interrupt transmission of HIV. We attempted to determine HCW knowledge of HIV epidemiology and their compliance with universal precautions, along with a cost analysis of such precautions. Methods. HCW in our 900 bed general hospital were surveyed regarding their knowledge of the epidemiology of HIV infection and their compliance with precautions. We compared our hospital's use of gloves, gowns and needle disposal apparatus pre and post institution of universal precautions. Results. HCW were well aware of important epidemiologic characteristics of the HIV infected population such as the predominance of males among cases and the infrequency of cases among non-transfused patients over 50. HCW were selective in their application of blood and body fluid precautions, utilizing them for patients they considered to be at risk for HIV infection, but often omitting them for low risk patients. In 1987, our hospital which admitted approximately 200 HIV infected patients spent $332,000 for additional supplies and materials to implement universal precautions. Conclusion. Consideration of well defined epidemiologic characteristics including age, sex and geographic distribution of HIV infection is warranted in implementing blood and body fluid precautions in a manner which is both cost effective and acceptable to the HCW. Notes: 9007 The Use of Latex and Vinyl Gloves for Protection Against HIV Infection D. Korniewicz, B. Laughon, A. Butz, E. Larson Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing Baltimore, Maryland This study is to compare the efficacy of latex and vinyl gloves as barriers to microorganisms. The current literature has investigated the strength, durability and permeability of latex gloves as recommended by the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM). To date no research is available regarding standards for testing vinyl gloves. Laidlau (1984) tested the permeability of both latex and vinyl gloves to antineoplastic agents and found that vinyl gloves were more permeable. With the majority of health care personnel involved in direct patient care procedures that require gloving for short to prolonged periods the need is clear to determine if microorganisms can penetrate vinyl or latex gloves. In most health care settings, vinyl gloves are provided to protect personnel from contaminated materials. However, no evidence of protective efficacy exists. We designed laboratory based experiments to test the permeability of vinyl and latex procedure gloves to S. marcescens. Both vinyl and latex gloves were stressed using a standardized set of manipulations designed to mimic activities performed during patient care. Gloved hands were immersed for 1 minute in a culture of S. marcescens, and a modified glove juice technique was used to culture the inside of each glove. Vinyl gloves were significantly more permeable to S. marcescens than latex gloves. We conclude that high inocula of bacteria can penetrate gloves, particularly vinyl, during routine clinical manipulations in the absence of obvious damage to the gloves. It is likely that these results are observed because of passage of organisms through defects in the gloves which may have been present but undetected initially or due to imposed stress. Further viral studies are indicated. 9008 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Survival in Blood Cultures. R.L. HODINKA, P. GILLIGAN, and L. SMILEY. UNC Sch. Med., Chapel Hill NC, USA The collection and processing of blood cultures presents a potential risk for HIV exposure to individuals handling these specimens. We have examined the survival of HIV in several blood culture systems using HIV-infected CEM cells at 5x10 cells/ml seeded into either a Columbia broth bottle (CB), Middlebrook 7H12 broth Bactec vial (BAC), or a combination of the Isolator (ISO) tube/BAC systems and incubated at 37 C. At 0,1,2, and 7 days, samoles fror each system were co-cultivated with uninfected CEMs to propagate virus. Cells inoculated to ISO tubes were held for up to 2 hours at room temperature prior to being transferred to BAC for incubation at 37 C. Supernatant fluids were assayed for virus-associated reverse transcriptase (RT) activity every 3 or 4 days for 42 days. Infectious virus was readily recovered from all specimens incubated in the CB or BAC alone. A delay of 25-29 days in the appearance of detectable RT activity for cells incubated in the ISO/BAC system was observed. Only samples incubated for 2 and 7 days in the ISO/BAC system were positive for RT activity. This would suggest the level of recoverable virus had been reduced by the ISO treatment and that some repair of damaged virus had occurred by prolonged incubation in BAC. These data indicate the need to follow strict infection control guidelines when performing blood cultures. 477 [Page 478](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/476) 9009 HIV-1, HIV-2, J.-L. *Harvard of Le Dantec and Hopital Fann, Dakar, Senegal. Objective. (1) To determine the prevalence of retroviral infection in hospital workers. (2) To better understand HBV infection in this population considering the similartiy in the way of transmission for HIV and HBV. Methods. Serum samples from 780 Dakar Hospital workers were screened for HIV antibodies by DuPont HTLV-III ELISA; antibodies were detected to both HIV-1 and HIV-2. ELISA + samples were confirmed by immunoblotting using HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigens separately. All sera were tested for HBeAg, Delta antibody, and HBV-DNA. Age, sex, years of experience, department, occupation and medical history are available for each coded serum sample. Results. There were 479 males and 301 females; mean age was 31 years +/- 8.2 years. HIV-1 HIV-2 HBsAG ANTI-HBc 1 (0.1%) 4 (0.5%) 138 (17.7%) 602 (77.2%) Conclusions. Hospital workers do not represent a Risk Group for HIV infection when compared with the healthy control population in Senegal. A closer analysis of HBV data showed a high rate of infection in the first three years working in the hospital (more than 30% HBsAg+), mainly among those who were not yet exposed to the virus. Protecting hospital personnel against HBV contamination and monitoring by serum screening should also limit HbV dissemination in this population. 9010 NEEDLESTICK HIV In health care workers, HIV infection has rarely been related to permcutaneous injury from a contaminated sharp object. We report a welldocumented instance of such a case. After drawing a blood sample from an AIDS patient in a vacutainer tube, a nurse stuck her finger with the lap ge bore needle of the adapter without blood injection. She immediately kept her finger in a 0,5% sodium hypochlorite solution during 15mn,accofi ding to the hospital guidelines. 23 days after the injury, she experienced abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever for 5 days. Then she developed anorexia and fatigue with a 5 kg weight loss until day: 45 when a left peripheral facial palsy occured. Clinical examination revealed generalised lymphadenopathy without fever. Leucocyte (N < 25UI), Alk Ph were normal. CSF yielded 4 lymphocytes/mm3, 0 RBC, protein 60 mg/dl, glucose 50 mg/dl, culture for bacterial and viral agent was negative. Results of serum and CSF samples for HIV antibodies are reported: Day 13 Day 45 ELISA: Elavia,Organon Abbott 2d gen. WB Weakly + + Day 56 Day 71 CSF Day 53 + + _ + + - Anti P24,P55, Anti P18,P24, All GP160 P55,GP160 Blood culture for HIV (day 71) and P24 antigenemia (day 13, 45) were negative. CD4 lymphocyte count was 1163/mm3 (CD4/CD8=1,33) and multitest score was 8/3 (day 71). Serologic and virological data ruled out other infection. Careful epidemiologic investigations of the nurse and her husband failed to identify any risk factor for HIV infection. Antibodies for HIV were undetectable by ELISA and WB technique in her husband on day 62. Health care workers have to be informed of the risk of occupational HIV transmission which is low but actual. In case of contaminated needle stick, HIV seroloqical survey is mandatory. Notes: 9011 THE UK APPROACH TO SAFE WORKING IN LABORATORIES HANDLING HIV. John R Keddie, Health & Safety Executive, Stanley Precinct, Bootle, England. Objective: To describe current UK standards relating to HIV laboratories and systems by which adherence to these standards are monitored. Methods: Containment standards in UK microbiology laboratories are laid down by the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP). The ACDP categorise pathogens into 4 hazard groups and specify detailed laboratory containment for each group. ACDP categorise HIV as a group 3 pathogen, although clinical diagnostic work is conducted at level 2. Research involving the propagation of HIV is undertaken at ACDP level 3. Specialist Microbiology Inspectors from the HQ of the UK Health & Safety Executive (HSE), monitor standards nationally in HIV labs and advise researchers on appropriate precautions. Persons intending to propagate HIV notify HSE. A Specialist Inspector visits each lab to discuss work and codes of practice, & inspects the facilities to ensure compliance. Generally this is completed prior to commencement of HIV research work. Compliance with ACDP requirements is assessed within the framework of the UK Health & Safety at Work etc Act 1974. Results. The standards present in HIV laboratories in the UK generally comply with laid down standards. The existence of detailed specifications for containment labs provide a minimum standard, widely acknowledged by researchers. The existence of a national co-ordinating body with wide-ranging legal powers ensures uniform standards are achieved throughout the UK. To date, there have been no reported cases of laboratory acquired HIV infection in the UK. 9012 RISK OF HIV AND HBV INFECTION AFTER ACCIDENTAL NEEDLESTICK Pizzocoloo, R Stellini', The accidental exposition of sanitary personnel to HIV infected needles requires the adoption of strict laboratoristic follow-ups in order to detect possible seroconversion. In this context, we have monitored 367 Health Care Workers (HCW) who had an accidental needlestick of the Spedali Civili di Brescia (Italy), following a surveillance protocol (proposed by the Sanitary Services of the Region Lombardy), consisting of medical consultation and laboratory tests (WBC, differential count, CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8 ratio, HIV ELISA Ab, and serological markers of HBV) at days 0, 30, 60, 90, 180, 360. Out of the 367 needlesticks 172 resulted to derive from HIV neg. and HBsAg neg. patients, while the remaining 195 derived from HIV pos. patients (40, two of which HBsAg pos.) or were of unknown origin (155). Among the 195 \"at risk\" expositions for HIV/HBV, 116 HCW (59.5%) showed the evidence of previous HBV immunity at day 0 and the remaining 69 have been administered gamma-globulins (day 0, Human BIG-Biagini) and successively vaccinated (HAEVAC B-Pasteur). At present, 77/195 (39.5%) exposed persons have completed the yearly follow-up schedule: none has shown HIV seroconversion, CD4/CD8 ratio alterations nor emergence of HBsAg and/or HBcAb positivity. According to our data, HIV infection probability after accidental needlestick seems to be extremely low. Furthermore, the adopted prophylactic schedule to prevent accidental HBV transmission prooved to be highly effective. 478 [Page 479](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/477) University, Mannequins are used for resuscitation (CPR) training. Simulating a \"worst-case scenario\", a mannequin was contaminated with HIV and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) decontamination procedures for CPR mannequins was assessed. Data on testing these guidelines specifically for HIV have not been oublished. E'THOD: The mannequin was contaminated with a virus saturated swab containina HIV 5x10 infectious units/ml. The decontamination procedure used. consisted of alcohol application (alcohol saturated sponcre or 70% isopropyl alcohol spray) for 5 or 10 seconds, CDC specified drying time of 30 sec. and mechanical action of 5 sec. of wipina the surface. After each maneuver, a sample from the mannequin surface was obtained, cultured with AA5 cells and tested for infectious virus by a reverse transcriptase assay of culture supernatants obtained at 6, 10 and 13 days post infection and by quantitative P24 antigen capture on day 13 supernatants. RESULTS: Infectious virus was detected only after mannequin contamination. No virus was detected after disinfection for 5 or 10 sec. with alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittant disinfection was demonstrated with either a saturated alcohol soonce or spray with a contact time of 5 seconds. Uipinq with a dry sponce did not add to the effect. This research tested the CDC Guidelines by assayirg the time needed for alcohol to achieve disinfection of an HIV contaminated CPR mannecuin. 9014 GUIDELINE FOR THE PROTECTION OF LABORATORY WORKERS FROM INFECTIOUS DISEASE TRANSMITTED BY BLOOD AND TISSUE. Stanley Bauer Pathology Department, Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, Bronx, NY and The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), Villanova, PA Objective. To describe the NCCLS Guideline for the Protection of Laboratory Workers from Infectious Disease Transmitted by Blood and Tissue. Methods. A task force was convened representing clinical laboratory professional organizations, U.S. Governmental Agencies, and manufacturers of in-vitro diagnostic products. The content of the guideline was developed by the task force in August, 1987. Results. The guideline is a bench level procedure manual. It covers all areas of clinical laboratory work as well as autopsy and surgical pathology work. Detailed instructions are given for the implementation of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommended Universal Blood and Body Fluid Precautions including sources of protective barrier equipment and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency registered Hospital Disinfectants. Explicit instructions for safe lab. practices, decontamination of spills, personnel practices and the handling of accidental needlestick inoculation of laboratory workers are given. A complete review of the guideline is given in this presentation together with photo-illustrations of equipment and techniques recommended. Conclusion. Adherence to the recommendations in the guideline should minimize even the small risk associated with laboratory exposure to HIV and HBV. Notes: 9015 and the Cooperative Needlestick Surveillance Group. *Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA. Objective. To estimate the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in health-care workers (HCWs) exposed to blood of HIV-infected patients. Methods. Epidemiologic data and serum for HIV-antibody testing were collected from HCWs with parenteral or mucous-membrane exposures to the blood of HIV-infected patients at baseline (within 30 days) and at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months postexposure. Results. As of September 30, 1987, 1019 HCWs had been tested for HIV antibody; 770 (76%) had needlesticks, 87 (9%) cuts with sharp objects, and 162 (16%) other exposures. Of the 1019 exposures, 37% were considered preventable if proper infection control precautions had been used: 17% were due to recapping used needles, 14% to improperly disposing of needles or sharp objects, and 6% to contamination of open wounds on ungloved hands. Of the 1019 HCWs, 917 HCWs were tested for HIV antibody at least 90 days after the exposure. Four (0.4%; upper limit of 95% confidence interval = 1.0%) tested positive. Baseline serum was not available for 1 of these HCWs; the remaining 3 represent seroconversions via needlestick. These seroconverters all suffered from an acute retroviral syndrome within 4 weeks after exposure, characterized by fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, myalgia, and arthralgia. Conclusions. The risk of seroconversion after exposure to the blood of an HIV-infected patient is <1%. Seroconversion in HCWs is commonly preceded by an acute retroviral syndrome. Proper infection control may have prevented 37% of the exposures. 9016 RISK FOR OCCUPATIONAL/NOSOCOMIAL TRANSMISSION OF HIV-1 AMONG HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS David MD, **Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, ***NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD Objective. This study is designed to measure the risk for occupational/ nosocomial transmission of HIV-1 among health-care providers (HCP). Methods. Using self-administered yearly questionnaires, yearly testing for antibody to HIV-1 and intensive follow-up of HCP having adverse exposures, we are prospectively following 983 HCP who have varying exposures to patients and specimens from patients with HIV-1 infection. The study began in 1983. Results. 126 percutaneous exposures (in 108 HCP) and 337 mucosal splashes (in 234 HCP) have occurred in the study. Although not sought directly in the questionnaire, HCP volunteered the occurrence of 1672 cutaneous exposures to blood or body fluids from 0/234 (0) Cutaneous exposures 1/616 (0.16) 0 All Participants 6/983 (0.06) 0 All six seropositve HCP (including the HCP reporting cutaneous exposure) were positive at study entry. All six acknowledge participation in behaviors associated with risk for community-acquired HIV-1 infection. Conclusion. The risk for occupational/nosocomial HIV-1 transmission is small and may be decreased further by adherence to Universal Precautions. 479 [Page 480](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/478) 9017 FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF CUTANEOUS EXPOSURES S TO BLOOD AND BODY FLUIDS AMONG HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN A REFERRAL HOSPITAL David K. Henderson, BJ Fahey, ME Willy, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD Objective. This study assesses the frequency and intensity of cutaneous exposures (CE) to blood and body fluids (BBF) among health care providers (HCP). Methods. Because participants in a longitudinal study of risk for occupational/nosocomial HIV-1 transmission volunteered frequent CE to blood, sputum, urine, feces, or other body fluids, we asked HCP in our study to complete a supplementary questionnaire quantitating CE to BBF from all patients (as well as those known to be HIV-1-infected) for the period 8-1-86 through 7-31-87. Respondents were asked to estimate either total exposures for the period, or, when CE were frequent, to estimate average monthly CE to BBF. Of 983 mailed questionnaires, 770 (78.3%) were completed and returned. Results. Of those responding, 668 (86.7%) noted that their duties involved handling/processing BBF. 442/668 acknowledged at least one CE to BBF during the study. No seroconversions occurred. Exposures by BBF were: # HCP Exposed 43 800/2,856 Conclusions. CE to BBF occurs far too frequently in the health care setting. Institution of universal precautions should significantly diminish the small risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens by CE. 9018 A COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF PERSONAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HIV RISK AMONG NURSING STAFF OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA AND NEW JERSEY Rita Fahrner*, JB Cohen*, SL Starr**, D Ilamolsky***, KM Nelson**** *San Francisco General Hospital, **HIealth Research and Educational Trust of New Jersey, *** Mt. Zion Hospital, ****Alta Bates-Herrick Hospital Objective: To assess nursing staff perceptions of personal and occupational HIIV risk and to explore fears about and obstacles to providing care to HIV infected patients. Methods: Anonymous questionnaires about HIV risk, infection control, and antibody testing were completed by all levels of nursing staff at large hospitals in four cities. Results: 34% of respondents reported high levels and 50% extremely high levels of risk from occupational exposure. Over 2/3 of respondents agreed or agreed strongly that they were fearful of acquiring AIDS through their work. Presumed knowledge of infection was still used to determine the extent of infection control by 93%, even though they felt that nursing interventions were more difficult when following these precautions. Conversely, staff were evenly divided on the issue of antibody testing of staff and patients. Work setting (OR, ER) and ethnicity were strongly associated with higher levels of concern. Conclusions: Despite increased knowledge about HIV, and experience in providing care for infected patients, a significant proportion of nursing staff report high levels of fear and selective compliance with appropriate infection control guidelines. These appear to be reinforced by ethnic background and particular work settings. Notes: 9019 UNRECOGNIZED HIV INFECTION IN GENERAL EMERGENCY PATIENTS. G. Kelen*, S. Fritz*, B. Qaqish**, R. Brookmeyer**, D. *Div. of Emergency Medicine, **School of Hyg. & Pub. Health, The Johns Hopkins University, ***NIAID (NIH), Maryland, USA. Objective: To determine the extent of unrecognized HIV infection and exposure to HCWs from emergency patients. Methods: Sera of 2303 consecutive adult emergency patients were anonymously analyzed for HIV antibodies by ELISA and Western Blot. Data was related to demographics, risk factors, clinical presentations and HCW exposure. Results: We found 119 (5.2%) patients to be HIV seropositive. The highest seroprevalence (14.0%) was found in black males between the ages of 25-34. Only 27 of the patients were known to have AIDS or ARC. The remaining 92 patients (4.0%) had unrecognized HIV infection. Nonwhites, and age less than 45 years were at higher risk of unrecognized infection (p<.0l). Excluding known HIV seropositive patients, 13.0% of the 276 patients with identified risk factors were seropositive. Among the 1999 patients in whom risk factors were not identified, 2.8% were seropositive. Seropositive patients were found among all categories of clinical presentations. Patients with penetrating trauma had a seroprevalence of 13.6%. This was the only clinical presentation with higher risk of unrecognized infection independent of other factors (p=.02). Unprotected exposure to patients' body fluids occurred in 84% of cases. Conclusion: Risk factor assessment practices in emergency settings are inadequate to reliably identify patients with HIV infection. \"Universal precautions\" should be consistently applied by all emergency HCWs whether or not HIV infection is known or suspected, and regardless of clinical presentation or risk factor status. 9020 AIDS IN HEALTH-CARE WORKERS--A SURVEILLANCE REPORT Mary Chamberland, L Conley, A Lifson, C White, K Castro, H Jaffe, T Dondero Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA, USA Objective. To summarize epidemiologic data for U.S. health-care workers (HCWs) with AIDS and to determine the mode of transmission for HCWs who do not report high risk sexual contact, intravenous-drug use or transfusion. Methods. All HCWs meeting the CDC AIDS case definition who do not report high-risk behavior were investigated by local health departments using a standard protocol. Results. As of November 23, 1987, 2,231 (6%) of 39,930 adults with AIDS for whom occupational information was available were HCWs. HCWs with AIDS were similar to other AIDS patients in that 92% were male, 63% were white, and the median age was 35 years. HCWs were more likely than non-HCWs to have an undetermined risk (5% vs. 3%, p<0.001). Of all HCWs initially reported with an undetermined risk and who were available for follow-up, 65% were reclassified when other risk factors were identified. Of the 108 HCWs currently listed with an undetermined risk, data were incomplete for 18 (17%) because of death or interview refusal and for 54 (50%) who were under investigation. No risk was identified for 36 (33%) who had additional follow-up. Sixteen (44%) of these 36 HCWs reported occupational needlestick and/or mucous membrane exposures to blood or other body fluids, but none involved known HIV-infected patients. Conclusion. Although some of the HCWs with undetermined risk probably acquired HIV infection through an unrecognized occupational exposure, these data support previous observations that the risk of transmission in health-care settings is low. 480 [Page 481](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/479) 9021 HIV SCREENING IN THE INTEREST OF EMPLOYEE PROTECTION Ricardo Edstrdm, M.D., Ph.D. National Board of Occupational Safety and Health, Solna, Sweden Objective. To obtain a national policy on the use of HIV antibody/ teats for employee health protection. Methods. A working group, composed of experts and representatives of employer and employee organisations, has assisted in helping the authority to issue a policy document. Results. A so called \"general recommendation\" from the Board will be issued in the spring of 1988. Conclusions. In the case of accidental unprotected contact with possibly contaminated blood there should be established routines for offering the test to the \"donor\" of blood - and routines for testing the exposed employee if needed. Personell serving in high prevalence areas should be instructed about HIV-risks and routinely tested. The policy is very restrictive about other protective uses of the test. 9022 NIJRSE SCREENING CL.INIC EVALUATION Gary Carr, Nancy L~ovejoy, Donald Abrams AIDS Clinic, San Francisco General Hospital San Francisco, Californiia, UJSA Objective: To describe the disposition of patients from an AIDS nurse screening clinic and determine what percentage of patients were referred into the AIDS care system. Methods: A retrospective study of 60 charts of patients who entered an AIDS nurse screening clinic during July to December, 1986, was conducted. Charts were audited for presenting complaint, duration of symptoms, and disposition. Results: Of a sample of 60 charts, 30 were self-referred and 27 were referred by health-care providers (3 were undetermined from the records). The majority in both groups had histories of HIV risk factors, symptoms of possible HIV-related disease, and received a diagnosis of AIDS or ARC as a result of the screening process. A third (37%) of the sample was brought into the AIDS clinic system for on-going care; of the remaining patients, 23% of self--referred and 19% of providerreferred were referred to other systems for problems not related to HIV. Conclusion: An AIDS nurse screening clinic has been effective in San Francisco for assessment of persons at risk for AIDS and providing appropriate referrr~ls for care.

Objective. The role of education to stem the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) goes far beyond the production of flyers, pamphlets, or posters. Effective educational measures aim at inducing a radical change of harmful behaviors in the general public and in those groups engaging in high-risk practices. Methods. Educators must drive home the messages that people are responsible for their own health and that their personal life-style decisions have a bearing on whether or not they will acquired the much dreaded HIV infection. In short, that the kind of life they choose today determines if they will live tomorrow. Results. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), is charged with executing WHO's Global Special Program on AIDS in the Americas. Specifically it coordinates research efforts, plans, implements, and evaluates national AIDS education programs in the Western Hemisphere. Details of PAHO's AIDS education program are presented, and the AIDS education activities in Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Mexico are described. Conclusion. General public awareness of the danger of AIDS and of the form of transmission of the HIV virus has been achieved in all countries surveyed. 9024 INNER-CITY MOBILE UNITS: AIDS EDUCATION AND PREVENTION Joyce Jackson, R Baxter State Department of Health, New Jersey Objective. To bring AIDS knowledgeable physician and counselor into inner-city neighborhoods. Provide education, prevention, early intervention and referral in regards to drug abuse, AIDS and other health problems to populations isolated from traditional health services. Method. Contracts originated with two community-based drug treatment programs. Mobile health van is staffed at all times by driver, AIDS trained counselor and physician. Physician conducts upper body physicals, provides medical information and referral. Counselor provides literature and referrals regarding health and social welfare concerns. Publicity generated for van services through media, community and church groups, and ex-addict street educators. Results. First van operational August, 1987; second December, 1987. Community response good, often waiting lines. Anonymous contact forms kept on all clients evaluated. Significant number are IVDUs, relatives or friends of IVDUs. Frequent referrals made to medical, counseling, and testing services. Conclusion. Mobile Health Vans can be effectively used to reach, educate, and provide referral to inner city residents isolated from traditional health services. These vans can also be used to reach isolated populations in rural areas and in developing countries. Notes: 9025 AIDS EDUCATION IN THE WORKPLACE Trish Halleron, M.P.H. American Foundation for AIDS Research 40 West 57th Street, Suite 406 New York, New York, 10019, USA Objective. To outline the elements necessary for a successful worksite education program. Methods. A seven-step approach will be detailed which provides guidelines and issues for discussion within the corporate structure allowing for the preparation of a complete strategy to handle policy development and employee education. Results. An AmFAR publication and sample materials will be displayed. Conclusion. The worksite provides an excellent opportunity to provide education to large numbers of the public. Through careful planning and design of an education program, companies can provide lifesaving information and prevent unnecessary disruption. 9026 AIDS EDUCATION AND PREVENTION IN A HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION Jams Buhes*, M Prasse** *Capitol Area Permanente Medical Group, **Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the MidAtlantic States, Washington, DC, USA Objective. USA Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) providing pre-paid health care services for defined enrollee populations are motivated to provide preventive services. An AIDS prevention program providing education at the physician, support staff, and enrollee level in a 170,000 member HMO is described. Methods. 6 6-hour off-site continuing medical education (CME) programs in progress for 30 physicians per session use guest and HMO physician faculty and are evaluated by participant physicians. A train-the-trainer session prepared HMO physician and support staff faculty to conduct 20, 2 hour work-site educational programs; these programs were evaluated by the participants. A quarterly newsletter delivered HMO-developed articles and a federal government pamphlet (printed but not otherwise provided by the government) to every enrollee home. Results. Physician personal CME expectations fulfilled: 8.35 points of possible 10 (N=31). Support staff reporting acquiring new knowledge: 86.2% (N=566). (Direct measurement of enrollees' knowledge pending.) Conclusion. HMO's can respond to their incentive to prevent AIDS by educating physicians, support staff and enrollees. 482 [Page 483](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/481) 9027 THE COMMUNITY IN ACTION Grace Smallwood, Townsville Australia The community is a great resource, this potential can be harnessed to develop AIDS Media and educational materials. Although Australia is not a developing country, black Australians have a health status similar to that of third world countries. The approach of using the Community as the main resource, is applicable to any Society, particularly one which has limited technical professional and monetary resources. Black health workers are the key element in the teaching of all health education. These workers have a practical knowledge of the culture. A commitment to raising the health status of the Community: 1. A knowledge of local health issues. 2. An understanding of the restrictions, facing any problems in the Community. 3. And a degree of credibility in the community, that visiting experts cannot quickly achieve. The approach in the development of health education taken has three main components: 1. Consultation - to work in black communities with local people. 2. Networking - to use established black health worker networks. 3. Pretesting of communication materials which involves black health workers in developing, pretesting and running public health campaigns. 9028 THE IMPACT OF HIV ON THE WORKPLACE M R Bailey, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London The workplace is a central feature of any community, workers are the providers for ccmunity and are key figures in family groups and often in the comminities. These key figures, the workers are brought together in the workplace. Here they may be contacted, educated, and counselled from this focal point, information about health and attitudes to behaviour can be disseminated into the community with the credibility that providers enjoy. This opportunity for health promotion through the workplace introduces a responsibility for employers additional to those they already carry. Employers have a responibility to protect the health and safety of their employees. Where any new hazard of HIV infection through work activites exists this must be confronted and appropriate arrangements made. Many workers will think that they are at risk; they will need education and counselling about occupational hazard. Almost all workers need education on the general hazards of HIV infection and AIDS, on personal behaviour questions and on a variety of AIDS related issues. The workplace should not be affected by an employee who has HIV infection or AIDS except in as far as any emplyee with a health problem affects the workplace. It may be necessary to be selevtive about the work tasks of emplyees with HIV infection or AIDS. Notes: 9029 CARING FOR AIDS PATIENTS IN A HOSPITAL BASED PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL GROUP PRACTICE. H. J. Makadon, B. Bush, D. Cotton, M. Weiner, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass., USA. Objective: To integrate care of AIDS patients into an existing general medical primary care group practice (GMPCGP) in order to provide continuity of care for patients, teaching for residents and prevent burn out of staff that occurs in segregated AIDS facilities. Methods: Beth Israel Healthcare Associates (HCA) is a GMPCGP in Boston that sees 26,000 patient visits each year for general medical care. Care is provided by rultidisciplinary teams that consist of faculty physicians and residents, nurse practitioners, a social worker, a psychiatrist and a nutritionist. Faculty physicians assume responsibility for providing primary care to identified AIDS patients, often supervising residents, and follow patients both in and out of hospital. The practice has its own infectious disease consultant, an AIDS specialist, to help evaluate difficult problems. Results: HCA currently cares for 50 AIDS patients. All have an identified faculty member as a primary care physician who provides continuity of care for patients and can consult with the practice AIDS specialist when necessary. Conclusion: Use of a hospital based GMPCGP is an excellent strategy to increase capacity to provide quality care to AIDS patients, teach residents, and avoid overuse and burn out of AIDS specialists. As the epidemic widens, diffusion of AIDS expertise and responsibility for care among primary care physicians will be important. This model will permit such diffusion. 9030 AIDS HOSPITAL CARE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND SURROUNDING COUNTIES, 1982-1986 Donald I. Abrams, M.D., Frances M. Strychaz, M.S.P.H. West Bay Hospital Conference Objective: To provide data and information for resource and policy planning for AIDS care. Methods: Abstracts of acute care discharges with an AIDS diagnosis from all 27 of the area's hospitals were compiled and analyzed. Results: Year Average Daily Census Annual Increase 1982 0.9 patients 1983 8.8 \" 826.7% 1984 38.1 \" 335.4% 1985 63.2 \" 65.7% 1986 98.2 \" 55.4% The initial high rate of growth in numbers of AIDS inpatients occurred in the suburban counties about a year and a half later than in San Francisco. The average length of stay dropped by over 5 days from 1982 to 1984 and continued to decrease at a slower rate to 12.0 days in 1986. The average re-admission rate was unchanged at approximately 1.7 per year. Nearly 40% of the patients were hospitalized more than once during the year. Approximately 40% of the hospitalizations were for respiratory diagnoses. Most (73%) patients were discharged to home. Approximately 30% were funded by Medicaid, 37% by private indemnity insurance and the remainder by HMO's and other private and public payors. In 1986 the average cost per day was $917 and per discharge $11,059. Conclusion: The numbers of acute hospitalizations continues to steadily increase although at a decreasing rate of growth. Most other variables unchanged 1984 - 86 483 [Page 484](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/482) 9031 AIDS IN THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION: DEMOGRAPHICS AND EPIDEMIOLOGY R. Allen, S. Mather AIDS Program Office, VA, Washington, DC, USA Objective. To describe the demographics of the individuals coming to the Veterans Administration (VA) for treatment of AIDS. Methods: The Veterans Administration has instituted a surveillance similar to and parallel with the Centers for Disease Control. By the end of 1987 approximately 127 VA medical centers had reported treating AIDS patients. The results of this surveillance will be presented. Results: One of the first cases of \"epidemic\" Kaposi's sarcoma was diagnosed at the New York VA Medical Center in 1979. Reporting began in the VA in 1983 and by the end of 1987 approximately 3,500 patients had been reported. The risk factor analysis shows that the AIDS patients cared for in the VA are different from the national AIDS population. Besides being all adult and almost totally male, homosexual or bisexual males account for only 46% of VA cases, compared to 65% in the reported AIDS population at large. The intravenous (IV) drug users account for 25% of the patients in the VA, compared to 17% of those AIDS patients reported in the general population. In like fashion, the ethnic groups are different with a greater percentage of black individuals coming to the VA. Conclusion: The VA is the largest comprehensive health care system in the United States. The VA utilizes a surveillance system to track the AIDS patients that have come for treatment. The VA patient differs from the USA reported AIDS patient in several areas. These data will be presented and discussion encouraged. 9032 AIDS BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL SERVICES: A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY MODEL Kathleen Sheridan*, J Phair* *Northwestern University Medical School Objective. Implementation and evaluation of ambulatorybased services for the spectrum of AIDS-related biopsychosocial problems. Methods. All medical, psychological, dental and legal referral sources were conceptually and physically combined in a large urban medical center. The biopsychosocial philosophy fosters a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to AIDS. Antibody testing; treatment clinics; neuropsychological assessment; individual, group, and couples psychotherapy; plus in-house dental and legal services are available to risk group members, friends, lovers, spouses, HIV+ persons and PWAs. The setting also houses epidemidlogic, drug trial, psychosocial, education, and health services evaluation research. It serves as clinical training site for predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows in health psychology, plus psychology, medical and psychiatry residents and fellows. Data on service utilization, cost-effectiveness, and quality of care are being analyzed. Conclusion. An integrated, multidisciplinary health care delivery system is presented as an alternative to, or reasonable re-allocation of, existing models of care and services resources. Notes: 9033 A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO THE CARE OF AIDS AND SYMPTOMATIC HIV INFECTED PATIENTS. Gary Garberl, Lothar Huebschl, Marie Kane2, Luce Sauvg3. Departments of Medicine1, Nursing2 and Social Work3, Ottawa General Hospital, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Objective. In the past year, Ottawa has seen a dramatic rise in the incidence of new cases of AIDS. In fact more cases were reported in 1937 compared to all previous years combined. To meet this increase and its impact on our hospital and community, we established a multidisciplinary comprehensive AIDS care clinic. Methods. This clinic treats the medical, social and psycholooical asoects of this disease in a multidisciplinary consultative team approach. Patients are assessed by the individual team members and a specific care plan is initiated. This includes goals for individual or nrouo counsellina, appropriate medical investigations, therapeutic ootions and followup scheduling. The patients are encouraned to continue to have close liaison with their family physician. Team members act as resource personnel for community based professionals and have a major role in educating patients, families, hospital staff and the community at large in prevention and impact of HIV infection. Results. In 1937 the clinic has grown from an initial 200 to 1200 patient visit/year. Over 150 patients are followed regularly. Patient satisfaction is very hioh. 95% of our patients continue to work full time, in many cases due to the support of team members. Outpatient medical therapy and palliative care are adapted as renuired. Conclusions. In summary, in centres where community support may not be organized, a hosoital based multidisciplinary team can helo maintain patients out of hosnital (reduced cost) and significantly imorove their quality of life. 9034 THE HIV TEAM: A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT CARE HIVINFECTED PATIENTS J. Klimek, M.D., L. Andrews, R.N., Hartford Hospital, Hartford, CT, USA Objective. To provide support for hospital staff and to meet the multiple needs of HIV ots, an ad-hoc multidisciplinary team, the HIV Team, was formed in 1/87. Ours is a 900 bed university-affiliated community hospital which admitted over 150 HIV-infected pts last year. Method. Team members include Epidemiology, Chemical Dependence, Dietary, Home Care, Medicine, Nursing, Pastoral Services, Pharmacy, Physical Medicine, Psychiatry and Social Service. Pts are followed on a referral basis. Services offered to the patient, family and significant others include education, counseling, and support. The team supports the staff through education, coordination of services, assistance in problem-solving and by providing emotional support. The team coordinator receives notification of pt admissions, makes initial visits, identifies which team members are required at which time, formulates a care plan, updates the care plan writes team progress notes and chairs periodic summary meetings. The team Drovides outpatient services including education, counseling, testing, followup, referral and placement, and research. Conclusion. This coordinated multidisciplinary effort (1) provides more effective allocation of hospital resources, (2) increases the quality of care through matching of resources with needs, (3) increases employee retention, (4) decreases the length of stay, and (5) decreases the number of readmissions of HIV pts. 484 [Page 485](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/483) 9035 9 HOSPITAL UTILIZATION BY PERSONS WITH AIDS IN SAN FRANCISCO, JANUARY 1984 - JUNE 1987 Robert T Chen, JL Barnhardt, GF Lemp, GW Rutherford Dept. of Public Health, San Francisco, California, USA Objective. To study trends in the proportion of living persons with AIDS (LPWA) in San Francisco (SF) who are hospitalized at any time from 1/84 to 6/87 and to estimate the future need for acute care hospital beds in SF. Method. The number of LPWAs at any time was obtained from an active surveillance system with >95% accuracy in previous validation studies. From 1/84 - 10/86, by convention,, all AIDS hospital discharges in SF were coded with ICD-9 code 279.19. Beginning in 11/86, ICD-9 codes 042 - 044 instead have been used. Results. Mean Number Mean LPWA Hospitalized/Month Year LPWA/Month Number (%) 1984 381 36 9.5 1985 689 61 8.8 1986 1047 88 8.4 1987 1372 110 8.0 p = NS Conclusion. The proportion of living PWAs in SF requiring hospitalization has declined slightly despite Large increases in the number of cases. This is probably due to the development in SF of extensive 1) outpatient clinical services and 2) out-of-hospital nursing, residential, and social services. Assuming that these services can be maintained at similar levels for new LPWAs, acute care hospital beds will be required for approximately 8% of LPWAs in the near future in SF. 9036 PHYSICIAN-ASSESSED NEEDS FOR STEP-DOWN CARE IN A GROUP OF PERSONS WITH AIDS. WC McCormick*, Sharon G Hopkins**, R Wood*,**. U of Washington* Dept. of Public Health**Seattle, WA, USA Objective. Patient satisfaction may be increased and cost savings realized by caring for persons with AIDS (PWAs) in less intensive settings than the acute care hospital. We sought to characterize PWAs who, in the judgment of their physicians, had spent days in the hospital that could have been better spent in a less specialized setting (step-down days) if such a unit existed. Methods. We obtained questionnaire data in the Fall of 1987 on PWAs (N=77) from their physicians, including age (36+6 yrs), length of illness (11.5+5.5 mos), diagnoses, care needs (medication, intravenous therapy (IV), transfusions), Karnovsky score, insurance, number of hospitalizations, and estimated number of step-down days. Results. Of the 77 PWAs, 56 had been hospitalized one or more times. Pneumocystis pneumonia was the commonest diagnosis in general (48 of 77) and in those who had been hospitalized (41 of 56), and Kaposi's sarcoma was the commonest among those who had never been hospitalized (11 of 21). In those who had been hospitalized, the number of step-down days (range 0-57) was related significantly, using linear regression, to number of hospitalizations (r=.54), Pneumocystis (r=.22), IV needs (r=.29, p<.05 in each case), and less so to Karnovsky score 50-80 (p=.06), length of illness (p=.07), and insurance (Medicaid vs. other, p=.08). Outliers had a strong influence on the significance of the regressions. Conclusion. Physician-assessed need for step-down care is related to diagnosis, hospitalizations, IV needs, Karnovsky score, illness duration, and insurance coverage. These factors need to be evaluated prospectively in hospitalized patients with long lengths of stay. Notes: 9037 AIDS EDUCATION AND PREVENTION AT THE WORKSITE: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY MODEL Donna L. Richter and F. Sy; University of South Carolina School of Public Health, Columbia, SC, USA Objective. To provide an interdisciplinary model for worksite AIDS education and prevention. Method. An interdisciplinary team composed of faculty members from public health, medicine, law, and philosophy combined to provide AIDS education for more than 5000 employees of a nine-campus major urban university. Employees are divided into general categories from senior management level to custodial workers. Several sessions for groups of 50-100 employees are scheduled. All employees receive intensive AIDS education regarding epidemiological, medical, psychosocial, ethical and legal aspects of AIDS. Pre and post test questionnaires are administered to determine changes in knowledge and attitudes about AIDS before and after each education program. Results. This project focuses on providing AIDS education to reduce employee fear and resistance to working with people with AIDS. The initial program for senior management was conducted on Jan. 21, 1988. It was so successful on the university campus that it is being extended to the business community as well. AIDS education programs for other employees are scheduled from Feb. to April, 1988. Evaluation of the impact of the AIDS education programs will be presented. Conclusion. The interdisciplinary approach to worksite AIDS education is effective in preventing unnecessary fear, confusion and disruption in the workplace. 9038 MANAGEMENT OF HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS: EXPERIENCE AT POLICLINICO \"A. Gemelli\" - Roma - Italy Objective. To relate the main aspects of the management of HIV-infected patients (symptom free or with ARC or AIDS) at Policlinico \"Agostino Gemelli\" - Catholic University - Rome. Methods. The Department of Infectious Diseases (ID) and Direzione Sanitaria in conjunction with Servizio (SFA), Servizi centralizzati di diagnosi (hospital diagnostic laboratories) and the other Departments, planed the following procedures: SFA --I out patient service \\l: ID ward consultants in hospital diagnostic laboratoriesl other wards 1. preferential pathways for biological specimens directed to laboratories, and for refuses to be eliminated; 2. non specific preventive measures (gloves, masks, eyewears, gowns, etc.) in laboratories, operating and delivery rooms etc.; 3. isolation of the in-patients; 4. psycological and educatio nal service for patients 5.continuing edu cational (and psycological) support for -the medical staff. Conclusion. Remarkable aspects of the whole activity are to be seen in: i) bridging between hospital and domicilia ry care; ii) treatment of all the aspects of the disease with particular interest to psycological aspects. 485 [Page 486](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/484) 9039 ROLE OF OUTPATIENT CARE W.Rozenbaum, S.Gharakhanian, Hospital, Paris. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the potential of comprehensive outpatient management in the light of the challenge to medical institutions posed by the HIV epidemic. METHODS:The activity of our AIDS clinic, located in an infectious-diseases hospital, was analyzed over 6 months (Jun-Nov 87). The following services were offered to 1089 patients on an ongoing basis: outpatient care, day care, home care, psycho-social support. RESULTS: 260 patients were admitted to the day clinic, on average 4 times (1-24). Of this group, 73 had AIDS, 51 were CDC IV-A, and 36 were CDC II-III. Of the daycare group, 95 (37%) required hospitalization an average of 1.4 times, for a mean duration of 22 days (1-93). 15 patients entered intensive care; 17 patients died. A further 20 (8%) of patients receiving day care needed home care for a mean duration of 31 days (4-182); 18 of these patients had AIDS and 2 were IV-A. Day-care admissions were for diagnostic procedures including broncho-alveolar endoscopy, lumbar puncture, bone-marrow aspiration and biopsy, thora-centesis and abdominal paracentesis, all done on a regular basis. In addition, 916 out of 1139 total day-care admissions(80%) were for drug treatment: or antibiotics. CONCLUSION:Medical care of HIV-infected persons, even with advanced disease, is possible in an outpatient structure offering multiple medical and social services. The quality of medical care in this setting and the cost-benefit aspects are to be evaluated. 9040 THE INSTITUE FOR IMMUNOLOGICAL DISORDERS (IID): AN EXPERIMENT IN THE DELIVERY OF CARE FOR HIV INFECTION. Peter W.A.Mansell. -he University of Texas M.D.Anderson Hospital, Houston, Texas. USA. Objective. To provide economical, humane,investigational medical care for HIV infected persons,. Methods/Results Following a year of negotiations between AMI Inc.,a hospital owning company, and UTexas IID was opened in September 1986, IID was the clinical locus of a $5.8M AIDS Treatment and Evaluation Unit (ATEU) contract with a full time academic staff of 5.As well as ATEU suppprt many trials of antiviral, antibiotic,antineoplatic and immunomodulatory drugs were sponsored by drug companies (260 patients entered in all). Objectives of IID were also to provide supportive care,education, screening and to reduce the cost of care. A previous out patient model was refined based on.five years experience. 726 patients were registered at IID with up to 1000 out patient visits a month. Only 196 patients were admitted with a total of 444 admissions, mean stay 10.2 days, 118 patients died..On December 11th. 1987 IID closed with an estimated loss of $12M to AMI, the main contributory factors being the. cost of indigent care born by AMI and lack of community support. Conclusions. Excellent standard and investigational care can be given to HIV infected persons in an ambulatory model using infusion techniques and psycho-social,dietary,physical and respiratory therapy support with home care.

Methods: A primary care facilitator was appointed to work directly with GPs and community nurses to assist in the developement of the skills and services necessary for the home care of persons with HIV disease. This development is closely linked with prevention and health promotion in general practice. Results: A study of general practitioners (see abstract: Kirsch, et al: GPs and the Management of HIV infecttion) determined that while GPs were already highly involved in the education and care of their patients, significant areas of work remained before the ideal of care at home could be achieved. Regular updates, in the form of teaching sessions and circulars; training sessions for nursing staff were necessary to provide the knowledge base upon which effective care could be based. Links were also developed between other agencies involved in home care, such as social services and the voluntary sector, to provide a continuity of care for patients. Conclusion: An approach based on the development of resouces and knowledge at primary care level is essential to the effective dilivery of care at home for persons with HIV disease. Furthermore, health promotion and education for patients was emphasised as a priority of primary care. 486 [Page 487](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/485) 9043 THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE/SENSITIVE AIDS CLINIC SERVING PEOPLE OF COLOR AT A MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL Paul A. Paroski Jr MD, Iris Davis MD, Peter Laqueur MSW, Mary Jo Kennedy MD - Woodhull Medical & Mental Health Center, Brooklyn, NY USA Objective. This presentation describes how Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, Brooklyn, NY (a division of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation) opened and staffed its AIDS Assessment Unit addressing the specific needs of the population that it served. Methods & Results. Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center is a 550 bed tertiary care municipal facility which has a Department of Ambulatory Care serving over 1400 patient visits a day. The Bushwick Health Care Center, one of Woodhull's primary care off-site facilities, was designated as the AIDS Assessment Unit, targeted to serve primarily the black and hispanic population of Brooklyn. The Bushwick Health Center is almost exclusively staffed by women of color. In an attempt to address the specific needs of the target population, special emphasis was placed on staff selection. Discussion will occur of methods of doing so within the confines of the civil service system. After the staff was brought on board, specific training events were implemented allowing for appropriate staff development. In addition, on going educational activities center around specific issues identified by both staff and administration. Conclusion. Through these deliberate actions, we have developed a municipal facility that is culturally sensitive and appropriate for the communities served - IV drug users, their sexual partners and the hidden gay/lesbian communities of color; providing the highest quality of health care without regard for ability to pay. 9044 ADDRESSING THE NEED: CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE TREATMENT MODALITIES Iris Davis MD, Peter Laqueur MSW, Mary Jo Kennedy MD, Paul A. Paroski Jr MD - Woodhull Medical & Mental Health Center, Brooklyn, NY USA OBJECTIVE: This presentation describes the different treatment modalities, including drug therapy, psychosocial intervention, outreach and education, necessary to address the unique characteristics of the patient population seen at a communitybased out-patient facility for HIV infected individuals. METHODS: Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, a division of NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation, is a 550 bed tertiary care municipal hospital located in Brooklyn, New York. The Bushwick Health Center, one of Woodhull's primary care off-site facilities, was designated as the AIDS Assessment Unit, serving a largely black and hispanic community which has a high incidence of drug use and tuberculosis. RESULTS: Unusual patient characteristics noted include: selfreferred female heterosexual partners of IVDUs or bisexual men who do not have any other risk factors; a varied group of IVDUs including current, ex-, and recreational users; and the \"hidden\" gay/bisexual community not traditionally identified in either gay or minority cultures. Initial data indicate that patient response to treatment differs from that reported in the literature. Due to multiple socioeconomic factors, the lack of culturally sensitive AIDS services, and poor health and nutritional status, patients present late in the course of infection and do not respond to treatment in the same manner as previously described. CONCLUSION: There is a need for enhanced culturally sensitive education and prevention services as well as increased research into the treatment modalities and drug therapies most appropriate for this population.

To describe the program for health care of patients with HIV infection created by the Department of Health of Basque Country. Methods. Basque Country is a community of 2.200.000 inhabitants - with somewhat over 6.000 heroin addicts,52% of whom have HIV infection.In December 1987 the Department of Health of Basque Country - initiated the first program in Spain of integrated attention for - patients infected with HIV. This program is based on the coordinated efforts of a hospital AIDS Unit, out-patient clinic, day care - facility, psychological support team, home care team and family - practitioners. Results. The firts six months' experience of a AIDS Unit ( Hospital Nuestra Sefora de ArAnzazu, San Sebastian) is presented, including the problems that have arisen in the course of its creation, the me dical and psychological problems of sanitary personnel, the difficulties of relating to patients (75% are heroin addicts), and problems of coordination with the home care team and community health services. The mean hospital stay of AIDS patients and number of admissions be fore and after beginning this program are compared. Conclusion. A discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of - the integrated care program for patients with HIV infection is - offered.

Wendy Naylor. Jill Eddy. Haemophilia Toundation of Australia & National Advisory Committee on AIDS. 4*Writer, educator. A'*^Social Worker. Melbourne. Members of the Haemophilia Foundation of Australia with an HIV infected family member have reflected the need for specialized, targetted educational materials. Initially for: Information on AIDS and all its ramifications expressed in layman's language and in terms relating directly to their haemophilia. Subsequently for: A leaflet to address the nervousness many using concentrates still have, (either conscious or unconscious) by giving reassurance in the use of blood products. What can we do to help keep the immune system healthy? A booklet that presents suggested strategies to improve general health and that help give some feeling of control in the AIDS situation, (without inducing further guilt if progression still occurs.) Reinforcing responsible protective sex messages for young men and.couples. Endeavouring to capture the attention of those who may have previously \"switched off\" reading AIDS newsletter items. A Haemophilia Speaker's Kit was also produced to answer the need for the increased number of requests for information on haemophilia raised by the link with HIV. This paper will: Present the objectives of the materials. Outline the process used to develop them. Display copies of each. Give a summary evaluation of their impact on the targetted groups. Notes: 9049 INTERPRETING PHYSICIAN RESPONSE TO AIDS Kathryn M Taylor* PhD, Harvey A Skinner* PhD, Maria Shapiro* MD *Dept. of Behavioural Science, University of Toronto Objective: To put forward a framework that will (1) serve as a conceptual basis for organizing the explosion of information in the literature on physicians and AIDS, and (2) provide a model for guiding empirical research that seeks to understand and predict physicians' participation in the prevention and medical management of AIDS. Since 1980 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has been a leading public health problem. AIDS incorporates the gravest features of serious illness: it is both contagious and universally fatal. Attempts to comprehend the extreme nature of physician reaction to AIDS have met with great difficulty since AIDS brings into question norms and assumptions that have traditionally been unquestioned. Method: Using a measuring instrument, the Physicians AIDS Profile, we are conducting a national survey of 1,800 Canadian physicians, considering how (a) characteristics of the disease, (b) elements of the health care system, and (c) physician attitudes, interact to influence physicians' clinical and personal practices. AIDS and the risks of AIDS are responsible for new delineations of physician responsibility and modification of prevailing beliefs of physician autonomy that will lead to a redefinition of the role of the physician in the 21st century. 9050 GENERAL PRACTITIONERS AND MANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION (refBritish Medical Journal,n press) G Kirsch,R T Mayon-White,P A Anderson; District Dept of Community Medicine.Oxfordshire Health Authority, UK. Objective: To survey education,knowledge, current practice and attitudes of GPs in relationship to the management of HIV Infection and assess the implications for the development of prevention and treatment outside hospitals. Methods: \"he sample comprised 280 GPs. They were sent a questionnaire comprised of six components(public education,professional education,HIV antibody testing,management of AIDS patients,attitudes to HIV infection and patients from different risk groups). Results; Response rate was 84%. 90% of respondents had given advice to patients about HIV,50% had done the HIV antibody test and 25% were caring for an infected individual. there was a positive relationship between doctors' attitudes and both the amount of professional education (r=.17,p 0.01)and the number of patients who had asked questions about AIDS (r=0.22,p 0.001). The more education and the higher the involvement with HIV,the better was their overall attitude. GPs supported the involvement of primary care teams in the management of patients at home. They also expressed a comnitment to the education necessary to overcome difficulties. Conclusion: Well informed GPs are likely to have better attitudes to the prevention and care of HIV infection. They are also more open to the management of patients at home. To act upon these results, a primary care facilitator was appointed. (see abstract: Kirsch, et al; Community Based Strategies for the Prevention of HIV). 488 [Page 489](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/487) 9051 AIDS and the Duty to Treat: Risk, Responsibility and Health Care. Ronald Bayer, The Hastings Center, Briarcliff Manor, NY, USA During the last year in the United States, a number of well-publicized instances have surfaced of physicians refusing to treat HIV-infected patients. These cases suggest a profound erosion in the traditional conception of the duty of health workers to care for those in need. This paper will review the American controversy, the response of professional medical associations and will underscore the broader social and moral implications of how this controversy is resolved. 9052 HOW TO TALK TO HEALTH CARE WORKERS ABOUT AIDS: A GUIDE FOR MANAGERS William Sabella Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut, USA Objective: To train health care workers about AIDS and HIV infection using a \"Train-the-trainer\" model. Methods: Yale New Haven Hospital has a history of providing compassionate services to people with AIDS, those who are infected with HIV and their families. Staff education has been a key factor in reducing hospital personnel fears of inadvertent exposure to HIV and has increased AIDS knowledge and understanding. Appropriate, compassionate care for people with HIV related illnesses can be provided when all hospital employees understand and believe AIDS facts. In order to facilitate the dissemination of AIDS information throughout the hospital, a comprehensive AIDS train the trainer manual has been developed and implemented. The manual includes an AIDS curriculum, learning objectives, transparencies, glossary and an evaluation component. Substantiating documents, pamphlets, video and community resources and bibliography are included. Results: Ongoing evaluation indicates a marked increase in health care worker knowledge and understanding of AIDS as well as a feeling that personal questions and concerns had been addressed. Conclusion: Comprehensive AIDS education intervention in the hospital setting improves the health care worker's attitude, knowledge and understanding of HIV illness. Notes: 9053 CHANGING DENTISTS' KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS RELATING TO AIDS: A CONTROLLED EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION B. Gerbert, B. Maguire, V. Badner, D. Greenspan, J. Greenspan, D. Barnes and R. Carlton Dental Public Health, Univ. of California, San Fran. Ob iective. To test the efficacy of an educational intervention designed to improve dentists' responses to the AIDS epidemic by improving their oral diagnosis skills and increasing their willingness to treat AIDS patients. Methods. 102 San Fran. dentists were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental subjects received a 4-month educational intervention with 3 components: computerized feedback comparing participants' own knowledge, attitudes and behaviors to those of fellow participants and to an ideal, periodic newsletters, and telephone conference calls with experts. Five outcomes were assessed using self-report questionnaires before and after the intervention. Results. There were significant differences (p (.05) between the groups on all five outcome variables. The mean changes from pretest to posttest were: Control Exp'l t Knowledge of HIV 1.0 2.6 3.37 <.002 ID of HIV lesions -0.5 1.3 3.94 (.001 Willingness to treat 3.1 6.7 2.32 <.024 Complete Intraoral Exam 0.0 2.3 2.60 <.013 Complete Extraoral Exam 0.8 2.4 2.63 <.012 Conclusion. This office-based educational intervention increased dentists' knowledge regarding HIV and its oral manifestations. It also increased their willingness to render care to infected patients and it facilitated the behavioral changes required to make this care effective. 9054 E AND POST ASSSS OF AID-HIV SEDUCATION (E) ON THE INFECTION OONTROL PRACTICES (ICP), KNOWIEDGE (K), AND ATITIUDES (A) OF PHYSICIANS (MD), NURSES (RN), MEDICAL STUDENTS AND WORKSITE EMPLOYEES (WE) Harvey Bartnof MD*#, J Ziegler*, D W Feigal*, R Edison*, and R Juster*; *U.C. San Francisco School of Medicine, #AIDS Virus Education and Research Institute (AVERI) Objective. To evaluate the effects of AIDS-HIV E on MD, RN, health provider students (HPS), and non-health care WE by administering pre/post assessment scales. Methods. 2-, 4-, 19-, and 160-hour AIDS-HIV E programs were presented by UCSF (n=46), RN WE (n=563). Pre/post HIV K, ICP, and A scales were completed by attendees before commencing and after completing the E programs. Results. AIDS-HIV K increased significantly in all groups (p<0.001). ICP and K which would decrease nosocomial transmission of HIV improved in RN (p<0.02) and in same MD groups (p<0.05); HPS data are pending. Attitudes optimal for HIV-patient care improved in the RN (p<0.04), but not the MD (p=0.10). Fear of AIDS patients by WE decreased significantly (p<0.01). Conclusion. AIDS-HIV E which includes biomedical and psychosocial topics not only increases K for MD, RN, HPS, and WE, but also improves reported ICP by some, which would limit nosooomial transmission of HIV. Addressing psychosocial and phobic issues of HIV appears to be a requisite for effecting appropriate MD, RN, HPS, and WE response to the HIV-infected patient. Pre/post E scales by AVERI are useful: (1) in evaluating HIV-related K, ICP, and A; and (2) in identifying persistent HIV misinformation, risky ICP, and AIDS fears. 489 [Page 490](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/488) 9055 AN EVALUATION OF A TRAINING PROGRAM FOR AIDS COUNSELORS Nicholas Freudenberg, Jacalyn Lee, Elizabeth Schnee Hunter College School of Health Sciences/CUNY/New York Objective. To assess what factors influence how health care workers who have received training in AIDS counseling and risk reduction use their skills in their work setting. Methods. Sixty-five outpatient nurses, social workers and other health professionals serving high risk populations attended a five day workshop on how to integrate AIDS counseling and education into their regular interactions with patients. Four to six months later, investigators interviewed trainees to determine what AIDS prevention activities they were carrying out. They were also asked about previous experiences and attitudes towards high risk populations, and about institutional support for AIDS prevention activities. Responses were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to determine how the counselors' attitudes, previous experience and institutional support influenced their level of AIDS prevention activity. Results. Preliminary analyses indicate that institutional factors such as time availability, patient flow and management's perceived commitment to AIDS prevention strongly influence how effectively AIDS counselors use newly acquired skills. Conclusions. Institutions seeking to train existing staff to provide AIDS counseling and education to those at high risk of HIV infection must develop appropriate criteria for selecting trainees and for providing trained staff with the institutional support needed to carry out their new functions. 9056 \"AIDS INSIDE\". A TRAINING PACKAGE FOR STAFF IN PENAL ESTABLISHMENTS IN ENGLAND AND WALES. L. Curran*, J. Gallwey**, J. Kilgour***, D. Miller***. *HM Prison **Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, ***HM Prison Medical Service, ****Middlesex Hospital Medical School, London. Objective. To educate staff in penal establishments in order to reduce inappropriate anxieties and promote good standards of practice in health and safety as regards AIDS and HIV infection. Methods. Community anxieties generated by AIDS/HIV have produced problems in the management of prison populations. A working party of outside, independent experts in AIDS/HIV and senior, experienced prison personnel prepared training packages for staff and inmates. The presentation discusses the rationale behind the package designed for staff which was completed in October 1987 and is currently being implemented and evaluated on a national basis with a target of 25% of staff being educated within a year. The package consists of a video and training manual detailing step by step presentation together with extensive resource material and is delivered by specially trained officers from each establishment in a one hour session thus permitting secondment of staff without disruption of prison management routine. Video showings and the accompanying leaflet will be made available. Notes: 9057 Implementing the \"Train the Trainer\" Model: An Efficient Approach to Peer AIDS Education. Janet Bath, Kathleen Williams, Laurie Kunches. AIDS Program, Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Training groups to be AIDS educators to their peers is a novel and efficient approach for maximizing hunan resources to reach those at risk for HIV infection or those directly affected by AIDS. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, AIDS Education Unit, has developed a \"train the trainer\" model that consists of a curriculum adapted to specific populations with a two day intensive interactive training and follow-up sessions and materials for distribution. The overall goal is to train participants to educate their peers which included persons of color from 20-60 years, equal numbers of men and women, and some whom were bilingual. They included medical students, law eforcement officers and nurses. Systematic criticism of the model was received and the necessary revisions have been implemented. The knowledge and expertise gained from pretesting the training enhances this model as an invaluable teaching method for other health education specialists. This paper is a descriptive study as well as an analysis of the knowledge and attitude change from pretest to posttest of about forty new trainees participating in the \"train the trainer\" program in 1988. Their primary target audiences or peers are hospital nurses, nursing staff, home care staff, local health department staff, school nurses, and staff at daycare centers and early intervention programs. The major indices examined measure 1) AIDS knowledge and attitude change, 2) the ability to accurately orally present AIDS facts, 3) the ability to answer and address sensitive, sexually explicit, and \"difficult to answer\" questions, and 4) the ability to use appropriate teaching tools, such as flipcharts and group facilitation. Data on the above stated indices will be collected, presented and discussed. In addition, an indepth description of effective ways to implement, structure, and format the AIDS \"train the trainer\" session, content for follow-up sessions, necessaryresources, and criteria for selection of trainees will be presented. 9058 HEALTH PROVIDERS (HP) & WORKSITE EMPLOYEES (WE) ONSITE AIDS-HIV (A-H) CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAMS & INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS BY THE AIDS VIRUS EDUCATION & RESEARCH INSTITUTE (AVERI) Harvey S. Bartnof MD, AVERI & Univ. of Calif. San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco Objective. To describe the A-H educational programs (EP), services, and materials, as well as research activities offered by AVERI. Methods. The expanding pandemic of HIV infections and disease presents a significant challenge in educating HP about new concepts in pathobiology, altered clinical manifestations and courses associated with a new human pathogen, effective treatments for 10 & 20 pathologies, infection control (IC) practices which limit nosocomial transmission (NT) of HIV, and socio/psychosocial HP' HIV-related issues. It cannot be assumed that HP and HP-care systems are knowledgable about complete A-H-related curricula. WE also need A-H education. Results. In 1985, AVERI was founded to deal with these issues. Onsite A-H continuing education curricula have been developed and implemented for MDs, RNs & other HP. A-H Prevention/Knowledge (P/K) and IC Study Guide Modules as well as Certification Scales to document HIV and IC knowledge have also been developed and implemented. These EP, materials, and Certificates have been used in No. America to accomplish issues in \"Methods.\" EP are conducted by UCSF MDs. The pandemic itself and the EP allow for varied research. Conclusion. Specific A-H related EP, materials and P/K & IC Certification are described for HP & WE. Further implementation will limit NT & non-NT of HIV and will optimize A-H knowledge, patient care & interactions. 490 [Page 491](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/489) 9059 DESIGNING TRAINING PROGRAMS TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WORKING IN AIDS Judy Macks, LCSW AIDS Health Project, University of California, San Francisco, California,USA Objective. To discuss developmental trends in the training of health care professionals regarding AIDS and mental health, and to discuss tie effectiveness of various training designs to meet these changing needs. Methods. Documentation of types of training requests received by the UCSF AIDS Health Project and data were evaluated by client satisfaction questionnaires, preand post-tests and qualitative measures. Results. Data from trainings presented to over 10,000 health care professionals since March 1984 will be presented. The author will discuss developmental trends in the training needs of health care professionals seen over the past four years. Various training formats and designs including: workshop series, 3 day intensive trainings on HIV antibody testing and counseling, AIDS and Mental Health Conferences, train the trainer programs, professional support services fcr AIDS service providers, and staff development and consultation will be discussed and evaluated. Conclusion. As the AIDS epidemic grows, increasing numbers of health professionals recognize the necessity of learning about AIDS and the psychosocial impact of the disease. In order to both care for people with HIV infection and prevent the spread of the disease, effective training designs must be developed and implemented to address the educational needs of health professionals. In addition, AIDS service providers increasingly recognize the need for effective and creative interventions to manage the psychological and social impact of working in AIDS. 9060 The Islington Approach: HIV Prevention and Training in one Inner London Health District David Panter, Dave Ayres, Greg Lucas, Marion McEvoy HIV Prevention Unit, Islington District Health Authority, Health Education Department. Introduction: In 1986 Islington became the first English Health District to employ a HIV education worker. A second worker was appointed in 1987. This paper describes the contents and outcome of the Islington HIV programme. AIM: To effect the long-term primary prevention of AIDS and HIV infection in Islington by providing a comprehensive programme of health education for the local community. Methods: Using interviews and questionnaires to identify education needs of health staff and the community. Training sessions tailored to meet those needs in conjunction with Health Education Department. Developing leaflets and posters in 7 languages; risk assessment materials for use in Genito-Urinary Medicine and Family Planning Clinics; HIV information 'credit cards' for health staff. Providing information and advice, via telephone, to the community. Using surveys to measure changes in knowledge, beliefs and practices. Results: Significant numbers of physicians hold eroneous beliefs about HIV. Significant positive changes in work practices of health staff have been noticed follow training. There has been an increasing demand for the services of the HIV workers. Conclusion: The Islington HIV Programme has gained significant achievements and the necessity for continuing the service has become clear. Notes: 9061 MANAGING COUNTERTPANSFERENCE: A GUIDE FOR AIDS HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS Dawn Victoria Cavrell, C.S.W. Bronx Lebanon Hospital, Bronx, New York Objective.To place in a conceptual framework countertransference issues impactinp job performance of AIDS health care professionals; to develop methods for manaaement of these issues with the aoal of reduction of inaDpropriate staff behavior, assurinn quality health care. Methods.Health care orofessionals frequently experience multiple conscious and unconscious reactions to their AIDS patients which may manifest in inappropriate behavior towards patients as well as towards other staff. In an inner city AIDS designated treatment center such behaviors were observed and are discussed and detailed. Results.Underlying countertransference issues are identified and discussed in terms of their dynamic, defensive and copinp functions. A conceptual framework is offered to assist professionals in recoonizina breakdowns in job performance, identifyino related countertransference issues and utilizino approPriate manaaement techniques. Case illustrations are provided to demonstrate the use of this framework in mnaagino countertransference, decreasing staff anxiety and exhaustion and finally in fostering a team approach to health care. Recommendations are made for the implementation of this framework in staff in-service trainings, staff supervision, interdisciplinary meetings and staff support proups. Conclusion.The results indicate that appropriate mananement of countertransference can have far reachino implications not only for quality assurance but for the orevention of staff burn out as well. This is crucial in a time when AIDS health care professionals are difficult to recruit and attrition is hiah. 9062 EVISED AIDS-HIV CURRICULA FOR MEDICAL, NURSING, DENTISTRY AND PHARMACY STUDENTS (MNDPS) AT THE UCSF SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Harvey S Bartnof, M Grade, J Ziegler, L Zegans, and J Mandel, UC San Francisco School of Medicine Objective. To describe the revised AIDS-HIV medical school multidisciplinary elective course for MNDPS at the UCSF School of Medicine. Methods. Based on a needs assessment in 1985 and evaluations from students enrolled in 1986 and 1987, the revised curriculum for 1988 was implemented. A survey of STD-related topics from the core curriculum identified overlapping and lacking subject areas. Results. \"AIDS-HIV 1988: Overview and Update\" was revised to a 19-hour multidisciplinary survey course, including 23 UCSF MD lecturers with AIDS expertise and 2 panels. Pre/post-course HIV-related.knowledge and attitude scales and evaluations indicated success as measured by improved knowledge, improved infection control (IC) practices which would limit nosocomial transmission of HIV, and improved attitudes necessary for the care of HIV-infected individuals. The 25 topics will be described. Conclusions. A revised 19-hour multidisciplinary survey elective course on AIDS-HIV for MNDPS at UCSF School of Medicine has been described. The following factors together constitute a successful curriculum which has led to increased HIV knowledge, improved attitudes essential for clinical care, and improved reported IC practices: a ratio of 7:3::biomedical:psychosocial topics; a comprehensive presentation of IC and health provider issues; having AIDS MD role models as lecturers; and including a panel of persons with AIDS and ARC. This model could be applied to training other MNDPS and health providers elsewhere. 491 [Page 492](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/490) 9063 AIDS PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION: A TRAINING MODEL FOR PHYSICIANS AND NURSES Jeffrey S Mandel, M Grade, L Zegans, J Ziegler, H Bartnof, and B Faltz Univ. of California San Francisco School of Medicine Objective. To develop a comprehensive model of AIDS education specific to physicians and nurses in practice and in-training. Methods. Preliminary and ongoing means of needs assessment have included: faculty committee review of curricular content; quantified measurement of prevailing knowledge and attitudes; faculty-wide retreats; discipline-specific focus groups; impartial program review and program evaluation. Interventions have included: integration of AIDS education within relevant existent course work and clerkships; establishment of a multidisciplinary AIDS course; an annual patient care conference; a monthly lecture series; individualized training modules (e.g., promoting safer sex; HIV treatments; HIV test counseling; care to caregivers). Results. Needs assessment revealed an unexpected paucity of professional AIDS education, and a strong need for well-coordinated efforts. Resistance to education was found to rest largely within the AIDSrelated fears of professionals and students. In our own early efforts, it was found that left unaddressed, related attitudes precluded the assimilation of even basic biomedical information. Conclusions. Optimal professional AIDS education is dependent upon the dual use of traditional educational methods and those which specifically target psychosocial concerns. The existence of professional education, even in areas of high AIDS prevalence, should not be presumed. 9064 AIDS TRAINING FOR HOSPITAL NURSES: THE CLAUDE BERNARD HOSPITAL EXPERIENCE. Claudie Schneeberger, C. Poitevin, Hopital Claude Bernard, 75944 Paris cedex 19, France. Objective. For competent medical teams to train nurses who have little or no experience in caring for patients with HIV infection and AIDS. Methods. Five day courses are organized and assessed, the first of which was run in October 1987, and three are programmed for 1988. Forty-five nursing staff, all workening in medical and hygiene specialities which are involved in AIDS, are enrolled in each course. Training staff includes administrative and nursing staff and doctors from Claude Bernard Hospital, and doctors from the WHO Collaborating Centre on AIDS. The programme includes: - Lectures on HIV infection and AIDS (1/4 time), - Debates and practical work in the hospital on care techniques, hygiene, facilities, staff safety and psychological aspects (1/4 time), - Education in prevention (1/4 time). Results. - The evaluation by the students during the first course of the quality of teaching showed there is a good correspondance between the nurses interest and the programme. - The practical modification, apprehensions and transfer of knowledge in the workplace is being assessed by questionnaire and will be presented. Conclusion. Fear and poor knowledge about AIDS and HIV infection justify setting up such training courses. Notes: 9065 AIDS TRAIN THE TRAINER PROGRAM FOR HEALTH CARE Provider - Helen Schietinger, California Nurses Association (CNA) AIDS Education and Training. Objective - To describe the model and outcome of the CNA AIDS Train the Trainer Programme. Methods - A curriculum was developed, piloted and implemented in Year One and modified to include new goals and target groups in Year Two. Evaluation of the 2-day program included post-tests of and evaluations by the Trainers and a random phone survey of Trainers. Evaluation of the AIDS classes conducted in health care settings by the Trainers included pre- and post-tests of and evaluations by the Health Care Workers (HCWs) and collection of enrolment sheets and demographic information. Results - In Year One, 759 Trainers were trained and in turn provided AIDS classes to 18,000 HCWs (85% achieved 90% competency). In Year Two, over 600 Trainers were trained and provided AIDS classes to more than 15,000 HCWs (85% achieved 90% competency); 250 Trainers attended intensive review workshops; 1,200 Trainers received the Trainer Newsletter designed to provide technical assistance, support and updated AIDS information. Conclusion - The CNA AIDS Train the Trainer Program is a successful model for educating HCWs about AIDS, using innovative teaching strategies to address their fears and concerns as well as to provide accurate information. 9066 AIDS AND THE PROCESS OF SCIENCE Roulette Wm. Smith Institute for Postgraduate Interdisciplinary Studies, P. 0. Box 60846, Palo Alto, CA 94306-0846 USA Objective: To revisit and reassess the impact of AIDS and HIV infections on academic sciences and scientific methods. Methods: An Analysis of reasoning and problem-solving in the biological sciences reveals sharp differences in approaches to parsimony and understanding (PU). Descriptive-structuralism (DS) emphasizes descriptions, structures, taxonomy, and, in general, syntactic issues. PU are contextualized according to these syntactic issues. Heuristic functionalism (HF) emphasizes processes, errors, iteration and recursion, and, in general, logistic and semantic issues. PU under HF need not coincide with PU under DS, even though overlapping syntactic and semantic issues may be subsumed in both approaches. It was postulated that recombinant genetic techniques and slow infections (and especially AIDS) might revolutionize the natural sciences leading to rapid change and fundamental developments. This study examines changes taking place in the investigation of AIDS between Jan., 1984 and Dec., 1987. Papers on HIV and AIDS in 6 journals and conference proceedings for 4 professional associations were examined for evidence of DS and HF. Results: There appear to be few instances where biological scientists have switched from DS to HF in their investigations of AIDS. Virtually no reports take up issues of ethnomethodology or of causation versus consequences in AIDS. Education and the social sciences appear to have lagged behind other sciences in addressing AIDS-related issues. Although ethical and moral issues have been considered, there are virtually no instances where philosophers or logicians have tackled AIDS-related issues. Conclusion: Academic sciences appear to have proceeded very slowly in addressing AIDS-related issues, despite its obvious impact on society. One must wonder whether this slow start is, in any way, related to the rate of progress in preventing AIDS. 492 [Page 493](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/491) 9067 TRAINING PHYSICIANS ABOUT AIDS: THE PLAN IN THE UNITED STATES Ronn D Rucker*, S Matheny**, M June Horner** *The East Central AIDS Education and Training Center, Cincinnati Board of Health/University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, **U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Rockville, Maryland Objective. To describe the establishment of regional AIDS Education and Training Centers (ETCs) for physicians and other health care professionals in the United States. Methods. An analysis was completed of the AIDS Education project proposals which have been funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Results. Projections of an increasing number of persons with AIDS through the 1990's indicates that the supply of available specialists in infectious diseases will be overwhelmed. As a result, primary care physicians will be central to the early detection and management of AIDS. Four centers were established in 1987 to pioneer the development and implementation of health care training; six additional centers are scheduled for selection in 1988. This paper summarizes the goals and objectives of the following ETCs: 1) New York University, the School of Education, Health, Nursing, and Arts Professions, New York, New York; 2) the Ohio State University Research Foundation, Columbus, Ohio; 3) the University of Washington, School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington; 4) the University of California at Davis, Davis, California. Conclusion. A global need exists to train thousands of health care providers about AIDS. This paper describes the major effort of the U.S. government to respond to this need within the United States. This may serve as a model for the development of health provider training in other parts of the world. 9068 MODIFICATIONS OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR BECAUSE OF AIDS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION OF PARIS REGION J.P. MOATTI, PhD (1); W. DAB, m.d. MSc (2); Unit n~240 - (2) INSERM Unit n~88 - (3) CEA In a survey on perception of AIDS, through personal interview, of a representative sample of the Paris region (n = 900; Dec. 1987; quota method), specific questions confidentially answered in written form were devoted to sexual behaviour (answer rate = 90 %). 81,2 % (n = 655) declared sexual intercourse durina the last six months, among whom 14% (n = 92) with multiple sexual partners. Condoms were said to be used by 11,9% (53,8% of them where new users of the last six months, fear of AIDS beina their major motivation). 10,5% of sexually active respondents had renounced to sexual intercourse in some occasion because of their fear of AIDS. Condom use is highly correlated with marital status, number of sexual partners, knowledge of AIDS transmission modes, one-self perception of risk of contracting the disease and the fact of having already been tested for HIV. Preliminary analysis suaaest that having undergone a HIV test (voluntarily) might be a predictor of safer sexual behaviour. Implications for screening policy will be discussed. Notes: 9069 Title: Public Knowledge About Aids in the United States Ronald W. Wilson National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, U.S. Public Health Service, Hyattsville, Maryland, USA Objective. To track changes in the knowledge level of the United States public about AIDS to provide information for the planning and evaluation of the national AIDS public education activities. Methods. Administer a 10-15 minute questionnaire as a part of the National Health Interview Survey, a survey conducted, by the Bureau of the Census for the National Center for Health Statistics, in a probability sample of 1,000 different households each week of the year. Data collection began in August, 1987 and will continue with modifications to the questions at about 6 month intervals. Results. Small, but statistically significant improvements were noted between the first 2 months of data, even before the National education campaign in October. Data presented will focus on changes that occurred between September and November to assess the impact of the education campaign. Conclusion. Ongoing national health surveys can be used to assess the public's knowledge about AIDS. 9070 CANADA YOUTH AND AIDS STUDY: A SURVEY OF AIDS KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOURS A King, R Beazley, Catherine Hankins * W Warren * *Social Program Evaluation Group, Queen's University, Ontario **Montreal Regional STD Control, Quebec, Canada Objective. To describe AIDS related beliefs, attitudes and behaviours and to provide direction for strategies designed to reduce HIV infection risk in young people. Methods. A national survey of 50,000 young people aged 12 to 19 years was conducted in February 1988. A twostage cluster sampling procedure identified formally scheduled classes for questionnaire administration. In addition 1000 dropouts were surveyed by telephone and 600 street kids were interviewed face to' face. Knowledge and attitude indicators regarding HIV infection and AIDS were related to measurements of self-esteem, peer relations, relationship with parents, sexual behaviour, drug and alcohol use and socioeconomic indicators. Results. 1859 students participated in the pilot phase in 3 provinces. Younger adolescents knew less about AIDS, were substantially more concerned about contracting AIDS and were more homophobic than older students. At all age levels there was general distrust of government information sources and confusion over media messages. Embarrassment was high regarding condom purchasing and perceptions were strong that condoms interfere with sexual behaviour. 25% of 14 y.o. (n=413) had had sexual intercourse, 9% with more than 1 person. 15% of 18-19 y.o. (n=815) had experienced anal intercourse, Conclusion. Knowledge gaps, negative attitudes, and evidence of risk related behaviour in this age group combine to challenge Canadian health educators. 493 [Page 494](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/492) 9071 CHANGES IN ADOLESCENT KNOWLEDGE AND BEHAVIORS CONCERNING AIDS TRANSMISSION Lee Strunin, R. Hingson Boston University School of Public Health Objectives. Knowledge about AIDS and behavior change among adolescents in Massachusetts was assessed in August-October 1986 and February 1988. Methods. A sample of 860 16-19 year olds in 1986 were interviewed in a statewide anonymous random digit dial telephone survey. A similar survey of 1500 adolescents will be conducted in February 1988. Results. The 1986 survey indicated that many adolescents were misinformed or confused about AIDS transmission. Seventy percent said they were sexually active but only 15% reported changing their sexual behavior because of concern about AIDS. Only 20% of those who changed their behavior used effective methods. Eight percent of sexually active adolescents did not know that AIDS is transmitted by heterosexual sexual intercourse. One percent reported IV drug use. There was no significant difference in knowledge between sexually active and nonactive adolescents concerning sexual transnission of AIDS or between the drug users and nonusers concerning drug use and AIDS transmission. In 1987 the state developed and offered an eight lesson plan to communities across the state. Comparisons of knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about AIDS and the sexual and drug use behavior of adolescents in 1986 and 1988 will be presented. Conclusions. Education programs about AIDS should target adolescents and surveys should monitor their effects on adolescent knowledge and behavior. 9072 W. DAB, m.d. M.Sc. (1), J.P. MOATTI, Ph D. (1), S. BASTIDE, Ph D. (2), L. ABENHAIM m.d.M.Sc. (1). MISPERCEPTION OF TRANSMISSION OF AIDS AND ATTITUDES TOWARD PREVENTION IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC (a survey in Paris region). 1- I.N.S.E.R.M. 2 C.E.A. In order to investigate risk perception of AIDS, knowledge about transmission, and, attitudes toward prevention, in the general public, a survey was carried out in the metropolitan area of Paris (10 million inhabitants) in December 1987. A one hour questionnaire was submitted, through personal interview, to a representative sample of the population of the region (900 individuals, quota method). Total % of respondents believing in different modes of transmission of HIV is the following: Sexual intercourse: 97,7% - IV Drug injection: lavatories: 28% - By 26,6% - Drinking in glass: 18,7% - close to AIDS' patients: 14,6% - At the swimming-pool: 11 %. Level of education is highly correlated with knowledge about transmission (at least, p<10-5): low level of education is associated with false beliefs in transmission through casual contact. No other socio-economic variable appears to influence knowledge. Stigmatization of AIDS' patients (measured on the \"Interpersonal Evaluation Inventory\" scale) is strongly correlated with false beliefs about transmission: for ex., among individuals who believe in transmission in public lavatories, 26,2% are not willing to have dinner in a carrier's house, 11,5% deny working with him, and, 46% will not allow children to visit him (while they are only 10,3%, 3%, and 27% among those who do not believe in that mode) (p< 10-6; p<10-4;p<10-6). False beliefs about transmission influence individuals' willingness to support coercive measures (such as isolation) against AIDS' patients and HIV carriers: 37,9% of those believing in transmission at the swimming-pool support \"exclusion of AIDS' children from school\" (against 11,7 % for those who do not believe it). These results suggest that education campaigns are not only important to promote preventive behaviour, but, may also be crucial in order to reduce social pressure in favour of control measures that are not justified in terms of public health. Notes: 9073 AN ASSESSMENT OF KNOWLEDGE, RISK PERCEPTION, AND RISK REDUCTION BEHAVIORS AMONG FRESHMEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA Ernest Ayers, F. Sy, C. Garrison, D. Glik, K. Jackson, J. Kronenfeld - all at the University of South Carolina Objective. To determine knowledge and risk perception concerning AIDS and risk reduction behaviors among entering freshmen at the University of South Carolina. Methods. A Questionnaire was administerd in the fall of 1987 to 1054 incoming freshmen taking a course of introduction to university life (University 101). Separate summary scores were obtained for knowledge, risk perception, knowledge of risk reduction behaviors, and intent to use these behaviors. Results. 47% of the students correctly answered 14 or more of the 18 general knowledge questions, and 92% answered 9 or more. Awareness was high concerning sexual and blood-borne transmission. Questions regarding transmission by casual contact were most often answered incorrectly. 13% believed transmission could result from donating blood. Knowledge of risk reduction behaviors was high: only 1.4% received a \"poor\" score. Intention to use these behaviors was less encouraging: 17% received a \"poor\" score and only 16% received a \"good\" score. Few students (3%) perceived themselves to be at high risk in casual situations. 6% expressed concerns about their own infection status. Conclusion. Though South Carolina is a low incidence area for AIDS, general knowledge concerning AIDS was high. The students did not perceive themselves to be at high risk of infection with HIV. Only 16% were committed to using risk reduction behaviors consistently. Increasing concern for one's risk of aquiring HIV infection could improve intent to use precautionary behaviors. 9074 AIDS ATTITUDES, KNOWLEDGE AND RISK REDUCTION IN A COLLEGE POPULATION Richard J. Wolitski, F. Rhodes Psychology Dept., California State University, Long Beach, USA Objective. To examine the relationship between AIDS knowledge, attitudes towards the disease, and AIDSrelated behavior changes among college students. Methods. Measures of AIDS knowledge and six factoriallyderived attitudinal components were obtained from 1,025 college students. These components were: (1) personal vulnerability, (2) severity of epidemic, (3) cynicism/mistrust, (4) importance of mobilizing against AIDS, (5) fear of persons with AIDS, and (6) desire for more AIDS education. Reduction of personal sexual risk and demographic information were also assessed. Results. AIDS knowledge was generally high, with a 14 -item knowledge test yielding a mean of 60 points (out of 70). Subjects typically viewed AIDS as a severe and pervasive problem, but they did not tend to perceive themselves to be highly vulnerable to HIV infection. Of the six attitudinal components, only perceived personal vulnerability had a noteworthy correlation (r>.20, p<.0001) with one or more of the risk-reducing behaviors endorsed by those students who were sexually active. However, seven of the first-order interactions among these attitudes were related to the criterion behaviors and were the strongest predictors in multiple regression equations. None of the demographic variables nor AIDS knowledge had a meaningful correlation with risk reduction behaviors (r <.15). Conclusion. Although college students typically possess basic knowledge of HIV transmission, this knowledge alone may not lead to adoption of risk-reduction strategies. 494 ach cfiietiality limits tIe sxctrun cf pwulatnis willing to I-as tes credible cf health date. ao t hxw to renay are Cf them prdil rs will he cfferd. Notes: 9077 MEDIA USE AMONG CLOSETED GAY MEN IN DALLAS Anne C. Freeman, M. Lerro, C.E. Haley, J. Tabori, Dallas County Health Department, Dallas, Tx Objective. To identify communication channels among gay and closeted gay men in Dallas in order to target AIDS and health messages. Methods. A 30-question survey is distributed to 200 self-identified gay men, each of whom agrees to give two male friends a copy of the survey, for a total of 600 possible responses. Each of the original 200 men takes 3 blank surveys, 1 for himself, and 2 for friends. The survey asks men to provide behavioral information about the type and frequency of media contact, especially media addressing health, AIDS, and gay community issues. Media included in this survey are: newspapers and radio reports (gay and non-gay media), television reports, social and political newsletters, posters, brochures, and word-of-mouth. Media channels identified in this survey are those available to the health department. The completed surveys will be returned to a blind post office box within a set time. Coding each survey before distribution will allow rough sociometric mapping. Information returned to the health department will be reported and used in building models through which AIDS information can be distributed in Dallas. Comparisons will be made between respondents who identify themselves as gay and those who do not. Results. Initial results pending. Survey to be completed in May 1988 and reported in June 1988. Conclusion. This binary study should help identify media habits of hard-to-reach closeted gay men. 9078 PREDICTORS OF AIDS HIGH RISK BEHAVIOR AMONG A PROBABILITY SAMPLE OF GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN Maria 4L. Ekstrand and Thomas J. Coates University of California, San Francisco and Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A. Objective. To identify predictors of AIDS high risk sexual behavior among gay and bisexual men in San Francisco. Methods. This study includes data on 639 gay and bisexual men who participated in the San Francisco Men's Health Study. Twelve psychosocial and demographic predictor variables were selected out of the pool of questions administered in 1985. Two outcome variables were used: unprotected anal intercourse and a combined risk score based on number of partners, condom use and anal intercourse. These were measured in 1985, 1986, and 1987. The prediction model was tested using logistic and multiple stepwise regression procedures. Results. Crossectional predictors of high risk behavior included prodromal symptoms and having a friend or lover with AIDS. These subjects were also significantly younger and reported more alcohol use than did low risk subjects. Longitudinal predictors of high risk behaviors in 1986 included feeling lonely, without social support, and having thought of oneself as gay at an early age. High risk subjects were also significantly younger and had more prodromal symptoms and less intake of health food supplements than did low risk subjects. Outcome data from 1987 are currently being analyzed and will be reported at the meeting. Conclusion. These data show that we can identify a subgroup of gay and bisexual men who are still engaging in AIDS high risk behaviors. This suggests that future behavior change programs may need to focus on some of the above issues such as social support and alcohol use. 495 [Page 496](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/494) 9079 AIDS PREVENTION AMONGST HOMOSEXUALS IN SWITZERLAND F. Dubois-Arber, Ph. Lehmann, D. Hausser, F. Gutzwiller. University Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, Lausanne, Switzerland. Objective: to evaluate the effects of public infortion campaigns designed to modify attitudes and risk-associated behaviour. Method: information collected during 1987 by: - a questionnaire distributed by homosexual press and organizations concerning attitudes, sexual behaviour and change in these, lifestyle, perceptions of the prevention campaigns and opinions on testing - in-depth interviews concerning reasons for any change and nature of changes in behaviour. Results: 795 questionnaires and 42 interviews were analysed. 85 % of respondants said they had changed their sexual behaviour. More than half of those who practised \"safer-sex\" had practised it for more than two years. Changes most frequently mentioned included a reduction in the number of partners, utilization of condoms, oral sex avoiding oral ejaculation, a renunciation of oral and anal sex. Unprotected anal sex was practised sometimes by less than 20 %. Interviews showed that new attitudes and behavioural patterns require time to be established and repeated coherent external stimulations (prevention campaigns, multipliers in the milieu). Sources of resistances to change and promoters of change were identified. Conclusion: Swiss homosexuals have changed their behaviour as a result of the epidemic and public information campaigns. 9080 QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY OF CHANGES IN SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AMONG HOMO- AND BISEXUAL MEN IN A DANISH POPULATION J. Bdttzauw*, Hermansen*, F.T. Black*, P. Tauris*, J. Olsen**, P. Jorgensen et al. *Marselisborg Hospital, University department of Medicine and Infectious Diseases, **Institute of Social Medicine, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark. Objective: To test the knowledge of HIV-transmission in, a group of Danish homo-/bisexual men and to look at changes in their sexual behavior in the light of this knowledge. Methods: 430 questionnaires were distributed by mail to homo-/bisexual men subscribing to a homosexual magazine. Results: 144 questionnaires were returned (33%). Most of the responders had been \"openly gay\" for several years. The mean age was 32 years. Their knowledge about HIVtransmission and \"safe sex\" was rather extensive, but they knew less about subjective and objective signs of HIV-infection/AIDS. Only 50% were HIV-antibody tested. A significant decrease in number of annual partners as well as in different sex.practices was reported. However, the frequency of anal intercourse was unchanged. The use of condoms in sexual practices increased, especially in connection with anal intercourse with casual partners (from 3% to 82%). Most of the men accepted the use of condoms. The unsafe sex practices were particularly in monogamous relationships. 12 reported homosexuals had sex relations to both men and women. Conclusion: The group of Danish homo-/bisexual men demonstrated good knowledge of HIV-transmission and the majority had modified their sexual behavior accordingly, including the use of \"safe sex\" practices and use of condoms. Nevertheless, more education and information is needed to motivate further reduction in high-risk sexual bphavior.

To estimate the level of knowledge on AILS in Sani.ta.ry-Epidemiologicai Irolessionalists, who must carry out health education on AIDS with people of different target groups. Methods. 407 professionalists were trained. After half of the year the level of their knowledge was examined by anonymous questionnaire. The data concerning the readiness of these persons to carry out effective anti-AIDS health-educational activities were analyzed,too Results. In 100% the examined persons mentioned as the risk group-homosexuals;1/3 forgot to mention the risk grours:drug addicts or blood recipients, 1/3 incorrectly pointed that HIV virus is insensitive to well-known disinLectants. About 10\"o stressed the need f'or t-he change of the worklace or not acceptiar t'he infected persons to schools. Nearly 20% pointed out to the possibility of the infection risk in personal contacts,non-sexual contacts,for example while shaking hands,working together,bathing in the same swimming-pool, Conclusion. Single training is not sufficient. Permanent training is necessary to carry out anti-AIDS health-education activity. 9082 CONDOMPROMOTION Vroome++, Tielman++ + Dutch Foundation for STD-control, Utrecht, Netherlands ++University of Utrecht, Netherlands Objective. Several campaigns and activities are undertaken to promote condom-use among heterosexuals. The effect on knowledge, attitude, intention and behaviour is measured among people with different forms of relationships. Methods. Population surveys (n=1000,age 15-45)are done before and after each campaign (April 87, Sept.87, March 88) Results. In April 87 98% felt that condoms should be openly (in the media) advised to non-monogamous people. 97% knew where to buy them. A favourable starting point. Knowledge: it was confirmed that condoms protect against Aids by 74% in April, compared to 80% in Sept. (p=.01). Attitude: the most important reasons to not use condoms (\"not exciting\" and \"interfering with sex7 lowered from 48% to 31% (p=.000). Most important reasons to do use condoms: protection from Aids (from 34% to 49%, p=.000), from std (27%, no change), (from 32% to 39%, p=.01). In April 62% sees more advantages to condom-use than disadvantages, against 70% in Sept. (p=.001). Intention: among non-users the intention to use condoms in the future has significantly risen (p=.01). Behaviour: among non-monogamous respondents in April 29% says they adapted their sexual behaviour as a result of the Aids-risk, to 46% in Sept. (p=.01). In the age-group 15-29 yrs condom-use has risen from 10%/o to 235% Conclusion. Knowledge, attitude, intention and behaviour as to condom-use have all changed in the wished-for direction. Results of the March 88 survey will be presented,as will the lowering incidence of gonorrhea and the rising condom-salesfigures as indicators of change in behaviour, in the direction of safer sex. 496 [Page 497](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/495) 9083 SURVEY OF AIDS KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS IN SAN FRANCISCO'S BLACK COMMUNITIES Noel A. **Department of Public Health, San Francisco, CA, USA. Objective. To obtain baseline data on AIDS knowledge, attitudes and risk behaviors in the Black Communities of San Francisco. Methods. A population-based random sample of 400 adult Black residents was surveyed through face-to-face interviews between April and June, 1987. The sample was identified through random telephone calls and \"intercepts\" at key points of congregation. Results. 36% of respondents were judged to be high risk as a result of having risky sexual partners, risky sexual behaviors, or sharing needles. 4.5% had sexual partners with AIDS/ARC or were IVDU needle sharers. 3.5% of the sample were homosexual men and another 3.5% were bisexual. Bisexual men reported the highest average number of partners, were often married, and 33% had children. 7% of the sample were IVDUs with 60% of them reporting needle sharing. 22% of all respondents did not know that AIDS was preventable. Most knew what sex acts were \"safer\" but were confused about what was unsafe. High risk people had attitudes that were least supportive of \"safe sex\" practices. Conclusion. The Black community is aware of the threat of AIDS but lacks basic knowledge. Bisexual men may be a significant vector for HIV dissemination among heterosexuals, and should be included as a targeted audience for prevention efforts along with gay men, and needle sharers and their partners. 9084 SURVEY OF AIDS KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, AND RISK BEHAVIORS IN SAN FRANCISCO'S LATINO COMMUNITIES. George F. Lemp*, G Bregmen**, Montanez***, A Sacchetti***, G Sandlin***, GW **Fairbank, Bregman & Maullin, Inc.; ***Mission Neighborhood Health Center, San Francisco, CA, USA Objective. To obtain baseline data on AIDS knowledge, attitudes, and risk behaviors in the Latino Communities in San Francisco. Methods. Three hundred and fifteen adult Latino residents of San Francisco were randomly selected and interviewed in person between April and June, 1987. The survey was conducted by a door-to-door methodology, using a cluster block random sampling scheme. Results. Eleven percent of respondents reported that they had engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse with highrisk or multiple partners. One percent reported engaging in intravenous drug use with needle sharing; and 1% engaged in both. 17% of respondents said that they had changed their sexual behavior since becoming aware of AIDS. Nearly all respondents (96%+) correctly identified the ways in which AIDS is commonly transmitted. However, a large proportion of the respondents mistakenly believed that AIDS could be transmitted when donating blood (68%), when having blood taken for lab tests (72%), from toilet seats (46%), when drinking out of the same glass as someone who is infected (42%), and when eating food prepared by someone who is infected (34%). Conclusion. Thirteen percent of Latinos in San Francisco may be at increased risk for AIDS as a result of potentially unsafe sexual and drug-using behaviors. Although most respondents were aware of AIDS, many were misinformed about the diseases and how it could be prevented. Notes: 9085 V90 5 KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES AND PRACTICES ABOUT AIDS AMONG HAITIANS IN MONTREAL, CANADA. Alix (1,2). (1) Department of Community Health, Montreal General Hospital, (2) Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McGill University, (3) Montreal Regional STD Control Program. As of January 1988, 81 (17%) of the 463 adult AIDS cases diagnosed in Quebec were of Haitian origin. A convenience sample of 72 individuals from this community participated in testing the inter-item and item-total correlation of the attitude section of a 1 - hour questionnaire on knowledge, attitudes and practices related to AIDS (Cronbach alpha = 0,7282). Of 400 randomly selected subjects, 66% agreed to participate. Preliminary data on 61 of a proposed sample of 100 subjects (42F, 19M; mean age = 30.2) show that 26% of them had arrived in Canada in the last 8 years. General knowledge about AIDS and HIV transmission was limited. A positive attitude toward AIDS patients and HIV carriers was demonstrated by 62% of the subjects; 90% believed that HIV antibody testing should be mandatory. Although attitudes towards condom use were positive, 62% had never used them. During the last year, 5 individuals had more than 1 sexual partner, 14 changed their sexual behaviour because of AIDS, 1 reported having paid for sex and there was no homosexual relations. Three individuals had gonorrhea during the last 5 years and there was no needle use during that period. There was one report of anal intercourse. These results will allow better strategies for intervention in this community and will be used as baseline data for evaluation. 9086 KNOWLEDGE ABOUT AIDS AND BEHAVIOR CHANGE AMONG MINORITY GROUPS IN MASSACHUSETTS Ralph Hingson*, L. Strunin*, D. Craven**, L. Mofenson***, H. Amaro*, *Boston University School of Public Health, **Boston Department of Health and Hospitals, *** Massachusetts Department of Public Health Objective. Knowledge about AIDS and behavior change in Massachusetts among minority groups in response to the epidemic was assessed. Methods. In October 1987 a statewide anonymous random digit dial telephone survey of 1,323 adults aged 18 and older was conducted in English and Spanish. Results. Overall Whites were more knowledgeable about AIDS transmission than Blacks or Hispanics with Hispanics being least knowledgeable. Hispanics, particularly Spanish speaking Hispanics, reported less mass media exposure to information about AIDS than those interviewed in English. Significantly fewer Hispanics knew that the AIDS virus can be transmitted from: sex between two men, sex between a man and a woman, sex with a healthy person, and sharing needles. Significantly more Hispanics believed the virus is transmitted in ways that it is not. Even though Hispanics were more worried about getting AIDS in their lifetime, they were less likely to think that schools should educate students to avoid AIDS by using clean needles and/or using condoms. Although the percentage of IV drug users and gay/bisexual men did not vary among different ethnic/racial groups, Blacks and Hispanics were more likely to practice unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners in the last six months. Conclusion. More education programs in both English and Spanish are needed. But mass media education alone will not reachall members of the Hispanic community.

Rosenstock, S. Wolf, R. Wolitski AIDS Education Project, California State University, Long Beach, CA., USA Objective: To develop and pilot a standard technique to assess attitudes of minority populations toward existing or proposed AIDS-informational materials and to identify specific strategies for maximizing cultural relevance. Methods: An evaluation procedure employing a detailed interview protocol was developed for implementation in a focus-group context with same-sex/ethnicity participants. The procedure requires approximately two hours and is divided into two conceptually distinct parts. In the first, reactions to the content of the materials is assessed through participant ratings of communicated threat, response efficacy, self-efficacy/vulnerability, disease severity, arousal/emotionality, and consistency with prevailing behavioral norms. Group members are encouraged to identify content themes having specific relevance for their own culture. The second part focuses on reactions to the form of the materials. Feedback on wording, graphics, and medium (e.g., poster, brochure) is obtained, with suggestions for improvement. Results: Preliminary data from Black and Hispanic populations confirm that many of the current AIDS-informational materials are seen as inappropriate or ineffective for these groups. Valuable suggestions for improvement of materials in terms of content, wording, and format have been garnered. Conclusion: This standard evaluation protocol is a promising tool for designing and modifying materials suitable for use in minority communities. 9088 AIDS Education and Attitudes: Experience with Minority College Students. R.E. Jackson, W.A. Alexander, R. Bakeman and B. Bagley. Morehouse School of Medicine and Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia; USA College students constitute an important age group to target educational efforts relative to AIDS. Because Blacks in the U.S. are affected disproportionately, AIDS education on the historically black college campus is of utmost importance. The study reported here was part of an educational effort in April, 1987, intended to increase knowledge and awareness about AIDS at three historically black campuses. To develop a baseline of knowledge and attitudes about AIDS in this population, a questionnaire was developed and administered probing students' attitudes about AIDS and their knowledge about transmission of HIV and testing. Five hundred and twenty (520) questionnaires were distributed to students at the beginning of assemblies and evaluated. Almost all students had accurate knowledge about research-substantiated routes of transmission, but many held to certain myths about transmission - especially those who held socially conservative attitudes. Confusion existed in several areas including blood donation and infection, the purpose of HIV testing, the insect as a vector for the virus, and relative risk for AIDS in Blacks and whites. It is concluded that subsequent educational efforts need to address, in addition to facts, attitudes about AIDS-related matters as well. Notes: 9089 LONG TERM IMPACT OF THE UK HEALTH EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. L. Sherr J. Green St Mary's London OBJECTIVE To evaluate the long term impact of the UK Health Education Campaign on Higher and Lower risk groups. METHODS Information and attitudes were measured by questionnaire. 400 subjects (Higher Risk n=200: STD attenders - Lower Risk n=200 Students). Subjects rated absolute knowledge and level to which they believed items. Campaign content (phase 2) was measured in a sub-sample of higher and lower risk subjects (n=74). Anxiety was monitored pre and post exposure on a clinical Anxiety Inventory. RESULTS Although short term information gains were low, longer term (18 months) data suggests that basic information has filtered through, anxiety is not as high as it was initially, but behavioural intentions and beliefs are slow to follow. Higher risk subjects were significantly more scared (p:.0001) and more likely to change their sexual behaviour (p=.0001). There were no differences in anxiety levels between higher and lower risk groups. The use of fear arousal in the campaign did indeed raise anxiety both for visual (posters) and audio-visual (TV advertisements) p=.04 and p=.0003 respectively). However lower risk subjects did not perceive the campaign as aimed at them and higher risk subjects felt the campaign did not accurately reflect high risk situations. CONCLUSION 18 months after the campaign started the AIDS debate has reached the public eye, but changing attitudes and information although necessary is not sufficient in changing behaviour. Knowledge misconceptions are still apparent and the data suggests that it is easier to fill gaps than redress errors. 9090 ASSESSING AIDS EDUCATION NEEDS IN THE UNITED STATES: A BENCHMARK FOR THE NATIONAL CAMPAIGN Laurie Sherman, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, Steve Rabin, Ogilvy & Mather Washington, D.C. Objective: To assess AIDS education needs of key subgroups and the general population of the United States for the creation of national advertising and public relations programs. Methods: Survey of 388 AIDS educators in 20 metropolitan areas and 200 national leaders of specific groups, including national Gay, Black, Hispanic and Asian leaders. Public opinion surveys and consumer focus groups in all geographic regions. Results: Knowledge and awareness of AIDS primary modes of transmission is over 95% in all key subgroups and in the general population. There is substantial confusion regarding casual contact in all segments with confusion highest among children and ethnic minorities. There is no national consensus on a hierarchy for behavior change. There is not widespread practice of prevention behavior by sexually active adults or IV drug users. There are changes occurring in specific communities. Conclusion: National efforts must encourage behavior change while respecting ethnic diversity and local community standards. All prevention methods must be discussed, including abstinence, mutually faithful relationships, condom use, drug abstinence, and drug treatment. Materials should demonstrate realistic positive prevention behavior. Facts on casual contact issues should be included. All materials must be sensitive to needs of HIV positives and should seek to prevent discrimination against any specific group. 498 [Page 499](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/497) 9091 A NATIONAL SURVEY OF KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOUR RELATING TO AIDS IN NEW ZEALAND. S Jane Chetwynd Christchurch School of Medicine, New Zealand. Objective. To evaluate the effectiveness of nationwide AIDS educational efforts in New Zealand, and to obtain baseline attitudinal and behavioural measures against which to measure future change. Methods.A fully national sample of 1,000 people aged 16-60 were interviewed in their own homes. More sensitive questions were included in a separate self-complete section. Results. Knowledge about AIDS and its major means of transmission was well established as was knowledge about ways to reduce the risk of contracting it. (95% of sample named condom use and 96% named non-sharing of needles.) Greatest areas of misconception concerned the risks associated with donating and receiving blood and with saliva exchange. Television was the most common and most informative source of AIDS information. Over 75% of the sample wanted more information on AIDS. Questions on policy issues showed 63% of the sample in favour of a free needle exchange scheme, 70% in favour of TV advertising of condoms and 78% in favour of greater availability of condoms. AIDS prevention education in secondary schools was supported by 92% of the sample and in primary schools by 60%. Changes in sexual behaviour as a result of AIDS was reported by 16% of the sexually active with reduction in number of sexual partners and/or use of condoms the most commonly reported changes. Conclusion. It appears that knowledge about AIDS and its prevention is widespread in New Zealand. Translating this knowledge into behaviour change is the next challenge. 9092 PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE AND OPINIONS ON AIDS IN y HUNGARY Adam VassX E Lengyelxx, E Katonaxx, G F ----t~~~Fust xx Ministry of Social Affaires and Health, Hungarian Institute of Market Research, xxxNational Institute of Health Education, xxxxNational Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Budapest, Hungary Objective. With 9 full-blown cases and 149 known HIVseropositives, Hungary is still a relatively low risk area for AIDS. Therefore it seemed interesting to study the knowledge on and attitudes towards AIDS and compare the data to those obtained in countries of hish prevalence. Methods. A public poll was performed in December, 1987. A questionnaire with 104 questions on AIDS was sent to 7000 Hungarian citizens. 3765 individuals sent back the filled questionnaire, and according to the statistical analysis, the sample was representative for the whole Hungarian population. Answers were scored with emphasis on the most important ones, grouped and evaluated. Results. General knowledge on AIDS was found to be reasonable: 79% gave right answers (RA) on questions concerning causative agent, pathomechanism, etc. 73% ias aware of the real routes of transmission. By contrast, knowledge on symptoms is limited (10% RA). 50% of the people have misinformation on AIDS, e.g. 41% believes in transmission by insects, according to 25% AIDS virus is transmitted by coughing, in swimming pools (20%), by pets (13%) or at blood donations (17%!). Attitude tow!ards AIDS victims was mostly tolerant (77%). Conclusion. Based on these and other data to be presented, further education can be planned rationally. Notes: SUMMARY OF NATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION POLLS ON AIDS BY AGE, GENDER AND MARITAL STATUS Susan M. Blake, Ph.D., and Arkin, E. *American National Red Cross Washington, D.C., U.S.A. Objective. To analyze change in public knowledge, attitudes, and behavior between 1983 and 1986. Methods. Crosstabular comparisons were made by age, gender and marital status on twenty-six surveys during the study period. Categories were as follows: men and women, married vs. unmarried, and 18-24; 25-34; 35-44; 45-64; 65+. Significant differences will be presented. Results. Few differences in knowledge by gender or marital. status were found throughout the study period. Knowledge did differ by age; with the oldest and youngest respondents being most misinformed about AIDS. The young increased in knowledge during the study, while the oldest remained more misinformed. Greater personal concern about AIDS was expressed by the young, women and unmarried; greater behavior change by the young, and unmarried. Women were more likely to have changed behavior in 1985; by 1986 there were no differences by gender. Conclusions. Predictable differences were observed over the study period by age, gender and marital status. These data can effectively be used to target education and motivational messages to specific population segments. 9094 SUMMARY OF NATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION POLLS ON AIDS *Susan M. Blake, Ph.D. and Arkin, E. Americqn National Red Cross Washington, D.C., U.S.A. Objective. To define levels and trends in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors in the general population. Methods. Thirty-two nationally representative, public opinion polls on AIDS conducted between 1983 and 1986 were summarized to determine changes in the population over time, and to identify potential targets for public educatiod, communication, and behavior chanie programs. Results. Public Knowledge about AIDS improved between 1983 and 1986. Confidence in the level and accuracy of information remained low. Misperceptions continued in the \"grey\" areas where transmission probabilities are less clear (eg. kissing), in blood donation, and in the specificity of knowledge about disease progression, HIV infection and testing. The public became more aware of the threat to public health, although few perceived themselves to be at risk personally. Some positive behavior changes were observed (eg. fewer were avoiding public restrooms, more had reduced sexual partners), yet, the extent and nature of the change would not eliminate risk entirely. Conclusion. Intensify education and behavior change efforts. Knowledge does not necessarily lead to behavior change. Target gaps in public information and behavior. Seek strategies to increase perceptions of vulnerability where appropriate, and prosocial behavior. 499 [Page 500](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/498) 9095 CANADIAN PHYSICIAN SURVEY ON HIV IN PRIMARY CARE: PREVALENCE OF PREVENTIVE ACTIVITIES TJ Elmslie 1,2, AM Arnill 1, NM Busing 1, JK Shearman 1. 1 Family Medicine 2 Epidemiology and Community Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada Objective. To determine the prevalence of preventive HIV activities utilized by general practitioners. Methods. A mailed survey was used to obtain information from a proportionate, random sample of Canadian general practitioners in clinical practice, stratified by geographic region and size of community of the practice. Specific strategies were used to maximize response rate. Results. Prior to the final mailing, 751 questionnaires have been returned (response rate of 70%). Overall, 54% of physicians initiate discussion about HIV/AIDS, fewer specifically inquire about the following risk factors: sexual orientation (30%), sexual practices (28%), IV drug abuse (31%), possible sexual contact with high risk individuals (34%). 46% ask about blood transfusion history. Of the 78% who have ordered HIV antibody tests, 90% do pre-test counselling.and 63% do post-test counselling. Physician age, years in practice, size of community and geographic region are significantly associated with preventive activities. Conclusion. Effort is needed to increase the current level of HIV preventive activities of primary care physicians. Simple demographic factors may be useful in targeting these efforts. 9096 KNOWLEDGE ABOUT AIDS AND BEHAVIOR CHANGE IN MASSACHUSETTS Ralph Hingson*, L. Strunin*, D. Craven**, L. Mofenson*** *Boston University School of Public Health,**Boston Deoartment of Health and Hospitals, ***Massachusetts Department of Public Health Objective. Knowledge about AIDS and behavior change amonq high risk qroups in Massachusetts in response to the epidemic was assessed. Methods. In October 1987 a statewide anonymous random diqit dial telephone survey of 1,323 adults aged 18 and older was conducted. Results. Fifty-two percent of gay/bisexual males, 27% of IV druq users and 21% of persons who had multiple Heterosexual partners in recent years have adopted abstinence, monoqamous sexual relations or condom use specifically to avoid AIDS virus exposure. Nonetheless 6% of all respondents and 11% aged 18-25 had unprotected sex with multiple partners in the past 6 months. One percent reported unprotected anal sex and 1% of Boston respondents continued IV druq use. Those who maintained riskful behavior were just as knowledgeable as those who changed. Over 90-95% of respondents including IV drug users and gay/bisexual men knew AIDS has no cure, the virus can be transmitted by homosexual and heterosexual intercourse, by sharing needles when injecting drugs and having sex with someone who appears healthy. However, only one quarter of those who continued unprotected sex believed they were even somewhat likely to acquire AIDS in their lifetime. Conclusion. Information about AIDS transmission will dissuade some but not all from engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners. Notes: 9097 William *Kansas Project 9098 ASSESSMENT OF NEED FOR AIDS EDUCATION - THE KANSAS RESPONSE Earl Wade, III, D.O.*,T.M.Knapp,Ph.D.** AIDS Network, Inc., **UCSF, Aids Health KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, AND BELIEFS ABOUT AIDS IN COLORADO. Peter L. Ralin, DL Cohn, FN Judson. Denver Disease Control Service, Denver CO, USA. Objective. To assess the baseline level of knowledge of the general population of Kansas regarding AIDS and AIDS-related conditions. Methods. A questionnaire was completed which surveyed numerous areas of previous risk exposure, behavioral change, and overall HIV disease knowledge. The instrument was then coded and evaluated statistically for age-related trends. Distribution and collection of the instrument yielded 1133 usable returns. Results. The respondents were primarily female who considered themselves to be well informed about AIDS. However, their knowledge level was rated as average to below average.Most respondents did not feel behavioral change was necessary for them. Conclusion. Behavioral -change development may begin with a desire for increased knowledge, but facts alone do not constitute effective prevention education for the sample population. AIDS prevention and risk reduction must incorporate education,attitude change, and practice integration of new behavioral skills. Objective: To measure knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about AIDS in the general population of Colorado. Methods: A 51-question random digit dial telephone survey of 400 Denver area and 200 other Colorado residents age 18-65 was conducted September 22-28, 1987. Up to 8 attenpts were made to reach each respondent. Results: A response rate of 68.5% produced the 600 respondents. 59% of respondents were 25-44; 70% educated be3ond high 84% were white, 8% hispanic, and 4% to selected questions were (%): Agree/ Undecided/ Disagree/ True Don't Know False AIDS spread from men to women during sex 98 1 1 IVDU's at high risk of AIDS 99 0 1 Can get AIDS from blood transfusions 98 1 1 Condom use reduces transmission of AIDS 90 9 1 AIDS spread by synptomatic patients only 19 8 73 Children with AIDS not kept frmo school 65 13 22 Don't fear AIDS by casual contact 79 9 12 Mosquitoes can spread AIDS 28 19 53 Quarantine AIDS patients 21 9 70 Gov't efforts adequate to control AIDS 24 10 66 H.S. students should be taught about AIDS 99 1 0 AIDS not punishnent for immoral behavior 69 12 19 Homosexual behavior should be illegal 34 13 53 Would not avoid friend with AIDS 83 10 7 Conclusions: Coloradans have a high awareness about AIDS, particularly regarding its transmission; still have some concern over casual transmission; harbor sane homophobic attitudes; and believe that local and federal governments have not done enough to control AIDS. 500 [Page 501](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/499) 9099 AIDS IN THE PUBLIC'S HIND: CHANGES OVER TIiE IN LONDON, NEW YORK, AND SAN FRANCISCO L Temoshok, DM Sweet, JM Moulton, J Zich, A O'Leary Langley Porter, Univ. of California, San Francisco, CA. Objective. To investigate how much AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior change may be influenced by social and cultural contexts and events. Methods. In 1985, we administered a survey to 400 residents of London, New York, and San Francisco. In 1987, we simultaneously administered the same survey with updated information, attitude, and behavior questions to 1,088 persons in the same 3 cities. Results. All analyses were controlled for age, education, and salary. For all 3 cities, knowledge about AIDS increased significantly (p<.0001) from 1985 to 1987. However, there was little change reported in sex, drug, or health behaviors associated with increased HIV risk. The general public \"less at risk\" for AIDS in both London and San Francisco had significantly fewer erroneous beliefs about casual transmission of AIDS in 1987 than in 1985. On the 1987 knowledge scale, the \"less at risk\" public in New York was significantly (pc<.01) less knowledgeable than their London and San Francisco counterparts. The New York sample also took a significantly (p<.0001) more fearful/reactionary stance towards AIDS and homosexuals. New Yorkers were significantly (p<.001) more likely to believe that some information about AIDS is being kept secret from them,. Conclusion. AIDS public health education campaigns must do more than merely present information; they must be sensitive to and address sociocultural and subcultural differences in attitudes and beliefs. 9100 C)ICAU)'S SGENEAL POPULATION AIDS SURVEY David G. Ostrow*, G Albrecht**, ' eilly*** *Chicago Department of Health, **University of Illinois at Chicago, ***Centers for Disease Control, U.S.A. Objectives. To provide information for an AIDS educational effort and a baseline for subsequent evaluation, we surveyed residents in the Chicago metropolitan area to assess their knowledge, attitudes and risk-related behaviors relative to AIDS. Methods. As part of a CDC-sponsored AIDS prevention education demonstration project, 1540 eligible respondents, age 18 to 60, were selected via random digit dialing. We oversampled black and Hispanic households in the City of Chicago to assure enough respondents from these groups to be able to design educational programs specific to these communities. Results. The response rate (the number of interviews completed over the total known eligible contacts 1540/2089) was 74%. Nearly all respondents (98%) have heard of AIDS and have received information about AIDS from television (99%). Of those persons seeing thes- selves at risk for AIDS, many have made behavioral changes to reduce that risk, with monogamy, reduced number of sexual partners, and condom use being the most frequently acknowledged. Despite the high levels of AIDS awareness in the adult population of Chicago, about onequarter believed that \"the AIDS virus\" is as easily transmitted as a cold. Most (98%) felt that the public schools should teach students about AIDS and 59% felt that AIDS education should begin before the 6th grade. Conclusion. The survey results are being used to help guide a public AIDS education program targeted to persons with low levels of AIDS awareness, misinformation about HIV transmission, and/or experiencing difficulty taking appropriate steps to reduce their risk of infection. Notes: 9101 Comparative survey of knowledge and attitudes about AIDS in Rhoe. Islanders in 1986 and 1987. Providence, RI, USA. BA DeBuono, HD Scott, CE Haskell, Janet Hodge RI Dept. of Heal* OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of AIDS education on Rhode Islanders in 1987. METHODS: Two random digit dial telephone surveys were conducted in December 1986 and 1987 and compared. Statistical analyses were performed, using chi sq. and Students T-test when appropriate. RESULTS: In each survey year four hundred adults responded. In both surveys there were slightly more female than male respondents. Median age was 40 and median educational level was 12 years. Despite more correct responses to questions about AIDS transmission and risk groups among 1987 than 1986 respondents misconceptions persisted. 8% of '87 respondents vs. 15% in '86 said AIDS could be transmitted by casual contact(p<.05). While 24% thought that AIDS could be transmitted by drinking from the same glass as a person with AIDS in 1986 16% felt this way in '87 (p<.05). Recognition of risk groups was unchanged in the two groups. 55% of respondents identified drug addicts as a risk group for AIDS in 1986 compared with 58% in 1987 (p>.05). Similarly, in 1986, only 12% vs. 9% in 1987 recognized heterosexuals as being at risk for AIDS (p>.05). Results were stratified by age, sex and educational level. AIDS knowledge varied directly with educational level and inversely with age in both surveys. Improvements in AIDS knowledge was most marked in those 55 and over and individuals with between 12 and 15 years of education. These points are illustrated in the following table: Blood Supply Safe?%Yes AIDS Children to School?%Yes 1986 1987 1986 1987 Age 55+ 36 48 68 80 Education 35 46 68 80 12-15 Yrs. All Respon.38 48 74 80 In both surveys, less than 10% of respondents changed their sexual behavior since learning of AIDS. Changes included increased condom use and reduction in the number of sex partners. CONCLUSION: Knowledge about AIDS improved but considerable misconception persists. Behavior change is lagging behind. 9102 THE PUBLUC'S IESPCNSE TO CCEIN ABOUT ADS IN OF PEVENTICN STRATEGIFS Timothy M. Sankary, M.D., M.P.H. AIDS Prevention Center, San Francisco, CA Objective. To assess the public's concern about AIDS and their behavioral response to that concern in their choi ce of preventi on strategi es, testi ng, and partners. Methods. We surveyed 830 adults (60% F, 40% M) at the San Franci son County Fair, where 52.6% were unattached sing] es and rest married or living with someone. Results. The percent concerned about becoming infected by HIV was highest in teens (80.6%) decreasing with age: concerned. Sing] es were most concerned (71.7%) followed by unmarried couples (49.0%) and married (38.3%). (p<001) Choice of prevention strategy significant]y favored abstinence in teenagers (45.2%) but this choice dropped to 15.5% of 20-40 y.o. and rose to 21.8% over 40 y.o. Condoms steadily decreased in wet contact) was as unpopular (13.9%) as condoms (12.1%) dropping from a high of 18.9% popularity among teens to 6.1% of those over 50(p<.01) The Safe Partner strategy (both uninfected) increased from 15.1% among teens to become the most popular strategy for those over 20 (50-61.2%)(p<.01). Among unattached singles abstinence(30.0%) and a Safe Partner(29.5%) were over Safe-Sex(15.8%) or coondoms(18.5%)(p(O1). Partners/last 12 no. were:None(13%),CkOne(60%),Two(12%),3 -5(10%1,6+(5%)and varied little by age or sex. Conclusion. These data undersoore the need to tailor the approach of AIDS prevention strategi es to address the needs of different segments of the population. 501 [Page 502](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/500) 9103 REGIONAL VARIATIONS ON NATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION POLLS BETWEEN 1983 and 1986 Susan M. Blake, Ph.D., and Arkin, E. * American National Red Cross Washington, D.C., U.S.A. Objective. To analyze change in public knowledge, attitudes and behavior by region during this period. Methods. Crosstabular comparisons were made on twentythree polls between 1983 and 1986 for the South, Northeast, Midwest, and Western United States. Regions conformed in most cases with the U.S. census definition. Nationally representative samples of between 759 and 2000 were summarized for adults over age eighteen. Results. Westerners appeared most knowledgeable, least judgemental, perceived themselves to be at risk, and were more likely to have done \"something\" to avoid risk. Northeasterners were most concerned about the disease, supportive of government involvement and likely to report self-protective actions. Midwesterners were less well informed, less likely to perceive AIDS as relevant to them, and least likely to have done anything to reduce risk. Southerners were most misinformed, supportive of restricting persons with AIDS, and likely to have made behavior changes that are unlikely to reduce their chance of getting AIDS. Conclusions. Regional variations appeared to parallel the prevalence of AIDS, as well as existing cultural or regional values. Implications for planning are discussed. 9104 UNDERSTANDING OF HIV TRANSMISSION BY THOSE INFECTED WITH HIV AND THEIR SEXUAL PARTNERS Kenneth Miller, E Donegan, and Patient Managers University of California, San Francisco Objective. To assess post-counseling knowledge about HIV and its transmission in anti-HIV(+) blood donors, blood recipients, hemophiliacs, and their sexual partners as compared to anti-HIV(-) controls. Methods. A sixteen item multiple choice questionnaire was distributed to 167 study participants and their sexual partners 6-12 months following standard verbal counseling regarding methods of HIV transmission. After privately completing the anonymous questionnaire, participants were asked to return the form in a sealed envelope. Results. 14/58 (24%) of anti-HIV(+) respondents were unaware that AIDS is caused by a virus but 57/58 (98%) correctly identified the bodily fluids that contain the highest concentrations of HIV. Unsafe sexual practices could be identified by 37/58 (64%) of anti-HIV(+) participants and their sexual partners as compared to 61/109 (56%) of anti-HIV(-) participants and their sexual partners (p=0.05). 25/58 (43%) of anti-HIV(+) participants and their sexual partners were able to identify safe sexual practices; 35/109 (32%) of the anti-HIV(-) respondents were able to identify tnese same practices (p=0.05). Conclusion. Verbal counseling about HIV and its transmission is equally effective for those who are HIV(+) compared to those who are HIV(-) but counseling sessions are not always successful and need repetition and reinforcement over time. Notes: 9105 INFORMATIONAL NEEDS, BELIEFS, AND BEHAVIORS, OF HIV SEROPOSITIVE MEN, Nancy C. Lovejoy*, Tracy Moran**, *University of California, San Francisco/ Davies Medical Center**San Francisco General Hospital Objective. To describe the health promotion practices, beliefs, and informational needs of HIV seropositive men in San Francisco. Methods. A sample of 178 self-selected, seropositive, male outpatients completed a modified version of an AIDS Beliefs and Behaviors Questionnaire developed by McKusick et. al., 1985. Results. Results showed that seven years into the epidemic, most patients (90%) believe that all sexual behaviors pose some risk of infection and many patients (40%) are celebate. Sexually active patients have few partners (X =.9 + 1.6) and have limited their use of possibly, unsafe sex (deep French kissing, digital intercourse, etc.) to known partners. Frequently cited reasons for altering previous behaviors were AIDS experiences or information (69%). Most patients (75%) are also using a variety of health promotion behaviors (ranging from avoiding public telephones to practicing \"herbology\") and want to know what impact these behaviors will have on their health status. In contrast to earlier reports, most patients (70%) want more information about building their immune system, and few (20%) want more information about safe sex. Patients also report wanting information about drugs currently under investigation, and many specified how they wished to receive this information. Conclusion. Patients in this sample have adopted conservative, responsible AIDS beliefs and behaviors, but health professionals need to monitor and address their changing informational needs, 9106 SUMMARY OF NATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION POLLS ON AIDS BY RACE Susan M. Blake, Ph.D., and Arkin, E. * American National Red Cross Washington, D.C., U.S.A. Objective. To analyze change in knowledge, attitudes and behavior by race between 1983 and 1986. Methods. Crosstabular comparisons on twenty-two polls were conducted using the.following categories; Black, White, Hispanic, Asian American, and Other. Sample sizes overall ranged from 759 to 2405. Population subgroups for other than Whites, Blacks, and Non-Whites were too small for meaningful comparison. Results reflect primarily Black vs White differences. Results. Blacks were more interested, expressed more personal concern and fear, and had greater misperceptions about AIDS than Whites. Increased concerns paralleled greater support for government regulations, and more self-protective behavior. Blacks were more likely to have changed sexual behaviors as a result of AIDS, and more likely to volunteer time or contribute money to help with the problem than White respondents. Conclusions. Increased education targeting minorities to reduce misperceptions, increase accurate risk appraisals, and motivate and sustain positive behavior changes was indicated. Encouraging community involvement to help with the problem is also suggested. Messages targeting the non-white population must increase appropriate perceptions of vulnerability. 502 [Page 503](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/501) 07 osnital Worlkers F- A 1 PP,: I nderstand in 9107 the Imnortance of Contact.

Objective.To measure perceived stress among hospital workers of AIDS patients-to determine effects of contact.knowledge death anxiety homophobia on perceived risk, stress, and comfort. Methods.Surveyed 256 hospital workers.Using mul-- tivariate analyses the variables of contact, knowledge, death anxiety & homophobia were related to perceived stress, risk of contagion & comfort with AIDS patients. Results.30-40% of sample scored high on nerceived risk. stress & discomfort. Demoranhics of age,race.sex did not effect responses. Homophobia related positively with discomfort risk 5 -stress. Knowledge related negatively with these variables.Contact related positively with all three variables. Death anxiety related significantly only with stress.Technicians renort higher levels of risk & discomfort. Nurses rerort higher levels of risk.Doctors show lower levels of comfort, higher levels of stress. 20-367 of variance in the denendent variables is exnlained by the multiple regression analyses. Conclusion. Hosnital staff AIDS education nrograms must include issues such as homonhobia 5 -death anxiety in order to enhance workers' coping with stress, risk, and comfort with AIDS patients. 9108 KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES OF HEALTH CARE STAFF TO HIV INFECTION I.Klimes*, J.Catalan**, A.Bond**, A.Day**. *Dept. of Clinical Psychology, and **Oxford University Dept. of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, Oxford, U.K. Objective. To survey knowledge about HIV infection and attitudes to HIV+ patients' care amongst doctors and nurses; and to examine their relationship and implications for further staff training. Methods. A randomly selected sample of 400 health workers (100 each of hospital doctors, general hospital, psychiatric and community nurses) was mailed a 49-item questionnaire. This comprised a Knowledge section (transmission, infection control, and occupational risk), and an Attitudes section (to general management, clinical skills needed, and to patients from different high risk groups). Results. Response rate was 64%. Of these 23% had previously cared for HIV+ patients. Average for correct answers on Knowledge across all professional groups was 85%; however, those who previously cared for HIV+ patients, and doctors, were significantly (p( 0.01) more accurate due to their better understanding of transmission and infection control. The better informed the staff were about HIV, the more positive was their overall attitude towards caring for HIV+ patients (pl 0.001) and towards AIDS sufferers (p4 0.01). Three-quarters of respondents indicated the need for further information. Conclusion. Ensuring that health care staff are accurately informed about HIV infection is likely to lead to good attitude to the care of HIV patients. The results highlight the need for continuing education,, Notes: 9109 A STANARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRE FOR HEA CARE PROVIDERS Margaret Grade, N Bliwise*, H Bartnof, J Mandel, J Ziegler, and L Zegans. University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, *Pacific Graduate School of Professional Psychology Objective. To develop a reliable and valid, standardized measure of AIDS knowledge, attitudes and opinions for immediate use within 16 U.S. medical school training institutions. Methods. Epidemiologic data, clinical observations, and a comprehensive review of existent AIDS surveys, related psychological measures, and corresponding findings were bases for a 71 item questionnaire inclusive of 3 sections and 7 proposed subscales. Reliability was tested on a sample N of 30. A revised questionnaire was administered to 763 health care students, faculty and practitioners. Principal component analysis preceded standard factor analysis. Results. The knowledge component proved differentially applicable to the broad range of respondent education, personal, AIDS-related demographics and experience. Select opinion items, based on scientifically devised orders of magnitude, proved particularly robust. Among attitudinal items, 4 principal factors emerged: contagion; stigmatization; death anxiety; and social desirability. Conclusion. A sound measure of AIDS knowledge, and of psychological barriers to assimilation and application of knowledge has been developed. It is a measure which will confidently allow for comparisons within and across sites, and across time; it will serve as a vital component of educational program planning, evaluation, and revision. 9110 AIDS-RELATED KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS AMONG EMPLOYEES AT A U.S. HOSPITAL Keith Henry*, S Campbell*, K Willenbring* *St. Paul-Ramsey Medical Center, St. Paul, Minnesota,USA Objective. Examine variables which affect AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors among hospital workers. Methods. In September 1987, an anonymous survey was delivered to every employee (2980) of a 455-bed acute care teaching hospital and its associated clinics. The survey included scales measuring AIDS-related knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes. Many items were included in previous studies by Gordin et al (1987), Link et al (1987), Hudson et al (1980), and Shultz et al (1988). Results. Responses were obtained from 2351 (79%) of the employees. One-half (52%) indicated that hospital workers should be allowed to refuse to care for AIDS patients, 74% indicated concern about job-related HIV exposure, and 27% indicated that all AIDS patients should be quarantined. Multivariate analysis found that factors correlated with positive behaviors and attitudes toward AIDS patients were lower homophobia scores, higher AIDS knowledge scores, expressed confidence in AIDS-related medical information, and a greater number of previous contacts with AIDS patients (p<.0001). Those with a family member or close friend with AIDS showed more positive attitudes and behaviors (p<.02). Level of education was correlated with knowledge about AIDS (p(0001), but not with positive attitudes or behaviors towards AIDS patients. Conclusions. Educational efforts should attempt to improve the hospital employee's knowledge about AIDS and their confidence in AIDS-related medical information. Efforts to address homophobia should also be considered. 503 [Page 504](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/502) 9111 HOSPITAL POLICIES RELATING TO AIDS: A U.S. SURVEY Felissa L. Cohen, S. Dudas, C. Ferrans University of Illinois at Chicago Objective. To examine hospital policies and practices as they relate to issues arising from the AIDS pandemic. Staff and patient issues were both examined. Methods. A questionnaire was developed based on the literature and was pretested and subjected to a panel of experts for content validity. Four hospitals from each state in the U.S. and the District of Columbia were randomly selected for a total sample size of 204. Results. Returns to date total 121 for a response rate of 59.3%. The number of beds of participating hospitals ranged from 16 to 1700. Patient issues to be discussed include patient placement, confidentiality, HIV testing and others. Staff issues to be discussed include procedures for refusal to care for AIDS patients, HIV testing, differential pay for AIDS patient care and others. The type and composition of committees dealing with AIDS issues, and the formulation and dissemination of AIDS-related policies will be described. Data will be analyzed in relation to hospital size, type, location, number of AIDS patients admitted within the last year and other pertinent demographic variables. Conclusion. Data analysis is still in progress. It will be completed by March 31. 9112:A.E.Phila.ithis (1), V.Georgoulias (,3), V.Tsilivakos (3), I.Vlachonikolis (4,1), M.Fioretos (1).

AIDS came to the attention of the public in Greece in 1985. Since then the government has started a health education campaign and the mass media have given firstpage coverage to the topic. Subjective evidence indicated that although facts about transmission are understood, fear and prejudice dominate attitudes towards AIDS. We started a study in order to provide objective evidence of this fact. The study consisted of a self-administered anonymous questionaire with 87 items covering sources of information, knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of respondes-, 3 groups have been surveyed so far: 373 army recruits and commissioned officers, 57 high school teachers and 138 students of a nursing school. The results show a discordance between levels of knowledge and attitudes towards HIV carriers. The findings to be presented show that the health education campaign has had less impact than hoped. The sources of information of respondes were mostly the mass media rather than the official health education campaign. Furthermore, attitudes towards issues such as sexual behaviour and isolation of carriers are still marked by prejudice. The study illustrates the need for a more intensive and direct campaign. This research was funded in part by BRSG grant # 2 S07 RR05776-07, Division of Research Resources, NIH. Notes: 9113 Student Nurses' Fear of AIDS. Lula Lester, Betty Beard, Eastern Michigan University. The purpose of this study was to explore student nurses' fears about AIDS. There is an escalating likelihood that students in nursing today will encounter a patient with AIDS at some point in their nursing careers. In this study it was hypothesized that fear would be affected by knowledge level about AIDS and that interactions would occur between and among fear, willingness to care, and attitudes about homosexuality. Lazarus' cognitive theory of stress and coping provided the conceptual framework. The sample consisted of 177 students in a BSN program. Two instruments were developed which included which included questions related to fear of AIDS, knowledge about AIDS,willingness to care for AIDS patients, and feelings and beliefs about homosexuality. Students with high fear scores were less willing to care for AIDS patients, had higher knowledge scores, and expressed more negative attitudes toward homosexuality. Students who were homophobic were afraid that they might contract AIDS during routine care or carry the virus home. They believed that AIDS patients should be isolated from the public and would quit their jobs rather than care for them. 19% of the students believed that AIDS is God's way of punishing homosexuality. Considering the impact of AIDS onthe health care delivery system and in the future, designers of school curricula must respond by providing accurate information to students and by working to allay students' fears. Nursing faculty must implement effective teaching strategies to prepare students to cope with the challenges inherent in the care of a patient with AIDS. 9114 AIDS FACTS AND NURSING CARE KNOWLEDGE AMONG NURSES IN THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, USA F.L. Cohen*,, J. Durham**, K. Smith*,I.Cohen*** University of Illinois at Chicago*, Illinois Wesleyan University**, Illinois State University\"*** Objective. To determine nurses' knowledge of general AIDS facts (AIDSFACTS) and facts about nursing care(AIDSCARE). To explore the relationship between selected demographic variables (e.g. size of practice location, actual care of AIDS patients, age etc) and the degree of knowledge. Methods. One hundred fifty nurses were randomly selected from nurses licensed to practice in Illinois and were sent a questionnaire. The instruments used had undergone extensive prior testing and refinement including content validity, item analysis and factor analysis. The internal consistency yielded an alpha of.8803(AIDSFACTS) and.8748 (AIDSCARE). Nurses rated their attitudes to somewone with AIDS as negative, positive or neutral. Results. One hundred thirty-one responded for a response rate of 87.3%. The overall scores for the AIDSFACTS was low (55.5%). For AIDSCARE it was higher (mean=14.4 of possible 20). Nurses living in larger cities scored significantly higher on AIDSFACTS and AIDSCARE[t(127)= -4.04,p<.001, t(126)=-2.39,p=.018] respectively than those in smaller locales. Those who had cared for AIDS patients scored significant ly higher on AIDSCARE [F=5.53 (2,126), p=.005], but there was no significant difference for AIDSFACTS. Those with positive attitudes toward AIDS patients scored significantly higher on AIDSFACTS but not on AIDSCARE [F(2, 128)=8.12, p=.0005]. Conclusion. It appears that those with at least the potential of exposure to AIDS patients possess more knowledge about AIDS. 504 [Page 505](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/503) 9115 OPINIONS ABOUT PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES AND AIDS FACT KNOWLEDGE AMONG U.S. NURSES F.L. Cohen*, J. Durham**, K.Smith*,I. Cohen'*, *University of Illinois, Chicago;**Illinois Wesleyan University, ***Illinois State University Objective. To Examine public policy opinions and AIDS facts knowledge among a sample of United States nurses. To examine the relationship between those opinions and knowledge and selected demographic variables. Method. Registered nurses holding a license to practice Were randomly selected through state board of nursing listings. Questionnaires were sent to 120 nurses in each of 7 geographic locations for a total of 840. To date, 421 have been returned. Each instrument had undergone extensive development (item analysis, validity determinations and factor analysis) and pilot testing. Internal consistency alphas for reliability were for the public policyt (PUBPOL).9419, AIDS knowledge (AIDSFACTS).8803, and the Index of Homophobia,.9417. Results. Data collection is not yet complete. Issues to be discussed include the relationship between PUBPOL, AIDSFACTS and the Index of Homophobia, geographic location, contact with AIDS patients, academic preparation, clinical practice specialty, sex, age etc. These nurses perceived risk of contracting AIDS, needlestick exposure, opinions about refusal to care for patients and HIV testing will be discussed. Qualitatie data will also be presented. Conclusion. Data collection is nearly complete. Data entry has begun and analysis will be completed by April. This research was supported in part by BRSG grant #2 S07 RR05776-07, Nurses' Attitudes about AIDS: An International Study. Betty Beard, L. Lester, S. Ivey, N. Prince, Eastern Michigan University. The number of children with AIDS remains small. However, about 80% of the cases of children with AIDS are thought to be infected through perinatal transmission. As the largest group of health care personnel, it is extremely likely that nurses will encounter a patient with AIDS, or one who is HIV-positive, at some time in their nursing careers. Caring for AIDS patients elicits strong emotional responses in providers. In the obstetrical area, these responses may be difficult to acknowledge or express because of the nature of the clinical area: life-giving/lifepromoting. The purpose of this international study was to assess the attitudes and knowledge of obstetrical nurses about AIDS. Nurse midwives (N=162) at 4 hospitals in England were surveyed in November, 1987 while obstetrical nurses (N=150) in midwest U.S. hospitals were surveyed in Winter, 1988. The instrument, made up of 67 demographic, knowledge, and attitude items was pretested for reliability and validity. Preliminary results suggest that nurses who have cared for an AIDS patient have less fear of AIDS and are more willing to care for AIDS patients. The general level of knowledge of nurses, related to perinatal transmission and epidemiology of AIDS, is high. Conclusions will present direction for staff education programs to reduce fear. Notes: 9117 SURVEY ON AIDS KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE, AND BEHAVIORS IN A HETEROGENEOUS, HIGH-RISK SAMPLE, FLORIDA Spencer Lieb*, M Kuechler**, H Cummings*, M Rigaud*, J Sims*, *Florida Department of Health & Rehabilitative Services, **Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, USA Objective. To assess and compare levels of AIDS knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors in groups at high risk in a region having >2,400 reported AIDS cases. Methods. In 1987, a survey was administered anonymously in English, Haitian Creole, or Spanish to 2,328 persons sampled non-randomly in four south Florida counties. Questions focused on behavioral modes of transmission, HIV antibody testing, and condom use. Results. Based on self-reported behaviors, 2,153 respondents were classified as gay/bisexual male (N=676); (268); sexually transmissible disease (STD) client (299); heterosexual with multiple partners (337) or single partner (350); and persons with no recent IV drug abuse or sexual activity (223). Overall, 22% engage in sexual activities they do not recognize as a way to transmit HIV. Levels of awareness of the antibody test vary widely by behavioral group, from 57% for STD clients (11% previously tested) to 92% for gay/bisexual males (35% tested, of whom 32% were seropositive). In each of the 6 groups, >60% would be tested if they learned a sex partner was HIVinfected. Overall, only 8% always use condoms, but 87% would use them if a partner was known to be infected. Conclusion. Low subjective assessments of risk largely influence decisions on condom use and antibody testing in this sample. Favorable attitudes toward AIDS prevention only marginally translate into behavior. 9118 FEAR OF CONTAGION AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIER O KNWLEDGE AND REIATED CARE Harvey Bartnof, M Grade, J Ziegler, J Mandel, and L Zegans University of CA San Francisco School of Medicine Objective. To develop a means of evaluating psychological barriers-particularly fear of contagion--to assimilation and eventual application of AIDS knowledge by medical students. Method. Opinion items with respect to risk of contagion were formulated on the bases of: provider reports collected within the context of focus groups; previous survey findings; and bicmedical findings as reported both in the scientific literature and by available epidemiologists. Consensually agreed upon items were constructed according to orders of magnitude. Reliability was tested, and revised questionnaires were administered to all incoming UCSF medical students (N=142). Data was analyzed by a sample T test of group to population means. Correlations between extremity and knowledge measures were likewise calculated. Results. Fears of contagion were not only found to be significantly elevated, but in exaggerated form, found to preclude assimilation of even basic biomedical information about AIDS. Fifteen of 17 opinion items revealed deviation scores of significant proportions. Data analysis additionally revealed a significant inverse relationship between these same collective items and knowledge measures. Conclusion. A major psychological barrier to traditional (didactic), professional AIDS education is a fear of contagion which extends significantly beyond available biomedical findings. Optimal education--and thus patient care-must include particular attention to this cofactor of resistance. 505 [Page 506](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/504) 9119 CROSS-ETHNIC ATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT P. Judin,* Cathalene Teahan**, W-S Tseng* *University of Hawaii, Department of Psychiatry **The AIDS Foundation of Hawaii Objective: To determine the knowledge about AIDS information,the attitudes toward Persons with AIDS, and sources of information among the four major ethnic groups of high school (HS) and adult populations living in Hawaii. Methods: Using a survey developed for this study, AIDS knowledge, attitudes and behavior data were obtained by self report and guided interview from 466 adults and 1464 students. Nurse and gay bar samples served as controls. 371 students responded to a post-test. Results: There were significant differences (p<.01) among ethnic groups both in HS and adult populations. Known routes of HIV transmission were accurately identified by over 90% of all groups. Casual contacts were misperceived significantly among groups and by age, occupation and occupation. Attitudes toward PWAs also differentiated groups. Knowledge and attitude scores were not related. Media were the prominent sources of information, physicians and religious groups least. AIDS instruction improved scores. Conclusion: AIDS educational materials and interventions need to be designed to target specific ethnic groups. Attitude needs to be emphasized in educational efforts. A one hour presentation for HS students can effectively boost knowledge. Physicians and clergy need to provide more education about AIDS. 9120 PREVALENCE OF HIV INFECTION IN AN URBAN COLLEGE CAMPUS: R. Shah, M.D., H. Wallace, Dr.PH, R. Kincade, R.N., Long Beach City Health Department, Long Beach, CA U.S.A. Objective. Determine prevalence rate of HIV infection in an urban college campus; knowledge of HIV prevalence is essential to: (a) project incidence of HIV infection in a select population; (b) develop profiles of behavior contributing to transmission; and (c) reduce HIV transmission using effective prevention strategies. Methods. The test site is at the Long Beach Campus of California State University with a student population of over 33,000, and known cases of AIDS and ARC. Individuals at the test site were self-selected students and employees. The study group was matched to a control group of STD patients with similar patterns of promiscuity, risk status, age, and sex ratios. Results. 3ased on 142 study and 163 control subjects tested to date, no infections were detected in the study group, while the infection rate was 4.3% (7/163) in the control group. Of the self-identified heterosexuals in both groups, 94% (72/77) of the study group vs. 97% (136/140) of the control group, admitted to multiple sexual partners, while 12% (9/77) of the study group vs. 71% (100/140) of the control group adnitted to other risk factors. Conclusion. In this study, the numbers of sexual partners do not appear to be the determining factor for the difference in prevalence rates. The evaluation of additional risk behaviors will be shown as significant in contributing to the transmission of HIV. Notes: 9121 9122 AMERICAN INDIAN AIDS. Peter I. Hartsock, CMB, DCR, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Rockville, Maryland, U.S.A. Objective: To describe the development of AIDS among American Indians. Methods. Data and information collected from various Indian tribes by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Indian Health Service, and the Centers for Disease Control are analyzed to describe how AIDS has developed among American Indians, risk factors associated with this development, and its impact both on Indians and upon public health resources. Results: Most Indian AIDS cases (44 as of Sept., 19t/--CDC) to date have not occurred on reservations but in urban areas, particularly in California and New York. The rate of increase has paralleled that of the general U.S. population. There is growing concern, however, that this rise will become more rapid as AIDS spreads among reservation populations. The following factors are a few of the variables which appear to contribute to this possible increase in the rate of change: increase in intravenous drug abuse, alcoholism, bisexuality, very sexually active youth, and geographic isolation with more intimacy among reservation Indians. Conclusion: The National Association of American Indian Physicians has declared that AIDS may be the most serious Indian health crisis in the 20th Century. While further information and data are needed to confirm trends in Indian AIDS, enough information is available to document the need for rapid development of prevention measures. 506 [Page 507](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/505) 9123 THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN SWEDEN: CHANGES IN AWARENESS, ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR Bengt Brorsson, C Herlitz Dept of Social Medicine, Uppsala University, Uppsala Objective. To present results on state of and change in awareness, attitudes and knowledge of HIV and AIDS, sexual behavior and related factors in the Swedish adult population. Methods. Four wawes of mail surveys based on random samples of 4000 individuals aged 16-44 years of age. The response rate fluctuated around 70 percent. Results. General public awareness about how the virus is carried and transmitted increased over the period studied. Among all groups, however, widespread misunderstandings exists concerning the risk of infection from various objects. One measurable effect on behavior which appeared in this study was that respondents who were celibate the month before the surveys increased from 28 to 36 percent. Increasing numbers of respondents also feel it is acceptable to institute mandatory medical examinations for certain risk groups. Conclusion. The general public views the epidemic with growing concern, they are familiar with how the disease spreads and they feel that it is up to individuals to adapt their behavior if we are to slow the spread of infection. 9124 PRACTICAL PROBLEMS DURING HIV INFECTION NATIONAL SEROSURVEY: THE UGANDAN EXPERIENCE J.F. Kengeya-Kayondo, J.R. Ndumu & Research Institute, P.O. Box 49, ENTEBBE Objectives: To give a brief presentation of the methodology of the HIV infection national serosurvey in Uganda; to discuss the practical problems that were encountered at the different stages of the first HIV infection National survey in Uganda; to highlight different practical approaches that were used to solve or minimize these problems and to recommend some practical approaches to other countries that may be planning a National HIV infection serosurvey. Methods: The methodology of the serosurvey will be briefly presented. Practical experiences and problems during the serosurvey will be discussed particularly regarding the following aspects. Final planning and piloting; introductory and mobilisation activities; selecting the starting household; questionnaire administration; blood sample collection, storage, transport and analysis; methods of maximizing participation and analysis of results and interpretation. Results: Results relevant to practical problems will be presented. Details of total and type of samples collected; rate of refusal to participate and reasons; total questionnaires and any problem answers and loss of specimens during transport, storage or through haemolysis. Conclusions and Recommendations: Based on the Ugandan experience, some practical recommendations will be made that may prove useful to other countries that have not participated in a National HIV infection serosurvey of this nature. Notes: 9125 SERO-SURVEY FOR HIV UGANDA J.R. Ndumu, Kengeya-Kayondo & W. Namaara Uganda Virus Research Institute, P.O. Box 49, ENTEBBE Objective: To obtain an estimate of the overall proportion of adults and children with serological evidence of HIV infection in Uganda. Methods: Cluster sampling procedures were employed in this study. The method used to select the first household varied according to the population density (rural versus urban) and the available information e.g. lists of households. Blood specimens were collected by venupuncture from adults (15 years and above) and older children (5-14 years) using vacutainers. The under five children were bled by finger prick and blood was sampled with paper discs. Information on the health status of the population was obtained by a questionnaire. On-spot medical treatment of minor complaints was readily given. The ELISA and Dot EIA were to be the methods of choice for screeing and Western Blot for confirmation. Results: A total of 3495 samples was collected from 21 rural parishes and 4 urban centres of which 49.3% were children's specimens. Tremedous co-operation was registered from the study population. 9126 PREDICTORS OF HIV SEROSTATUS AT AN ALTERNATIVE TEST SITE Fen Rhodes*, N. H. Corby**, R. J. Wolitski*, R. L. Kincade**, *Psychology Department, California State University, Long Beach, CA, USA, **Department of Public Health, Long Beach, CA, USA Objective. To examine sexual and nonsexual factors associated with serostatus among gay/bisexual men presenting for HIV-antibody testing at an Alternative Test Site. Methods. Between December 1985 and February 1987, 3,314 first-time testees completed questionnaires detailing sexual activities, brief health history, and lifestyle factors. Data were analyzed by cross tabulation and stepwise logistic regression against client serostatus. Results. Seropositivity (women). Logistic regression equations for 2,163 gay/bisexual men, using a cluster of 42 individually significant ( p<.01) predictors of HIV serostatus, yielded the following findings: (1) Among sexual activities, receptive anal intercourse (ROR=1.5) and number of sexual partners during past year (ROR=1.3) were the strongest unique predictors; oral sex made no independent contribution to increased risk of seropositivity (p>.10). (2) The strongest nonsexual cofactors were: frequency of recreational drug use (ROR=1.4), history of liver disease (ROR=1.5), and history of high blood pressure (ROR=1.4). These findings were substantially equivalent for both gay and gay/bisexual cohorts. Conclusion. These findings are generally consistent with findings of earlier studies and demonstrate the predictive uniqueness of sexual, drug-use, and \"liverdisease\" cofactors. The meaning of self-reported high blood pressure as a specific cofactor is not clear. 507 [Page 508](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0006.001/506) All authors in alphabetical order Author Abstract no Author Abstract no Author p Aaby, P Abad, S Abatte, Ebo Abcekke R A Abdul-Quader, Abu S Abdul-Quader, Abu S Abdul-Wahab, A Abe, T Abe, T Abel, Carlos a Abel, S Abenhaim, L Abenhaim, L Abramczuk, J Abramczuk, J Abrams, D Abrams, D Abrams, D Abrams, D Abrams, D A Abrams, D A Abrams, D A Abrams, D I Abrams, D I Abrams, D I Abrams, D I Abrams, Donald Abrams, Donald I Abrams, Donald I Abrams, Donald I Abrams, Elaine J Abramson, I Abu, A S Abu-Lisan, M Abu-Lisan, Mustafa Abu-Lisan, Mustafa N Adal, G Adal, G Adal, G Adamkiewicz.
