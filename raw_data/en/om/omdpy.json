The Indian Association of Palliative care (IAPC) definition of Palliative Care (Medicine) states that \"Palliative Care is the active total care applicable from the time of diagnosis, aimed at improving the quality of life of patients and their families facing serious life-limiting illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering from pain and other physical symptoms as well as psychological, social and spiritual distress throughsocially acceptable and affordable interventions\". The key features of Palliative Medicine are, recognition and relief of pain and other symptoms, recognition and relief of psychosocial suffering, including care and support for families and caregivers, recognition and relief of spiritual / existential suffering, recognition of End of Life Care needs and provision of End of Life Care and Bereavement Support after death. Palliative Medicine is applicable to all life limiting conditions such as cancer, advanced HIV/AIDS, end stage organ failure, chronic neurodegenerative conditions etc. Palliative Medicine should be applied early and should be integrated with all health services. Specialist Training in Palliative Medicine involves 24 months broad experience (Core Training) in Palliative medicine and 12 months focused experience (Non - Core Training) in cancer medicine, general medicine and related subspecialty and others. The goal of this training program is to provide competency-based training in symptom management, supportive care, awareness of a range of medical and non-medical options available for the disease management of palliative care patients, psychosocial support to patients and families, working in a multi- disciplinary/inter-disciplinary team, working in different clinical settings, communication skills,decision making skills, procedural skills relevant to Palliative Medicine, ethics based good practice, leadership, teaching and research. At the completion of the Specialist Training Program in Palliative Medicine, as defined by the curriculum, it is expected that the postgraduate trainee will have acquired knowledge, attitude and clinical skills required for competent palliative medicine practice. SUBJECT SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES The trainee at the end of training would have acquired the ability to: 1. Manage pain and other physical symptoms, using appropriate clinical assessment methods, rational investigations and provide relief of pain and symptoms by pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods. 2.
