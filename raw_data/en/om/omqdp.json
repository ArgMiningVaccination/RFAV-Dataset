A natural alkalizer and detoxifier baking soda is great at pulling out blockages from the aura. Returning your energetic vibration to something more neutral. Leaving you with a sense of peace, and equilibrium. This is especially helpful when dealing with exhausting people, or situations. I find it combats feelings of anxiety and depression very well. Simply run a bath of warm water that feels relaxing to the touch. Add a cup of baking soda to water. As the water runs the baking soda will begin to dissolve neutralizing the water's acidity, not only leaving you feeling energetically level, but also leaving your skin feeling silky smooth. I like to say a prayer or affirmation while bathing in a spiritual cleansing bath. This can be a simple statement that comes straight from the heart. Something like: \"As I relax into this healing bath all negative blockages and energies dissolve. I am wrapped in the light of the Universe.\" APPLE CIDER VINEGAR BATH Apple Cider Vinegar is another great remedy for energetic blocks and releasing psychic toxins. Soaking in Apple cider vinegar is beneficial for easing skin issues, detoxify and restoring its natural ph balance. It is also rich in vitamins and minerals which can be absorbed through the skin. The onset of a cold can often mean energetic disturbances in the aura...taking an apple cider vinegar bath will help the cold run its course, and move the energetic debris out of your system. Again, you will run a warm bath that is relaxing to the touch. Adding 1-2 cups of Apple cider vinegar to the bath water. Slip into the tub, easing your mind and relaxing. Allow yourself to become completely embraced by the experience. You can visualize the energetic toxins, and debris being drawn from your body/aura, into the bath to be neutralized. Be sure to allow your head to be submerged for a few moments.The base of the head/back of the neck is one of the major places we take on stray energy. You can also use the above affirmation, or an appropriate prayer during this bath. If the smell of Apple cider vinegar is offensive to your nose then add a 5-10 drops of peppermint oil to the bath. Peppermint is also a detoxifier, and it uplifts the senses... Easing the mind and emotions. SEA SALT BATH Sea Salt is a traditional bath for spiritual cleansing. Salt also has a detoxifying quality that will draw out impurities in the energy bodies. You can substitute sea salt for Epsom salt which is high in magnesium, easing aches, pains and the muscles. Run a warm bath adding in a handful of sea salt. As you soak begin to imagine the tube filling with pure white light. This is the healing light of the Universe. Imagine any dark, and negative vibrations lingering in the aura being absorbed by this light. Envision these blocks being replaced with nothing but positive intentions. Salt can dry out the skin so you may want to dress yourself with a rich oil after your bath. You can dress yourself with a mixture of olive oil, and lemongrass essential oil to nourish the skin, and charge the aura with a magnetic quality.Lemongrass oil is an old botanical used for attracting prosperity and good fortune. BAKING SODA, SEA SALT, AND VINEGAR BATH Adding all 3 ingredients together will create a wonderful spiritual cleansing bath!! Or combine them as you like. Remember to use an affirmation, prayer or visualization. After bathing spend time in meditation, prayer, or just relax for the evening. I like to make a warm cup of chamomile and valerian tea to calm my nerves and promote sleep. Turn in early for the night, allowing the healing process to continue into sleep. If you are feeling especially heavy and blocked use a spiritual cleansing bath for 7 consecutive days.
