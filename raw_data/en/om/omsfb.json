However, since there is the work from flow in all cases, we like to rewrite the equation so that this is taken into account. Derivation: Closed system balance: combining the first two equations, Open System Energy Balance Equation: H = 0 if there are no temperature changes, phase changes, or chemical reactions. Also, U = 0 for small pressure changes pf a few atm for most systems. Ek = 0 if the system doesn't change velocity Ep = 0 if the system doesn't move vertically Q = 0 if the system doesn't exchange heat with the surroundings, that is, if the system is adiabatic or insulated Ws = 0 if there are no moving parts, no electrical currents, or radiation exchanged between the system and the surroundings. Example 1: Two streams of water are mixed to form the feed to a boiler. Note: Often, even for the simplest energy balances on open systems, we will need to calculate H for changes in temperature and pressure(unlike in the previous example, where the enthalpys were simply given). In this book, obtaining H from changes in temperature and pressure are given in chapter 8. So, even though the equations have already been given here, we will continue these problems in that section. | | \u00a9 2007 Arizona Board of Regents for The University of Arizona "}
