The College provides the means for undergraduates to acquire a liberal arts education: an education that broadens the student's knowledge and awareness in the major areas of human knowledge, significantly deepens that awareness in one or two fields, and prepares the foundation for a lifetime of continual learning. The distinguishing mark of the university is that its faculty is engaged in the discovery and dissemination of knowledge, thereby offering students an unusually rich opportunity to gain a liberal education. A liberal arts education begins with the premise that one's world and one's self are worth knowing. To understand our world, we must know something about its physical, biological, cognitive, social, cultural, and spiritual dimensions. The liberal arts provide these perspectives on knowledge to serve as the basis for a full and effective professional and personal life. No better preparation for success in the professions exists than a strong liberal arts education, and our experience demonstrates that the liberal arts help develop the rigor of mind needed for advanced study in any field and for the pursuit of a richer life through the enlargement of mind and spirit. By its very name, a liberal arts education suggests that broadness of study is a primary concern. It inspires openness and breadth of mind, regard for values unlike our own, and respect for the creative processes of diverse disciplines. The liberal arts emphasize cultural, social, and biological change and assess the impact of technological progress on the world's environment. They generate appreciation and understanding of many societies' past accomplishments and provide the basis for future insight and enterprise. At Indiana University, the liberal arts curriculum of the College of Arts and Sciences directs its students to achieve 11 major goals: 1.Our students must achieve the genuine literacy required to read and listen effectively, and to speak and write clearly and persuasively. 2.The liberal arts teach students to think critically and creatively . As perceptive analysts of what they read, see, and hear, students must learn to reason carefully and correctly and to recognize the legitimacy of intuition when reason and evidence prove insufficient. 3.By gaining intellectual flexibility and breadth of mind, liberal arts students remain open to new ideas and information, willing to grow and learn, and sensitive to others' views and feelings. 4.The curriculum of the College of Arts and Sciences helps students discover ethical perspectives so that they can formulate and understand their own values, become aware of others' values, and discern the ethical dimensions underlying many of the decisions they must make.5.A quality liberal arts education includes an appreciation of literature and the arts and the cultivation of the aesthetic judgment that makes possible the enjoyment and comprehension of works of the creative imagination. 6.Liberal arts students must understand and practice scientific methods . This approach to knowledge forms the basis of scientific research; guides the formation, testing, and validation of theories; and distinguishes conclusions that rest on unverified assertion from those developed through the application of scientific reasoning. 7.Mathematical and statistical studies teach arts and sciences students to reason quantitatively , a skill essential in an increasingly technological society. 8.A liberal arts education must develop historical consciousness so that students can view the present within the context of the past, appreciate tradition, and understand the critical historical forces that have influenced the way we think, feel, and act. 9.The College of Arts and Sciences emphasizes the study of the international community and encourages students to become involved in the contemporary world. By understanding the range of physical, geographic, economic, political, religious, and cultural realities influencing world events, students cultivate an informed sensitivity to global and environmental issues. 10.Students in the liberal arts develop basic communication skills in at least one foreign language, providing the fundamental skills for communicating with people from other cultures and offering insights into other patterns of thought and modes of expression. 11.The breadth of knowledge characteristic of a liberal arts education requires an in-depth knowledge of at least one subject to be complete. Students in the College of Arts and Sciences must learn to acquire and manage a coherent, sophisticated understanding of a major body of knowledge with all its complexities, power, and limitations. The liberal arts education of the College of Arts and Sciences provides the fundamental knowledge, skills, and experience essential for a full, rich, and rewarding life. Such an education taps many of the capacities that we as human beings possess. It offers us fuller lives, in understanding and expressing ourselves and in relating to others. The arts and sciences are pre-professional in the best sense. They serve as a foundation for many professions, many ways of earning a living. More than training for today's occupations, a liberal arts education offers students the foresight and flexibility they will need as they move on to careers and technologies not yet known or imagined. Finally, a liberal arts education develops the qualities of mind that are needed by informed and responsible people. Any decision or action\u2014whether personal or professional \u2014informed by knowledge, rationality, and compassion makes the greatest contribution to a better world.2Overview Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 The College of Arts and Sciences The education offered by the College of Arts and Sciences is based on a tradition established when Indiana University was founded in 1820 as a liberal arts institution. What are now departments in the College served then as the core of the university from which all the other schools and units developed. Today the College continues its central role in the mission of Indiana University. The College not only offers more than 70 baccalaureate majors leading to the Bachelor of Arts, the Bachelor of Science, the Bachelor of Fine Arts, and the Bachelor of General Studies degrees; it also provides much of the general education for undergraduate students in the Schools of Education, Informatics and Computing, Journalism, Public and Environmental Affairs, Public Health, Social Work, the Kelley School of Business, and the Jacobs School of Music. At the heart of the College's tradition is excellence in teaching based on excellence in research. College faculty, who are at the forefront of their disciplines, teach at all levels of the curriculum, from freshman through senior and graduate courses. Although the content of courses has changed as society has changed and knowledge has developed, the College faculty has always sought to provide students with specialized knowledge in a major field of study that is enriched by a broad liberal arts education. For over 190 years, the mission of the faculty has been to provide students with the knowledge, skills, and perspectives to help them develop an understanding of themselves and the world around them through a combination of specialized and general study. The present degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences relate these principles to the modern world. English Composition , Mathematical Modeling , Public Oral Communication , Intensive Writing and Foreign Language provide opportunities for students to develop communication and computational skills for use in their own society as well as for use in understanding other societies. Critical Approaches to the Arts and Sciences courses and the Breadth of Inquiry requirements are designed for students to acquire broad familiarity with the general areas of human knowledge by taking courses in the arts and humanities, social and historical studies, and natural and mathematical sciences. The Culture Studies requirement enables students to enrich their understanding of their neighbors at home and internationally. These courses serve as the foundation upon which students can develop a major program of study. Because of the richness and diversity of its more than 70 majors, the College offers students a variety of advising services to help them take full advantage of their opportunities at Indiana University. Academic assistant deans in the College can answer specific questions or talk with students about their goals. The College Undergraduate Recorder's Office is available throughout a student's career to answer questions about academic records, policies, and procedures\u2014by email (coasrecd@indiana.edu) , by phone (812-855-1821), or in person in Owen Hall 003. Academic advisors in each department in the College are eager to help students understand the special requirements and options of the department, and are also happy to discuss general degree requirements and the best options for theircompletion. Finally, counselors in Arts and Sciences Career Services in the Career Development Center help students understand how to combine their liberal arts education and their career goals in satisfying employment.

Admission Admission to IU Most incoming freshmen admitted to Indiana University first enter the University Division , where they must complete a specific set of requirements if they are interested in gaining admittance to the College of Arts and Sciences. Although the University Division provides advising services, students who are considering pursuing a degree from the College should also meet, early in their time at IU, with the advisor from any department(s) that offers a major, minor, or certificate that the student thinks he or she may want to pursue. Also, a small number of incoming students with records of academic excellence may be invited to apply for Direct Admission to the College. Entering the College Most incoming students admitted to Indiana University first enter the University Division . With the exception of those individuals who are admitted directly into the College (see Direct Admission), students who wish to enter into the College must: complete 26 credit hours of course work that can count toward a degree in the College; maintain a minimum cumulative College grade point average of 2.000; satisfy the English Composition Requirement. IU students at other schools on the Bloomington campus who wish to enter the College must fulfill the same entry requirements as University Division students. When students in the University Division have satisfied the College entry requirements, they will be certified to the College department that offers the major that they have chosen to pursue (and that is listed on their record). To declare or change a major, students in University Division should see their University Division advisor or go to the University Division Records Office , Maxwell Hall 030. Students are encouraged, early on in their time in University Division, to make an appointment with the advisor of any departments that offer majors that students think they may want to pursue. It is important to note that, even when they are still in University Division, students can begin to satisfy College degree requirements. Direct Admission The College of Arts and Sciences recognizes the achievements of a small number of outstanding incoming freshmen each year by extending to them invitations of direct admission. Most students who are admitted to Indiana University begin their studies in the University4Admission Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Division, where they must complete certain requirements before they can enter the College of Arts and Sciences. Direct admission enables invited students, who are chosen by the College's selection committee, to bypass the University Division and, instead, enter immediately into the College. Such students can declare a major at the start of their freshman year. Students interested in being considered for direct admission to the College should first apply for admission to IU Bloomington through the Office of Admissions . Students admitted to the Bloomington campus by the deadline (see website for exact date) who have indicated an intended major in the College of Arts and Sciences and who meet initial eligibility criteria are invited, via email and in the IU admission packet, to complete IU's Selective Scholarship Application (SSA). The SSA (including the required letters of recommendation) must be completed and returned by the date specified on the application for consideration for direct admission. Students admitted to IU Bloomington by the deadline who do not receive an invitation to complete the online SSA may petition for the opportunity to be considered for direct admission. Contact the College's Office of Enrollment Management for more details by sending an email to coasinfo@indiana.edu . More information about direct admission to the College of Arts and Sciences is available at www.indiana.edu/ ~college/ado/dap/direct.shtml . Transfer Students Transfers from Undergraduate Programs in Other Schools on the Bloomington Campus Students transferring to the College of Arts and Sciences from undergraduate programs in other schools of the university, such as the Kelley School of Business, the School of Education, or the Jacobs School of Music, must have completed at least 26 credit hours that can count toward a degree in the College with a minimum cumulative College grade point average of 2.000. They also must have completed the English Composition requirement. Engineering and technical courses cannot be applied as credit toward a degree program in the College of Arts and Sciences. Students must contact the advisor in the department in which they wish to become a major. The advisor will submit a School Change Request to the College Recorder's Office in Owen Hall for processing. Requests to change schools must be completed by July 1 for the fall semester, December 1 for the spring semester, and April 15 for the summer session. Transfers to and from Other Indiana University Campuses Students can transfer easily from one campus of Indiana University to another and continue their studies as degree candidates. Credits are evaluated on a course-by-course basis, but students generally find that most courses do transfer because of the similarity of course work on the eight campuses. Engineering and technical courses cannot be applied as credit toward a degree program in the College of Arts and Sciences. Transferring students should note that the degree requirements differ among the various campuses of Indiana University. Students who are eligible to transfer as degree candidates from one campus of Indiana University to another must meet thedegree requirements of the degree-granting division of the campus from which they expect to graduate. Transfers from Other Indiana University Campuses to the College Students transferring to the College of Arts and Sciences at Bloomington from other campuses of Indiana University must have completed at least 26 credit hours that can count toward a degree from the College, maintained a minimum cumulative College of Arts and Sciences grade point average of 2.000, and completed the English Composition Requirement.

See above (\"Transfers to and from Other Indiana University Campuses\") for additional requirements in effect. For detailed information about applying for intercampus transfers, see www.iupui.edu/~moveiu . Transfers from Other Colleges and Universities Indiana University welcomes students who wish to transfer from other colleges or universities. Students who have completed less than one full year of academic course work will be considered for admission into the University Division. Students who have completed at least 26 credit hours that can count toward a degree in the College, a year of course work at another institution, and the English Composition Requirement may be granted admission to the College of Arts and Sciences. Applications for transfer admission are evaluated on the basis of a number of factors, including the following: A minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.000 on a 4.000 scale. A higher GPA may be required for certain majors. In addition, nonresidents of Indiana will be expected to have a considerably higher GPA for consideration. A high school record showing satisfactory entrance units. Evidence of good standing in the institution last attended. Official transcripts of credits and grades earned in all subjects. Acceptance of credit from other institutions will be determined by the Office of Admissions. The applicability of credit toward degree requirements in the College will be determined by the Dean of the College. Only credits earned at Indiana University will count toward a student's cumulative grade point average. Courses from other colleges and universities transfer as credit only, with the exception of courses that transfer into a student's major; the grades associated with these courses are factored into the student's major grade point average. For additional information and application deadlines, please refer to the Office of Admissions website . Exploratory Students Students wishing to pursue baccalaureate degrees in the College who have not yet chosen majors and who have completed no more than 55 degree credit hours may enter the College as exploratory students.

Double or Triple Majors (B.A.) The College offers a double or triple major for the B.A. degree with the following requirements: 1.At least 27 distinct College of Arts and Sciences credit hours must be taken in each major. 2.The residence requirement of at least 18 credit hours in each major at Bloomington must be met. 3.Students must have two or three advisors, one from each department in which they propose to study. 4.The program of studies must be approved by the College of Arts and Sciences, Owen Hall. 5.With approval of the relevant major departments and the College, one course may be counted toward both majors of a double major or all three majors of a triple major program. Whether a student plans two majors or three majors, a total of only one course may be double-counted. Interdepartmental Majors (B.A.) Interdepartmental majors are available in some disciplines for students who are pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree and who wish to combine two disciplines or subjects into an interdepartmental concentration area. Such students are required to complete a minimum of 40 credit hours but cannot exceed 62 credit hours in the interdepartmental major. However, a maximum of 20 major credit hours taken in excess of 62 may be counted toward the 120 minimum credit hours required for the degree. In no case may the total of credit hours outside the College and excess major credit hours exceed 20 credit hours. Requirements for Minors Many departments in the College of Arts and Sciences offer minors of at least 15 College of Arts and Sciences credit hours. Students majoring in one department (e.g., English) may satisfy the requirements for a minor in a different department (e.g., Religious Studies). A student may complete up to three minors. Those minors that are listed in this Bulletin may appear on student transcripts. A few majors require that students also complete a minor. Students planning to complete a minor should consult the advisor in the department in which the minor is offered. In completing requirements for minors, students should be aware of the following College of Arts and Sciences policies and procedures: 1.A minor must consist of 15 or more credit hours in College of Arts and Sciences courses. 2.A minor must include at least 9 credit hours at the 300-400 level.Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Degree Requirements 11 3.The residence requirement of at least 9 credit hours in the minor at Bloomington must be met. 4.Certain departments and programs do not count 100-level language courses toward the requirements for their minors. Please see the entries under the section of this Bulletin titled \"Departments & Programs\" for information regarding specific minors. 5.Any course in which the student earns a grade below C- may not be used to fulfill a minor requirement. 6.The grade point average of all courses taken in fulfillment of minor requirements must be at least 2.000. 7.Some minors may have a higher overall grade point average requirement. 8.Courses taken to satisfy the Foundations requirement in English Composition may not be applied toward a minor requirement. 9.Some majors require that students also complete a minor. For information about specific minors, see departmental statements in this Bulletin. For minors outside the College of Arts and Sciences that can be listed on a College student's transcript, please see the section of this Bulletin entitled \"Opportunities Outside the College.\" Foundations Requirement English Composition The College's English Composition requirement can be satisfied by any course used for that purpose in the campuswide General Education Curriculum at Indiana University. Please see http://www.gened.iub.edu// requirements/engcomp.html and note the minimum grade needed. Students are exempted from the English Composition requirement if they meet the following standards: SAT (recentered) Verbal score of 670 or higher; or ACT English score of 32 or higher; or AP Program English: Composition and Literature score of 4 or 5; or AP Program English: Language and Composition score of 4 or 5. Students earning one of the above test scores AND a score of 660 or higher on the SAT II: Writing Test qualify for exemption from the English Composition requirement and become eligible to apply for 2 credit hours in English W143 with a grade of S (satisfactory). Please call (812) 855-1430 to request this special credit. Mathematical Modeling The College's Mathematical Modeling requirement can be satisfied by any course used for that purpose in the campuswide General Education Curriculum at Indiana University. Please see http://www.gened.iub.edu// requirements/math.html . Note that the same course can simultaneously count toward the campuswide General Education Curriculum's Mathematical Modeling requirement and the College's Breadth of Inquiry requirement in Natural and Mathematical Sciences ( CASE N&M).Public Oral Communication Requirement Candidates for all bachelor's degrees in the College of Arts and Sciences must complete the Public Oral Communication requirement. A course in Public Oral Communication prepares students in the liberal arts to communicate effectively with public audiences. The course emphasizes oral communication as practiced in public contexts: how to advance reasoned claims in public; how to adapt public oral presentations to particular audiences; how to listen to, interpret, and evaluate public discourse; and how to formulate a clear response. The ability to communicate effectively in a public setting is an essential component of a liberal arts education and an important skill needed in every discipline. Employers continually emphasize the need for students to have well- developed oral communication skills. Courses that fulfill this requirement are designated with CASE POC. COLL-P 155 Public Oral Communication (3 cr.) CASE POC Prepares students in the liberal arts to communicate effectively with public audiences. Emphasizes oral communication as practiced in public contexts: how to advance reasoned claims in public; how to adapt public oral presentations to particular audiences; how to listen to, interpret, and evaluate public discourse; and how to formulate a clear response. Credit given for only one of P155, CMCL-C 121, or CMCL-C 130. Intensive Writing Requirement The Intensive Writing (IW) requirement may be fulfilled by completing one Intensive Writing course at or above the 200 level after completing the English Composition requirement. Normally, Intensive Writing sections are taught by faculty in small sections and include written assignments in which students are asked to make, illustrate, and develop arguments. Graded revision of assignments is a requirement of all Intensive Writing courses. Students must check the listings for courses in the online Schedule of Classes each semester to make certain that the course section they have chosen fulfills the requirement. Intensive Writing credit will not be awarded for written work in courses that are not listed as Intensive Writing unless special arrangements have been completed and approved prior to the relevant deadline. All special arrangements are subject to the approval of the College. Students who wish to arrange an individual Intensive Writing component for a course or section that is not listed as Intensive Writing must obtain the approval of the faculty director of undergraduate studies of the department of their major concentration as well as that of the Office of Undergraduate Academic Affairs of the College of Arts and Sciences, Owen Hall. The deadline for submitting a Proposal to Satisfy Intensive Writing by Special Arrangement is the end of the second week of instruction for regular semester-length courses, the end of the first week of instruction for eight-week courses, and the end of the first week of instruction for a course taught in a summer session.12Degree Requirements Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 CASE Foreign Language Requirement Students pursuing the B.A. or B.F.A. degree in the College must establish proficiency in a single foreign language through the second semester of the second year of college-level course work. Students pursuing B.S. degrees should check the Foreign Language requirement for their particular degree program since the requirement varies according to the degree being pursued. Students are encouraged to include foreign language study in their first semester at Indiana University Bloomington (IUB). Completion of the CASE Foreign Language requirement can be demonstrated in four ways: 1.Completion of the final course in the sequence. 2.Testing out of the requirement by virtue of appropriate performance on certain types of exams, such as Advanced Placement (AP), SAT II, and/or International Baccalaureate (IB) exams. Check with the relevant department for additional information about which type of exam is accepted. 3.Appropriate official documentation that the student has proficiency via formal education in a language other than English. This documentation must be from an accredited international institution which is considered appropriate by both the relevant department and the College of Arts and Sciences. Such documentation generally indicates satisfactory completion of a secondary education in a language other than English\u2014i.e., a transcript. 4.Satisfactory completion of a proctored proficiency exam administered by the relevant department (NOT the placement exam), if such an exam is offered by that department. Completion of high school foreign language courses is not accepted as completion of the requirement. Please note that the CASE Foreign Language requirement differs from the campuswide General Education curriculum's World Languages and Cultures requirement. Fulfillment of the CASE Foreign Language requirement for B.A. and B.F.A. degrees will, in most cases, also fulfill the campuswide General Education's World Languages and Cultures requirement. For information about the latter, please see http:// gened.iub.edu/requirements/genedrequire.html . Placement Students who matriculate to Indiana University with prior knowledge of a foreign language must take the placement test in that language before registering for their first semester's classes to identify the appropriate foreign language course to take at IU Bloomington. For the following languages, this is done online: Chinese French German Hebrew Italian Japanese Latin Spanish For all other languages, please contact the relevant department for information on their placement tests. Proficiency The test used for placement is NOT the same exam used to establish proficiency in foreign language. Afew departments offer proficiency exams to students who wish to demonstrate that they do not need any additional foreign language enrollment/study to meet the IU General Education World Languages requirement and/ or the College's CASE Foreign Language requirement. Proficiency exams are not tied to special credit. Domestic students interested in establishing proficiency should contact the department offering the relevant language. International students who wish to use their native language (if their native language is not English) to establish foreign language proficiency should complete the Application for Establishment of Foreign Language Proficiency for Non-Native Speakers of English . Students interested in this option should complete the process as early in their undergraduate careers as possible. Special Credit Policy Degree-seeking students can earn a maximum of two semesters of special credit for foreign language and this special credit is limited to two semesters of second-year study (the third and fourth semesters). The number of credits varies according to the language. To earn special credit, students must take the placement test offered by the appropriate department at IUB, complete a validating course on the IUB campus at the level into which the student placed (or higher) with a grade of C or higher, and apply for the special credit to be posted retroactively. If a student earns a grade of C- or below in the validating course, s/he will not earn special credit. To be eligible to earn foreign language special credit, students must take a validating language course which must be their first IUB course in that language. A transfer course may not be used as a validating course. If a student drops the validating language course, s/he can re-enroll and be eligible for special credit provided that s/he earns a grade of C or higher in the course. Grades (A, B, C, etc.) are not given for special credit. Students with native language fluency (i.e., students who learned the target foreign language in ways other than formal schooling/ instruction) are not eligible to earn special credit in that language. Students can earn special credit in more than one language as long as they meet the other requirements listed above and below to earn special credit. Students who have taken the AP, SAT II, or the IB exam must check with the respective language department to find out departmental policy regarding which exam has precedence in terms of placement in language classes. Policies regarding AP, SAT II, and IB credit are unrelated to those for IU special credit, so AP, SAT II, and IB credit remain unaffected by the College's special credit policy. Special credit can be awarded for all third- and fourth- semester foreign language courses. The validating foreign language course: Must be taught at IUB; Can only be a fourth-semester language course or higher; Must be the student's first course in that language at IUB;Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Degree Requirements 13 May only be completed once in an effort to earn special credit; and Must be completed with a grade of C or higher. For those students interested in special credit, it is in their best interests to complete their validating course as soon as they begin their studies at IUB. Breadth of Inquiry Requirement Students pursuing a B.A. or B.F.A. in the College must complete 6 courses in CASE Breadth of Inquiry in addition to the Breadth of Inquiry courses that they must complete for campuswide General Education including two designated courses in the arts and humanities, two designated courses in social and historical studies, and two designated courses in natural and mathematical sciences. For information about Breadth of Inquiry requirements for the B.G.S. or B.S. degrees, please see the entry for the department or program that offers the degree in question. Specific courses that fulfill the College's Breadth of Inquiry requirement are designated by abbreviations following the course titles (CASE A&H, CASE S&H, or CASE N&M). For a complete list of courses that fulfill the Breadth of Inquiry requirement, please use the CASE Course Designations tool. Courses to be considered for CASE Breadth of Inquiry credit must be conducted as formal classes. A course can carry only one Breadth of Inquiry designation. Arts and Humanities (CASE A&H) Courses in this area help students think about the complexity of human experience, appreciate the range of human thought and emotion, learn about varieties of aesthetic expression, and grapple with moral issues. Such courses study written texts and works in literature, the visual arts, music, and the other performing arts, as well as philosophical and religious thought, and intellectual and cultural traditions. The approach may be comparative, historical, or analytical, but the emphasis is on developing students' interpretive and critical skills. Social and Historical Studies (CASE S&H) Courses in this area analyze social institutions, the behavior of individuals in social contexts and historical settings, and changes in social conditions over time. Such courses study the political, economic, and cultural institutions of society, from individuals in social interactions to the international system of nation-states and transnational organizations and actors as well as changes in the human condition over time, including the inception, development, and transformation of institutions and civilizations, ideas, genres, or forms of representation. Natural and Mathematical Sciences (CASE N&M) Courses in this area provide an appreciation of the physical and biological environment, introduce students to systematic investigation of that environment, show the value of experimental methods for understanding natural laws, and explore the role and methods of the mathematical sciences. Such courses study the natural sciences, introducing and emphasizing basic principles of the chemical, physical, and life sciences, and expand students' understanding of the physical world and scientific inquiry about it, as well as analytical reasoning, the mathematical sciences, and the thinking process and its representations. Courses may focus on forms ofreasoning or the nature and processes of cognition and computation. Culture Studies Requirement The purpose of the Culture Studies curriculum is to introduce students to cultural systems, to allow students to define what is commonly meant by the term \"culture,\" and to examine critically specific examples of culture. The curriculum also provides students with the opportunity to explore the relationship between cultural artifacts and the community that produced them and/or draw comparisons between different cultures. This exposure can lead students to understand the facts, possibilities, and limitations of their own cultural conditioning. Please note that the College's CASE Culture Studies requirement is different from the campuswide General Education curriculum's World Languages and Cultures requirement. Students in the College must fulfill the College's CASE Culture Studies requirement, the College's CASE Foreign Language requirement, and the campuswide General Education's World Languages and Cultures requirement. Fulfillment of the College's Foreign Language requirement for B.A. and B.F.A. degrees will, in most cases, also fulfill the campuswide General Education's World Languages and Cultures requirement. For information about the latter, please see http://gened.iub.edu/requirements/genedrequire.html . Students pursuing a B.A., B.F.A., or B.G.S. degree in the College must observe the following guidelines when fulfilling the Culture Studies requirement: 1.Students are required to complete two courses that carry CASE Culture Studies credit, one from \"Diversity in the U.S.\" and one from \"Global Civilizations and Cultures\" (for a list of designated courses, please use the CASE Course Designations tool). 2.Students who successfully complete a semester (or more) abroad in a program sponsored by the Indiana University Office of Overseas Study will satisfy the \"Global Civilizations and Cultures\" component of the CASE Culture Studies requirement. These students must still complete a course designated \"Diversity in the U.S.\" Critical Approaches to the Arts and Sciences Requirement Courses in Critical Approaches (CAPP) are intended to help first- and second-year students begin to develop an understanding of the fundamental questions asked and methods employed by the various departments and programs in the College. Rather than focusing on depth of coverage, CAPP courses introduce students to the different kinds of scholarship that take place in a university. Through these courses, students learn about the ways particular disciplines seek answers, solve problems, and organize ideas. Alternatively, these courses can demonstrate the merits of viewing a problem from an interdisciplinary or a multidisciplinary perspective. CAPP courses also teach students how to seek information from various sources, evaluate the validity of that information, and construct arguments. One of the main objectives of these courses is to instill sound research and writing practices that students will employ in their future undergraduate course work.14Degree Requirements Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Any student who is a candidate for a bachelor's degree offered by the College is required to complete one CAPP course on the Bloomington campus. This includes students who transfer from other IU Bloomington schools, from other IU campuses, and from other institutions. Students are encouraged to take this course in their first year; in any case, they should plan to take their CAPP course no later than the first semester of their second year. For a listing of all courses that can satisfy the CAPP requirement, please use the CASE Course Designations tool. For updates of CAPP courses, see the College website at http://college.indiana.edu/undergrad/ CriticalApproaches . CAPP courses can also be counted toward a College and campuswide General Education Breadth of Inquiry requirement.

Second Bachelor's Degree In certain cases the Dean may admit bachelor's degree holders to candidacy for a second bachelor's degree. When such admission is granted, the candidates must earn at least 26 additional College credit hours in residence and meet the requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences and of the department in which they are candidates. Students seeking second degree candidacy must observe the appropriate deadlines for applications (contact the College Recorder's Office , 855-1821 for information) and, if eligible, should schedule an appointment with the advisor in the Office of Undergraduate Academic Affairs , (812) 855-1647, Owen Hall. Some students will be required to submit an appropriate Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) score as part of the admission process. This requirement applies to international students who are from countries where English is not the language of instruction, who have not otherwise been admitted to the university in undergraduate status, and who are applying to the university for admission directly into a second undergraduate degree program in the College. Students with a bachelor's degree who wish to further their education should consider becoming qualified for admission to a graduate program. Students may also be admitted to candidacy for a concurrent second degree. In the case of simultaneous conferral of the first and second undergraduate degrees, 26 additional residency hours for the second degree are not required. Students currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in the College of Arts and Sciences should consult their academic advisor regarding the approval process.Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Academic Policies & Procedures 15 Courses Outside the College A candidate for a bachelor's degree in the College of Arts and Sciences, with the exception of the B.G.S. degree, must satisfactorily complete a minimum of 100 credit hours in courses offered by the College. Students may select the remaining 20 credit hours from courses in the College of Arts and Sciences and/or from courses outside the College. [Please note that certain specific courses from both the Jacobs School of Music as well as the School of Informatics and Computing in Computer Science that are listed as being approved for CASE Designations may be counted among the 100 credit hours inside the College of Arts and Sciences.] Students satisfying requirements for a teaching certificate may take a maximum of 29 credit hours outside of the College if the courses selected are required for teaching certification. Students planning teacher certification may need to complete more than 120 credit hours and should confer with their major advisor and with an advisor from the School of Education early in their academic careers. Students should also consult the School of Education Undergraduate Academic Bulletin. The College does not accept certain types of credit, including engineering, technical, or self-acquired competency credits. Policies & Procedures Academic Policies & Procedures Petitioning the College of Arts and Sciences Exceptions to College policies may be granted only in rare instances upon written petition to the College of Arts and Sciences. Absences from Final Examinations A student who fails to attend the final examination of a course and who has a passing grade up to that time may be given a grade of I (Incomplete) if the instructor has reason to believe the absence was beyond the student's control. If not, a grade of F must be recorded. [For additional information regarding Incompletes, please see the section of this Bulletin entitled \"Grade of Incomplete,\" which can be found under \"Academic Policies & Procedures.\"] The Committee on Absence of the Division of Student Affairs reviews excuses concerning absences from final examinations and informs instructors of its decisions. Students scheduled for more than three examinations in one day may have their examination schedule adjusted if they notify the instructor or department of the course scheduled for the fourth (and additional) final examination of the day. It is the student's responsibility to be aware of the date and time of the final examination for each of his or her classes before officially enrolling. See the (Office of the Registrar) each semester for further information. Absences from Scheduled Classes Illness is usually the only acceptable excuse for absence from class. All absences must be explained to the satisfaction of the instructor, who will decide whether omitted work may be made up. The names of studentswho are absent excessively are to be reported by their instructor to the Dean of Students. Addition of Courses No course may be added by an undergraduate student after the first week of a semester or summer session without the approval of the instructor of the course, the chair of the department in which the course is offered, and the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. Applying for Graduation An application for graduation with a degree must be submitted to the College Recorder's Office in Owen Hall 003 months ahead of the desired graduation date. Applications can be submitted online from the Recorder's Office website, college/recorder/appinfo.shtml . This should be done no later than June 1 for subsequent May graduation, no later than December 1 for subsequent August graduation, and no later than March 1 for subsequent December graduation. Failure to file by these deadlines may delay graduation. Candidates for degrees must have all credit on record at least six weeks before the conferral of degrees, except that of the current semester. Credit for current semester enrollment in Indiana University or non- Indiana University programs must be posted on the student's Indiana University transcript by the last day of the semester in which the student wishes to graduate. Students enrolled in non-Indiana University programs should make arrangements to have their transcripts sent to the Indiana University Office of Admissions on the Bloomington campus as soon as possible once final grades are posted. Students enrolled in programs where grades will be reported after the end of the Indiana University Bloomington semester should apply for the next appropriate graduation date. Please consult with the College Recorder's Office (Owen Hall 003, coasrecd@indiana.edu or 812-855-1821), for further information. Change of Major To change their major, students must contact the advisor in the department in which they wish to become a major. The advisor will submit a Major or School Change Request to the College Recorder's Office for processing. Class Standing Class standing is based on the number of credit hours completed toward graduation: Freshman, fewer than 26 credits Sophomore, 26 to 55 credits Junior, 56 to 85 credits Senior, 86 or more credits Credit by Examination Students may receive credit for certain courses by successful performance on the SAT, SAT II Subject Tests, College Board Advanced Placement Tests, International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level (HL) exams, and, with permission of the Dean, examinations offered by academic departments while at Indiana University. The appropriate department of the College reviews the placement tests in order to make recommendations about advanced standing. Students who believe that they are prepared for advanced study or that they are eligible for16Academic Policies & Procedures Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 special credit because of superior preparation are urged to accelerate their college programs by taking the requisite exams. Students may thus graduate early, or they may use the time gained to take higher-level courses. Credit will be recorded simply with the grade of S (Satisfactory) unless the examination clearly merits an A grade and the department requests the use of a grade other than S. Failure to pass the examination carries no penalty. Fees for special credit/credit by examination are waived for undergraduate students enrolled in an IU degree- seeking program for at least 12 credit hours in either the fall or spring semester. Regular credit-hour rates apply for graduate students and undergraduate students enrolled in fewer than 12 credit hours. For a discussion of credit offered for foreign language exams, please see the section of this Bulletin entitled \"Foreign Language Requirement.\" Credit for Correspondence Courses Courses taken by correspondence may not be applied to any degree requirement of a bachelor's degree without prior special permission of the Dean. Extended X Indiana University allows students to retake up to 3 IU courses (or total of 10 hours) and replace the grades earned in the first enrollment with the grades earned in the second enrollment, with some significant restrictions. Students wishing to pursue this option should read the full text of the policy at registrar.indiana.edu/extendedx.shtml on the Registrar's Web site. Additionally, College of Arts and Sciences students should contact their academic advisor(s) and the College Recorder's Office, Owen Hall 003, (812) 855-1821. Important Note: The College does not acknowledge this policy for internal GPA purposes. All grades in completed course work, even if an \"X\" is on record, are calculated into the College of Arts and Sciences cumulative GPA. Since this policy does not affect the College's GPA (that is, the College still includes the grade earned in the first enrollment in the College GPA), class rank, major GPA, and the academic standing of College of Arts and Sciences students remain unaffected by any \"X\" grade. This policy does not apply to the B.G.S. Grade Appeals and Retroactive Changes Appeals of grades should be resolved with the instructor who recorded the disputed grade. If the student and instructor cannot resolve the matter, the student should discuss it further with the chair of the department offering the course. Appeals unresolved at the department level may be referred to the academic assistant deans. Appeals of grades or requests for other actions after the conclusion of a course should be made as soon as possible. Such requests will not be considered after one calendar year from the end of the semester in which the course in question was taken. Note that grades of I (Incomplete) or W (Withdrawal) may not be recorded for a course when a student has taken the final exam, or completed the final paper or project for the course.Grade of Incomplete A grade of I (Incomplete) may be given only when the work of the course is substantially completed and when the student's work is of passing quality. A grade of I may not be given when a student has taken the final exam or completed the final paper or project for the course. When an I is assigned, a record must be maintained in the office of the department in which the grade was given. The record will include a statement of the reason for recording the I and an adequate guide for its removal and a suggested final grade in case the instructor should leave campus for an extended time. The time allowed for the removal of an I may not exceed one calendar year from the date of its recording, although the dean of the student's college or school may authorize adjustment of this period in exceptional circumstances. To complete a course in which a student received a grade of I, the student should consult with the instructor. The student should not reenroll in the course. By assigning an I, an instructor implicitly authorizes and requires the I to be changed to an F at the end of one calendar year if that instructor does not act to remove the I. The registrar will automatically change the I to an F at the end of this time period. Both the student and the instructor in whose course the student received the I will be notified of this change of grade. These regulations do not apply to Research and Readings courses in which completion of the work of the course is not necessarily required at the end of the semester and the grade R (Deferred) is given. Once a student has graduated, nothing in these regulations shall prohibit the I from remaining on the record. Grading System Grades are awarded on the following basis: A 4.000 Excellent A- F 0.000 Unsatisfactory Graduate-Level Course Work Under normal circumstances undergraduate students should not be enrolled in graduate-level courses. If, however, the instructor, the department and the student agree that the course is appropriate given the student's academic goals and interests and that s/he is qualified to take the course, the student may enroll. The student must accept full responsibility for fulfilling the course requirements and for the grade earned. Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Academic Standing 17 Even if the student has successfully completed a graduate-level course, it will satisfy degree requirements for a bachelor's degree only by special permission of the Dean. Approval for graduate-level courses to be applied toward the requirements for a bachelor's degree is not guaranteed, but rather is granted on a case-by-case basis. To request such approval, the following procedure should be followed: 1.The student obtains permission from the instructor of the course and the department to enroll in the graduate-level course; 2.The student asks his/her academic advisor to submit an exception in the College database; 3.The Dean reviews the exception request and notifies the academic advisor of the decision; 4.The academic advisor notifies the student of the decision. In those cases in which undergraduates are permitted to count graduate-level course work toward a bachelor's degree, no more than 12 credit hours will be counted. Graduate courses taken while an undergraduate and counted toward the requirements of a bachelor's degree may not count toward a graduate degree at Indiana University (and may also not count toward graduate degrees at other universities). Graduation Dates Degrees are conferred in December, May, and August; Commencement ceremonies are held in May and December. Candidates for degrees in August may participate in the May Commencement. Junior College Credits No more than 60 credit hours earned in accredited junior colleges may be applied toward a degree. Pass/Fail Option During their undergraduate program, students in good standing (not on probation) may enroll in a maximum of eight elective courses to be taken with a grade of P (Pass) or F (Fail). The Pass/Fail option is available for a maximum of two courses per academic year, including summer sessions. For the Pass/Fail option, the academic year is defined as beginning with the start of the fall semester and ending with the end of the second summer session. The course selected for Pass/Fail must be an elective (i.e., it cannot fulfill requirements other than the minimum 120 hours required for the degree, but it can be used to meet the requirement for courses at the 300-400 level). It may not be used to satisfy any of the College of Arts and Sciences Foundations, Intensive Writing, Foreign Language, Breadth of Inquiry, Culture Studies, Public Oral Communication, or Critical Approaches to the Arts and Sciences requirements. Nor may it be counted as a part of the student's concentration area, minor, or certificate program. During the freshman year, students may elect to take activity courses in the School of Public Health on a Pass/Fail basis in addition to the two other permitted courses. Students who wish to use the Pass/Fail option must submit the appropriate form to the College Recorder's Office by the relevant deadline. See the Enrollment and Student Academic Information Bulletin (Office of theRegistrar) for deadline dates, including deadlines for eight- week sessions. A grade of P is not counted in computing grade point averages; a grade of F is counted. A grade of P cannot be changed subsequently to any other letter grade. Status Update Form As do students from all other units of the university, College of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who have been away from the university for two sequential regular semesters must fill out a brief informational form regarding their activities while away from the university system. For information regarding the Status Update Form , please contact the College Recorder's Office, Owen Hall 003, (812) 855-1821, coasrecd@indiana.edu . Transcripts Complete information on transcripts can be found in the Enrollment and Student Academic Information Bulletin . Requests for transcripts must be made in person or in writing to the Office of the Registrar, 408 N. Union Street, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405, or via email to registrar@indiana.edu . Withdrawals from Courses The College permits withdrawal from courses with the automatic grade of W (Withdrawal) until the end of the eighth week of classes during the regular academic year, until the end of the fourth week of classes for eight-week courses, and until the end of the first two weeks of classes during a summer session. See the for deadline dates for a particular semester. Petitions for late withdrawal after the periods specified above will not be authorized by the Dean except for urgent reasons beyond the student's control related to extended illness or equivalent distress. The desire to avoid a low grade is not an acceptable reason for withdrawal from a course. If students withdraw with the Dean's consent, their grade in the course shall be W if they are passing at the time of withdrawal and F if they are not passing. As with all grades, instructors will assign the appropriate grade. The grade will be recorded on the date of withdrawal. Failure to complete a course without authorized withdrawal will result in a grade of F. The grade of W may not be recorded for a course when a student has taken the final exam, or completed the final paper or project for the course. Academic Standing Academic Probation Students are on academic probation when their cumulative grade point average is below 2.000 (C). They are also on probation for the duration of the regular semester following one in which they failed to attain at least a 2.000 (C) grade point average. Students on academic probation must comply with any restrictions the Dean of the College deems necessary. Candidates for Bachelor's Degrees in Good Standing Students are considered to be candidates in good standing for an Indiana University bachelor's degree when they have been regularly admitted by the Office of18Academic Standing Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Admissions, when their academic grade point average is not less than a 2.000 (C) for the last semester's work, and when their cumulative grade point average is at least 2.000 (C). Dismissal Students are dismissed from the College of Arts and Sciences when, in the judgment of the Academic Retention Committee, they have ceased to make adequate progress toward their degree. Students who fail to attain a minimum grade point average of 2.000 (C) in any two semesters and who have a cumulative grade point average below 2.000 (C) are dismissed automatically. (Note that these students will have been placed on probation at least once before dismissal.) Whether or not students have been placed on probation before, the Academic Retention Committee may dismiss students if their record reveals any of the following: failing or near-failing performance in any semester; failure to make adequate progress toward completion of major requirements; failure to make any progress toward completion of degree requirements in any semester; a cumulative grade point average below 2.000 (C). Readmission The Academic Retention Committee considers petitions for readmission from students who have been dismissed. A student dismissed for the first time must petition to continue as a student in the College. A student dismissed for the second time may not be admitted for the next regular semester but is eligible to submit a petition for readmission after a period of at least one regular semester. Third dismissals are generally considered final. Students should contact the College Recorder's Office (Owen Hall) for further information concerning eligibility to petition. In order for petitions for readmission to be considered and accepted by the committee, students eligible to submit them must do so before June 20 for the fall semester and before October 1 for the spring semester. Restart Policy Students who have been away from Indiana University for at least five years and who earned grades that make it impossible or very difficult to return to a College of Arts and Sciences degree program may petition for a \"restart.\" Under a restart, the College of Arts and Sciences will establish a new degree record for the student that will consist of courses previously taken that were completed with a minimum grade of C. Note that all Indiana University course work will remain on the student's permanent record (the university transcript); this policy will affect only the student's College of Arts and Sciences record. Students will be eligible for consideration for this policy once a minimum of five years have passed since full-time or continuous part-time enrollment. Students will need to provide evidence that indicates a significant change in their ability to succeed in academic work. Reevaluation of fundamental skills may be necessary before the student can proceed. Students should petition for a restart as part of the readmission process. For information aboutdeadlines for submitting readmission petitions, please see the section of this Bulletin entitled \"Readmission.\" Students should contact the Office of Undergraduate Academic Affairs , Owen Hall, to begin the petition process and to discuss the details of this policy. Petitioning the College of Arts and Sciences Exceptions to College policies may be granted only in rare instances upon written petition to the College of Arts and Sciences. Student Records Confidentiality of Records Indiana University, in compliance with the campus-wide General Education Provisions Act, Section 438, titled Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, provides that all student records are confidential. Confidential academic information is released by the College of Arts and Sciences only to the student, and to person(s) whom the student authorizes in writing to be appropriate recipients of the information.

African American & African Diaspora Studies Introduction The Department of African American and African Diaspora Studies (AAAD) introduces students to a wide range of current research and scholarly opinion on the history, culture, and social status of black Americans and their African heritage. As an intellectual enterprise, the department provides an eclectic analysis of the African American and African Diasporic experience. As a humanistic discipline in the democratic tradition, African American and African Diaspora Studies seeks to dispel the myths and expose those attitudes that perpetuate racism in American life. Students enrolled in any department or school may elect any course or sequence of courses in African American and African Diaspora Studies for which they are eligible. Many of the courses in the department may be used to satisfy Breadth of Inquiry or Culture Studies requirements. A few courses may be used to fulfill the Intensive Writing requirement. The Department of African American and African Diaspora Studies is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing Indiana University undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century. Degree programs associated with SGIS emphasize language proficiency, cultural competency, and in-depth training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies. SGIS students will enjoy unparalleled access to a stellar faculty and career-focused advising.

Students planning to enter the workforce immediately after graduation may wish to select a double major. African American and African Diaspora Studies graduates enjoy careers in medicine, theatre and drama, the music industry, local and state governments, education, law enforcement, the criminal justice system, private industries, information science, employment with non-profits, humanist agencies, health care, the legal profession, banking and technology industries, and others. Requirements Students must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of undergraduate course work selected from the department's three concentration areas (see Courses list): 1.Arts 2.Literature 3.History, Culture, and Social Issues No more than 6 credit hours at the 100 level and no more than 6 credit hours at the 200 level can be counted toward the major. At the time of admission to the department, each student and the undergraduate advisor together plan an individualized program of study, including the selection of a major concentration area. Majors must complete the following: 1.A150. 2.A355 or A356 (history). 3.A379 or A380 (literature). 4.A493 Senior Seminar in African American Studies. 5.An additional 18 credit hours in AAAD electives are required to complete the major. A minimum of 9 of the 18 credit hours must be at the 300 or 400 level. 9 credit hours taken in one African American and African Diaspora Studies concentration area. A355, A356, A379, and A380 will count in the major but will not count in the concentration areas. 3 credit hours in each of the other two concentration areas for a total of 6 credit hours. Note: Credit hours in the major cannot be double counted. Students must also complete the degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. Recommendations During the freshman and sophomore years, students should take African American and African Diaspora Studies courses at the 100 and 200 level that satisfy general education requirements. During the senior year, however, majors are strongly encouraged to enroll in the department's suggested electives (A400, A486, A493, and A495) to help them more clearly define theirlast year, which AAADS is calling the fourth year senior experience. These 400 level courses are suggested in order to create space within the curriculum to provide majors with additional understandings concerning how they can use their degree in AAADS to secure career opportunities and/or continue their studies at the graduate and/or professional level. The AAADS academic advisor will work closely with students to ensure that all required courses for the major are completed during the first three years, thereby making it possible for majors to utilize the fourth year for specific learning contexts. Students who plan to have a double major should make this decision as early as possible so that course selections in African American and African Diaspora Studies and the second major can be closely coordinated. Majors in journalism, telecommunications, business, public and environmental affairs, pre-law, social work, education, and many other disciplines have found African American and African Diaspora Studies courses to be useful, interesting, and important to their chosen fields.

CASE S&H, CASE GCC African Studies Introduction The African Studies Program (AFRI) provides unique opportunities for students on the Indiana University Bloomington campus to study with distinguished faculty members, meet with visiting Africanists from all over the world, learn African languages, and use the outstanding facilities of the Wells Library, the Archives of Traditional Music, and the Art Museum. The program has both regional and subject-area concentrations in which faculty conduct research and offer courses. Regularly offered language courses include Akan, Arabic, Bamana, Swahili, Wolof, and Zulu. Tutorial sections in other African languages may be provided if funding is available. Undergraduate students can earn a Certificate in African Studies by completing a flexible course of study designed to fit their individual interests and needs. A certificate is more rigorous than a minor, showing potential employers and graduate schools that students have completed a comprehensive course of study in an important world region. It is intended to give undergraduates both a broad, interdisciplinary understanding of the African continent (as does the minor), but it also requires that students gain a more in-depth knowledge of Africa as it relates to at least one discipline and one of its languages. Four semesters of an African language such as Akan/Twi, Arabic, Bamana, Swahili, Wolof, or Zulu are required. A Certificate in African Studies also complements a major in many departments and professional schools throughout the university. The African Studies Minor is intended to give undergraduates an opportunity to gain a broad, interdisciplinary understanding of the African continent. As an interdisciplinary minor, it complements a variety of majors. The African Studies Minor provides students with a cross-disciplinary understanding of the African continent by helping them gain a basic understanding of African history, achieve a familiarity with African cultures and societies, contextualize and analyze current African issues, and acquire at least an elementary knowledge of a language spoken on the African continent (not including English). The minor is sufficiently flexible to complement any departmental major. Recognition that a student has earned a certificate or a minor appears on the transcript along with the student's major department. The certificate or minor is awarded upon graduation from Indiana University. The African Studies Program is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing IndianaUniversity undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century. Degree programs associated with SGIS emphasize language proficiency, cultural competency, and in-depth training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies. SGIS students will enjoy unparalleled access to a stellar faculty and career-focused advising.

Animal Behavior Introduction The Program in Animal Behavior (ABEH) encourages students to explore the many different ways in which scientists aim to understand the physiological, environmental, and evolutionary factors influencing and constraining animal behavior. The undergraduate minor emphasizes courses needed to develop a background in the different disciplines that study animal behavior, providing students with the language they need to transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries and to reflect on the consequences of different intellectual approaches to a single problem. To complete the minor, students take courses in evolutionary biology, neuroscience, learning, and more. They also have the opportunity to engage in their own independent research and to conduct applied internships in which they apply their newly learned knowledge to practical problems in zoos, museums, and veterinary contexts.

Anthropology Introduction Anthropology is the interpretive, scientific, and comparative study of humankind. The Department of Anthropology (ANTH) offers courses in the history of the discipline, museum studies, general anthropology, and the four subfields: anthropological linguistics, archaeology, bioanthropology, and social/cultural anthropology. Anthropological linguistics concentrates on human communication through language: the structure of languages, the history of their development and interrelationship, and the social contexts for language use. Archaeology explores the material remains of cultures in the recent and distant past, seeking to understand how people once lived. Bioanthropology emphasizes primate origins, evolution, and present-day biological/ genetic variation and adaptation of human populations. Social/cultural anthropology studies contemporary and historical cultures and societies of every scale worldwide. Anthropology courses are organized by both geographical areas and interpretive themes.

Apparel Merchandising and Interior Design Introduction The Department of Apparel Merchandising and Interior Design (AMID) consists of programs that examine consumer-oriented and aesthetic components of the near environment. AMID offers three degree objectives: Apparel Merchandising B.S., Interior Design B.S., andTuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Apparel Merchandising and Interior Design 51 Fashion Design B.A. These programs integrate knowledge from the arts and the physical, social, and business sciences with behavioral and technical studies in textiles, apparel, furniture, and interior design. In the apparel merchandising program, students are exposed to every aspect of the retail cycle, allowing them to develop their creative and analytical skills into a progressive retail perspective. The interior design program is a CIDA (Council for Interior Design Accreditation) accredited program that addresses the multidisciplinary design process used in the creation of interior space. The fashion design program explores the art, process, and product of fashion design within a cultural context. The IU Center for Art + Design (IUCA+D) is a new addition to the Department of Apparel Merchandising and Interior Design. A unique collaborative initiative of Indiana University and the Columbus, Indiana community, IUCA+D was created to develop and promote the comprehensive integration of art and design. Our mission is to relocate art and design from the periphery of human experience to its center. In this educational model, we teach people to work at the intersection of multiple forms of design practice and to bring design and design thinking to institutions and businesses within the city. The Department of Apparel Merchandising and Interior Design is home to The Elizabeth Sage Historic Costume Collection, which consists of more than 24,000 objects of women's, men's, and children's clothing, dating from the late eighteenth century to the present day. The Sage Collection is used in the study of the history and preservation of costume and textiles.

Asian American Studies Introduction The program in Asian American Studies (AAST) introduces students to the history, culture, arts, and life experiences of people of Asian descent in the United States, and in other parts of the world. The term Asian American applies to groups from diverse cultural heritages within the United States, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Asian Indian, Pakistani, Vietnamese, Hmong, Cambodian, Burmese, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander. In attending to these populations, the undergraduate minor aims to foster awareness of Asian American experiences and contributions as part of the multicultural and multiracial history and ongoing development of the American experience, and to locate this experience in a larger global context. Its faculty members undertake a wide range of research and scholarship on issues such as Asian immigration, community development, labor market status, physical and mental health, gender and sexual politics, ethnic and diasporic identities, cultural representations, civil rights, and citizenship. Courses in Asian American Studies provide students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of these issues from an interdisciplinary perspective that includes history, sociology, literature, ethnography and media studies, political science, applied health science, and counseling psychology. Students in Asian American Studies not only learn the traditional skills in critical analysis and research, but also develop domestic and global perspectives as effective and responsible agents in a rapidly changing twenty-first century world.

Secondary Education In an effort to address the shortage of Indiana high school teachers in certain subjects, the College, in conjunction with the IU School of Education, offers an accelerated five-year program in which students can obtain a B.S. in Biology and an M.S. in Secondary Education and also complete all requirements for State licensure in Secondary Education. Under this program, students complete all of the course work required for the B.S. in Biology major by their eighth semester at IU. Beginning in their eighth semester and then continuing in the summer after their fourth year and in a fifth year of study, students complete all of the requirements for the M.S. in Secondary Education with licensure. Students must apply and earn admittance to the School of Education's Secondary Transition to Teaching and the Master of Science in Education programs during the fall semester of their senior year. After they have completed a minimum of 90 credit hours in the College of Arts and Sciences and satisfied the Foundations, Intensive Writing, Foreign Language, Breadth of Inquiry, and major concentration requirements for the B.S. in Biology, students may apply up to 30 credit hours earned in the School of Education as College electives. The requirements for the B.S. in Biology must be completed before student teaching begins in the final spring semester of the five-year program. The two degrees (B.S. in Biology and M.S. in Secondary Education) are awarded simultaneously. Students considering this degree should seek advising from both the Department of Biology and the School of Education. Also, students are advised to check on the effect that the transition to graduate status may have on existing undergraduate funding.

B.S. Chemistry/M.S. Secondary Education In an effort to address the shortage of Indiana high school teachers in certain subjects, the College, in conjunction with the IU School of Education, offers an accelerated five-year program in which students can obtain a B.S. in Chemistry and an M.S. in Secondary Education and also complete all requirements for State licensure in Secondary Education. Under this program, students complete all of the course work required for this B.S. Chemistry major by their eighth semester at IU. Continuing in the summer after their fourth year and then in a fifth year of study, students complete all of the requirements for the M.S. in Secondary Education with licensure. Students must apply and earn admittance to the School of Education's Secondary Transition to Teaching and the Master of Science in Education programs during the fall semester of their senior year. After they have completed a minimum of 90 credit hours in the College of Arts and Sciences and satisfied the Foundations, Intensive Writing, Foreign Language, Breadth of Inquiry, and major concentration requirements for this B.S. Chemistry, students may apply up to 30 credit hours earned in the School of Education as College electives. The requirements for the B.S. Chemistry must be completed before student teaching begins in the final spring semester of the five-year program. The two degrees (B.S. in Chemistry and M.S. in Secondary Education) are awarded simultaneously. Students considering this program should seek advising from both the Department of Chemistry and the School of Education. Also, students are advised to check on the effect that the transition to graduate status may have on existing undergraduate funding.

At its core, the program focuses on formal theories of mind and information. The field is inherently interdisciplinary, with contributions from computer science, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, biology, anthropology, and other fields. Both natural intelligence (in humans and in animals) and artificial intelligence fall within the scope of inquiry. The field deals with aspects of complex cognition, computational models of thought processing, knowledge representation, dynamics of real-world engagement, and emergent behavior of large-scale interacting systems. Goals of the Cognitive Science Program include a better understanding of mind, learning and teaching, cognitive skills, and the development of intelligent systems designed to augment human capacities in constructive ways. The Cognitive Science Program is structured to give students fundamental skills, applicable in a wide variety of information-related careers: psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, telecommunications, information processing, medical analysis, data representation and information retrieval, education, scientific research, human-computer interaction, multimedia, knowledge management, and information policy. The skills also have wide applicability in technical and expository writing, mathematical analysis, experimental techniques, and computer programming. Students interested in a cognitive science degree are encouraged to take advantage of services and opportunities that complement their academic study: advising, colloquium series, internships, research, the Student Organization for Cognitive Science (SOCS), and a free technical report series.

Communication and Culture Introduction The Department of Communication and Culture (CMCL) advances the study of communication as a cultural practice and teaches an array of perspectives that enable students to prepare broadly for a variety of careers. Requirements for the major and minor are flexible in order to promote individualized programs of study in three interrelated aspects of communication: rhetoric and public culture, film and media, and performance and ethnographic studies. Rhetorical studies orient students to the strategic dimension of human communication associated with deliberation, advocacy, and persuasion in a variety of social, political, and professional settings. Studies of media focus primarily on film and television, with additional emphasis on topics such as radio, recorded music, and interactive digital technologies. Performance and ethnographic studies explore an array of communicative practices, from the conversations and disputes of everyday life to artful performances at cultural events,Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Communication and Culture 105 which are the competencies essential for participation in social life. Students in the department make use of these approaches to the study of communication to examine links among social, corporate, and governmental organizations; to study the formation of individual and group identity in contemporary culture; to explore the connections between ideology and politics; and to bring intercultural and transnational considerations into focus by examining how diversity and differences of various kinds are negotiated across boundaries. Students prepare to become productive citizens of a democratic culture while gaining a thorough understanding of the theory, history, production, and critique of public communication.

CASE S&H, CASE DUS East Asian Languages and Cultures Introduction The Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALC) is a multidisciplinary and multicultural department that aims to provide students with an enhanced understanding of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages and cultures. The department offers a wide range of culture courses, open to nonmajors, that deal with virtually every facet of the cultures of East Asia. Language courses in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are offered from beginning to advanced levels. Two majors and two minors are offered. The majors differ in the amount of language required and in the specificity and range of culture courses allowed. There is a language minor in Japanese, Chinese, or Korean, and a minor in East Asian studies that requires no language training. As part of the baccalaureate training, students are encouraged to study abroad in China, Japan, or Korea on one of IU's overseas study programs. Students who are returning from East Asia or who have any background in an East Asian language prior to enrolling at IU are required to take a placement exam before enrolling in a language course. The Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing Indiana University undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century. Degree programs associated with SGIS emphasize language proficiency, cultural competency, and in-depth training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies. SGIS students will enjoy unparalleled access to a stellar faculty and career-focused advising.

It has been designed as a flexible program for students who want basic language training as well as the opportunity to study a variety of topics and approaches to the culture and history of East Asian countries. This major is suitable for students pursuing careers in business, international relations, cultural exchanges, and other occupations with a focus on East Asia. Required Courses A minimum of 30 credit hours in department-approved courses, at least 18 of which must be at or above the 300 level, including: 1.Second-year, second-semester proficiency in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (i.e., through the 202 level). First-year language courses (i.e., C101- C102, J101-J102, J110, K101-K102) are not credited toward the total number of hours in the major. 2.At least six culture courses (18 credit hours) one of which must be E310. Culture courses at the 100 level are not credited toward hours in the major. Culture courses must include at least two culture areas (China, Japan, Korea), selected from the subject area course list. For a list of culture courses, please see the section of this Bulletin entitled \"East Asian Culture Courses by Subject Area.\" Students must complete the degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. Students should also read Placement/Proficiency Examinations in this departmental section. Major in Language and Culture Purpose The major in language and culture emphasizes language training in one of the East Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, or Korean). The Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Concentrations each require language study through the third-year level. In addition, there is also a fourth option called the Accelerated Chinese Concentration, which requires advanced Chinese language study beyond the fourth-year level and participation in the Chinese Flagship program. In addition to language study, Language and Culture majors take courses on the society's culture, including in-depth study in one of two subject areas, according to the student's primary interest: \"History, Literature and Culture\"; or \"Politics, Social Science and Business.\" This major is intended for students who wish to develop a solid foundation of language skills and knowledge in one of the three culture areas or to prepare for graduate studies.Requirements A minimum of 30 credit hours in department-approved courses with at least 18 credit hours at the 300-400 level, including: 1.Third year, second-semester proficiency in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (i.e., through the 302 level). First-year language courses (C101-C102, J101- J102, J110, K101-K102) are not credited toward the total number of hours in the major. 2.At least five culture courses (15 credit hours), one of which must be E310. Culture courses at the 100 level are not credited toward hours in the major. Three culture courses must be at the 300-400 level, selected from the same subject area (either History, Literature and Culture or Politics, Social Science, and Business). Though it does not count toward the subject area requirement, one fourth-year language course may be counted as a required culture course. For courses by subject area, please see the section of this Bulletin titled \"East Asian Culture Courses by Subject Area.\" For the Accelerated Chinese Concentration, a minimum of 36 credit hours in department-approved courses, at least 18 of which must be at the 300-400 level, including: 1.Fourth-year, second-semester proficiency in Chinese (i.e., through the 402 level) and two semesters of C457 and/or C467. and third-year language courses (C101-C102, and C301-C302) are not credited toward the total number of hours in the major. 2.At least seven culture courses (20 credits), including the following required courses: E310, two 300- level EALC culture courses associated with C457 and/or C467, and another EALC culture course; and participation in the capstone program in China is required. Culture courses at the 100 level are not credited toward hours in the major. Capstone enrollments include three additional culture courses (at least 8 credits). Students pursuing the Accelerated Chinese Concentration need not select a subject area concentration within the culture courses. 3.One semester of ASCS-W 499 (internship during capstone year in China (0 cr.) Note that the Accelerated Chinese Concentration requires summer and overseas study. Because students are expected to have completed the equivalent of four years of language preparation by the end of their second college year, students with no prior background in Chinese who elect this concentration will be expected to take Chinese language courses during the summers after their freshman and sophomore years. Students with no prior background who enter the program after the freshman year should anticipate similar course work during the summer and a total of more than four years to graduate. Students must complete the degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. Students should also read Placement/Proficiency Examinations in this departmental section.124East Asian Languages and Cultures Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Double Major Purpose Each of the majors described above may be pursued in combination with a major in another department. Students whose broader interests include preparation for such careers as business, law, or telecommunications, and who desire some background in East Asian cultures, may consider a program leading to the double major degree given by the College of Arts and Sciences. Required Courses Course requirements are the same for the double major as for the single major leading to the standard B.A. degree. A double major within the department is not permitted. Minor in East Asian Languages Required Courses Students may minor in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean language. A minimum of 15 credit hours in the chosen language is required, at least 9 of which must be at the 300-400 level.

CASE A&H, CASE GCC Economics Introduction Economics is the study of how individuals and societies manage their scarce resources\u2014 people must decide how much they work, what they buy, how much they save, and how they use their leisure time. Most societies use decentralized markets as the primary means of allocating resources, so economics gives students insight into how markets function in coordinating the activities of many diverse buyers and sellers. Economics also analyzes the trends and forces that affect the economy as a whole, including growth in average income, the portion of the labor force that cannot find work, and the rate at which prices are rising or falling. A major in economics provides excellent preparation for graduate and professional school, including law school, and for rewarding careers in consulting, finance, and other private and public sector employment. The Department of Economics offers course work in a variety of topics including microeconomic theory, macroeconomic theory, financial economics, money and banking, public finance, labor economics, international economics, economic development, game theory, and econometrics. Note: Throughout the listing of major requirements, minor requirements, and course prerequisites, any course may be replaced by the honors equivalent. All ECON and non- ECON courses listed as required for a major or minor (ECON, ECON/MATH, ECON/POLS) must be completed with a minimum grade of C-. Course prerequisites areTuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Economics 133 strictly enforced. Students interested in preparing for graduate study in economics should take M211 or M213, rather than M119, and consult with the department's undergraduate advisor regarding additional recommended mathematics courses.

Introduction The B.S. in Environmental Science (B.S.E.S.) is a joint degree program between the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. The interdisciplinary B.S.E.S. program considers the environment as a scientific entity. Students preparing for professional employment or graduate study in environmental science or in one of the traditional sciences should consider this degree. While it is possible to divide environmental science into numerous subdisciplines or systems such as the atmosphere, the biosphere, the hydrosphere, and the lithosphere, these subsystems are interdependent components of a single large system. It follows that the problems encountered in the environmental sciences are inherently interdisciplinary; hence, a scientist working in this field is required to possess both a breadth of knowledge and a specific set of skills and expertise. The overall organization of the B.S.E.S. degree program reflects this philosophy with a broad core curriculum.Opportunities area also available for research projects that provide advanced hands-on experience.

Institute for European Studies Introduction The Institute for European Studies, a program in the College of Arts and Sciences, offers interdisciplinary programs that combine courses in the social sciences, humanities, and languages to give students a broad understanding of the countries of Western Europe and the European Union. The program offers two undergraduate minors: the European Studies minor and the European Union Studies minor. Both minors combine core courses with elective courses from other departments and schools. Some courses to fulfill the minors are listed under \"Institute for European Studies\"; others are offered through various departments. Students may earn both minors, but the minors may not be completed with the same courses. Students must meet with the Institute for European Studies academic advisor to apply for the minors and to work out the course plan. The Institute for European Studies is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing Indiana University undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century. Degree programs associated with SGIS emphasize language proficiency, cultural competency, and in-depth training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies. SGIS students will enjoy unparalleled access to a stellar faculty and career-focused advising.

CASE A&H Film Studies Film and Media Studies is a humanities-style program focused primarily on the critical and theoretical study of cinema, television, and new media. We offer a broad- based curriculum that balances introductory courses in film, critical television studies, and/or new media theory, criticism, and history with advanced courses devoted to the latest developments in the field. To provide valuable hands-on experience, we also offer a number of film and video production courses. Our curriculum and requirements are flexible, so that students may craft individualized programs of study that concentrate on a specific medium; that investigate the relationships among media; or that explore the relationship of media studies to rhetoric or ethnographic and performance studies. Students interested in taking film and media classes, as well as students seeking to major or minor with an emphasis in film studies in the College of Arts and Sciences, should look for film and/or media course listings under the heading for the Department of Communication and Culture.

Folklore and ethnomusicology emphasize fieldwork methods to learn how societies function. Fieldwork involves documenting and learning about people's lives, expressions, and beliefs in context. Through the study of different social groups and cultures, students gain skills in observation, analysis, documentation, reporting, and multicultural understanding. The study of folklore and ethnomusicology taps capacities we possess as human beings and develops the qualities we need to be informed and responsible people. Many courses in folklore and ethnomusicology fulfill Breadth of Inquiry and culture studies requirements. There are opportunities for direct student-faculty contact through individual and collaborative research, such as fieldwork projects, specially designed readings courses, internships in arts and cultural organizations, and performance. Additionally, the departmental honors program provides students with the opportunity to pursue an in-depth research project under the close supervision of a faculty member. Students may make use of the department's archives and state-of-the-art laboratory for sound-video analysis and production. \"Folk\" can refer to any group of people\u2014from any economic, religious, generational, or ethnic background \u2014who share a common interest. As a form of communication, folklore is created when people interact with one another. \"Lore\" represents the knowledge and artistry of a group in forms such as stories and jokes, art, architecture, music, dance, custom, belief, ritual, and festival. Folklore interprets, diffuses, or incites pressure points in modern society. Ethnomusicology is the study of music of all types and from all cultures. Ethnomusicologists not only listen to the sounds of music within particular cultures and events but also inquire into people's ideas and beliefs about music. Ethnomusicology explores the role of music in human life, analyzes relationships between music and culture, and studies music cross-culturally.

Gender Studies Introduction The Department of Gender Studies (GNDR) offers interdisciplinary courses that explore the making and meaning of gender across cultures and social formations. Courses may undertake an analysis of gender in institutions, practices, representations, and knowledge across a range of cultural frameworks. They may also interrogate the intersections between gender and systemic forms of oppression and/or difference, including those based on race, aboriginality, ethnicity, class, and sexual identity and desire. Students achieve a scholarly understanding of the options and situations of both women and men, in the past as well as the present; they are often encouraged to devise and execute original research projects.Contact Information Department of Gender Studies Indiana University Memorial Hall 130 1021 East Third Street Bloomington, IN 47405 (812) 855-0101 gender@indiana.edu http://www.indiana.edu/~gender/ Faculty Chairperson Claudia Breger Director of Undergraduate Studies Colin R.

Major in Gender Studies\u2014B.A. Purpose The interdisciplinary major in gender studies offers students the opportunity to achieve an up-to-date, interdisciplinary, thematic, and problem-oriented understanding of gender. The major encourages students to ask critical questions about how gender operates within the cultures of the world. This program of study can complement minors or majors that students choose in other disciplines and area studies, and enhances the existing teaching and research on gender taking place at Indiana University Bloomington. Fundamental objectives of the major pursued through each of its interdisciplinary courses are to:1.Train students to think critically about how gender has been formed and altered in different cultures, contexts, and historical eras. 2.Equip students to identify and analyze assumptions about gender built into the varying approaches of disciplines and areas of knowledge, and to evaluate the effects of such assumptions on research, teaching, and professional profiles of the disciplines. 3.Provide students with a solid understanding of ways in which \"gender issues\" involve not only the study of women, but, as centrally, the study of men, families, workplaces, organizations, nations, economies, science, industry, laws, sexual behavior and identities, customs, mass media, sports, leisure, religion, and many other subject areas relevant to future careers of graduates. 4.Develop students' skills in undertaking research, critical analysis, and written and verbal presentations of their findings, and encourage a fully professional approach to the subject matter and content of the courses of the major. Graduates will be prepared to enter the full range of graduate and professional education. Some will become specialized researchers and scholars. In addition, the gender studies major provides a sound background relevant to employment in a variety of occupations within the private sector, the professions, government, and the nonprofit sector. Graduates can pursue occupations in public relations, advertising, or the media. Others may become lawyers, doctors, journalists, social workers, or psychologists. Still others will work in education, social services, the arts, public administration, and international aid and social justice organizations. Required Courses In addition to fulfilling the requirements for the B.A. degree in The College of Arts and Sciences, all Gender Studies majors must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours, including the following: 1.Required courses: G101 Gender, Culture, and Society, and G300 Gender Studies: Core Concepts and Key Debates. 2.Any three out of the following six core elective courses (9 credits). G206 Gay Histories/Queer Cultures G215 Sex and Gender in Cross Cultural Perspective* G290 History of Feminist Thought and Practice G310 Representation and the Body G335 Explaining Sex/Gender Differences G410 International Feminist Debates* 3.At least one course fulfilling the international/non- Western requirement (denoted by * above). 4.Majors must include the following: 3 credit hours at the 100 level. 3 credit hours at the 200 level 9 credit hours at the 300 or 400 level 9 additional credit hours at the 400 level Additional electives to meet the 30 credit hour requirement are freely chosen by the student.

Global and International Studies, School of Introduction The School of Global and International Studies (SGIS) was established in 2012 to focus the talent, resources, and energy of Indiana University to address globalizationTuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 History 207 as a defining organizing principle of the twenty-first century. By further integrating highly regarded educational, scholarly, and research activities, SGIS will take its place among the world's leading centers for international studies. SGIS will serve not only as a research center, but also as an academic unit within the College of Arts and Sciences offering a wide variety of graduate and undergraduate degrees. Students enrolled in SGIS can opt for more than twenty distinct undergraduate degrees and certificates and enroll in more than 70 languages. Overseas study and internship opportunities for students extend to more than 250 destinations around the world. SGIS academic programs will prepare students to meet the global competencies of the twenty-first century by providing a thorough and interdisciplinary education in the study of economics, culture, politics, business, law, technology, and countless other fields. The School of Global and International Studies builds on Indiana University's and the College of Arts and Sciences' long and distinguished record of international engagement dating back to 1901, when IU education professor Fred Atkinson was appointed as the general supervisor of education in the Philippines, becoming a global ambassador for an IU education and recruiting Filipino, Chinese, and Japanese students to come to Bloomington. As the focus of the United States' strategic interests has evolved, IU's international studies offerings have expanded. When the Cold War intensified in the late 1940s, we were one of the only American universities offering Russian language studies. At the start of the twenty-first century, as the nation's security focus has shifted toward Iraq, Afghanistan, and the surrounding region, we have strengthened our programs in Central Asian languages, Islamic Studies, and Turkish Studies. SGIS will provide a nexus for expertise and excellence at IU through support provided by the College in the area of collaborative research in global studies. By enabling and facilitating partnerships inside and outside the academy and by enhancing the strengths and visibility of this university, SGIS will place IU at the forefront of global research in the twenty-first century. A key component to bolster and facilitate increased collaborations will be the new state-of-the-art Global and International Studies building (GIS) which will elevate the visibility and prestige of Indiana University's Global Studies programs. The resultant intellectual and administrative centralization of units within SCIS will provide opportunities for collaboration on international topics in both research and teaching. The School will eventually be housed in the new facility, to be located between the Wells Library and the Radio- TV Building, just north of the IU Auditorium and east of the Arboretum. In the interim, we are operating out of the College of Arts and Sciences offices in Owen Hall.Contact Information School of Global and International Studies College of Arts and Sciences Indiana University Owen Hall, 790 E.

Recommendations Students should consult with departmental and faculty advisors regarding their selection of courses within the primary concentration. Suggestions for programs of study are available from the History advisor and on the Department of History website: www.indiana.edu/ ~histweb. Prelaw Advice The history major provides an excellent preparation for students intending to study law. In addition, those interested in legal careers should concentrate on developing particular kinds of skills needed in legal education and practice. They should, for example, develop their analytical skills by taking courses such as logic, their writing skills by taking seminars and other courses that offer structured writing exercises, and their speaking skills by taking courses in speech. Finally, since much of the law deals with marketplace issues, students interested in law should consider taking micro- and macroeconomics.

Science and other requirements are specified only when they are essential for comprehending the course material. Guide to Course Numbers Courses at the 100 level are designed for freshmen and sophomores. Such courses are typically limited to enrollments of 35 students per section. The 200- level courses do not require extensive experience in an appropriate major and are designed for undergraduates at all levels. The 300-level courses deal with more specialized topics and may require some understanding of a particular science. The 400-level courses are specialized courses designed with college honors students particularly in mind. The 300- and 400-level courses sometimes meet with corresponding graduate courses, but will normally carry separate undergraduate requirements. Certificate in the Cultures of Science and Medicine Purpose This program aims to give both undergraduates majoring in the sciences and undergraduates majoring in the humanities a unique opportunity to bridge the ever- widening gap between the notorious \"two cultures.\" The program is organized and administered within the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, but it also involves a wide spectrum of other units across the university, such as the Departments of Anthropology, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, English, History, Mathematics, Philosophy, Physics, Psychological and Brain Sciences, Religious Studies, and Sociology; and the Schools of Business, Education, Informatics and Computing, Journalism, and Public and Environmental Affairs. The program involves several different tracks that integrate the sciences and the humanities in a variety of ways: (1) Life Sciences; (2) Physics, Computation, and Cognition; (3) Science, Society, and Culture; (4) the Nature of Science. Required Courses Students must complete 25-27 credit hours\u201424 credit hours of course work divided into eight 3 credit courses, with 1-3 extra credit hours given for a capstone research project. Four of the courses, totaling 12 credit hours,220History and Philosophy of Science Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 will be in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, and the remaining four, also totaling 12 credit hours, will be spread across the other curricular units involved in the program in accordance with the chosen track. Each student's plan for a particular track must be approved by the director of the program. A 100-level core course in history and philosophy of science is required for all students in the program. Students may select either the introductory survey course offered every semester under the course number X102 or the Critical Approaches to the Arts and Sciences course relevant for their chosen track: Track 1: COLL-C 104 Genetics, Eugenics and Biotechnology Track 2: COLL-C 105 Quantum Mysteries for Everyone Track 3: COLL-C 104 Evolution, Creationism, and Society or COLL-C 103 Eyes, Light, and Color: Vision Studies from the Renaissance Through the Twentieth Century Track 4: No available Critical Approaches Courses. Students must take X102. Three other HPSC courses relevant for the chosen track, one of which must be at or above the 300 level, are also required. These courses will be selected in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Four courses from other relevant units, adapted to the particular track elected by the student, will then complete the program. In non-HPSC courses, at least one must be at the 300 level or above. Four courses (including both HPSC and non- HPSC courses) will be at the 300-400 level.

Human Biology Introduction The Human Biology program provides students with a holistic understanding of our species with a focuson our biology. It includes consideration of how our biology is altered by both evolutionary history and a contemporary environment that includes natural, social, and technological components, and how it is interpreted within a social and cultural context. Students explore these diverse aspects of humanity while gaining a solid knowledge of our biological foundations. In the Human Biology curriculum, students study cases from the perspectives of different disciplines, work with team members to generate and present cases, participate in experiential learning environments, conduct original research, and communicate their work to a larger community using various media. The Human Biology program is designed around a core sequence of two interdisciplinary 4-credit courses and a 3 credit senior capstone course. In addition to these, students take required courses in a variety of disciplines to gain expertise in the diverse aspects of human biology, and courses in a single area of concentration, that allow for more in-depth study in their area of interest. Each area of concentration includes courses from both the life science perspective and the historical, social, arts, and humanities perspectives.

India Studies Introduction The Madhusudan and Kiran C. Dhar India Studies Program (INST) seeks to provide for the interdisciplinary study and critical analysis of the cultures and civilizations that have developed on the Indian subcontinent from ancient times to the present. The primary focus of the program is on present-day or modern India, but in order to understand modern India, it is important to have some basic knowledge about the great periods in the history of India that have shaped modern Indian social reality. This approach requires a sophisticated understanding of the country's highly developed arts, music, literature, drama, philosophy, religions, and social and political structures. In addition to providing an overall, comprehensive education about Indian civilizations, the program allows for more specialized work in (a) literary and performance studies, (b) philosophical and religious studies, and (c) social, political, and historical studies. The India Studies Program also offers beginning and intermediate-level courses in several Indian languages. All students in the program are encouraged to take language classes, as well as to consider study abroad in India.Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 India Studies 231 The Dhar India Studies Program is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing Indiana University undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century. Degree programs associated with SGIS emphasize language proficiency, cultural competency, and in-depth training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies. SGIS students will enjoy unparalleled access to a stellar faculty and career-focused advising.

Smith, III, Sycamore Hall 123, (812) 855-2736 Major in India Studies Purpose India is an important, dynamic part of today's world. The India Studies major equips students to understand and become engaged with this complex and exciting region. The major is designed for undergraduate students on the Bloomington campus, including those in various professional schools. The program offers a variety of courses dedicated to investigating the culture, literature, arts, philosophy, socio-political and historical dimensions of India. The program also offers training in several Indic languages at the beginning, intermediate and advanced levels. When combined with a major in International Studies, Communication and Culture, Anthropology, History, Religious Studies, Comparative Literature, Political Science, or Folklore, to name a few, the India Studies major gives students a competitive edge in the increasingly global market. Required Courses Students pursuing a major in India Studies must complete a second major (B.A.) in a department of the College of Arts and Sciences. (Students completing a simultaneous second degree program in the College or through another school should check with the advisor for details.) 1. Six credits through the fourth-semester level of a modern Indic language, Sanskrit, or an appropriate substitute which must be approved in advance by the Academic Program Committee of the India Studies Program. Students demonstrating proficiency to a level commensurate with the completion of four semesters of course work may substitute six credit hours from other India Studies courses. 2. In addition to fulfillment of language requirements (specified above), completion of a minimum of 24 credit hours of India Studies courses, including the following: The India Studies \"core course\" At least one 3-credit course at the 300 level or above from the Literary and Performance Studies group At least one 3-credit course at the 300 level or above from the Philosophical and Religious Studies group At least one 3-credit course at the 300 level or above from the Social, Political, and Historical Studies group One 3 credit course (or course equivalent) at any level Three additional 3-credit courses at the 300 level or above, at least one of which must be at the 400 level.232India Studies Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 See the India Studies website for a listing of courses in each group. At the discretion of the Director, a student may receive credit for course work taken under the auspices of a Study Abroad program. Students wishing to receive such credit should consult their academic advisor and the Director of India Studies. Other IU course work that involves a significant amount of work related to India/South Asia, but without an India Studies designation, may also be applied to these requirements at the discretion of the Director. Students wishing to receive such credit should consult their academic advisor and the Director of India Studies. Students must also complete the degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. Certificate in India Studies Required Courses The undergraduate Certificate in India Studies requires 24 credit hours, including the following: 1.I100 Introduction to India (the core course for India studies); 2.Two courses each from the three areas of specialized work in India studies (i.e., two courses from the Literary and Performance Studies group, two courses from the Philosophical and Religious Studies group, and two courses from the Social, Political, and Historical Studies group); 3.The remainder of the units will come from interdisciplinary electives in any of the areas of specialization. See the India Studies Advising Office, 825 E. Eighth Street, for a listing of courses in each area of specialization. Of the total 24 credit hours, at least 15 credit hours must be taken from courses at the 300 level or above. It should be noted that, under certain circumstances, other courses that include some aspect of the study of India may, by special arrangement and with the permission of the director of the India Studies Program, be counted toward the certificate program. The first two years of language instruction in Hindi or Sanskrit, however, do not count toward completion of the certificate. Only four courses from a student's major may be double- counted toward the Certificate in India Studies. The India Studies Program encourages work in elementary, intermediate, and advanced Hindi and Sanskrit. All students in the certificate program are strongly urged to study either Hindi or Sanskrit (and preferably both) and to begin the study of the languages at the earliest possible opportunity. Students in the program should also consider the possibility of studying in India and should consult about this possibility with the Office of Overseas Study, Franklin Hall 303, (812) 855-9304 (www.indiana.edu/~overseas ). India also has a rich English-medium cultural tradition (in such areas as Indo- British literature, drama, and Third World studies, among others), so students may choose to focus their work on these English language traditions.Minor in India Studies Required Courses 15 credit hours, chosen in consultation with the undergraduate advisor, including: 1.The India Studies \"core course\" 2.At least one course from the Literary and Performance Studies group. 3.At least one course from the Philosophical and Religious Studies group. 4.At least one course from the Social, Political, and Historical Studies group. 5.No more than 6 credit hours of course work may be taken at the 100 level. 6.At least 9 credit hours must be taken at the 300 level or above. In consultation with the undergraduate advisor, two semesters of intermediate language course work may be substituted for one of the requirements listed above (with the exception of the \"core course\" which is required of all students). Only two courses from a student's major may be counted toward the India Studies minor. All students in the minor program are strongly urged to study an Indic language at the earliest possible opportunity. India also has a rich English-medium cultural tradition (in such areas as literature, drama, and Third World studies, among others), so students may choose to focus their work on these English language traditions. Overseas Study Students in the program should also consider the possibility of studying in India and should consult with the director about opportunities, and with the Office of Overseas Study , Leo R.

Individualized Major Program Introduction The Individualized Major Program (IMP) is an interdisciplinary program resulting in a B.A. from the College of Arts and Sciences. The IMP facilitates the creation of student-designed interdisciplinary majors whose primary emphasis is in the liberal arts. The IMP allows students with interests that cross traditional departmental and disciplinary boundaries to combine those interests in coherent and meaningful ways, building upon\u2014and using in new ways\u2014the resources available in the College, and bringing in expertise from the professional schools as needed. Students develop majors in consultation with faculty sponsors and propose them to committees of two faculty members selected from the IMP's Faculty Committee (IMPFC). The IMPFC is responsible for ensuring that individualized majors are distinct from fields of study available in existing degrees and majors and that they conform to College and university standards of breadth, depth, and rigor. Approved majors normally combine courses from two or more College departments, and, as needed, from the professional schools, with independent and self-directed work. In addition to granting admission to the program, faculty committees work with sponsors to monitor students' progress, evaluate theses or projects, and administer final oral reviews. Each IMP major will include at least 18 credit hours of 300-400 level course work. Students in the IMP must fulfill the College requirements for the B.A. degree. Students are eligible to apply for admission to the IMP after completing one IU semester with a GPA of 2.500 or higher, but they cannot be accepted to the IMP until they have been admitted to the College. Formal requirements for admission are otherwise the same as those for the College. Students who do not meet the GPA requirement, but who feel that their past grades do not accurately reflect their potential for success in the IMP, may request permission from the IMP director to go through the application process. Such permission allows the applicant, like other applicants, to present his or her case to an admission committee, but does not, of course, guarantee that the student will be accepted into the IMP. Students of any class standing or level of interest in the IMP are encouraged to meet with the Assistant Director and may236Individualized Major Program Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 arrange a meeting by calling (812) 855-9588 or e-mailing imp@indiana.edu . IMP students are eligible to take a second major in another department if the course credit is separate and distinct from the IMP concentration. Students in the IMP may graduate with honors if their GPA meets College honors standards and if their project work is deemed of honors quality by the IMP review committee.

International Studies Introduction Both the B.A. and the B.S. in International Studies (INTL) provide an intellectual foundation that enables students to communicate, collaborate, and work across national, cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic boundaries. By incorporating extensive foreign language study and mandating an overseas experience, these degrees foster competencies that students need in order to function successfully in a global environment. The majors are broadly constructed to allow flexibility as well as depth and breadth of regional and thematic knowledge. Students explore the majors by taking two introductory courses chosen from the following thematic concentrations: Global Health and Environment; Global Development; Human Rights and International Law; International Communication and the Arts; Identity andConflict; and Diplomacy, Security, Governance. They are also required to complete 300- and 400-level courses that focus directly on their chosen thematic concentration. Students must choose a regional concentration area with the approval of the departmental advisor. This area can be perceived in one of two ways (students must select one): 1.An area defined geographically (either broadly defined, such as the Pacific Rim, or with a concentrated focus, such as Egypt or Germany); or 2.An area defined linguistically, religiously and/or ethnically (such as the Jewish diaspora) outside the United States. Optimally, the regional concentration chosen will relate to the student's foreign language study. Information on the Certificate in Islamic Studies administered by International Studies can be found at Islamic Studies. International Studies is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies (SGIS) in the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing Indiana University undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century. Degree programs associated with SGIS emphasize language proficiency, cultural competency, and in-depth training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies. SGIS students will enjoy unparalleled access to a stellar faculty and career-focused advising.

Jewish Studies Introduction The Robert A. and Sandra S. Borns Jewish Studies Program (JSTU) has as its objective the study of Jewish civilization from antiquity to the present and its interaction with and impact on world civilization. Our program draws on the many disciplines necessary to study the multifaceted Jewish experience, thus bringing a variety of approaches to the study of Jewish civilization. Contributing departments include Anthropology, Communication and Culture, Comparative Literature, English, Fine Arts, Germanic Studies, History, Hutton Honors College, Musicology, Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, Political Science, and Religious Studies. Modern and Biblical Hebrew language courses and Hebrew literature and culture courses taught within the Jewish Studies Program offer students a way to understand Jewish culture and its historical experience through literary analysis of texts and artifacts. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the Jewish Studies Program, students enrolled in the B.A. or certificate programs have the opportunity to structure course work individually, according to their specific areas of interest. Students in the Jewish Studies Program can pursue either a B.A. in Jewish studies or a certificate in Jewish studies. Students, in addition, may complete a minor in Hebrew or a minor in Yiddish studies (through Germanic Studies). These programs are open to students from all academic and personal backgrounds. We encourage students planning to major in Jewish studies to see the Jewish studies advisor in their first or second semester. Students may call (812) 855-0453 to make an appointment.

Recognizing the varied objectives of students, the Latin American and Caribbean studies faculty has attempted to provide diverse formats and levels of study in the program.Although the program offers no undergraduate major, students may choose Latin American and Caribbean studies as a minor or obtain a certificate along with the bachelor's degree in an academic discipline. In either case, the program provides the student with a basic knowledge of the anthropology, art, economics, folklore, geography, history, languages, literatures, music, and politics of Latin America. Such study is especially useful to students who contemplate advanced study in the area or who plan to work or live in Latin America. Students may elect to complete the minor or the certificate but not both. The Latin American and Caribbean Studies Program is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies (SGIS), an autonomous unit within the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing Indiana University undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century. Degree programs associated with SGIS emphasize language proficiency, cultural competency, and in-depth training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies. SGIS students will enjoy unparalleled access to a stellar faculty and career-focused advising. For further information regarding the mission, structure and resources of the School of Global and International Studies, see http://sgis.indiana.edu . SGIS serves an economically, culturally and generationally diverse student body. Contact Information Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies Indiana University 1125 E.

Selected on a competitive basis, undergraduates pursuing a major in the College of Arts and Sciences enter the three-year LAMP program as sophomores. LAMP students acquire both technical business and management skills and an understanding of the social, political, and cultural contexts that shape business life. Building on the bachelor's degree requirements of the College, students in LAMP take courses in management, business law, and computer applications in the Kelley School of Business and economics courses in the College. To draw together their course work in business, economics, and liberal arts, LAMP students take the program's own seminars.

As they solve real-world business problems and analyze the relationships between business and society, students connect with faculty who bring many perspectives from different disciplines. Admission to LAMP LAMP has two application periods each academic year: freshmen may apply online during the spring semester and sophomores and transfer students during the fall semester. Candidates for LAMP will be selected on the basis of their academic achievement and promise, leadership potential, and ability to articulate their reasons for pursuing an interdisciplinary program combining arts and sciences with business. Typically, applicants will not yet be students in the College of Arts and Sciences when they are admitted to LAMP. In order to continue in the program, students must declare their major in a department of the College during their sophomore year and maintain an overall grade point average of 3.300 or higher.

Mathematics Introduction Mathematics explores patterns in numbers, space, nature, music, science, and art. Its precise language facilitates qualitative and quantitative analysis of these patterns, and often connects them with completely unexpected areas of application. A math degree prepares a student for a mathematical research career or for graduate or professional school in statistics, medicine, law, or the natural sciences. Mathematicians work in actuarial science, in education, and in a wide array of government and business-related organizations which seek out creative and disciplined analytic thinkers. Mathematics underpins the natural and life sciences, economics, and computer science, and affords dynamic double-degree opportunities. The honors course S212 is available for students of outstanding ability (credit for M211 and consent of department required). Particularly well-prepared students may take the accelerated course M213, which covers the material of M211 and M212 in one semester (consent of department required). Advanced Placement (AP) Credit High school students who have taken the CEEB Advanced Placement Program mathematics examinations will be awarded credit as follows: A score of 4 or 5 on the Calculus AB exam earns a student 4 credits of M211. A score of 4 or 5 on the Calculus BC exam earns a student 4 credits of M211 and 4 credits of M212. Special credit will be awarded with the grade of S. Credit by Examination Credit for M118, M119, M211, M212, and certain other courses may be obtained by passing an examination administered by the mathematics department with a grade of at least a B. Special credit will be awarded with the grade of S.

B.S. Mathematics/M.S. Secondary Education In an effort to address the shortage of Indiana high school teachers in certain subjects, the College, in conjunction with the IU School of Education, offers an accelerated five-year program in which students can obtain a B.S. in Mathematics (either Program I or Program II) and an M.S. in Secondary Education and also complete all requirements for State licensure in Secondary Education. Students must begin by pursuing a B.S. Mathematics degree, Program I or Program II. After they have completed a minimum of 90 credit hours in the CollegeTuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Mathematics 267 of Arts and Sciences and satisfied the Foundations, Intensive Writing, Foreign Language, Breadth of Inquiry, and major concentration requirements for this B.S. Mathematics major, students may apply up to 30 credit hours earned in the School of Education as College electives. Students must apply and earn admittance to the School of Education's Secondary Transition to Teaching and the Master of Science in Education programs during the fall semester of their senior year. The B.S. requirements must be completed before student teaching begins in the final spring semester of the five- year program. The two degrees (B.S. Mathematics and M.S. Secondary Education) are awarded simultaneously. Students considering this program should seek advising from both the Department of Mathematics and the School of Education. Also, students are advised to check on the effect that the transition to graduate status may have on existing undergraduate funding. Actuarial Studies Actuaries use mathematics to determine the financial effect that uncertain future events such as birth, death, retirement, fire, earthquake, accident, and sickness have on insurance and other benefit plans. Actuaries may work for insurance companies, consulting firms, or the benefits departments of general businesses and government agencies. The program of study outlined below combined with a B.A. or B.S. degree in mathematics prepares the graduate for entry into the actuarial profession. The B.S. Program II with a Minor in Economics, or the Interdepartmental Major in Mathematics and Economics, works especially well with actuarial career preparation. For further information, contact the mathematics department's academic advisor in Rawles Hall 115, (812) 855-1589. To advance in the actuarial profession, one must pass a series of highly challenging examinations given by the Society of Actuaries ( www.soa.org ) or the Casualty Actuarial Society ( www.casact.org ). Passing these examinations requires discipline and additional study beyond Indiana University course work. Actuaries also must be comfortable with the language and substance of a wide range of mathematics, economics, statistics, and finance/accounting to prepare for these exams. An actuary student should aim to pass at least one, and preferably two, of these examinations before graduation. Actuary students who desire a summer internship may benefit from passing the first examination, Exam P, by the summer following their junior year. Internships help assure strong job placement upon graduation and are strongly encouraged. Additionally, an actuary student should take some VEE (Validation by Educational Experience) accredited courses and must receive a grade of B- or better in these courses to earn VEE credit. A list of VEE- accredited courses is available at the Society of Actuaries website and includes several of the courses mentioned below. M463 covers most of the material for the three-hour Exam P on probability. Students must take M211, M212, M311, and either M301 or M303 as preparation. Economics E425 covers the syllabus for the 2.5-hour Exam FM on Financial Mathematics, but students must first take E201, E202, and E321 as preparation. Students pursuing actuarial studies may benefit by taking Accounting A200, Computer Science C211, andEconomics E471 and E472.

Required Courses Students must complete a minimum of 30 credit hours in philosophy. No more than 3 credit hours of course work in the category of introductory courses (that is, any 100-level course or P240 or P270) may be included in the 30 credit hour minimum. Students are required to take: 1.P250 Introductory Symbolic Logic. 2.One course at or above the 200 level in history of philosophy. 3.One course at or above the 300 level in ethics and value theory. 4.One course at or above the 300 level in epistemology and metaphysics. 5.One 400-level course from among the following: P401 Special Topics in the History of Philosophy P470 Special Topics in Philosophy P498 Senior Seminar P499 Honors Thesis 6.A minimum of 18 credit hours must be completed at the 300-400 level. Students must also complete the degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences. Recommendations An exemplary plan of course work for majors who are considering graduate study in philosophy might be as follows: one course in logic (P250, which should be completed at the earliest opportunity); four courses in the history of philosophy (e.g., P201, P211, P301 or P304, and P401); two courses in epistemology and metaphysics (e.g., P310 and P312); and two courses in ethics and sociopolitical philosophy (e.g., P340 or P342). Varied interests in particular areas of philosophy will suggest other equally worthwhile plans of course work. Transfer of Credits toward Major Students planning to transfer philosophy credits toward a major in philosophy should consult with the director of undergraduate studies. Of the 30 credit hours required for the major in philosophy, at least 18 must be completed in residence on the Bloomington campus. These 18 credit hours will usually be 300- and 400-level courses taken from at least three of the following areas: logic, ethics and social-political philosophy, history of philosophy, and epistemology and metaphysics.

B.S. Physics/M.S. Medical Physics The Applied Physics alternative within the Physics program (Program II) emphasizes practical applications of physics in order to prepare students for high-tech physics jobs in industry and medicine. Some of these Applied Physics requirements can be fulfilled by taking courses also required for a Master's Degree in Medical Physics. By fulfilling requirements satisfying both programs, students can complete a Master's Degree in Medical Physics within as little as one additional year. Students must apply for and earn admittance to the University Graduate School and the Master of Science in Medical Physics program after completing at least 90 credit hours of the Applied Physics undergraduate track (generally during the fall semester of their senior year). The B.S. degree will be conferred upon successful completion of the Applied Physics program (Program II) requirements. The student must also successfully complete (passed with a grade of B or above) 40 credit hours of graduate work, at least 18 credit hours of which must be Physics courses numbered 501 or above (not included are reading, seminar and research courses) and must satisfy all other requirements for that degree to receive the M.S. B.S. Physics/M.S. Secondary Education In an effort to address the shortage of Indiana high school teachers in certain subjects, the College, in conjunction with the IU School of Education, offers an accelerated five-year program in which students can obtain a B.S. in Physics and an M.S. in Secondary Education and also complete all requirements for State licensure in Secondary Education. Under this program, students complete all of the course work required for the Physics concentration (B.S.) by their eighth semester at IU. Continuing in the summer after their fourth year and then in a fifth year of study, students complete all of the requirements for the M.S. in Secondary Education with licensure. Students must apply and earn admittance to the School of Education's Secondary Transition to Teaching and the Master of Science in Education programs during the fall semester of their senior year. After they have completed a minimum of 90 credit hours in the College of Arts and Sciences and satisfied the Foundations, Intensive Writing, Foreign Language, Breadth of Inquiry, and major concentration requirements for the B.S. in Physics, students may apply up to 30 credit hours earned in the School of Education as College electives. The requirements for the B.S. in Physics must be completedTuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Physics 287 before student teaching begins in the final spring semester of the five-year program. The two degrees (B.S. in Physics and M.S. in Secondary Education) are awarded simultaneously. Students considering this program should seek advising from both the Department of Physics and the School of Education. Also, students are advised to check on the effect that the transition to graduate status may have on existing undergraduate funding. Minor in Physics Required Courses Students must complete: 1.One of the two 10 credit introductory course sequences, P201-P202 or P221-P222. 2.A modern physics course, to be chosen from P301, P453, and P454. 3.A laboratory course, to be chosen from P309, P451, and P460. 4.Another 3 credit course above the level of P301. 5.At least 9 credit hours of course work at the 300-400 level. Departmental Honors Program The honors program provides well-qualified students with an exceptionally strong foundation in physics, both by encouraging excellence in course work and recognizing the importance of early participation in research. It is strongly recommended that students intending to enroll in graduate school pursue this option. The key component of the honors program is involvement of the student in an independent research project, typically carried out under the supervision of a faculty member. This work must culminate in the writing of an honors thesis (S409) before the end of the senior year. An oral presentation describing the work would also be expected. For more detailed guidelines, see the \"Honors\" section of the departmental Web pages. In addition to fulfilling the requirements associated with the B.S. degree, students in the honors program would also be expected to complete most of the course work listed under \"Recommendations\" for this degree; in particular, at least two of the three courses P332, P442, and P454 must be completed. To graduate with honors, students should maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.500 in all physics course work. Further information regarding this program may be obtained from the department.

Political and Civic Engagement Introduction The Political and Civic Engagement program (PACE) offers an interdisciplinary, 22-credit certificate program. It combines academic study with hands-on learning to provide students with an education in democratic citizenship. The PACE certificate prepares students to make a difference through active engagement in American political and civic life. Students learn to seek out various perspectives, engage in dialogue, analyze the effectiveness of policies, and take principled stands on vital public issues. They also explore the relationship between theory and practice, develop informed critiques of political and civic institutions, practice collective decision- making, work with those who hold opposing views, and devise effective solutions to public problems. Through academic and co-curricular experiences, students learn how to engage in a wide range of political and civic activities: advocacy groups; nonprofit agencies; political campaigns; branches of local, state, and national government; community organizations; and the media. PACE prepares students to enter work in political and civic organizations right after graduation and to pursue post- graduate education in law, public policy, the media, and kindred fields. It also enhances the education of students headed toward careers in other areas such as health care or the arts who want to be engaged citizens. Co-curricular activities are critical to PACE's goal of developing students' political and civic knowledge and skills. They range from formal lectures and panels to informal lunches with individuals with a wide variety of political and civic experiences. PACE students also engage in debates, election-watching parties, program retreats, blogs, roundtable discussions, and other activities designed to enhance their academic and experiential learning.

Departmental Honors Program The Department of Political Science makes a special effort to give outstanding students opportunities appropriate to their abilities and interests. In addition to a number of topics courses and small seminars, the department offers a formal program leading to a B.A. with honors.296Political Science Tuesday September 3, 2013 - 9:20 Admission to the program usually occurs at the end of the sophomore year. Students are eligible to apply if they have completed at least 9 credit hours in political science, including at least one 300-level course, with a minimum grade point average of 3.500 in political science and a minimum overall GPA of 3.300 in university courses. Students must complete an application and meet with the director of honors in the Department of Political Science to discuss the student's proposed program. To attain a degree with honors, students must: 1. Present an acceptable honors thesis and defend it before a faculty committee. There are two paths to the thesis: The student researches and writes a thesis, usually over the course of two semesters. Honors students typically enroll in 3-12 hours of Y499 for one or two semesters (usually in the senior year). The total amount of credit is determined by the chairperson of the student's honors committee. The honors thesis is written under the direction of two faculty members: a faculty supervisor who serves as chairperson of the student's honors committee, and at least one additional member of the honors committee. Graduate students may not serve as honors supervisors. The student arranges with a faculty member to enroll in a graduate seminar in political science. The research paper for that seminar serves as the basis for the honors thesis, and the instructor of the graduate seminar becomes the chairperson of the student's honors committee. This path is used very infrequently. 2. In both cases, during the fall and spring semesters of the year in which the thesis is being completed and defended, honors students are required to enroll and participate in the \"Honors Colloquium\" section of Y480. Any exceptions to the above requirements must be approved by the Director of Honors in Political Science. Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis The Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis develops courses that provide students with an opportunity to relate theoretical analysis of contemporary policy issues to empirical field research. Students in both graduate and undergraduate courses participate in the design and implementation of small-scale, policy-relevant research projects. These projects help students gain practical experience in reasoning through policy problems, in conducting research, and in analyzing data. Students may also use data collected in these studies for their own research, such as class assignments and honors theses. High-quality work may be considered for publication in the workshop publication series. The subject matter of the courses varies from year to year, but a consistent theme is the comparative study of alternative institutional arrangements for dealing with public sector problems. In addition to the development of specific courses, the workshop holds weekly colloquia where faculty and students at Indiana University and guest speakers address theoretical and policy problems of mutual interest.Reprints of recent studies in the workshop's publication series are available to students without charge. Further information, including listings of current course offerings and publications, is available from the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis, 513 N.

Psychological and Brain Sciences Introduction The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences (PSY) offers a major in psychology leading to the B.A. or B.S. degree, a B.S. degree in neuroscience, and course work for undergraduates who wish to satisfy Breadth of Inquiry requirements. As a science, psychology seeks tounderstand the basic principles by which living organisms adapt their behavior to the changing physical and social environments in which they live. The breadth of the discipline, with its links to the humanities, mathematics, and other social and natural sciences, encourages the development of broad problem-solving skills through exposure to research methodology and statistical analysis and contributes to the development of communicative skills. Psychological knowledge, techniques, and skills obtained in the B.A. and B.S. programs are applied in many careers and provide background for students entering graduate work in psychology and related areas, as well as the professions of medicine, dentistry, law, and business.

Slavic Languages and Literatures Introduction The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures (SLAV) offers courses that meet a wide range of needs and interests in Russian, Polish, Czech, Serbian and Croatian, Ukrainian, and Romanian. Advanced language courses are not only for the department's majors, but also for students specializing in other disciplines, particularly in the social sciences, natural sciences, and other languages and literatures. The department offers literature, culture, and film courses that require no knowledge of a Slavic or East European language and that can be taken by any student interested in the Russian, Slavic, and East European area. There is an intensive program during the summer that allows coverage of a full year of Russian and other Slavic and East European languages in eight weeks. By attending two such summer sessions in conjunction with a regular course of study, students can cover four years of Russian in two, or two years of another Slavic or East European language in one. Admission to the Summer Workshop in Slavic, East European, and Central Asian Languages is by application. To ensure proper placement in language courses at all levels, transfer students and those who return to the study of a departmental language after a lapse of time are required to take a placement examination administered by the department prior to enrolling in a language course. Majors and prospective majors are urged to consult early with the departmental academic advisor concerning the possibility of double majors and the scheduling of strong minors. The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures is affiliated with the new School of Global and International Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences, dedicated to providing Indiana University undergraduates with the intellectual tools they will need to live, work, and thrive in the globalized world of the twenty-first century. Degree programs associated with SGIS emphasize language proficiency, cultural competency, and in-depth training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies. SGIS students will enjoy unparalleled access to a stellar faculty and career-focused advising.

Additional course work in the honors program should be arranged with the departmental advisor, including honors sections of departmental courses and graduate sections of departmental graduate/undergraduate joint offerings. Overseas Study The university co-sponsors Russian and Czech programs administered by the Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE) for a period of one academic year or semester (fall, spring, summer). Successful participation in these programs can earn students up to 15 hours (up to 17 hours in certain programs) of Indiana University credit per semester. Through the Polish Studies Center, IU also offers a study abroad program at Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w, Poland (fall, spring). Study abroad in other East and Central European countries is also possible. For information on these and other overseas study opportunities in Russia and Central and Eastern Europe, contact the Office of Overseas Study in the Leo R. Dowling International Center, 111 South Jordan Avenue, (812) 855-9304 ( http://www.indiana.edu/~overseas/ ). Summer Workshop in Slavic, East European, and Central Asian Languages The Summer Workshop offers students an opportunity to accelerate their learning of Slavic, East European, Caucasian, and Central Asian languages by covering the equivalent of a year of college language study in eight weeks of intensive study and practice. Two summers of Russian study in the workshop combined with two years of regular Russian language courses are equal to four years of non-intensive Russian language courses. Besides Russian, the Summer Workshop regularly offers first-year Polish, Czech, Serbian/Croatian, Romanian, Hungarian, and Georgian, as well as a number of languages from the Central Asian region. Slavic Languages at the Global Village Living-Learning Center The department cooperates with the Global Village Living- Learning Center in offering housing options for students with common interests in Slavic languages and cultures.

Statistics Introduction Statistics is the science of data. Data are numbers with a context; the particular context that gave rise to the numbers is important. In addition to a knowledge of mathematics, statisticians must learn about the scientific disciplines that generate data of interest to understand and explain the observational studies or the statistical experiments in question. For example, statisticians calculate probabilities for DNA paternity tests; design clinical trials to study the effectiveness of new medications; study economic time series data, such as gross domestic product from developing countries in Africa; and develop statistical models of responses from fMRI psychological experiments. The field of statistics has a coherent body of theory, which students of the field master, as well as methodology designed for applied uses in many disciplines. The department teaches courses in both theoretical and applied statistics. Contact Information Department of Statistics Indiana University 309 N.
