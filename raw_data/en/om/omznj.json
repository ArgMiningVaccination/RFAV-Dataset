More recently, the beauty industry has been exploring a less exotic location for inspiration: the supermarket produce aisle. While industry watchers say that cosmetic-grade fruit and vegetable extracts have been around for a while with brands like Burt's Bees and L'Occitane paving the way they note that beauty formulations with ingredients like tomato (Philosophy Big Mouth Semi-Matte Lip Plump and Primer) and mushroom (Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins Plantidote Mega-Mushroom Skin-Calming Face Mask) have been appearing with increasing frequency. Their appeal lies at least in part in their familiarity. \"It's easy for consumers who've been bombarded with information about antioxidants and vitamins to transfer that knowledge to beauty and personal care,\" said Taya Tomasello, senior beauty analyst for Mintel International Group, a market research firm that tracks the cosmetic industry. \"They understand these products.\" \"It's a part of the whole organic, natural movement,\" said Dr. Leslie Baumann, a Miami Beach-based dermatologist and a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Dermatology. \"People are looking for the same things in their skin care that they know are good for them in their diet.\" Take, for example, spinach. According to Mintel, only two beauty products contained spinach as an ingredient in 2007. This year, it appeared in 10 concoctions, including CosMedix Purity Clean Exfoliating Cleanser and MAC Studio Moisture Cream. PurGenesis Technologies Inc., a Canadian botanical pharmaceutical company, wants to increase that number. In January, it will begin conducting clinical trials on an extract made from organic baby spinach that it says could be a strong antioxidant for the skin. \"Antioxidants work by donating an electron to an unstable molecule, but most traditional antioxidants become neutralized through the process,\" said Suzanne Villeneuve, chief executive of PurGenesis. \"This complex has regenerative capacities, so it continues to be able to engage in interactions. It has a longer-term effect.\" It takes 55 pounds of spinach to create one pound of extract, and PurGenesis has been working on the formula since 1999. The company hopes it will be available in face creams by the end of next year. Chili pepper is another ingredient enjoying a Cinderella moment. Mintel said that since 2006 there has been a 60 percent increase in the number of beauty products containing peppers. When applied to the skin, chili pepper extract increases circulation, manufacturers say. The extract can be found in products like Too Faced Lip Injection and Urban Decay Big Fatty Lip Plumper. Capsaicin, the chemical that gives chili peppers their heat, may also help people look younger. Blair Lazar is a New Jersey-based hot sauce maker who makes one of the hottest chili sauces commercially available. In 2003, a lab accident inspired him to create a face cream. \"I was filling up reserve bottles of the most concentrated form of capsaicin,\" Mr. Lazar said. \"A rubber hose burst, and I got sprayed in the face. My eye was swollen for like three days, but at the end of it, I thought, 'Wow, my skin looks tight.' \" Mr. Lazar worked with scientists for three years to find a formula that reduced the appearance of wrinkles without a stinging sensation. He introduced the BioCap line in 2007. Apples have also caught beauty companies' roving eyes. While their scent has been a favorite in perfumes and lotions for years, apple-based extracts are now the active ingredient in products like Dr. Brandt Lineless Foaming Cleanser and MD Skincare EZ4U 4-in-1 Facial Treatment. Lev Glazman, a founder of Fresh, which recently began offering an Appleseed Brightening Essence and Appleseed Brightening Exfoliant, said apple-seed oil \"helps soften the skin, brighten the skin and even out discoloration.\" Mr. Glazman has been finding inspiration at Whole Foods for years. \"I walk through the aisles and say: 'Black tea. Let me read about it. Litchi. Let me look into that,' \" he said. Once he has an idea for a new product, Mr. Glazman researches which manufacturers are already offering it. If no one is, he commissions a company to explore making the food a cosmetic ingredient. \"Food grade, when you apply it topically, does nothing,\" he said. \"The ingredients have to be cosmetic grade. The process is very expensive, and not everything can convert.\" The success of Yes To, an Israeli brand that uses pumpkin, sweet potato, melon, orange and, of course, carrot in its Yes to Carrots products, is an indicator of the interest in produce aisle ingredients. Walgreens began stocking Yes to Carrots products in 2007. Now, they are also available in stores like Target and Duane Reade, and the company started two new product lines this summer Yes to Tomatoes and Yes to Cucumbers. Still, some professionals are careful to note that as with just about everything in the world of skin care there are potential downsides. Dr. Baumann, the director of the University of Miami Cosmetic Medicine and Research Institute and author of \"The Skin Type Solution,\" said that it is difficult to formulate many fruit and vegetable ingredients so that they penetrate the skin. She said some ingredients, like vitamin C, can break down when blended into a cosmetic formula. \"There's not a lot of great products out there yet, especially from the big companies that do good research,\" she said. \"But you're going to start seeing them soon.\" She also pointed out there may be potential allergies, because the skin is one of the main organs in the immune system. \"In your skin, you have cells that move all around the body looking for foreign things,\" Dr. Baumann said. \"If they see, say, fig, and you're allergic, that'll trigger the whole immune system, and you'd still get a runny nose and all the symptoms you would if you ate it. Your skin actually is one of the most common ways to become allergic to something.\" Dr. Baumann recommends that consumers use the same skepticism when picking natural cosmetics that they use when looking at any traditional beauty product. \"Some things are just better to eat,\" she said. WHILE many beauty firms focus on produce for their new products, others are working with ingredients that sound like they are straight out of a witch's brew. The highlights: SNAKE VENOM In February, the British company Planet Skincare released its Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer, which contains a synthetic version of the venom produced by a viper. \"Like Botox treatments, it blocks the neuromuscular contractions which cause facial muscle tension,\" the company's Web site says. MUSSELS AND CLAMS Romanian researchers say an extract made from Mediterranean mussels and clams could have regenerative effects on the skin. They say that they tested the serum on rats and found that without the extract it took up to 22 days for burns to heal, compared with an average of 13 days with the extract. BULLFROG SKIN Scientists at Pukyong National University in South Korea are working with a peptide extract made from bullfrogs' skin as an antiwrinkle treatment. The peptide appears to have antioxidant effects, the scientists say. DONKEY'S MILK Donkey's milk was a popular beauty treatment in ancient Egypt. The Swiss beauty company C\u00e2linesse started a line of skin care products using the moisturizing ingredient last year. "}
