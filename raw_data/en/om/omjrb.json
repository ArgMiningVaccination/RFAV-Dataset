Below is a summary of my personal daily supplement protocol that I share with my clients who are ready to take the plunge into the Ketogenic lifestyle. I hope this helps you get past that Keto flu and well on your way to fat-adaptation! You can find most of these supplements for an affordable price in your local grocery store, at a health food store, or online via Amazon or the brand's website. Links are included for where you can find each - some of these are affiliate links, and I may earn a commission or referral benefits for your use of my links. Please know I would never recommend a product that I do not use personally. These are all products I use regularly and brands that I stand behind. MY MORNING ACV SHOT 1-2 Tbsp [Apple Cider Vinegar](https://amzn.to/2Cnz36u) (with the mother) 1 serving of full-spectrum liquid Minerals ( [Concentrace Trace Minerals drops](https://amzn.to/3fFtPl5)) 1 serving [Liquid Green Tea Extract](https://amzn.to/395xlmv) Mix these ingredients in a shot glass and fill with water, or mix into an 8 ounce glass of water first thing in the morning, or just before the first meal of the day. MY KETO COFFEE 4 cups of brewed black coffee 1/2 Tbsp MCT Oil ( [Nature's Way](https://amzn.to/2WqnJNK) is a great brand; look for any affordable brand, just make sure it is derived 100% from coconuts) 1/2 packet [LMNT Recharge](http://elementallabs.refr.cc/natalieg) Electrolyte Mix (Raw Unflavored) A dash or Peptides ( [Great tsp (3-5 g) [Creatine Monohydrate](https://amzn.to/32sRG3U) Powder (for strength training) 1 tsp (3-5 g) [L-Glutamine](https://amzn.to/3h7o0Nz) Powder (for gut health) My preferred brands for affordable sports supplements - Now Sports Nutrition, MRM, Bulk Supplements, Nutricost or Vitacost MY KETORADE (Infused Electrolyte Water) Pre-mix a jug (10-12 cups) and sip throughout the day. 10-12 Cups Filtered Water 2-3 g Pink Himalayan Salt (for sodium) & 1-2 g \"No Salt\" (Potassium Chloride) OR 1 packets of [LMNT Recharge](http://elementallabs.refr.cc/natalieg) (flavored - Raspberry, Orange or Citrus) & 1 scoop Ultima Replenisher (my favorite flavors are the Blue Raspberry & Watermelon) Citrus/Herb infusions: - Lemon/Basil (lemon slices & fresh basil leaves) - Cucumber/Mint/Lime (lime slices, fresh mint leaves & sliced cucumber) SUPPLEMENTS TAKEN WITH MEALS I take the following with every meal: My ACV Shot (Can be taken before or after the meal) 1-2 capsules of Digestive Enzymes ( [MRM Digest-All](https://amzn.to/3jeeKJB)) If you experience digestive discomfort, supplementing with digestive enzymes can help reduce gas and bloating and aid in digestion of proteins, carbs (veggies) and fats. 1-2 capsules of Betaine Hcl with Pepsin ( [Doctor's Best](https://amzn.to/2OA9i5D)) If you experience sluggish digestion, you may benefit from taking an Hcl supplement with meals. Try Apple Cider Vinegar first, but if you need more help, Betaine can be a game changer! I take 1 capsule with my first bite of my meal, and another with the last few bites. 500 mg [Krill Oil](https://amzn.to/395dTGt) (for Omega 3's) - 1 soft gel, 2 x per day (1 with each of my 2 meals) 1,000 mg Vitamin C ( [Solaray](https://amzn.to/30sEwB1)) - 1 capsule, 2 x per day (1 with each of my 2 meals) 5,000 IU Vitamin d3 - 1 softgel, once per day 50 mg [Zinc Picolinate](https://amzn.to/2CK2782) - 1 capsule, once per day NIGHT-TIME / JUST BEFORE BED 325 mg Magnesium drink (Natural Vitality - My favorite is the raspberry lemonade - [Try this sample pack available on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2WxpUiC) to find your preferred flavor) PROTEIN POWDER I make it a point to get the majority of my protein requirement from clean, whole food sources (meat, fish, eggs, etc.) in my meals, and always recommend my clients aim to hit their protein macro through food before supplementing with shakes. Also, when getting fat-adapted, I recommend my clients remove all sweeteners (natural or artificial) or any sweet-tasting things (food and beverage) for at least the first week, to change their palate, as well as shift their mindset towards sweet treats and create real habit-change from day one. However, after becoming fat-adapted and learning to go to real food first, protein supplementation via a powder may be beneficial when on-the-go, pre- or post-training, or as a substitute for Standard American Diet (SAD) sweet treats or savory comfort foods. I have tried many different protein powders over the years - mostly plant-based as I do not handle whey or casein - and after trying almost everything out there, I finally found a brand that I stand behind 100% (so much so, that I became an ambassador for them!). [Wycked Naturals](https://wyckednaturals.com/natalie-grasso) (Everything you need, nothing you don't!) This is not your ordinary Plant-based Protein Powder... With absolutely no gums or fillers, no artificial anything- this unique blend of Pea Protein, Organic Pumpkin Seed, Organic Watermelon Seed, and Coconut Milk Powder makes for a super creamy and smooth Protein filled delicious drink. It mixes effortlessly and is also perfect for baking. Pink Himalayan Salt adds nutrient dense minerals (especially important on a Keto diet!) and it's sweetened with Stevia Leaf Extract and Monkfruit.

DAILY INTAKE OF ELECTROLYTES My \"Cheat sheet\" of levels to hit to ensure proper electrolyte balance - and how to get these amounts through whole foods and supplements, if necessary. Sodium: 5,000-7,000 mg p/day via a good mineral salt like pink himalayan sea salt or celtic sea salt spread throughout the day. Do NOT use regular table salt (iodized), as it has been stripped of the naturally occuring mineral content. Potassium: 3,500-4,700 mg p/day via spinach, avocado, broccoli, other leafy greens, salmon, steak, pork; it is recommended to get potassium from whole food sources, but if you must supplement to reach the daily recommended amount, you can add 1,00-1,500 mg of potassium chloride (\"No Salt\" or \"NuSalt\") to your water or use it to \"salt\" your food, along with sea salt. Magnesium: 300-500 mg p/day via raw spinach, avocado and a good magnesium supplement; I prefer to use [Ancient Minerals Magnesium oil](https://amzn.to/3jbIvL0) (spray it on your skin and rub in - absorbs quickly right into the bloodstream), taking Epsom salt baths, and drinking Natural Calm magnesium chloride in a glass of water (lemon raspberry is my favorite) as my nighttime drink. My favorite electrolyte powders to add to water and sip throughout the day: [LMNT Recharge](http://elementallabs.refr.cc/natalieg) - Arguably the best formulation and concentration of minerals on the market - much more sodium than others; salty flavor but you get used to it; great when mixed with lemon/lime or cucumber water! (And they just came out with a new LIMITED EDITION Grapefruit flavor!) [Ultima Replenisher ](https://amzn.to/392JlF4)- affordable; lots of flavors to choose from; not the best concentration of minerals, but very tasty; you can find them locally at Sprouts Farmers Market or Whole Foods, or on Amazon (Some flavors are only available on Amazon - here's a link to the [variety pack](https://amzn.to/392JlF4) on Amazon.)
