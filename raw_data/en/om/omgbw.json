How is it that we have come to rely so heavily on putting a sheet of artificially scented, chemical infused paper in our dryer every time we do the laundry? I did a little research and discovered that scented dryer sheets were an invention of the 1970's as a way to deliver fabric softeners more effectively. Today, we know that scented laundry products contain toxic chemicals and even known carcinogens - but that's not stopping anyone from selling them. YUCK! Don't you wish we had left the dryer sheets behind with the pet rocks and the purple shag carpeting? Why You Should Ditch Conventional Dryer Sheets Conventional dryer sheets start out with a polyester material that is non-biodegradable. The material is coated with fabric softening agents and other chemicals designed to make fabric feel softer, reduce static cling and add fragrance. Unfortunately [studies have linked chemicals used in dryer sheets and fabric softeners](http://www.national-toxic-encephalopathy-foundation.org/undisclosed.pdf) to endocrine system disruption, skin irritations, asthma and even cancer. Plus that \"dryer sheet\" scent that we know all too well, comes from a mix of chemicals that can cause allergies and hormone disruption. And you won't see an ingredient list on a dryer sheet box because companies are not required by law to disclose ingredients for cleaning products - so you have no idea what you are using! One more point - dryer sheets are wasteful! Why use a single-use product when a reusable alternative is even better?

[Full Disclosure](https://mindfulmomma.com/privacy-policy/) Fortunately, there are safer, natural, more eco-friendly ways to scent, soften & reduce static in your laundry if you so desire: Natural Ways to Soften Laundry: - Add 1/3 cup of salt or baking soda in with your detergent in the wash cycle. Both are natural water softeners. - Vinegar is also popular for softening laundry. About 1/2 cup in the fabric softener container should do the trick. - Soak a cotton cloth in your favorite [eco-friendly fabric softener](https://www.amazon.com/Ecover-Natural-Plant-based-Softener-Morning/dp/B00B97OGT4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1467144707&sr=8-1&keywords=ecover+fabric+softener&linkCode=sl1&tag=mindmomm099-20&linkId=58737063ce3170702b83591d211533be).
