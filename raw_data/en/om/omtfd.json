This policy basically addresses the need to know, support, incorporate, and implement experiences that havebeen developed in the public network of many municipalities and states, especially in the fields of Traditional Chinese Medicine - Acupuncture, Homeopathy, Phytotherapy, AnthroposophicalMedicine, and Hydrotherapy/Crenotherapy. Due to the absence of specific guidelines, the experiences conducted in the state and municipal public network have occurred in an unequal and discontinued manner and often without due registration,adequate supply of inputs, or follow-up and assessment actions. Based on the current experiences, this National Policy defines the approaches of the PNPIC at the SUS considering also the increasing legitimacy ofsuch experiences by society. A consequence of this process is the demand for its effective incorporation into the SUS, as demonstrated by the discussions at the National Health Conferences, the 1 st National Health Surveillance Conference in 2001, the 1st National Pharmaceutical Care Conference in 2003, which emphasized the needfor access to herbal and homeopathic medicines, and the 2 nd National Conference on Health Science, Technology, and Innovation, held in 2004. By acting in the fields of injury prevention and health promotion, maintenance, and recovery based on a humanized care modelcentered on the integrality of the individual, the PNIPIC contributes to strengthening the fundamental principles of the SUS. Accordingly, the development of this National Policy on Integrative and6PNPIC - National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices of the SUS Complementary Practices must be seen as another step forward in the SUS implementation process. By considering individuals in their entirety - without ignoring their individuality when explaining their disease development and health processes - the PNPIC contributes to the integrality of health care, a principle that also requires the integration of the actions andservices found at the SUS. Studies have demonstrated that such approaches help strengthen the joint responsibility of the individuals for their health, thus contributing to the exercise of citizenship. On the other hand, the implementation of the PNPIC at the SUS opens the possibility of access to services that were previously available only through private care, as part of the effort to expand the supply of health actions. Thus, the Ministry of Health's priority is the improvement of services and development of different approaches to provide the SUS users with preventive and therapeutic options. Therefore, this National Policy attempts to make this priority effective byproviding it with the required safety, effectiveness, and quality in furtherance of the integrality of health care in Brazil. Ministry of Health of Brazil7CHAPTER 1 - The process of developing the National Policy CHAPTER 1 THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THE NATIONAL POLICY The development of the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices at the SUS started with the implementation of guidelines and recommendations of different National Health Conferences and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. In June 2003, representatives of the National Associations of Phytotherapy, Homeopathy, Acupuncture, and Anthroposophical Medicine held a meeting with thethen Minister of Health, at which, at the request of the Minister himself, a workgroup was set up, coordinated by the Department of Primary Care/Health Care Secretrariat and by the Executive Secretariat, with the participation of representatives of the Science, Techology and Strategic Inputs Secretariat and the Health Work and EducationManagement Secretariat/MS; the National Health Inspection Agency (Anvisa); and Brazilian Associations of Phytotherapy, Homeopathy, Acupuncture, and Anthroposophical Medicine to discuss and implementactions towards the preparation of the National Policy. At a meeting held on September 24, 2003, the management group responsible for coordinating the works and drafting the National Policy determined, among other things, the creation of four work subgroups according to the various areas, due to the specificities ofeach of them. As a strategy to prepare the Policy, the management group designed an action plan to be adopted by the subgroups and to be subsequently consolidated into a single technical document of the National Policy. Each subgroup had power to adopt different strategies to prepare its action plan, and the Homeopathy, Phytotherapy, and Anthroposophical Medicine subgroups decided to hold nationwide8PNPIC - National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices of the SUS Forums with extensive participation of civil society organizations, in addition to technical meetings to systematize the action plan. The TCM/Acupuncture subgroup decided to hold technical meetingssupported by the documents produced by the WHO for that area, among others. During that process, it was necessary to conduct a situational diagnosis of the practices at the SUS, especially: insertion of these practices at the SUS, survey on the installed capacity, number andprofile of the professionals involved, training of human resources, quality of services, and others. Accordingly, the management group and the work subgroups had, at this initial stage, the collaboration of the following organizations, entities, and institutions: General coordination of the process of preparing the National Policy Executive Secretariat/MS.

Upon consolidation of the works of the subgroups and preparation of the Proposed National Policy on Natural Medicine and ComplementaryPractices, the document was submitted to the Technical Committees of the National Council of State and Municipal Secretaries of Health for consideration and agreed by the Tripartite Commission of Managers on February 17, 2005. The document was submitted at an ordinary meeting of the National Board of Health (CNS) and, upon recommendation of this Board, was submitted in September 2005 to the Health Surveillance andPharmacoepidemiology Commission for consideration and comments. After innumerable meetings among technicians of the Ministry of Health and that Commission, the Proposed Policy wasagain submitted to and approved by the National Board of Health in December 2005 with reservations to the content of the technical proposal for Traditional Chinese Medicine/Acupuncture and thename of the Policy. On that same date, the CNS recommended a revision of the text of the TCM/Acupuncture and the inclusion of the practice of Social Hydrotherapy/Crenotherapy - based on theresult of the report of the Water Group of the CNS. Thus, a subcommission appointed by the CNS was set up with the participation of representatives of the National Board of Health, technicians of the Ministry of Health, and external consultants in orderto discuss and prepare the final proposal to be evaluated by the CNS at a meeting scheduled for February 2006. In February 2006, the final policy document, as amended, was unanimously approved by the National Board of Health andconsolidated into the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices at the SUS, published in the form of Ministerial Rules No. 971 of May 3, 2006 and No. 1600 of July 17,2006.11CHAPTER 2 - TECHNICAL DOCUMENT OF THE NATIONAL POLICY ON INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES IN THE SUS (PNPIC) CHAPTER 2 TECHNICAL DOCUMENT OF THE NATIONAL POLICY ON INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES IN THE SUS (PNPIC) 2.1 INTRODUCTION The field of Integrative and Complementary Practices contemplates complex medical systems\u00b9 and therapeutic resources\u00b2, which are also denominated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Traditional and Complementary/Alternative Medicine (TM/CAM), (World Health Organization 2002a). Such systems and resources involve approaches which stimulate the natural mechanisms of injury prevention andrecovery of health through effective and safe technologies, with emphasis in the sheltering listening, in the development of therapeutic bond and in the integration of the human beingwith the environment and society. Other points shared by the several approaches included in this field are the broader vision of the health-disease process and the global promotion ofhuman care, especially self-care. In the end of the 70s, WHO created the Program of Traditional Medicine, aiming at the formulation of policies in the area. Ever since, in several official reports and resolutions, WHO \u00b9Understand Complex Medical Systems as the diagnosis and therapeutic approaches in the field of integrative and complementary practices with their own theories about the health/ disease process. LUZ.T.M, 2003 \u00b2Understand therapeutic resources as those instruments used in the different Complex Medical Systems.12PNPIC - National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices of the SUS expressed its commitment in motivating the state-members to formulate and to implement public policies for the rational and integrated use of TM/CAM in the national systems of healthattention, as well as for the development of scientific studies for better knowledge of safety, effectiveness and quality of TM/ CAM. The document \"Strategy of WHO on Traditional Medicine2002-2005\" reassures the development of those principles. In Brazil, the legitimating and institutionalization of those approaches of health attention started in the 80s, especially after the institution of SUS. With decentralization and popularparticipation, the states and municipalities had more autonomy in the definition of their policies and actions in health, coming to establish pioneering experiences. Some events and documents about the regulation and the attempts of construction of the policy are important to highlight: 1985 - agreement celebration among the National Institute for Medical Assistance and Social Security (Inamps), Fiocruz, the State University of Rio de Janeiro and the Brazilian Hahnemanian Institute, with the intention of institutionalizing the homeopathic assistance in the public health network; 1986 - the 8 th National Health Conference (NHC) also considered a hallmark for Integrative and Complementary Practices in the Brazilian Health System. NHC impelled by the Sanitary Reform, deliberated in its final report \"the introductionof alternative practices of health care in the extent of the health services, making possible to the user the democratic access of choosing their favorite therapeutics\"; 1988 - resolutions of the Planning and Coordination Interministerial Commission (Ciplan) number 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8/ 88, established rules and guidelines for the service in homeopathy, acupuncture, thermalism, alternative techniquesof mental health and phytotherapy;13CHAPTER 2 - TECHNICAL DOCUMENT OF THE NATIONAL POLICY ON INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES IN THE SUS (PNPIC) 1995 - the establishment of the Technical-Scientific Advisory Group in non-conventional medicines, by the administrative rule no. 2543/GM of December 14, 1995, published by the NationalSecretariat of Surveillance of the Ministry of Health; 1996 - the 10 th National Health Conference approved in its final report the \"incorporation to SUS, in the entire country, of health practices such as phytotherapy, acupuncture and homeopathy,contemplating alternative therapies and popular practices\"; 1999 - the inclusion of the medical homeopathy and acupuncture appointments in the template of procedures of SIA/SUS (administrative rule no 1230/GM from October, 1999); 2000 - the 11 th National Health Conference recommends \"to incorporate in primary care (Family Health Program and CommunityHealth Agent Program) non-conventional therapeutical practicessuch as acupuncture and homeopathy\"; 2001 - the 1 st National Conference of Sanitary Surveillance; 2003 - the constitution of a Work Group in the Ministry of Health with the objective of elaborating the National Policy of NaturalMedicine and Complementary Practices (PMNPC or just MNPC) inSUS (currently PNPIC); 2003 - Report of the 1 st National Conference of Pharmaceutical Assistance, which emphasized the importance of amplifying accessto herbal and homeopathic medicines in SUS 2003 - the final report of the 12 th National Health Conference deliberates for the effective inclusion of MNPC in SUS (currentlyIntegrative and Complementary Practices); 2004 - the 2 nd National Conference of Science and Technology Innovations in Health to MNPC (currently Integrative andComplementary Practices) that was included as strategic field ofresearch inside of the National Agenda of Research Priorities; 2005 - the Presidential Decree of February 17, 2005, which establishes the Work Group to prepare the National Policy of Medicinal Plants and Herbal Medicines; and,14PNPIC - National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices of the SUS 2005 - the final report of the Seminar \"Mineral Water in Brazil\", in October, which indicates the constitution of a pilot project of Social Thermalism in SUS. The Ministry of Health, in order to meet the need to know experiences that have been developed in the public network of many municipalities and states, adopted the strategy of conducting a National Diagnosis of the conceptions already contemplated atthe Unified Health System, especially those in the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine - Acupuncture, Homeopathy, Phytotherapy, and Anthroposophical Medicine, in addition tocomplementary health practices. The diagnosis was conducted by the Department of Primary Care within the Health Care Secretariat of the Ministry of Health, during the period from March to June 2004 by sending a questionnaireto all municipal and state health system managers, totaling 5,560. 1,340 questionnaires were returned, and the results of the situational diagnosis on integrative and complementary practices at the state and municipal health systems revealed the structureof some of these practices in 232 municipalities, including 19 state capitals, in 26 states altogether. Results were considered satisfactory in the calculation of statistical significance for anational diagnosis. 2.1.1 Traditional Chinese Medicine - Acupuncture The Traditional Chinese Medicine is characterized by anessential medical system, originated thousands of years agoin China. It uses language that portrays symbolically the laws of the nature and that it values the harmonic interrelation among the parts seeking integrality. Having Yin-Yang as thefundamental basis, the division of the world in two forces of fundamental principles, interpreting all phenomena in complementary opposites. The objective of this knowledge is15CHAPTER 2 - TECHNICAL DOCUMENT OF THE NATIONAL POLICY ON INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES IN THE SUS (PNPIC) to obtain means of balancing such duality. It also includes the theory of the five movements that attributes all thingsand phenomena in nature as well as in the body, one of thefive energies (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water). TheTraditional Chinese Medicine uses in its several treatmentmodalities (acupuncture, medicinal plants, diet therapy,corporal and mental practices), elements of anamnesis,palpation of the pulse, and the observation of the face andof the language. Acupuncture is a health intervention technology that approaches in an integral and dynamic way the health-diseaseprocess in the human being, and could be used alone or in anintegrated way with other therapeutic resources. Original ofthe Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), acupuncture comprisesa group of procedures which allows the necessary stimulus ofspecific anatomical places through the insertion of threadlikemetallic needles for the promotion, maintenance and recoveryof health, as well as for the prevention of injuries and diseases. Archeological findings allow us to suppose that this knowledge source remounts from at least 3,000 years. The Chinesedenomination zhen jiu, which means needle (zhen) and heat(jiu) was adapted in the reports brought by the Jesuits in the17 th century, resulting in the word acupuncture (derived from the Latin words acus, needle and punctio, puncture). Thetherapeutic effect of the stimulation of neuroreactive areasor \"acupuncture points\" was first described and explained ina language of time, symbolic and analogical, consonant withthe Chinese classic philosophy. In the western societies, starting from the second half of the 20 th century, acupuncture was assimilated by the contemporary medicine, and thanks to the scientific researches undertakenat several countries both eastern and western, their therapeutic effects were recognized and they have been explained gradually in scientific works published in respected scientific magazines.It is now admitted that the stimulation of acupuncture points16PNPIC - National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices of the SUS provokes the release, in the Central Nervous System, of neurotransmitters and other substances responsible for theresponses of pain relieve promotion, restoration of organic functions and immunity modulation. WHO recommends acupuncture to their state-members, producing several publications about its effectiveness andsafety, professional training, as well as research methods and evaluation of the therapeutic results of the complementary and traditional medicines. The consensus ofthe United States National Health Institute attests the indication of acupuncture whether used alone or as a supporting procedure in several diseases and health injuries,such as postoperative dental pain, adult post-chemotherapy or surgery nauseas and vomits, chemical dependence, rehabilitation after cerebral vascular injury, dysmenorrheal,migraine, epicondylitis, fibromialgy, miofascial pain, osteo- arthritis, back pain, and asthma, among others. TCM includes also corporal practices (lian gong, chi gong, tui- na, tai-chi-chuan); mental practices (meditation); dietorientation; and the use of medicinal plants (Traditional Chinese Phytotherapy), related to the prevention of injuries and diseases, health promotion and recovery. In Brazil, acupuncture was introduced about 40 years ago. In 1988, through the Resolution no. 5/88 of the Planning and Coordination Interministerial Commission (Ciplan), acupuncture had their norms established for the service in the public healthservice. Several Health Professional Councils recognize acupuncture as a specialty in our country, and training courses are available in several states. In 1999, the Ministry of Health placed in the Ambulatory Information System (SIA/SUS) template of Unified Health System the medical consultation in acupuncture (code17CHAPTER 2 - TECHNICAL DOCUMENT OF THE NATIONAL POLICY ON INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES IN THE SUS (PNPIC) 0701234), that allowed the evolution attendance of the consultations by area and in the entire country. The data from SIA/SUS demonstrate a growth of acupuncture medicalconsultations in all regions. In 2003, there were 181,983 consultations, with a lager concentration of acupuncture doctors in the Southeast region (213 out of 376 doctorsregistered in the system). According to the insert diagnosis of MNPC in the services rendered by SUS and the data of SIA/SUS, it is verified that acupuncture is present in 19 states, distributed in 107municipalities and 17 capitals. As explained before, it is necessary to rethink, in the light of the attention model proposed by the Ministry of Health, the insertion of such practice in SUS, considering the need ofcapillarity increase to assure the principle of universality. 2.1.2 Homeopathy Homoeopathy, a complex medical system bases on holisticand vital principle and in the use of the natural law of healingwas enunciated by Hippocrates in the 6 th century b.C. It was developed by Samuel Hahnemann in the 18th century. After studies and reflections based on clinical observation and inexperiments accomplished at the time, Hahnemann systematized the philosophical principles and doctrinaire of homeopathy in his works Organon of the Art of Healing andChronic Diseases. Since then, this medical thinking has experienced great expansion in different places of the world, and today it is firmly established at several countries of Europe,America and Asia. In Brazil, homeopathy was introduced by Benoit Mure in 1840, and has become a new treatment option. In 1979, the Brazilian Homeopathic Medical Association (AMHB) was founded. In 1980, homeopathy was recognizedas a medical specialty by the Federal Council of Medicine18PNPIC - National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices of the SUS (Resolution no. 1000). In 1990, the Brazilian Association of Homeopathic Pharmaceuticals (ABFH) was created. In 1992, it is recognized as a pharmaceutical specialty by the FederalCouncil of Pharmacy (Resolution no. 232). In 1993, the Brazilian Veterinary Homeopathic Association (AMVHB) was created. Finally in 2000, homeopathy was recognized as aspecialty by the Federal Council of Veterinary Medicine (Resolution no. 622). In the 1980s, some Brazilian states and municipalities started to offer homeopathic services as a medical specialty to theusers of public health services, but as isolated initiatives and, sometimes discontinued because of the absence of a national policy. In 1988, with the Resolution no. 4/88, CIPLANestablished rules for the service in Homeopathy in the public health services and, in 1999, the Ministry of Health places in the SIA/SUS template the medical consultation in homeopathy. With the establishment of SUS and the decentralization of the management, the homeopathy service increased. Such progress can be observed in the number of homeopathy consultations that, since its placement as a procedure in theSIA/SUS template, is showing an annual growth around 10%. In 2003, the SUS information system and the diagnosis data done by the Ministry of Health in 2004 showed thathomeopathy is present in the public health network in 20 states, 16 capitals, 158 municipalities, counting with 457 homeopathy medical professionals registered. Homeopathy is present in at least 10 public universities, in teaching, research or attention activities, and counts with courses for training Homeopathy specialist in 12 states. It also counts with training of Homeopathy Doctors approved by theNational Commission of Medical Residence. Despite an increase of the services offered, the pharmaceutical attention in homeopathy does not follow this tendency. According to a survey done in 2000 by AMHB, only 30% of19CHAPTER 2 - TECHNICAL DOCUMENT OF THE NATIONAL POLICY ON INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES IN THE SUS (PNPIC) the homeopathy services of the SUS network supplied homeopathic medicines. The survey data done by the Ministryof Health in 2004, revealed that only 9.6% of the municipalities which informed having homeopathy services had Public Manipulation Pharmacies. The implementation of homoeopathy in the SUS, represents an important strategy to improve health attention: Has a person as a center of the attention, considering the physical, psychological, social and cultural dimensions. In homeopathy, illness is the expression of the harmony ruptureof those different dimensions. In that way, homoeopathy conception contributes to the empowerment of the integrality of the health attention. It strengthens the doctor-patient relationship as one of the therapeutics fundamental elements, promoting the humanization of the attention, stimulating self-care and the individual autonomy. It acts in several clinical situations of illness as, for instance, in non-transmissible chronic diseases, in breathing and allergic diseases, and in psychosomatic disorders, reducing the demand for hospital and emergency interventions, thuscontributing for the improvement of the user's quality of life. It contributes for the rational use of medicines, reducing drug-dependence. In 2004, with the objective of establishing participative process in the debate of the general guidelines for homeopathy practices, which served as subvention to the formulation ofthe actual National Policy, the Ministry of Health carried out the 1 st National Forum of Homeopathy entitled \"The homeopathy we want to implement in SUS\". This forum gathered professionals, Municipal and State Health Secretariats, Public Universities, Association of Homeopathy Users, a national homeopathy representative entity; the20PNPIC - National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices of the SUS National Council of Municipal Health Secretariat (Conasems); the Federal Council of Pharmacy and of Medicine, theInternational Homeopathy Medical League (LMHI) - an international homeopathy medical organization, and representatives of the Ministry of Health and of the NationalAgency of Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA). 2.1.3 Medicinal Plants And Phytotherapy Phytotherapy is a \"therapeutic process characterized by theuse of medicinal plants in their different pharmaceutical forms,without the use of isolated active substances, although of vegetable origin\". The use of medicinal plants in the art of healing is an ancient form of treatment, related to the originsof the medicine and based in the accumulation of information by successive generations. Along the centuries, products of vegetable origins constituted the basis for treatment of differentdiseases. Since the Declaration of Alma-Ata in 1978, WHO has been stating its position regarding the need of valuing the use of medicinal plants in the sanitary scope, knowing that 80% ofthe world population use those plants on preparations in what refers to the primary health attention. Besides that, it stands out the participation of developing countries in such process,since they have 67% of the world's vegetable species. Brazil possesses great potential for the development of such therapeutics, as the country with the largest vegetable diversity in the world, wide social diversity, the use of medicinal plantslinked to the traditional knowledge and technology to scientifically validate such knowledge. The popular and institutional interest is growing in the sense of strengthening phytotherapy in SUS. Starting from the decadeof 1980s, several documents were elaborated, emphasizing the introduction of medicinal plants and herbal medicines in the21CHAPTER 2 - TECHNICAL DOCUMENT OF THE NATIONAL POLICY ON INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES IN THE SUS (PNPIC) public system basic attention, among which stands out: The Ciplan resolution no 8/88, which regulates the implantation of phytotherapy in the health services and creates procedures and routines related to its practice in the medicalunits; The Report of the 10 th National Health Conference, held in 1996, which states in the item 286.12: \"to incorporate in SUS,through the entire country, the practices of health such asphytotherapy, acupuncture and homeopathy, contemplating the alternative therapies and popular practices\" and in the item 351,10: \"the Ministry of Health should stimulate phytotherapyuse in the public pharmaceutical assistance and elaborate norms for its use, thoroughly discussed with health professionals and specialists, in cities where larger popular participation is a realityand with more engaged managers to the issue of citizenship and popular movements\"; The Administrative Rule no. 3816/98, which approved the National Medicine Policy, which establishes in the scope of its guidelines for scientific and technological development: \"... it should be continued and expanded the support to research that seek the use of the therapeutic potential of our flora andnational fauna, emphasizing the certification of their medicinal potential\"; The report of the National Seminar of Medicinal Plants, Herbal Medicines and Pharmaceutical Assistance, held in 2003, which among its recommendations states: \"to integrate in the Unified Health System the use of medicinal plants and herbal medicines\"; The report of the 12 th National Health conference held in 2003, which points out the need of \"investing in research and technology development for the production of homeopathic medicines and medicines from the Brazilian flora, favoring thenational production and the implantation of programs for the use of homeopathic medicines in the health services, in22PNPIC - National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices of the SUS accordance with the recommendations of the 1st National Medicine and Pharmaceutical Assistance\". The Resolution no 338/04 from the National Health Council which approves the National Policy of Pharmaceutical Assistance, that contemplates in its strategic axes, the \"definition and agreement of intersectorial actions which intends the use of the medicinal plants and herbal medicine inthe process of health attention, respecting the traditional knowledge incorporated with scientific rationale, adopting policies of generation of work and income, with training andestablishment of procedures, involving the health professionals in the process of incorporation of this therapeutic option and based on the incentive to the national production, with theuse of the existent biodiversity in the country\"; 2005 - The Presidential Decree of February 17, 2005 establishes the Work Groups for the elaboration of the NationalPolicy of Medicinal Plants and Herbal medicines. Nowadays, there are state and municipal programs of phytotherapy, from those with therapeutic memento andspecific regulation for the service, implemented more than 10 years ago, to those recently started or with pretension of implantation. In a survey done by the Ministry of Health in 2004,it was verified that in all Brazilian municipalities phytotherapy is present in 116 municipalities, contemplating 22 states. In the Federal scope its worth mentioning that the Ministry of Health accomplished in 2001, the Forum for formulation of a National Policy of Medicinal Plants and Herbal Medicinesproposal, where different segments participated and, taking into account especially the inter sectoriality involved in the productive chain of medicinal plants and herbal medicines. In2003, the Ministry of Health promoted the National Seminary of Medicinal Plants, Herbal Medicines and Pharmaceutical Assistance. Both initiatives had important contributions for the23CHAPTER 2 - TECHNICAL DOCUMENT OF THE NATIONAL POLICY ON INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES IN THE SUS (PNPIC) formulation of this National Policy, as the structuring of a stage for the elaboration of the National Policy of Medicinal Plantsand Herbal medicines. 2.1.4 Social Thermalism/Crenotherapy The use of mineral water in the treatment of health is a veryancient procedure, used from the time of the Greek Empire.It was described by Herodotus (450 B.C.), the author of the first scientific publication on thermalism. Thermalism constitutes the different ways of mineral water use and its application in health treatments. Crenotherapy consists of the prescription and use of mineral water with therapeutic purposes in a complementary way to other health treatments. In Brazil, crenotherapy was introduced with the Portuguese colonization, which brought to the country the habits of usingmineral water for health treatment. For some decades it was considered a valuable and highly respected discipline present in medical schools such UFMG and UFRJ. After the end of theSecond World War, this field of study suffered considerable reduction of its scientific production and popularization with the changes in the field of medicine and of the social healthproduction as a whole. Starting from the decade of 1990s, the Thermal Medicine started to be dedicated to collective approaches, as much of prevention as of promotion and recovery of health, insertingin this context the concept of Health Tourism and Social Thermalism, whose main objective is the search and the maintenance of health. European countries like Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Hungary, among others, adopt Social Thermalism since the beginning of the 20 th century, as a way of presenting to senior people24PNPIC - National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices of the SUS treatments in specialized thermal establishments, aiming to provide that population the access to the use of the mineral water with medicinal properties, to health recovery as wellas health maintenance.

Along with the medical work, other specific actions are performed by other professionals according totheir specificities. The activity of doctors in this system is not much different from conventional practice, which is why Anthroposophical Medicine may be considered an extensionof medical practice. Steps such as anamnesis, physical examination, and request for additional examinations, when69GLOSSARY necessary, are similar. In the next step, in addition to conventional diagnosis, the anthroposophical doctor alsoperforms a complementary diagnosis based on the body of knowledge involved in anthroposophical world view. Programs for health professionals have a common corecurriculum of two years. Thereafter, each area continues separately with specific training, which lasts additional two or three years. Non-drug therapeutic options in AM: health team professionals (nurses, psychologists, masseurs, art therapists, and others) work in an integrated manner with doctors and dentists, applying other therapeutic options when advisable. a) External applications: comprise the use of hot-footbath, bandaging, compresses, and poultices based on teas, oils, and herbal ointments. They may be performed by all health team professionals. Somemodalities are folk medicine techniques and may be incorporated by users and community. b) Therapeutic baths: are performed by diluting oils of medicinal plants in the immersion water. They areperformed by the nursing team based on medical prescription and comprise some specific techniques. c) Rhythmic massage: is inspired by Swedish massage and believes the human organism is filled with vitality,which is generally altered in pathologic states. Through specific strokes (effleurage, petrissage, and friction, double circle, and infinity symbol), it is possible tobalance such vitality by acting on the aqueous, aerial, gaseous, and solid portions of the organism. It is performed by higher-level professionals specificallytrained by the Rhythmic Massage School of Brazil. d) Art therapy: is indicated both as a hygienic and preventive activity and for the treatment of various organic and psychological disorders.

Based on the questionnaires returned, the statistical validity of the sample size calculation was verified for the continuation of the works. 3.3 RESULTS Out of the 5,560 questionnaires sent, 1,342 were returned, 232of which presented positive results and revealed theimplementation of some integrative and/or complementary practice in 26 states, including 19 state capitals, and this sample was considered satisfactory in the statistical significancecalculation for a national diagnosis. After the questionnaire was sent, when reviewing the results, problems were noted in the working of questions 3/4/6/7. The results of these questions will be presented considering theselimitations in the analysis. Some of the practices were found to exist in 26 Brazilian states, especially in the Southeastern states (Graph 01). The results also revealed that complementary practices are predominant in termsof frequency, followed by Phytotherapy, Homeopathy, and Acupuncture (Graph 02). Reiki and Lian Gong stand out among the complementary practices (Graph 03). Only 6% of the total has a State or Municipal institutionalLaw or Act creating some type of service related to Integrative and Complementary Practices (Graph 04). It was also found that actions are preferably inserted in Primary Care - Family Health in all practices contemplated (Graphs 05 to10).77CHAPTER 3 - SITUATIONAL DIAGNOSIS OF INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES AT THE SUS With regard to training of the professionals, most activities are performed in the very health services, followed by training at other educational centers (Graph 11). Among the main material resources used, the following were listed for TCM/Acupuncture: Needles and Moxa; for Homeopathy: therapeutic handbook, and for Anthroposophical Medicine: homeopathic medicine, herbal medicine (Graph 12). With regard to the supply of inputs by a public pharmacy, it was found that only 9.6% of the homeopathic medicines are distributed through a public pharmacy (Graph 13). Conversely, for Phytotherapy, in 35.5% of the cases herbal medicines are distributed through apublic pharmacy (Graph 14). The law requiring the presence of a professional pharmacist at pharmacies has still not been complied with (Graph 15).

A consequence of this process is the demand for its effective incorporation into the SUS, as demonstrated by the discussions atthe National Health Conferences, the 1 st National Pharmaceutical Care Conference in 2003, which emphasized the need for access toherbal and homeopathic medicines, and the 2 nd National Conference on Health Science, Technology, and Innovation, held in 2004. Thus, the survey on the insertion confirms that the development of the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices at the SUS must be understood as a continuation of the process of implementation of the SUS, as it effectively promotes the applicationof the principles and guidelines governing the System. By considering individuals in their entirety - without ignoring their individuality when explaining their disease development and health processes - theMNPC contributes to the integrality of health care, a principle that also requires the integration of the actions and services found at the SUS. On the other hand, the implementation of Integrative and Complementary Practices at the SUS opens the possibility of accessto services that were previously available only through private care, as part of the effort to reduce regional differences in the supply of health actions. Studies have demonstrated that such approaches help strengthen the joint responsibility of the individuals for their health, thuscontributing to the exercise of citizenship. Thus, the Ministry of Health's priority is the improvement of services and development of different approaches to provide the SUS users with preventive and therapeutic options.86PNPIC - National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices of the SUS ANNEX I Situational Diagnosis of Actions and Services related to Natural Medicine and Complementary Practices found at the SUS This questionnaire is intended to collect important information for the preparation of the National Policy on Natural Medicine and Complementary Practices (MNPC) atthe SUS, currently including Homeopathy, Phytotherapy, Acupuncture, and Anthroposophical Medicine and Complementary Practices.
