Our multidisciplinary team has extensive experience in caring for children with stomach problems and we treat a wide range of conditions. What we do We are one of the few hospitals in London to provide a specialist gastroenterology service for children. Our multidisciplinary team has extensive experience in caring for children with stomach problems and we treat a wide range of conditions including: - Intestinal failure (when a portion of the small intestine is not present or does not function normally) resulting in the need for long term intravenous nutrition - Motility disorders (abnormal intestinal contractions) - Chronic inflammatory bowel disease - Gastro-oesophageal reflux - Allergic oesophagitis (allergic condition of the oesophagus) - Coeliac disease We carry out a variety of different diagnostic investigations and procedures including endoscopies (gastroscopy and colonoscopy), speech and language assessments, hydrogen breath tests, tube weaning, video fluoroscopy, and PH and impedance studies (to check for acid and non-acid reflux). We also run several weekly and monthly clinics for general gastroenterology, inflammatory bowel disease, motility and intestinal failure. We work closely with our paediatric surgical colleagues offering joint management of complex gastrointestinal disorders and, together, provide a therapeutic endoscopy service.
