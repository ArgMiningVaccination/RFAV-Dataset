This can be important to remember when you have a cough, because often you don't want to totally suppress it. You do want to make it easier on your body when the cough is never-ending, but you still want to be able to cough, allowing your body to get rid of the mucus buildup. In order to relieve some of the discomfort associated with a cough while not eliminating the cough completely, consider making your own cough medicine at home.

Add 3-4 tablespoons (44-59 mL) of freshly squeezed lemon juice to the warm honey. Add 14 to 13 cup (59 to 79 mL) of water to the honey-lemon mixture and stir while continuing to heat on low. Refrigerate the mixture. When you need the cough medicine, take 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) as needed. - Medicinal honey, such as [Manuka honey](/Eat-Manuka-Honey)from New Zealand, is recommended, but any organic honey will do.

Cut a washed, whole lemon into thin slices (along with the skin and the seeds). Add the slices to 1 cup (240 mL) of honey. Heat over low heat for 10 minutes with constant stirring. Advertisement - Break up the lemon slices as you stir. - Once you're finished cooking, strain the mixture to get the leftover lemon slices out. Store the mixture in the refrigerator. - 3Consider adding garlic to the honey and lemon cough medicine. Peel 2-3 cloves of garlic and chop them as finely as possible. Add it to the honey-lemon mixture before you add water. Heat the mixture on a low flame for about 10 minutes. Then add 14 to 13 cup (59 to 79 mL) of water to the honey-lemon mixture and stir it in while heating the mixture over the low flame.

Assessing Your Cough [Download Article](#) - 1Understand the possible causes of a cough. The most common causes for acute coughs are the common cold, influenza (better known as the flu), pneumonia (an infection in the lung(s) by bacteria, viruses, or fungi), chemical irritants, and whooping cough (also known as pertussis, a highly contagious bacterial lung infection).The most common causes of chronic coughs are allergic reactions, asthma, bronchitis (an inflammation of the bronchi or air tubes in the lungs), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and post-nasal drip (when mucus drips into the throat from the sinuses, causing irritation with a reflex cough). - There are other, less common causes of cough, including other lung disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. [[14]](#_note-14)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Coughs can also be due to side effects of medication. This is particularly the case with a class of blood pressure medications known as ACE inhibitors. [[15]](#_note-15)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - A cough may be the side effect of other infections and illnesses, including a coronavirus infection, cystic fibrosis, chronic and acute sinusitis, congestive heart failure, and tuberculosis. - There are other, less common causes of cough, including other lung disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. - 2Decide whether you should see a doctor for your cough. Try home remedies for 1-2 weeks. For most coughs, these should provide enough relief for you to recover. If there is no improvement after 1-2 weeks, however, make an appointment with your physician for a full diagnosis and to determine your best course of action. [[16]](#_note-16)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Also, make an appointment with your physician if during that 1-2 weeks you experience any fever of more than 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) for more than 24 hours, coughing up greenish-yellow thick discharge (this can indicate a serious bacterial pneumonia), coughing up mucus with streaks of reddish or pinkish blood, vomiting (particularly if the vomit looks like coffee grounds\u2014this may indicate a bleeding ulcer), difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, wheezing, or feeling short of breath. - 3Assess whether a child needs to go to the doctor for a cough. There are some illnesses that can incapacitate children more quickly and some illnesses that children are especially prone to get. Because of this, you need to assess their coughs differently. With children, call your physician immediately if they experience any of the following: [[17]](#_note-17)X Research source - Any fever over 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). - A barking type of cough\u2014this may be croup, a viral infection of the larynx (voice box) and trachea (windpipe). Some children may also experience stridor, which is a high-pitched whistling or gasping sound. If you hear either of these types of sounds, call your physician right away. - A wheezy, gurgling type of cough that may sound raspy or whistling. This could be bronchiolitis, potentially caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSC). - A whooping sound when your child inhales, which is likely whooping cough. - 4Decide whether a cough needs treatment. Remember that coughing is the body's natural way of getting rid of bacteria, viruses, or fungus-filled mucus, and that is a good goal! However, if your or your child's cough is not allowing you to rest or sleep, or is causing any difficulty in breathing, it is time to treat that cough. You need adequate rest and sleep when you have a cough, so that is where remedies can be useful. - You can use many home remedies as much and as often as you want. They will also help keep you hydrated, which is very important as your immune system and body recovers.
