It is now used in cancer therapy support.4 Researchers believe not only is the large antioxidant capabilities of triphala playing a role in managing the body's ability to heal itself from oxidative damage, it also may inhibit angiogenesis required by neoplasms.5 It is currently thought that the chebulinic acid concentrated in Triphala extracts is responsible for this action. Additionally, its traditional use for dental health has been repeatedly put to the test. One randomized trial of 90 individuals using triphala powder as a mouthwash found those using the powder to have decreased gingival symptoms from baseline and was equal in efficacy to chlorhexidine.6 A randomized double-blind trial of 57 children also found similar effects. 7 As mentioned earlier, Triphala is considered one of the greatest all-around digestive support supplements available, and science is catching up to understanding why Triphala deserves this claim to fame. It is currently held that much of its effect come from the synergy of its antioxidants and phytochemicals including ascorbic acid, the flavonoids luteolin, rutin, and quercetin, as well as the activity of phenolic acids including gallic acid, chebulic acid, and ellagic acid.8 The overall antioxidant capacity serves to protect the digestive system from the normal high-oxidative processes that often, when imbalanced, cause a host of digestive concerns. Interestingly, another theory into Triphala's ability to aid the digestive tract is through the interaction of quercetin, gallic acid, and chebulinic acid and their ability to modulate the intestinal flora to promote the growth of beneficial microbes. This is accomplished by being bactericidal to E. coli and other undesirable species, while the phenolic acids are readily metabolized by Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species into metabolites that promote their growth.9 This unique mechanism might explain Triphala's far-reaching digestive uses given how conclusive the research is regarding the human microbiome and its role in overall digestive health and function. Finally, Triphala's traditional use for reflux has also been examined and in this instance, one of Triphala's ingredients was singled out. In a double-blind clinical trial of 68 patients with heartburn, Amla was found to reduce symptoms of heartburn in 50% of patients while placebo reduced symptoms by only 17%.10 An ancient formulation that has stood the test of time, Triphala is a safe and extremely useful herbal combination that truly deserves its accolades, which are simply too numerous to list. As modern science continues to both unravel its mechanisms of action as well as test its efficacy in well-designed human trials, it is likely that this supplement will be around, supporting human health, for millennia to come, just as it always has. - Peterson, C.
