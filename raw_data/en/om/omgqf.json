Here are 13 osteoarthritis treatments that don't rely on medication or surgery to provide relief. Natural Treatment for Arthritis Osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, is a biomechanical and physiological disease. The cartilage that provides a buffer between bones breaks down and wears away, allowing the bones to rub and grind against each other, according to the [American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/osteoarthritis). While many view osteoarthritis as a disease of the elderly, this is entirely inaccurate. Three out of five arthritis patients are younger than 65. Osteoarthritis can result from overuse of joints, and is often a consequence of demanding sports, obesity, or [aging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818253/). If you were an athlete or dancer in your younger years and wonder why your knee or hip aches when you climb out of bed in the morning, ask your doctor about osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is common in weight-bearing joints \u2014 the knees, hips, feet, and spine \u2014 and comes on gradually over months or years. Except for the pain in the joints, it does not cause you to feel sick or have fatigue, as other types of inflammatory arthritis do. With osteoarthritis, you may feel fine except for a few minutes of stiffness on arising in the morning or stiffness after sitting. Other [symptoms of osteoarthritis](/osteoarthritis/guide/symptoms/) include: [Deep, aching pain in the joint](https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/pdf/MedlinePlusWinter2013_web.pdf) - Difficulty dressing or combing hair - Difficulty gripping objects - Difficulty sitting or bending over - Fatigue - Joint is warm to touch - Morning stiffness - Pain when walking - Stiffness after resting [Swelling of the joint](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoarthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351925) Are you at risk for osteoarthritis? Check out the following risk factors: - Abnormal joint positions - Age (risk increases with age) - Athletics (wear and tear and injuries) - Changing forces (putting weight on one knee or hip) [Gender (osteoarthritis is more common in women)](https://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health/joint-pain-and-women.aspx) - Heavy, constant joint use - Injury - Joint injury by other types of arthritis - Knee surgery - Lack of exercise (weak muscles give no support to aging joints) [Being overweight](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29079909) Osteoarthritis is diagnosed using blood tests that eliminate other more serious inflammatory types of arthritis and other medical problems. A sample of the joint fluid may show the typical changes of osteoarthritis. Usually by the time a patient gets [treatment for osteoarthritis](/osteoarthritis/treatment-symptom-management/), there are visible changes on an [X-ray](/x-ray/guide/) of the joint. A narrowing of the cartilage may show on the X-ray but no destruction as with [inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis](/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms/rheumatoid-arthritis-progression/). There are a few drugs that can help with osteoarthritis treatment, as well as surgical treatment for osteoarthritis for people in extreme pain. But the following natural treatment for arthritis may help ease your pain, too. Remember to consult with your doctor first before taking over-the-counter (OTC) natural supplements for osteoarthritis. Additional reporting by [Madeline Vann, MPH](/authors/madeline-r-vann/) Exercise Is a Natural Treatment for Arthritis Gentle weight training plus [aerobic](/fitness/workouts/why-you-need-aerobic-exercise.aspx) [exercise](//www.everydayhealth.com/hs/osteoarthritis/exercises-help-manage-knee-pain/) is a great combination natural treatment for arthritis that can strengthen the muscles around the affected joint, providing it with greater support and helping it stay healthy. \"Cartilage is like a sponge that needs exercise to bring nutrients into it to keep it healthy,\" says [Gurjit S. Kaeley, MD](https://hscj.ufl.edu/directory/bio/1438/gurjit-kaeley/), professor of medicine and chief of the division of rheumatology and clinical immunology at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Jacksonville. Is Weight Loss a Treatment for Osteoarthritis? If you're overweight, you're putting a tremendous amount of pressure, stress, and strain on knees and hips, worsening your osteoarthritis pain. The ACR guidelines emphasize losing weight as a treatment for osteoarthritis. \"Weight control in those who are overweight is one thing you can do to improve symptoms and perhaps even slow progression,\" says [Roy Altman, MD](https://www.uclahealth.org/rheumatology/roy-altman), a [rheumatologist](/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/how-to-choose-rheumatologist/) with UCLA Health and professor emeritus at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA in Los Angeles. \"Even modest amounts of weight loss \u2014 10 to 20 pounds \u2014 are often of benefit,\" says Dr. Altman. Aim to eat a balanced diet, count calories, and exercise regularly. Ice or Heat Therapies Are Common Osteoarthritis Treatments Lots of people swear by thermotherapy, a natural treatment for arthritis that uses [heat or cold](//www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/hot-and-cold-therapy/) to relieve osteoarthritis pain. \"When acute pain occurs, icing may help,\" Kaeley says. \" [For chronic pain, many patients report relief with moist heat](https://www.everydayhealth.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/treatment/hot-and-cold-therapy/) as well as topical OTC anti-inflammatory creams.\" The ACR suggests asking your medical team when and [how to best use hot and cold remedies](https://www.everydayhealth.com/pain-management/using-cold-and-heat.aspx). Consider Supplements for a Natural Treatment of Arthritis The combination of [glucosamine](/drugs/glucosamine) and chondroitin may help with osteoarthritis treatment. While the ACR in general doesn't recommend the use of either [supplement](/arthritis-pictures/8-supplements-for-arthritis-pain.aspx) alone, some studies have found that the combination can lead to some improvement of symptoms. In a [study published in April 2016 in the journal Aging Clinical and Experimental Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26178634), taking glucosamine and chondroitin for 12 weeks or longer appeared to give participants more ease of movement. And according to a [study published in May 2015 in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24395557), taking the combination over the course of a year led to less joint pain, and taking it for two years led to less joint space narrowing than a placebo. Early evidence has shown that the natural vegetable extract called [avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASU)](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/complementary-therapies/supplements-and-vitamins/supplement-and-herb-guide-for-arthritis-symptoms) could be an effective osteoarthritis treatment that might even slow progression of the disease and reduce dependence on narcotic drugs, according to a research [review published in January 2015 in the journal Cartilage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25621100). How to Treat Osteoarthritis With Anti-Inflammatory Foods Research has identified a number of [foods that can reduce inflammation and swelling](//www.everydayhealth.com/arthritis/diet/diet-tricks-arthritis-symptom-relief/) \u2014 the cause of much of the pain associated with osteoarthritis. Omega-3 fatty acids appear to play a role in controlling inflammation and improving wound and joint healing, which might slow the progression of osteoarthritis, according to [research published in November 2015 in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015373). The Arthritis Foundation states that following a diet similar to [the Mediterranean diet](/mediterranean-diet/guide/), which emphasizes plenty of vegetables, whole grains, fish, and healthy fats, could help reduce inflammation and be a treatment for osteoarthritis. Turn to Acupuncture for Relief of Osteoarthritis The ancient Chinese practice of [acupuncture](https://www.everydayhealth.com/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/) may be treatment for osteoarthritis. It involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body to [relieve pain](/hs/rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-management/change-treatment/), explains the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture-in-depth). Research into [acupuncture](/alternative-health/what-is-acupuncture-a-beginners-guide-to-how-it-works-and-how-it-may-improve-your-health/) is still ongoing, with some studies showing that [acupuncture is better for osteoarthritis treatment](https://www.everydayhealth.com/osteoarthritis/treatment-symptom-management/) than doing nothing, but perhaps not as good as other options. \"It's been difficult to evaluate acupuncture, but there is a consensus now that acupuncture may be of value,\" says Altman. How to Treat Osteoarthritis With Massage Therapy One hour of [massage](//www.everydayhealth.com/conditions/massages-for-arthritis-pain/) each week for at least eight weeks has been shown to be a treatment for osteoarthritis and relieve arthritis pain and stiffness as well as increase mobility, according to data from an [article published in June 2015 in The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25966332). Muscles that spasm around the joints in [osteoarthritis can be soothed using massage therapy](https://www.everydayhealth.com/osteoarthritis/massage-therapy-for-osteoarthritis.aspx), Altman says. The massage therapist lightly strokes or kneads the [sore muscles](/fitness/quick-fixes-for-sore-muscles.aspx), which can stimulate blood flow and make a stressed area become more warm and relaxed. Be sure to see only massage therapists who have experience treating [people with osteoarthritis](/osteoarthritis/guide/), because arthritic joints are very sensitive and must be handled with care. Ask your doctor for a referral for this natural treatment for arthritis. The Right Spa Is an Effective Osteoarthritis Treatment It may seem a bit frivolous, but going to the right spa has been shown to be an effective osteoarthritis treatment, according to a research [review published in August 2015 in the International Journal of Biometeorology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25339582). The researchers report that hydrotherapy, which involves soaking in very warm water or water containing minerals, can help relieve joint pain. Sulfur-rich mud baths are also a known [natural remedy for arthritis symptoms](//www.everydayhealth.com/arthritis/treatment/natural-ways-ease-arthritis-pain/). But the mechanisms by which spa therapy works as treatment for osteoarthritis are not entirely clear. Orthotics Help Relieve Osteoarthritis Pain Mechanical [devices called orthotics can be used as treatment for osteoarthritis](https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/osteoarthritis/knee-osteoarthritis-assistive-devices/) by supporting and protecting arthritic joints and [relieving osteoarthritis pain](//www.everydayhealth.com/news/strategies-relieve-arthritis-pain-from-those-who-know/), according to the ACR. A brace placed on an inflamed joint can provide pain relief by supporting the joint and relieving some of the stress caused by body weight or daily use. Braces can also help realign joints that are being distorted by arthritis. [Shoes](//www.everydayhealth.com/psoriatic-arthritis/treatment/psoriatic-arthritis-shoe-tips/) are another form of orthotics that are used in osteoarthritis treatment; soles that absorb some of the shock of walking can be very beneficial. Altman notes that one of the most common orthotics \u2014 a cane \u2014 is often used incorrectly. He suggests getting properly measured for the correct length of cane for your height and learning how to use it to your best advantage. How to Treat Osteoarthritis With Mind-Body Medicine Certain practices that focus on the interaction between mind and body can be a natural treatment for arthritis as people relax and stretch muscles while allowing the mind to focus itself away from the pain. Yoga can [improve your flexibility and strengthen muscles](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24647379) \u2014 both important for the support of arthritic joints. Tai chi can also ease symptoms in the short term, specifically pain, stiffness, and movement in people who have [osteoarthritis in their knees](/hs/osteoarthritis/dos-donts-osteoarthritis-knee-pain/), according to a research [review published in August 2013 in Complementary Therapies in Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23876571). Water-Based Treatment for Osteoarthritis Keeps Joints Moving Guidelines from the [American College of Rheumatology (ACR)](https://rheumatology.org/osteoarthritis-guideline) on [managing osteoarthritis](https://www.everydayhealth.com/osteoarthritis/treatment-symptom-management/) recommend aquatic, or water-based, exercise as osteoarthritis treatment. \"Some individuals may have too much pain to do land-based exercises, [but] aquatic exercises offer a way of exercising without putting too much stress on weight-bearing joints,\" Dr. Kaeley says. Find a program that uses a heated pool, and ease into the routine, starting in the shallower end without any equipment and then increasing your workout as your comfort level increases, the [Arthritis Foundation](https://www.apta.org/) recommends. Water-based exercise is a natural treatment for arthritis and can help older adults with osteoarthritis feel more confident about exercising, as well as improve mobility and the ability to perform daily tasks, according to [research published in 2015 in the Journal of Geriatric Physical Therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743752). TENS Helps Reduce Pain With Osteoarthritis TENS, short for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, uses a handheld device that sends electrical charges to disrupt pain signals, usually through patches placed on your skin, according to the AAOS. A [study published in August 2015 in The Journal of Knee Surgery](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25162407) found that three months of TENS use \u2014 under a doctor's guidance \u2014 is good treatment for osteoarthritis as it reduces pain and improves function. Ask your healthcare provider whether TENS might help your pain and how to properly use it at home, the ACR suggests. But TENS isn't for everyone; it's not an option if you have an implanted pacemaker or [defibrillator](//www.everydayhealth.com/atrial-fibrillation/living-with/shocking-truths-about-heart-defibrillators/), or if the cause of your pain has not yet been diagnosed, the AAOS says. Get Better Z's for a Natural Treatment for Arthritis It can be tough to sleep if you have joint pain, but improving your sleep could actually be a good treatment for osteoarthritis. According to a [study published in February 2014 in the journal Sleep](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24497658), researchers who worked with 367 adults with osteoarthritis to improve their sleep found that cognitive-behavioral strategies to reduce [insomnia](/insomnia/guide/) appeared to both improve sleep and reduce pain.
