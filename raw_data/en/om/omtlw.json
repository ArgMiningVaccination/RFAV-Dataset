Family Planning Iowa Total Care covers family planning services for males and females of childbearing age. You do not need a referral or authorization to see the practitioner of your choice in- or out-of-network. There is no out of pocket cost (copay) for these services and or supplies. Iowa Total CareEMERGENCY AND URGENT CARE 35MEMBER COSTS Copayments A copayment is a set dollar amount you pay when you get certain services or treatment. It is your share of the cost for a covered healthcare service. The only services where a copayment may apply is for use of a hospital Emergency Room (ER) to treat non-emergent conditions. Iowa Health and Wellness Plan members will be charged an $8 copayment for each visit to the emergency room that is not considered an emergency. Hawki members will be charged a $25 copayment for each visit to the emergency room that is not considered an emergency. A copayment shall not be charged to Hawki members who are not required to pay a premium. Before providing non-emergency services and imposing copayments, the hospital providing care must: 1. Conduct an appropriate medical screening to determine that the Member does not need emergency services. 2. Inform the Member of the amount of his or her co -pa yment obligation for non- emergency services provided in the hospital ER . 3. Pr ovide the Member with the name and location of an available and accessible alternative non-emergenc y service s provider. 4. Determine that the alternative provider can provide services to the Member in a timely manner with no co-payment. 5. Provide a referr al t o coordinate scheduling for treatment by the alternative provider. If the Member is advised of the available alternative provider and of the amount of the copayment, and chooses to receive treatment for a non-emergency condition at the hospital ER, the hospital will assess the copayment. Emergency services for emergent conditions are exempt from any copayment. Paying Copayments You must make copays directly to provider at the time of service. You are always responsible for paying a provider's full charges for non-covered services. At any time, you can ask us how much you and your household have paid in copays. There are several ways to request your copay totals: Iowa Total CareMEMBER COSTS 36 Contact Iowa Total Care Member Services by calling our toll-free number at 1-833-404- 1061 (TTY: 711). Request through your online account on the Secure Member Portal. Request this information from your care coordinator. If you do not agree with the copay totals we tell you, you have the right to appeal. If you paid a copay that you should not have been charged for, you have the right to be paid back by the provider who collected the copay. Exemptions These types of members are always exempt from paying copays: Children under the age of 21. Pregnant women. Individuals receiving hospice care. Federally-recognized American Indians/Alaska Natives. Children in Foster Care. Breast and Cervical Cancer Care Program (BCCCP). Disabled children under Family Opportunity Act. Note: You will be charged a copay if you decide to get care at the emergency room, and your medical illness is not an emergency. Member Liability/Client Participation The other type of cost sharing is when a member must pay a portion of their monthly expense. This is referred to as Patient Liability. If you have a member liability, your provider will collect this amount from you at the time services are rendered. Client Participation Client participation is the amount of income the Member must pay before Medicaid reimbursement for services is available. Members may be subject to client participation in an institutional setting or under 1915(c) home- and community-based services. The Iowa Department of Human Services (DHS) has the responsibility of determining the Member liability amount. A nursing facility or Immediate Care Facility for the Intellectually Disabled (ICF/ID) can discharge members due to non-payment of the client participation. In this instance, Iowa Total Care will work to find an alternative facility willing to serve the member, but the client participation will apply at the new facility because it is a condition of the member's eligibility for Medicaid services. Iowa Total CareMEMBER COSTS 37Explanation of Benefits If you receive a service from a provider and we don't pay for that service, you may receive a notice from us called an Explanation of Benefits (EOB). This is not a bill. The EOB will tell you: The date you received the service. The type of service. The reason we cannot pay for the service.

Iowa Total Care does not reward practitioners, providers, or employees who perform utilization reviews, including those of the delegated entities. Utilization Management's (UM) decision making is based only on appropriateness of care, services and existence of coverage. Iowa Total Care does not specifically reward practitioners or other individuals for issuing denials of coverage.

Utilization review includes: Preservice or prior authorization review Iowa Total Care may need to approve medical services before you receive them. This process is known as prior authorization. Prior authorization means that we have pre-approved a medical service. To see if a service requires prior authorization, check with your PCP, the ordering provider, or Iowa Total Care Member Services. When we receive your prior authorization request, our nurses and doctors will review it. If prior authorization is not received on a medical service when required, you may be responsible for all charges. Concurrent review Concurrent utilization review evaluates your services or treatment plans (like an inpatient stay or hospital admission) as they happen. This process determines when treatment may no longer be medically necessary. It includes discharge planning to ensure you receive services you need after your discharge from the hospital. Iowa Total Care 88OTHER PLAN DETAILSRetrospective review Retrospective review takes place after a service has already been provided. Iowa Total Care may perform a retrospective review to make sure the information provided at the time of authorization was correct and complete. We may also evaluate services you received due to special circumstances (for example, if we didn't receive an authorization request or notification because of an emergency). Adverse determinations and appeals An adverse determination occurs when a service is not considered medically necessary, appropriate, or because it is experimental or investigational. You will receive written notification to let you know if we have made an adverse determination. In the notice, you will receive detailed information about why the decision was made, as well as the process and time frame you should follow for submitting appeals. New technology Health technology is always changing and we want to grow with it. If we think a new medical advancement can benefit our members, we evaluate it for coverage. These advancements include: New technology. New medical procedures. New drugs. New devices. New application of existing technology. Sometimes, our medical director and/or medical management staff will identify technological advances that could benefit our members. The Clinical Policy Committee (CPC) reviews requests for coverage and decides whether we should change any of our benefits to include the new technology. If the CPC doesn't review a request for coverage of new technology, our Medical Director will review the request and make a one-time determination. The CPC may then review the new technology request at a future meeting. The organization distributes a statement to all members and to all practitioners, providers, and employees who make UM decisions, affirming the following: 1. UM decision making is based only on appropriateness of car e and service and e xistence of coverage. 2. The organization does not specifically reward practitioners or other individuals for issuing denials of coverage. 3. Financial incentiv e s for UM decision makers do not encourage decisions that result in underutilization.
