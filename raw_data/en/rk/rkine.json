The scalp is finally having its main character moment \u2014 so much so that many beauty buffs have coined [2022 as the year of the scalp](https://www.bustle.com/style/skin-care-trends-2022). This era of scalp skin care encompasses a rise in [ingredients](https://www.bustle.com/style/hyaluronic-acid-hair) and treatments traditionally used on the face making their way into the hair care realm, all with the overall goal of having healthier strands. \"'Skinification' of hair is a growing trend, and it makes sense: The scalp is skin, and the hair follicles are literally the manufacturing plant for your hair,\" [Dr. Iris Rubin, M.D.](https://www.instagram.com/dririsrubin/), board-certified dermatologist Haircare](https://helloseen.com/), tells Bustle. \"An unhealthy scalp cannot create healthy hair, and the presence of various inflammatory scalp conditions can impact the health of the skin on your body and face,\" unsurprising that scalp therapy has earned the second-highest searched category within the hair care product category, amassing an average of 3.2 million monthly queries in the U.S., according to trend data aggregation platform [Spate.](https://www.spate.nyc/) Another factor contributing to the movement? A global rise in [thinning hair ](https://www.bustle.com/style/people-who-have-thinning-hair-swear-by-these-products-that-actually-work)and hair loss caused by [pandemic-related stress](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35647001/) cosmetic dermatologist [Dr. Michele Green, M.D.](https://www.michelegreenmd.com/) \"This has created a need for treatments that alleviate hair loss,\" Green says, noting that this tends to start with the scalp. \"The health of the scalp plays a major role in the health of the hair, so when you have a clean, well-functioning scalp, you will, in turn, have strong hair that grows.\" Read on for scalp care tips that'll boost your overall head of hair as well as which at-home products and treatments experts recommend.

Scalp Care: The Basics Experts assert that caring for your scalp shouldn't come as a last resort, or solely when experiencing hair loss: Prioritizing the skin on your head can impact even the healthiest-seeming hair. Fortunately, [treating the scalp](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-5-best-scalp-brushes-22627043) is actually pretty easy, as the process starts in the shower. \"To prevent product buildup, the scalp needs to be regularly cleansed, [exfoliated](https://www.bustle.com/style/scalp-exfoliation-tips-experts), and moisturized,\" [Dr. Gaby Longsworth, Ph.D.](https://absolutelyeverythingcurly.com/our-story/), scientist, CEO, and of [Absolutely Everything Curly](https://absolutelyeverythingcurly.com/), tells Bustle. If the scalp isn't cared for, you can wind up dealing with similar issues as you would with the skin on your face: [clogged hair follicles](https://www.bustle.com/p/11-clarifying-shampoos-thatll-get-rid-of-scalp-buildup-asap-36838) from oils and build-up, explains celebrity hairstylist and founder of [Phenix Salon Suites](https://phenixsalonsuites.com/). And that can lead to dull strands or even hair loss \u2014 which is why having a proper scalp skin care routine is key. Experts recommend the following practices: Cleanse: It may sound contradictory, but overwashing your scalp leads to more oil production (and therefore buildup) \u2014 so it's all about [cleansing](https://www.bustle.com/style/195218-how-to-get-rid-of-scalp-buildup-according-to-an-expert) with the most effective ingredients. Specifically: Look for [clarifying shampoos](https://www.bustle.com/p/the-7-best-clarifying-shampoos-73011) to remove residue and dirt for a monthly detox treatment, and then stick to shampoos and conditioners meant for your hair type for more regular washing. Exfoliate: [Exfoliate with a scalp scrub](https://www.bustle.com/style/scalp-exfoliation-tips-experts) every other week (physical formulas that use salt or sugar are great). You could also opt to stimulate cell turnover with ingredients like [tea tree oil](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-tea-tree-oil-helps-your-scalp-hair-plus-10-products-to-try-44721) and [chemical exfoliants](https://www.bustle.com/style/195218-how-to-get-rid-of-scalp-buildup-according-to-an-expert). Hydrate: As with the skin on your face, it's important to keep the scalp moisturized.

If the hair follicles get stronger, this can help reverse the hair loss process,\" Green explains, adding that HydraFacial Keravive is customarily used with PRP for optimal hair health.
