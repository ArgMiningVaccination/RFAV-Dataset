We consider you and your family to be important parts of this team, and we encourage you to ask questions and share information with us. Co mmunication is not only welcome; it is a key part of your treatment and recovery. A successful BMT requires a medical team of BMT experts - doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assis tants, nurses, transplant coordinators, social workers, physical therapists, case managers, pharmacists, and dietiti ans - who can recognize problems and emerging side effects promptly and know how to react swiftly and properly. Psychosocial support is important throughout the BMT process and will be available to you and your family.

A BMT is a w ay to aggressively treat a nd/or cure a potentially fat al disorder or disease . A BMT can pote ntially re-establi sh blood cell producti on and the immune system. A BMT com es with seriou s complications and ris ks and should n ever be tak en lightl y. Although a BMT does not pre vent a disease reo ccurrence, it can increase the li kelihood of a cure, prolong the p eriod of remission, or keep your di sease from progress ing. A BMT can be a diffi cult process and requires a great deal of commitment from the pati ent, their family, and e ducated c aregivers. Most hematop oietic c ells (cells that pro duce/form bl ood cells) a re in your bon e marrow. Some make their w ay from the bone ma rrow into the bl ood that circulat es throu gh your bod y. Bon e marrow hematop oietic cells tu rn into red blood cells, whi te blood cells, or plat elets t o help you r body st ay health y. If your bon e marrow is a ttacked by a di sease, it may no longer make normal blood cells. In o ther situation s, the amount of chemoth erapy and/or radiation th at was needed t o conquer your disease also destroyed your exist ing bone marrow. In a BMT, healthy hematop oietic cells are placed in your body throu gh a cent ral venous line to help resto re your bone marrow. There are two ma in types of transpl ants. An allogeneic transplant is wh en you receive hematopoietic cells from a donor. An autologo us transplant is when you rec eive your own hematop oietic cells. This treatment is considered a rescue. This manual is about al logeneic t ransplants. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 17 A Better Understand ing: All ogeneic BMT An allogeneic transpl ant is one in whi ch the donor and the recipi ent are di fferent pe ople. You r hematopoietic cells are replaced with new, healthy hematop oietic cells fr om a donor o r from donat ed umbilical cord blo od. It involves: pre-BMT evaluation, planning, and preparation or a combi nation o f chemoth erapy and radiation therapy, is given to wipe ou t the canc er cells, su ppress the pati ent's immune system, or bo th. transplant: infusing your thawed hematop oietic cells into your bloodstream through your central venous line (an IV that goes into a large vein) to r eplace the marrow th at was destroy ed by your treatment (This procedure is similar to a blood transfusion) Finding a sui table don or is critical f or the success of an allogeneic transpl ant. Your imm une system c an tell the difference between your ow n cells and cells from anoth er person - and it c an attack the 'foreign ' cells, a condi tion called graft versus host disease. To avoid complicati ons that can be seri ous and di fficult to treat, your donor's tissue type should match yours as closely as possible. Your BMT Consult ation: Fa ctors to Consid er Befo re Movi ng Forward You have bee n referred by your hematologist/o ncologist or your pri mary c are physician t o be evaluat ed by the Roswell Pa rk Transpl ant Team for a possible bl ood or marrow st em cell t ransp lant. This may be the first of mul tiple BMT Center appointment s. We will confirm your diagnosis an d the sta tus of your diseas e. (For exampl e, you may need more che mo or radiati on before bein g considered for a BMT .) An allogeneic transpl ant may not b e appropriate treatment for all patients. However, there a re other factors that must b e considered before mo ving forward, includi ng: are you able to st op smoking well before bei ng ad mitted for transpl ant did you have a good respon se to chemo therapy/radiati on how well your heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys are w orking do yo u have adequate heal th and activity l evel reliable c aregivers who will be avai lable to assist wi th your medi cal care and t ransportati on abili ty to f ollow detailed i nstructions rel ated to your medi cal care abili ty to control anxiety (to cope wi th a prol onged h ospitalizati on) and im pulsive behavior abili ty to stay within 45 minutes from Roswell Park fo r at least 3 mo nths for an allogeneic transplant (relocati on) Your transplant team will review your medi cal situati on carefully before approving your BM T. This is for your safety and benefit. If you do not meet the cri teria for a saf e and effective BMT, the f ollowing may be suggested: a clinical trial, if one is available therapy at anoth er hospit al other typ es of treatments/chemo therapy/rad iation palliative care Please feel free to discus s this wi th your transplant coordi nator or BMT physi cian. \u00a9 Institute Patient Education 3/2016 18 Preparati on Psychosocial Evaluation You will be evaluated by a medical social worker to determine whether there are any psychologic al factors that would make it difficult or too dangerous for you to have a BMT. The stability of your support network will also be evaluated, as well as availa ble caregivers. If necessary, the medical social worker may involve a medical psychologist and/or psychiatrist to evaluate your psychosocial needs and collaborate with them to develop an effective plan of care. The medical social worker will also review Health Care Proxy and Advance Directive forms with you. Fertility Considerations Male patients may want to consider the option of sperm banking before their BMT. Female patients may have concerns regarding fertility. If so, you should ask a BMT clinician for information. You may also call: Buffalo Infertility & IVF Associa tes: (716) 839-3057 or vi sit www .buffaloivf.com Fertility Center: (585) 487-3378 or visit www .urmc .rochester.edu/ob-gyn/fertility-center Required Patient and Ca regiver O rientation Cl ass In order to proceed with a transplant, you will need at least one primary caregiver. Having a seco nd or third caregiver is optimal. Having a commi tted caregiver is essential to moving ahead. You and your caregivers will be expected to attend the Required Patient and Caregiv er Orientation meeting. This program provides information that you and your caregivers will need to successfully cope with the demands of the transplant and the post-transplant phase of recovery. A caregiver is expected to assist you with all of your daily nee ds. This includes medication administration/filling pillbox, transportation to and from clinic visits, meal preparation, and monitoring for si gns of infection. A caregiver's involvem ent is a 24 hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week obligation. A caregiver is expected to remain with you at all times after your discharge and until your transplant physician feels you are able to care for yourself safely. A caregiver's role is sig nificant in the post-transplant phase. This role will be further explored and discussed during the class. Smoking, Alcohol, and Other Drug Use If you smo ke, it is important that you quit to be eligible for transplant and to minimize risks to your health. You and your household members must stop smo king; otherwise you will increase your chance of dying from complications or suffering permanent and serious lung damage. Smoking marijuana could cause a lung infection and prevent you from having a bone ma rrow transplant. Likewise, smo king after your transplant increases your risk of developing and dying from pneumonia. (http://www .nysmokefree.com/1-866-NY-QUITS) The exist ence of liver disorders before your BMT can increase your risk of developing severe liver complications during or after BMT. Various tests are done before, during, and after your BMT to evaluate and monitor your liver function. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 19 Alco hol can damage your liver. You should avoid all alcohol before and after your BMT. Alcohol is a bone marrow poison. Alco hol also can damage your transplanted cells or decre ase their ability to work the way they should. No e-cigarettes, no vaporizing of tobacco or other products (vaping), and no aerosolization of oils, all are irritating to the lungs. Nutrition Co nsultation During your consultation, you will meet with a Registered Dietitian (RD). Your medical history will be reviewed as well as your nutrition requirements. The dietitian will perform an assessm ent to identify your energy and protein needs, make recomm endations for your nutritional care, and address any problems with your oral nutrition. Meals are provided by the Food and Nutrition Department. You will be on a diet to reduce your exposure to bacteria and prevent and food-borne infections and illnesses. Upon a dmission to the hospital, you will receive a Room Servi ce menu to ma ke your meal selections. A dietitian reviews your meal selections, monitors your tolerance of foods and beverages, and can g uide your meal choices as needed. Physical Therapy Con sultation Before your transplant, it is important to determine your current physical status and perfor mance level. The therapist will ask questions about any pre-existing conditions that may affect your ability to exercise during your hospital admissi on. Wear comfortable clothing and appropriate shoes as you will be asked to participate in a series of standardized tests to assess yo ur strength, mobility, endurance, and balance. These tests help with assessi ng your future needs during treatment. The therapist will educate you and your caregivers about the importance of staying ac tive during your hospitalization. The goal is to develop an appropriate exercise program to prevent the loss of function. Early PT intervention is esse ntial. You may be referred to PT to increase and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Dental Consultation/Prevention of Mouth Sores (Muc ositis) The dental team will conduct a comprehensive oral exam, including full mouth x-rays, before your BMT to look for any conditions that could compromise your transplant. If you visited your own dentist within the last year, please obtain a copy of your x-rays and a note from your dentist explaining any work completed. You will be advised if a thorough cleaning or any dental work is necessary. Because your mouth is a potential source of infection, good oral hygiene plays a key role in your successful transplant. Your mouth and throat may become very sore or dry during treatmen t. Good oral hygiene is important before, during, and after your transplant. Without attention to regular oral care, an infection can occur and spread to other parts of yo ur body. Mouth sores and infection can be very painful. You can significantly reduce the risk of developing mouth sores and infection by following your prescribed mouth care program. If you do develop mouth sores, the frequency of m outh care PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 20 will increase. You will be given pain medication to reduce your discomfort. The pain medication can be given orally, intravenously, or as a skin patch. It is highly recommended that you take pain medications to minimize discomfort. As your white blood cell count increases, your mouth will improve too. Family Mee ting Your family meeting is an important opportunity to meet with multiple members of the BMT Team. Your caregiver(s) and family members should attend. At this meeting, your treatment protocol or your non-protocol plan is reviewed in detail. We will review with you the specifics of your treatment schedule, medications, and short and long-term side effects. This time has been scheduled to discuss and clarify the many aspects and challenges of your BMT. Pharmacy Consultation You will meet with a pharmacist at the family meeting to review your current medications, drug/food allergies, and past medication experiences. The pharmacist will convey this information to the transplant clinicians and nursing staff. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 21 Tests and Procedures before BMT Once you have met these eligibility requirements, and if you wish to proceed, your BMT Coor dinator and BMT physician will plan yo ur next steps toward transplant - insurance coverage and setting a date for transplant. Financial counseling will contact your insurance company, or coveri ng agency, to get the proper authorization. Roswell Park has contracts in place with major local, regional and national insurance companies. Successful blood and marrow transplantation requires healthy blood and/or bone marrow for infusion. In addition, you must be healthy enough to endure the rigors of the BMT process. To determine whether you are an a ppropriate candidate, your doctor will consider your age, general physical condition, diagnosis, a nd stage of disease. Tests, procedures, and evaluations will determine when you are ready to have the treatment needed before the transplant. The tests must be completed between 30 and 60 days before you are admitted to the hospital. O ccasionally, some tests may need to be repeated due to a delay. Listed below are the most comm on tests done before a transplant. The tests you will need will depend upon your disease and your transplant protocol or non-protocol therapy. (Sometimes an insurance carrier will not cover protocol therapy.) Tests/Procedures (Not all are required for ev ery patient. Refer to Glossary for more information) 24-hour Urine Collec tion Blood tests (multiple tubes of blood will be drawn) Bone Marrow Biopsy and Aspirate Chest X-ray Com puted Tom ography (CT) Dual-energy nance Angiogr am (MRA) Scan Magnetic Reso Imaging (MRI) Scan Multigated Acquisition (MUGA) Scan or Echocardiogram Physical Exam Positron Emission Tom ography (PET) Scan Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) Skeletal Survey Evaluations Psychosocial Dental Physical Therapy Radia tion (may not be required) Nutrition Additional consults as needed PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 22 Please be honest with your transplant team about smo king, marijuana, alcohol, vaporizing of tobacco, other drug use, and any issues that you are unable to cope with, as these issues are very important. The goal is to get you through BMT safely. In order to do that, the BMT team will need to know if you have any alcohol or drug related problems or concerns. The BMT clinicians will then direct you to the right professional and resour ces for help. Some of these issues may lead to damage to lungs, heart, kidneys, and liver. Mes sage for P atients, Family, Caregivers, and Loved O nes Family m embers should make sure that the BMT clinic and nursing station has more than one phone number, and that they are correct. Emer gency contacts include home number, etc. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 23 Your Don or's Perip heral Blood and Stem Cell Collecti on or Bone Marrow Ha rvest In most cases, we collect hematopoietic cells, som etimes called stem cells, from your donor by collec ting the blood that is circulating in his/her blood stream (peripheral blood). Less often, we have to get (harvest) the cells from his/her bone marrow. Mobi lization and C ollection of Peripheral Blood Stem cells can be collected from a donor's circulating blood \u2014 known as peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) \u2014 using a procedure called pheresis (see apheresi s). Unlike a bone marrow harve st, pheresis does not have to be done in an o perating room, and the donor does not have to be under anesthesia. A few days before the procedure, donors are usually given a medication called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF/filgras tim/Neupogen\u00ae) that makes stem cells l eave the bone marrow and move into the circulating blood where they can be collec ted during pheresis. G-CSF is given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. It may cause flu-like symptoms and bone pain in the days before and after the procedure. Your donor's peripheral veins will be checked before the procedure to make sure that they can be used for pheresis. A peripheral intravenous (IV) ca theter will be placed in the antecubital area (the crease where your arm bends) of both arms on each day of collection. If we cannot use your donor's peripher al veins, a special pheresis catheter will be placed in the chest or neck area. The catheter placem ent is usually done as an outpatient procedure on the 1st day of collec tion and the catheter is removed when collec tion is completed. The collection process is also an o utpatient procedure. It takes 4-6 hours per day, for a minimum of 2 days, to collect enough stem cells for the transplant. After a brief physical exam, your donor's peripheral IV or pheresis catheter will be connected to a mac hine that circulates the blood. As blood flows through the mac hine, it separates out the stem cells and sends the rest of the blood (plasma, red blood cells and platelets) back into the donor's vein. The collected stem cells are either used immediately or are frozen and stored. When the procedure is over for the day, the donor is disconnected from the apheresis machine. A me mber of the clinic team, often your BMT Coordinator will let your donor know when enough hematopoietic cells have been collected. On the rare occasion that your donor did not successfully com plete hematopoietic cell collection within the 2 day collection process and more stem cells are needed for the required cell dose, your BMT physician may require a 3rd collec tion day or a bone marrow harves t. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 24 Bone Marrow Harvest at Roswell Park Cancer Institute Your BMT physician may recomm end a bone marrow harvest to collect the hematopoietic cells. Bone marrow harve sting is performed in an o perating room, under anesthesia. Your donor will not need stitches, but will have some pain and tenderness at the site of the harve st for about a week. In preparation, your donor will complete a health history, have a physical exami nation, and be evaluated by an a nesthesiologist. Your donor will be educated about the bone ma rrow harve st procedure and sign consent forms. Refer to the Bone Marrow Harvest Brochure for instructions in preparation for a bone marrow harvest at Roswell Park Cancer Institute . Day of Harvest On the day of the harve st, your donor needs to come to the hospital early in the morning. Your donor must not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before the harvest or the procedure will be delayed or cance led. After changing into a patient gown, your donor will be escorted to an area imm ediately outside the operating room. An IV will be started to give medications before the procedure. Once asleep, the donor will be placed on their stomach (abdomen) and the procedure will begin. Procedure Once asleep, the collection of bone ma rrow begins by inserting a special needle into the hip bone, attaching a syringe to the needle, and pulling the liquid m arrow into the syringe. This is repeated until the required amount of bone ma rrow is collec ted. When the collection is complete, a bandage will be applied to the area. The bone marrow harvest procedure takes 2-3 hours. The filtered bone marrow may be processed for freezing and kept frozen until it is time for a BMT. The harve st procedure affects only the red blood cell count. Red cells can be replaced through blood transfusions, if the doctor determines that it is necessary. Usually, discharge takes place that same evening. Because of the anesthesia, your donor will not be able to drive, and must have a ride home. Your donor may not drive until the clinical team says it is safe. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 25 Pre-Admission Pre-admission Visit for your B MT The day before your admissio n, or the Friday before your weekend admissio n, you will be scheduled for your pre-admission appointment in the BMT Center. Go to Patient Access (Regist ration) in the lobby, then to the Phlebotomy Lab to get your blood drawn. Both are located on the ground floor of the hospital. Next, go to the BMT Center. We will take your history and give you a physical exam, including your height and weight, and then you will be seen by a BMT physician. Your chemotherapy orders will be completed by the team. We will send you to Interventional Radiology to have your central venous line placed (see below). When all of this is done, you may go home or to local lodging. Pedi atric Pre-admission Visit for your BMT The day before your child's admissio n, or the Friday before your child's weekend admissio n, please go to Pediatric Clinic for your Pre-Admission appointment. We will take your child's history and give him or her a physical exam, including height and weight. Your child will be seen by an NP and/or pediatric BMT physician. Your child's chemotherapy orders will be completed by the team. Your child may be sent to Interventional Radiology for a line placement, depending on whether he or she needs a new central venous line for the transplant. When all of this is done, your child may go home or to local lodging. Getting a Central Venous Line A central venous line is a thin, flexible tube that is placed i nto a vein in the neck or chest area. Placement is usually done in In terventi onal Radiology Ce nter. One end of the catheter rests in the vein, near the heart, and the other end of the catheter is brought through the skin. Central venous lines are an effective way to give IV fluids and medications that need to be placed directly into a vein, give blood transfusions, take blood samples, and deliver chemotherapy. Consistent access to a central vein preserves the veins in yo ur arms and limits the amount of needle sticks. The catheter will remain in place for the duration of your transplant and possibly a fter discharge. Your caregiver will be taught how to care for your central venous line. The D ay of Admission Please go to the Patient Access (Regist ration) area unless you were asked to go directly to the BMT unit. When you arrive on the unit, the staff will meet you and take you to yo ur room. Your admitting nurse will do a nursing assessm ent. A nurse practitioner, physician assis tant, or a medical oncology fellow will do a physical assessme nt. Remember, the nursing staff is always ready to answer questions or find answers for you. Your treatment regimen will be ordered by your physician based on your diseas e, remissi on status, age, and prior treatment. It is som etimes called a conditioning or preparati ve regimen. It may consist of chemotherapy alone or in combination with total body irradiation (TBI). You will be told what days you will receive chemotherapy and/or TBI. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 26 Ros well Park's Transpl ant Unit Our Blood and Marrow Transplantation Unit is located on the 5th floor for adult patients and on 6 North for pediatric patients. All patient rooms are private, and all rooms and hallways are High Efficiency Particulate Free Air (HEPA)-filtered, giving you the freedom to leave your room and walk within the unit. Each room has a viewing window and all rooms have a camera to enable the nursing staff to monitor your situation more closely, if needed. Isolation rooms are avail able if necessary to protect you or other patients. A solari um and restroom facilities for your family and visitors are located next to the inpatient unit, on the 5th floor. The solari um is comfortably furnished and has a refrigerator, microwave oven, television, washer and dryer, and a telephone. Food is allowed in the solar ium, but we ask family and visitors to remember that this is a shared area. Guidelines for eating/drinking in patient rooms Family m embers are allowed to eat in the patient rooms Patients must strictly follow the low microbial diet at all times (brochures availa ble) Please throw away food leftovers when you are outside patient rooms Please clean up imm ediately when finished eating VERY IMPORTAN T: Please do not leave or store food in patient rooms Please do not leave dirty dishes in patient's room or nutrition room - these will be discarded Do not share food or drinks with patients Please be aware that patients are very sens itive to sm ells/odors If a patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) please do not bring food into room - We will let you know when you may resume eating/d rinking in the p atient's room Children can visit if they have an adult with them, but the child must not be sick Meals are provided by the Food and Nutrition Department. You will be on a diet, which is designed to do two things: 1) reduce your exposure to bacteria 2) prevent infection and food-borne illnesses When you are admitted to the hospital, you will get a Room Service menu to ma ke your meal selections. A registered dietitian (RD) reviews your me al selections, monitors how well you tolerate foods and beverages, and can guide your meal choices, if needed. Food from home is okay as long as items are selected and prepared within the diet guidelines. Food should be kept in a safe temperature zone during transport. Prepared food should be eaten within 48 hours of being prepared. Food should be labeled with name and date, and then placed in the Nutrition Room refrigerator. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 27 Patient Guidelines (See Visitor Rules and Guide lines Section) You may find it comforting to surround yourself with personal items. Converting your hospital room into your own \"space\" will help to alleviate some of the stress of a long stay. Pictures of family members, posters, a special bedspread or comforter, a CD or DVD player with yo ur favorite music, books, videos, or even a pillow can often help. Do not wear contact lenses. Make sure to bring your glasses with you. Pierced earrings are allowed; however wear metal that does not irritate your skin. Please remove acrylic nails or nail polish; it can interfere with the oxygen equipment. Please do not wear expensive jewelry such as heirlooms, they may have to be removed and may get lost, especially rings. Your hands may become swollen during this time and your rings may need to be cut off. These items are much safer if they are left at home! Pillows and comforters must not contain down or feathers; they must be new or freshly laundered. Stuffed animals should also be new or laundered to minimize the risk of infection. Feel free to bring your own clothes. Be sure they are loose fitting so that you are comfortable and the BMT team can easily access your catheter. Please leave all expensive jewelry, credit cards, medications, and large amounts of money at home. Mail will be delive red daily. New magazines, newspapers, and other unused reading material are acceptable. The unit secre tary will open all your mail before you get it. (This lowers the risk of getting a paper cut, which could cause infection while your white blood cell and platelet counts are low.) As of August 1, 2015, there is no charge for TV and phone. You may bring a laptop or tablet from home and access the Internet using Roswell Park's public wireless network. Inpatients may also get a laptop on loan from the Resource Center for Patients and Family on the first floor, in the Sunflower Cafe. Family m embers may go get it for you, or you can ask the nurse on your unit to call the Resource Center at X 1729. There is no charge. Do NOT keep money or valuables in yo ur room. Your door must be closed at all times so the special air-filter system works to its fullest potential. Fresh or dried flowers, live plants or animals are not allowed on the unit. Artificial flowers are okay. Be sure that artificial arrangem ents do not contain dried moss. Cards and balloons are fine. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 28 Visi tor Rules and Guidel ines Visiting The BMT unit has an o pen visiting policy, which means that family members or friends can visit at any time. However, you should check with your doctor and charge nurse before children visit. Children under the age of 16 are allowed to visit in the patient rooms, but must be accompanied by a responsible adult other than the patient at all times while on the unit. Children will go directly to the patient's room, remain in the room for the duration of their visit, and exit the unit directly on leaving the patient's room. Children may not visit a patient in strict respiratory isolation. For patients on contact isolation, children may visit and be closely monitored by an adult other than the patient. Only 2 visitors in the room at a time. A patient may request to limit or restrict visitors at any time. Only 1 person over age 18 is allowed to stay in the room overnight. Guidelines These rules and guidelines are designed to create a pleasant, healthy environment for everyone and to decre ase the risk of infections for our patients. Please respect them. Family m embers should make sure that the nursing station has multiple and correct phone numbers for emergency contacts. Including home number, cell phone number, caregiver home number, caregiver cell caregiver work etc. Visitors should re cognize that a good night's sleep is very i mportant to recovery. S hould you have a problem, family members returning to their home or hotel for the night will be notified of any change in your status. Smoking is not allowed. Roswell Park Cancer Institute is dedicated to the overall mission of curing cancer. Cigarette smo king is known to be a leading cause of cancer. Therefore, Roswell Park Cancer Institute has a strict No Smok ing policy throughout the transplant unit and the entire Institutes buildings and outside grounds. No e-cigarettes, no vaporizing of tobacco or other products (vaping) and no aerosolization of oils, because they are all irritating to the lungs. Your clinical team can prescribe medications to help you quit smo king. Hand washing with antimicro bial soap is the single m ost effective way to prevent infection. Before entering a patient's room, all visitors must wash their hands thoroughly. Hand sanitizer dispensers are also located outside every patient room. You may also use sanitizer unless otherwise specified. Adults and children with a fever, cold, contagio us infection such as chicken pox or flu, or recent exposure to a contagious infection within the past 2 weeks may not visit. Visitors who have been recently immunized with flu mist should not visit for 7 days. Visitors may not use the patient's bathroom. This is to prevent cross-contamination. Rest room facilities are located off the unit. Family m embers, as well as patients, are not to visit other patients in their rooms. This helps to prevent the spread of infection. Diapers are not to be changed within the BMT unit. There are public restrooms located on the ground, lst, 2nd, and 3rd floors of the atrium area that are equipped with diaper changing stations. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 29 Blood and Platelet Donat ions Blood is an important, life-saving resource. Almost all patients going through BMT will require blood and/or platelet transfusions. Often, family and friends will ask if they can help in any way. A wonderful opportunity exists for them to give not only to the patient but to the whole cancer comm unity. Donation may only take 45 minutes for red blood cells or 90 minutes to donate platelets. Those who are interested should talk to the clinical team about donating blood and platelets for your family me mber. Family a nd friends may donate blood and platelets directly at Ros well Park Cancer Institute by scheduling an appointment through the Donor Center at (716) 845-8275. Injections You may receive 2 types of injections: growth factors to help your blood counts recover, and a blood thinner enoxaparin (Lovenox \u00ae) to prevent clots. These injections cannot be giv en in your central venous line. You can have a subcutaneous port placed for these injections and other medications like insulin. Alm ost all of our patients leave the hospital without requiring hormone growth factors. Preventing Infection While You Are Hospitalized To help avoid i nfection while your immune system is recover ing, please follow these guidelines. Wash your hands with soap and water before eating or performing any oral (mouth) care, and after using the bathroom. If you use only a hand sanitizer, such as Purell\u00ae, it is important to wash your hands aga in, especially if yo ur hands are soiled with urine or stool. Contact lenses should not be worn during your hospital stay to decre ase the risk of infection. It is important that your prescription be updated and glasses are worn. Please remove artificial nails and use only clear nail polish. No new body piercings. Use Chlorhexidine Gluconate (CHG) wipes with or without showering every day. Your skin is your first line of defense against infection. Compromised skin can create doorways for infections to enter your body. Put on clean clothi ng every day. Follow your prescribed low micro bial diet. A copy of the diet will be given to you and your family. The dietary department will also assist you when ordering meals. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 30 Perform daily oral care with a sponge toothette or an ex tra-soft bristled toothbrush, depending on your platelet count. Use recomm ended toothpaste or oral rinses as prescribed by your clinical team. While your platelet count is low, you should not floss because of the risks of bleeding and infection. Avoid contact with people who are sick. Friends and family who have a fever, cold, flu, or other contagious diseases must not visit. If som eone has been recently exposed to an individual who is sick, he or she should not visit you. Anyone who has received the flu mist va ccine (nasal spray) should not visit the patient for 7 days. No plants, fresh flowers, fresh fruit, or fruit baskets in yo ur room. Take all of your medication on time as instructed by your nursing team. If you are having trouble taking your medication, let the clinical team know. A mask must be worn if you are being transported off the unit for a test or procedure. The only reason for leaving the protective environment is for a test or procedure. Don't wear your shoes or slippers in bed because it will transfer germs from the floor to your bed. Avoid contaminating your bedside table (keep urinals separate from that area). If you develop an infection during your recovery, your antibiotics may be changed. It is crucial to tell your doctor and nurses how you are feeling. Sym ptoms of infection include: fever chills/swe ating shortness of breath, difficulty breathing cough: dry, persis tent or with sputum sore throat or pain with swallowing sores or white patches in yo ur mouth or on your tongue sinus drainage, nasal congestion, facial tenderness, headache redness, tenderness or drainage at the site of your central venous line difficulty urinating or pain with urination cloudy or foul-smelling urine diarrhea vaginal itching or unusual discharge rectal pain or tenderness fatigue and dizziness pain PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 31 Chemoth erapy The chemotherapy you will receive has been carefully planned and is part of a protocol or non- protocol treatment. Your treatment timetable was designed by experts in the field of blood and marrow transplant. Chemotherapy, often called chemo for short, is an important part of yo ur treatment and will include one or more medications. It will be given on a special schedule that is thought to be best for killing your cancer while reducing harm to your body's normal cells, as much as possible. You will be told what days you will receive chemo and how you should ex pect to feel. Chemotherapy drugs will be giv en orally or through an IV. The doses of chemotherapy used in a transplant are usually different than those you may have received in the past. You may have different side effects than before. You are likely to have profound fatigue while in the hospital and after you are discharged home, so physical therapy (PT) is very important to your recovery. Chemotherapy usually kills o ther cells in addition to cancer cells; this is why people receivi ng chemo often have side effects. It can damage normal, fast-growing cells s uch as those in yo ur mouth, throat, bowels, skin, hair, and bone marrow. You may experience mouth or throat sores, nausea and vom iting, diarrhea, a skin rash, changes in skin color, and hair loss. Yo ur blood counts may become very low. You will receive medications to minimize nausea and vomiting. Pain medications will be given if you develop pain or sores in your mouth or throat. An oral hygiene program will begin once you are admitted to the hospital. It is very important that you do oral care to prevent side effects. Medications also will be given if you develop diarrhea or constipation. A pharmacist will review your medications to make sure you do not receive a seve re reaction. You may lose your hair during treatment. This is usually temporary and your hair should grow back within 3-6 months. Because body heat is lost through the head, you may feel colder after the loss of your hair. You are encouraged to wear a cap, scarf or wig. The Res ource Center for Patients & Families, located on the first floor in the Sunflower Caf\u00e9 (cafeteria) offers one new wig per year at no cost to those who have hair loss due to treatment. A sec ond wig may be purchased at cost. The Center also has various types of caps, scarves, and other head coverings. Chemotherapy may affect other orga ns of yo ur body such as your kidneys, liver, heart, or lungs. Although severe side effects are rare, they can progress and cause complications such as liver diseas e, kidney failure, congestive heart failure, or scarring/stiffening of the lungs. We cannot predict who will experience these rare side effects. You will be giv en information on these potential side effects, as well as explanations of each chemotherapeutic medication and its potential side effects. We will monitor you daily for signs and symptoms of possible side effects. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 32 Radiation Radia tion therapy (also called irradiation) is part of some transplant conditioning regimens. The type of ra diation you may receive is called total body irradiation (TBI) because it is given to your entire body. During treatment, a machine sends x-rays of high energy into your body. The cells in your body are prevented from growing and multiplying when they are exposed to these high- energy rays. What to Expect: First, you will meet with the radiation oncologist, who will review the procedure and ask you to sign a separate informed consent form. TBI treatments are usually giv en once or twice a day - once in the morning and once in the afterno on. The number of treatments depends upon your treatment plan or clinical trial. Before going for TBI, you m ay be given medication to prevent nausea. You should have a light breakfast before going. Do not wear any jewelry. You will need to wear a hospital go wn; you should not wear any clothi ng with metal on it such as zippers, snaps, etc. The treatment usually takes 1 hour. You will not feel anything while receiving the treatment. During this time, you will be asked to remain lying in a bed. You will be alone in the treatment room, but you will be monitored on 2 TV screens and a microphone. The technologist will be able to see and hear you. One screen will be focused on you and the other will be focused on a mac hine that monitors your blood pressure and pulse. If you are having any problems, you can visually si gnal or speak any concerns to your technologist who will do everything possible to ma ke you comfortable. Like chemotherapy, radiation affects both cancer cells a nd normal cells. The side effects that may occur are due to the effects on normal cells. In itially, you may experience nausea, vomi ting, and diarrhea. You will be giv en medications to prevent and treat these side effects. After you complete the treatments, you may develop some other side effects. These may include: red, dry skin, dry mouth (from the effects of the radiation on your salivary glands), parotitis (swelling of the parotid glands in front of yo ur ears), infertility, lung changes, or catarac ts. Your doctors and nurses watch very closely for any of these side effects. Some are easily treated, while others may require long-term follow-up. If you have any questions regarding your treatment, please ask any member of the transplant team or your radiation therapist/oncologi st. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 33 Stem Cell Transplant Day (D ay \"0\") The donor's collected hematopoietic cells are infused in to you through your central venous line. It looks very much like a blood transfusion. An experienced nurse performs the BMT infusion at the bedside. This will be done in your room on the BMT unit. Once thawed, the nurse will return the cells to you via your central venous line. The patient is monitored very closely for si de effects. Your vital signs - blood pressure, heart rate, respirations, temperature, and oxygen saturation - will be monitored throughout the infusion, and afterwards, for at least one hour. We monitor you because you could have a rare reaction. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 34 Blood Cell Ty pes There are 3 main types of blood cells - red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Each has a specific job to do, and each may be affected by chemo and/or radiation in a different way. To ensure you have enough of each type of blood cell, your blood will be monitored regularly, and transfusions will be giv en as necessary. Red Blood Ce lls (erythrocytes or RBCs) RBCs, which give blood its red color, carry an ir on-rich protein known as hemoglobin, which picks up oxygen from your lungs and carries it to all the cells in yo ur body. W hen your hemoglobin level is low ( anemia), you may feel weak or dizzy, lack energy, be short of breath, have headaches, and/or become irrita ble. If you become too anemic, there are standard or ders written by the clinical team so your nurses will give you a red blood cell transfusion. You will receive one or more bags of packed red blood cells, as needed, to boost your hemoglobin level. Each bag will be transfused over 2-3 hours. To lessen the chance of a reaction, the blood is typed and cross- matched to confirm that you and the donor have the same blood type. If you have a transfusion reaction, the symptoms may include chills, hives, itching, and/or breathing problems. If you have any of these symptoms, please notify your nurse imm ediately. Because RBCs have a longer lifespan than platelets, you will not usually need RBC transfusions as often as platelet transfusions. Platelets (thromboc ytes) Platelets are the small est components in blood; they play a crucial role in blood clotting and preventing bleeding. Without enough platelets (a condition called thrombocytopenia), spontaneous bleeding or excessive bruising may occur. Normal platelet values are between 150,000 and 300,000 per microli ter of blood. To help prevent bleeding, you may be giv en transfusions of platelets if your count is less than 10,000 (som etimes the term used is 'less than 10'). Platelets may be transfused more frequently if there is active bleeding or before any invasive procedures. Transfusions may be given until your bone marrow begins to produce its own platelets. If your platelets are low y ou may develop petechiae (rash of pinpoint-sized reddish- purple spots) or an ecchymosis (large bruise) near the area(s) where you had injections. White Blood Ce lls (leukocy tes, WBCs) WBCs defend your body against diseas e-producing bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, foreign substances, and tumor cells. T here are 3 main types. 1) Neutrophils (granulocytes) are the body's first line of defense against infection. The bone marrow can quickly speed up production of these cells whenever they are needed. They combat infection by rapidly moving into the bloodstream where they respond to the presence of bacteria or foreign substances. When the infection is controlled, their production returns to normal. 2) Lymphocytes patrol the bloodstream and all parts of your body. 3) Monocytes defend the body against bacterial and fungal infections. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 35 A normal total WBC count ranges between 5,000 and 10,000 cells per mi croliter of blood. Another numerical term you may hear is 5 to 10 cells per microli ter, which is an a bbreviated way of saying 5,000 to 10,000. Neutrophils account for approximately 50 percent to 80 percent of the total number of WBCs. You have neutropenia when your neutrophil count is low. Your risk of infection increases if your count is below 1,000. The risk increases dramatically if your count is below 500, and you will be giv en antibiotics. Your WBC and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) will be monitored daily. Ge nerally, as the overall number of WBCs increases, so too, does the number of circulating neutrophils. Your neutrophil count may decrease after you stop growth factor injections. All blood products are carefully tested for infections such as hepatitis, HIV, and syphilis, according to federal regulations. Cytomeg alovirus (CMV) testing will be done if your doctor decides it is needed. All blood products are irradiated and filtered to help eliminate the chance of reactions from white blood cells and transmission of infectious viruses such as CMV. Engraftm ent and Count Recovery The cells you receive during your transplant are often referred to as a graft. Engraftment is the process in which your transplanted cells migrate from your bloodstream to the center of yo ur large bones where bone marrow is located. Once these cells have found their way, they can begin to produce new blood cells. This process can take 2-4 weeks. During this time period, all of yo ur blood counts will be low and you will be susceptible to infection and bleeding. You will receive antibiotics to prevent infection. You will also receive blood products, such as red blood cells and platelets, until you are able to produce these cells on your own. When your white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet count begin to rise, we know that engraftment has begun. It is at this time that your need for red blood cell and platelet transfusions will decre ase. Your antibiotic treatment may be changed in anticipation of discharge. Graft failure or poor count recovery is a very rare complication that occurs when cells are not accepted by the body. With graft failure, the new cells do not repopulate the bone ma rrow. When this happens, patients are susceptible to infection and other complications. Sometimes graft failure is life-long, even life threatening, but it is a very rare complication. You may need transfusions of red blood cells a nd platelets for support. Additional treatment may include injections that stimulate the production of red or white blood cells such as erythropoietin/Procrit\u00ae/Epogen\u00ae, filgras tim/Neupogen\u00ae, or sargra mostim/Leukine\u00ae. Your transplant team will discuss this with you, if applicable. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 36 Potent ial Side Effects and Complications A transplant can be a potentially life-saving procedure and it comes with the possibil ity of complications. These complications can be very serious and even life threatening. Side effects and complications may happen quickly or develop over time and persist for long periods. Please report any symptom(s) you have to your nurse or doctor, so that we can address the problem and start treatment. Poss ible Side Effects of Conditioning Therapy Low blood counts Fever and Infection Fatigue Bleeding Nausea, vom iting and diarrhea Mouth sores Decrea sed a ppetite Skin rash and/or skin changes Difficulty eating Loss of appetite Diarrhea Hair loss High-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation are harmful not only to diseased cells, but also to normal tissues and organs. W hen normal cells are affected, side effects develop. These side effects can include nausea, vomi ting, difficulty eating, loss of appetite, diarrhea, hair loss, and skin changes. The healthcare team will be managing these side effects with medications, blood transfusions, IV fluids, and interventions as appropriate. Every day, we will check your Complete Blood Count (CBC). After conditioning therapy, the CBC val ues will drop below normal. The neutrophil count will fall close to zero, and can remain low for several weeks. During that time, you are at high risk for infections. That is also the time when you will feel the sickest. When the neutrophils start to recover, during the period of engraftment, you will begin to feel better. Difficulty Eating There are many reasons you may have difficulty eating during and after your transplant. Chemotherapy and/or radiation can cause nausea and/or vomi ting, mouth or throat sores, and diarrhea. In addition, your saliva may thicken and make chewing and swallowing food difficult. Rinsi ng your mouth often and drinking fluids will help. You can ask for a suction catheter (like the kind in a dentist's office) to help rinse your mouth. Mouth dryness may last for sev eral months after your transplant. Taste changes, either the inability to taste foods or a change in normal taste, may last for 30 to 60 days or longer after chemo or radiation. It is very important to eat small frequent meals even if you experience taste changes. It is also important not to eat greasy or fatty foods. You may receive nutrition in your central venous line called TPN (total parenteral nutrition). PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 37 Nausea a nd Vom iting Nausea and/or vom iting are comm on during and after all conditioning regimens, but can usually be controlled with medications. Medications and infections may also cause nausea or vom iting. Drugs called anti-emetics are used to treat nausea. (Emesis means vom iting, so anti-emetics are drugs that prevent or control vom iting). Even if you are feeling a little bit nauseous, please tell your nurse right away. The dose and frequency of the anti-nausea medications may have to be adjusted. Anti-nausea medications will be given to you through your central venous line on a regular schedule and on an as-needed basis. You can also get an a nti-nausea skin patch. It is very important not to let nausea and vomiting get out of control. Diarrhea Getting diarrhea after your conditioning regimen is comm on. Infection can also cause diarrhea. Your stool will be tested for an infection called C lostridium difficile or C. diff. If a C diff. infection is suspected, you may be started on an oral or IV antibiotic. Antidiarrheal drugs will not be giv en until we are sure you do not have an infection. Keeping the rectal area clean and dry is important to prevent infection and skin breakdown. You will be provided with wipes to help keep yourself clean. If your rectal area becomes irritated, please tell your nurse and creams will be provided to relieve your discomfort. You may develop hemorrhoids. If you do, it is important to keep them clean. Another complication is rectal fissure (tear), thus rectal exam and care are important to be done daily. It is important to change your underwear or disposable briefs (such as Depends\u00ae) every day. Hair Loss (Alopecia) Hair loss may occur after the conditioning regimen. You may also experience thinning or loss of eyelas hes, eyebrows, and body hair. This usually occurs within 3-4 weeks of receivi ng chemotherapy. Some patients prefer to shave their heads or cut their hair very short before hair loss begins. Scarves, caps, hats or wigs can be worn until your hair grows back. Wigs and other headgear are avail able at Roswell Park's Res ource Center for Patients and Families. (One wig and one head cover ing are free and you can purchase one more of each at cost.) You may wish to consider stopping by the Reso urce Center before you lose your hair. Hair normally grows back within 3-6 months after transplant. You may notice changes in the color, thickness, texture, or curl of your hair. Skin Ch anges Depending on the chemo and/or radiation you have, you may get a skin rash, peeling and/or reddened skin, or changes in the shade of yo ur skin. This is temporary, and you will receive creams to relieve any discomfort. The nurse will give you further instructions about your specific skin care. Less often, hyperpigmentation (dark spots on the skin) occurs. This usually fades over a period of 1-2 months. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 38 Urine It is important to use the stool and urine collec tion hats from the toilet so the team can keep track of your output. Your urine will be tested to make sure you do not have an infection that requires treatment. Fatigue Until your red blood cell counts recover, you may suffer from anemia. Symptoms may include: shortness of breath chest pain easily fatigued/weakness/dizziness headache difficulty concentrating rapid heartbeat: usually associa ted with exercise; irregular heartbeat that may require medication (see atrial fibrillation) leg cramps Until your red blood cell count recovers, you may require blood transfusions to treat your anemia. To help with the side effects, rest between activities, change position slowly to avoid dizziness and always call for assistance if you aren't feeling well. Sinu soidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS)/Ven o-Occlusive Disease (VOD) SOS/VOD is a rare but potentially serious condition caused by the high doses of chemo and/or radiation received before BMT. With SOS/VOD, the blood vessels that carry blood through the liver swell and become blocked. This condition i nterferes with the liver's ability to remove waste products from the bloodstream. Pressure and fluid buildup in the liver makes it swell and become tender. Other symptoms include rapid weight gain (from fluid retention), swelling in the arms, legs or abdomen, and an increase in bilirubin. Fluid in the abdomen may cause pressure on the lungs making breathing difficult. Also, toxins that the liver is unable to remove may affect how the brain functions, resulting in confusion. Blood thinners including enoxaparin/Lovenox\u00ae (daily i njections) and ursodiol/Actigall\u00ae pills will help prevent you from developing SOS/V OD. If SOS/VOD is suspected, your BMT team will attempt to prevent more serious complications by: minimizing or eliminating certain medications prescribing diuretics to increase urine output and relieve fluid retention in the body carefully monitoring the volume of fluids in the body transfusing packed red blood cells to keep the circulating blood volume high until the SOS/VOD runs its course PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 39 Lungs and Heart It is possible that your heart and lungs may be affected by high doses of chemo, radiation, fluids, or infections, decre asing their ability to function. For this reason, we will test you before, during, and after your transplant to monitor your heart and lungs. You can play a vital and active role in preventi ng lung complications. If you smo ke, you must stop before your admission for transplant. Smoking is not permitted while you are in the hospital. This includes electronic cigarettes. Resu ming smo king after transplant greatly increases your risk of serious lung complications and death. Information to help you stop smoking is availa ble. You may visit the Resource Center for Patients and Famili es for material or visit www .nysmokefree.com. You may also call New York S tate Smokers' Quitl ine at 1-866-NY-QUITS (1-866-697-8487). You may get an EKG, chest x-ray, CT scan (computerized tomography scan) or cardiac echocardiogram to evaluate your heart function. Some patients are at risk for irregular and fast heart beats. We may use a monitor to watch and evaluate your heart rate. We may also draw blood to check that your heart is working properly. You can develop lung problems up to sever al months after your BMT. You may have pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to check your lung function. If you feel short of breath, can't catch your breath, or are having trouble walking, let yo ur nurse know. We will check the oxygen level while you are at rest, and maybe while you are walking. If it is abnormal, you may have a chest X-ray or CT scan done. Your team will treat any lung infection or inflammation, if it occurs. Your health care providers will teach you how you can help maintain healthy lung function while you are hospitalized. Your nurses and doctors will evaluate your lungs daily. If necessary, your physician may prescribe an aerosol medication, chest physiotherapy, or oxygen. If you feel short of breath or have difficulty breathing at any time, please alert your nurse or doctor imm ediately. Kidneys and Bladder Your kidneys and/or bladder may be harmed by chemotherapy and other medications. We closely monitor how well yo ur kidneys are working while you are in the hospital. You will be weighed every morning and blood will be drawn daily; or more often if needed. Intraveno us and oral fluids will be measured carefully and recorded. All urine, stool, and eme sis will be mea sured and recorded. This is referred to as Intake & Output. If urine is not properly collected, the clinical team may not know if you need a diuretic to remove extra fluid from your body. Always let your health care providers know what fluids you drink and if you are vom iting. As mentioned previously, it is very important to use the collec tion hat and urinal. Sometimes the large amount of intravenous fluids that you receive can cause fluid retention. If this occurs, you may be given a diuretic medication to increase your urine output. In some cases, you may have difficulty emptying your bladder completely. If fluid or urine retention becomes a problem, a Foley catheter may be inserted into the bladder via the urethra. This flexible and soft tube allows the urine to flow freely into a collection bag. The catheter is temporary. If you develop lower abdomen and bladder discomfort, you may ask your nurse for a bladder scan. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 40 Occasionally, despite close monitoring and aggr essive therapy, kidney failure can occur. In these cases, dialysis may be necessary to help the kidneys heal and to remove toxins that build up in the body. The need for dialysis may be temporary until normal kidney function returns. In rare cases, the need for dialysis is permanent. Dental Conditioning regimens that include radiation can cause complications of the mouth and the mucus membranes. Dry mucosal me mbranes can cause you to ma ke less saliva, which leads to dental cavities. Fr equent oral hygiene is vital, and must be continued after discharge. You may brush your teeth with a regular toothbrush if your platelet count is above 50,000. Otherwise, use a sponge swab called a toothette or an ex tra soft toothbrush. We will provide these for you. Oral rinses will be prescribed. Cata racts Radia tion and steroid therapy may increase the risk of cataracts. Blurriness and changes in vision are comm on symptoms. Other symptoms include dry eyes, a feeling of grittiness, burning, itching and sensitivity to light. Protective sunglasses and artificial tears (eye drops) can reduce the discomfort. Medical follow-up and surgical intervention may be required if cataracts develop. This can occur months or ye ars after exposure. Thyr oid Changes Thyroid problems may result if radiation is included in your conditioning regime n. Report symptoms such as lack of energy, sluggishness, depression, sleep disturbances, swelling, weight gain, and sparse or thinning hair. We will draw blood and test it to see how well yo ur thyroid is working. If needed, we can prescri be medication to replace thyroid hormones. Bone Loss Complications of St eroids - Avascular Necrosis, Osteopenia/Osteoporosis, and Steroid Myopathy Steroids are frequently used to control side effects during BMT but som etimes, they can cause serious side effects that cause problems with bone and muscle tissue. Avascular necrosis is the death of bone tissue due to a loss of the blood supply to that bone. The condition most comm only affects the ends of long bones such as the femur (thigh bone), the head of the humerus (arm bone), and knees. Early symptoms include a dull, aching sensation within the hip that becomes worse with weight bearing or extreme hip m otion. Any hip or s houlder pain or discomfort, limited range of m otion, or joint stiffness should be reported to your doctor. Surgery may be needed. A more frequent complication from steroid medication is a loss of bone density. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are related conditions caused by a loss of bone density. Osteoporosis is the more serious condition. Loss of bone density can lead to broken bones (fractures). We can mi nimize the bone loss caused by steroid medications with exercise and medication before and after your transplant. This would include calcium, vitamin D a nd bone strengthening exercises. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 41 In addi tion, you may be given medicati ons called bisph osphonates, along wi th calcium and vitamin D, to pre vent or reverse bone loss. Bisph osphonat es can cause a rare complication calle d osteonecrosis o f the jaw or ONJ. This condi tion causes the jaw bone to weak en and die. It is importan t to have your te eth moni tored by a dentist to prevent toot h complicati ons. Steroid myopathy is damage t o the muscle fiber s. Using steroid medications causes a decrea se in muscle mass /size (muscle atroph y) and weakn ess. This condi tion may make it diffi cult to climb stairs or rise from a seat ed posi tion. Li fting objects may be di fficul t. Other sym ptoms include a dull, aching sensation in the hip or shoulder ar ea or limit ed range of motion. Muscle str ength usually returns over time, however, in some cases, the muscle h as too much damage and full recovery is n ot possible. It is criti cally impor tant to maintain physical acti vity before, during, an d after the trans plant pro cess. Secondary Malignancy Sometimes, pe ople who have h ad chemo an d/or radiati on may develop a seco nd, new type of cancer. The risk of a s econd canc er is outweigh ed by the benefits of a transplant. When your do ctor makes the rec ommendati on to use chemoth erapy and/or radiation, it is beca use he or she believ es that the risk o f not treating your first canc er is worse than the risk o f possible side effects (i ncluding a n ew cancer) that may occur in the future. A second ary canc er can occur any time aft er chem otherapy and radiation - at any p oint in a patient's life. The medi cal team sees post-t ransp lant patients every 1-2 years for life to screen for this possibl e complicati on. Some of the most common seco are ( MDS), skin cancer, and oth er solid tumo rs such as lung cancer. Talk to you r heal th care providers re garding your risk. In addi tion, you should continue the usu al canc er screening such as mammograms, pa p smears, and c olonoscopies. Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD) You m ay devel op Graft ve rsus Host D isease. You may be off ered the chance to receive a protoc ol/trial to decrease the chanc es of devel oping GvHD o r to treat it. Except f or identical twin s, there is some degree of inc ompatibility (mis match) b etween all donor and reci pient p airs, even if they have ma tching HLA a ntigen s. GvHD is a commo n complicati on following allog eneic BMT. The disease c an range from mild to li fe-threatening, with sh ort-term or l ong-term sym ptoms. ccurs when T-c ells from don or's immune system recognize p roteins (a ntigen s) on th e recipient 's cells as foreign. GvHD may have a benefi cial effect - the don or cells help wipe out th e recipient s' severe underlying cancer, even if it h as been resis tant t o chem o. But too much GvHD may cau se severe problem s, even death. The inci dence and sev erity of GvHD varies dependi ng up on the d egree and typ es of differences between the don or and recipient: If HLA a ntigens test ed are compatible, th e incidence of GvHD is less . But not all pe ople are able to find a don or who matches them completel y. Certain a ntigen mismat ches lems than o thers. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 42 Depe nding on the HLA matchi ng and the type o f transpla nt, GvHD may be mo re or less severe. Differ ent comp lications may arise with old er patients re quiring di fferen t transplan t approaches. Newer treatments are improving the cont rol of GvHD. Patients who develop sym ptoms of GvHD may n eed a skin biopsy, upper or lowe r endosc opy, liver biopsy, endoscopic lung biops y , or lavage to de termine if t here is GvHD or some ot her medical comp lication. GvHD c an also o ccur from a blood transfusion if the blood is not properly prepared becaus e the white blood cells in the pro duct can react agai nst the recipient. To help pre vent trans fusion-associat ed GvHD, all Roswell Park blood pro ducts (plasma, red cells, and p latelets) are irradiat ed befo re trans fusion. Not all tals nely u se this pr actice. Discu bloo d product trans fusion with your cl inical tea m. You will receive a bracelet th at stat es all bloo d products that you rec eive should be fi ltered and i rrad iated . (Radiati on inactivates all donor white blood cells but not the re d cells or plat elets.) GvHD c an be ac ute or chronic. Pati ents may experience non e, one or both t ypes. Acute GvHD usually o ccurs within the first 100 days of an allogeneic BMT . Chronic GvHD usually occu rs after the first 100 days and up to several years after transplant. Some form of GvHD pre vention (p rophylaxis) is star ted during your allo geneic BMT. It is critical that you take your anti -GvHD medications and noti fy your do ctor, nurse p ractitione r, physi cian assista nt, or if having prob lems. Anti- GvHD medi cations are frequently adjuste d after your transpl ant. The mo st common agents used to pre vent GvHD are tacrolimus ( d (hap mide (done af ter the donor ce lls are infused ) - OR- screen out the do nor T-ce lls most likely to cause an int ense reaction ( done be fore the donor ce lls are infus ed). You may be o ffered a clinical t rial that looks at new approac hes to managing GvHD. The memb ers of the transpl ant team are here to help you cope with all transp lant challenges. Acute GvH D (aGvH D) Acute GvHD usually affects the skin ( rash), GI tract (nausea, vomiti ng, diarrhea), and liver (yellowing ski n, dark urine). Sym ptoms may range from mild to seri ous, occur alone or together , or last a long t ime Gastroi ntestinal (GI) irritations c an make it diffi cult to properly absorb n utrients and can l ead to problems wi th swall owing or eati ng, heartburn, stomach pain, weight loss, and loss of appeti te. In seve re cases, p ermanent disa bility or death may occur. Fortunately, severe problem s do n ot happ en often, but it is very impor tant to promp tly report all s ymptoms y ou are having. Fortunatel y, most patients recover wi thout significant long-term side effect s. Researchers at Roswell Pa rk and all over the world co ntinue to investiga te ways to re duce the complicati ons of GvHD.PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 43 Chronic GvHD (cGvHD) The symptoms of chronic GvHD are often different than acute GvHD. Chronic GvHD (cGvHD) can weaken the imm une system, as can the immunosuppressive drugs used to treat it. Coping with this condition can be very challenging and you and your family may feel very frustrated. Chronic GvHD does have an anti-tumor effect and keeps the underlyi ng disease from recurring. There may be a cGvHD study for you that will treat the cGvHD and help us understand its causes. Chro nic Gv HD can cause: More infections (GvHD weakens your natural barriers (skin and mucous membranes) to infection. Good personal hygiene practices are very important! Liver problems: yellow skin, dark urine, and change in how you break down medicines Skin problems: rash, itching, changes in skin color, premature gray ing, hair loss (Severe problems include blistering, peeling, and scarring) Eye problems: dryness, burning, grittiness, irritation, and extreme sensitivity to light Mouth problems: dry or burning mouth and mouth sores GI problems: difficulty swallowing, feeling full, loss of appetite, and diarrhea Vision problems Tightening of the tendons in joints that can make arm and leg movem ent difficult. Lung complications. Pulmonary function testing (PFTs) should be performed regularly after your transplant to assess your lung function. Identifying lung problems early can prevent long term lung damage. Medication side effects: steroids may cause diabetes (which may require insulin or oral medications), mood swings, depression, and anxiety Medications/Trea tments used to prior authorization from your insurance company. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 44 Infections While waiting for your new cells to engraft (before your blood count recove ry) your white blood cell counts will be low. This means you are at a high risk for developing infections. At this point in time, infection can be critical and even life-threatening. Infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. You will receive medication to prevent infection. Types of Infections Bacterial Infections Your body is host to thousands of types of bacteria that are important in keeping you healthy. Most bacterial infections are caused by organisms that are already present on your body. When your immune system is weak, your ability to fight bacterial infections is changed in sever al ways. The skin and mucous membrane barriers that normally prevent bacteria from entering the body are damag ed. White blood cells that are responsible for fighting bacteria are not present. Fungal Infections Candida and Aspergill us infections are the most comm on fungal infections after transplant. Candida fungi and bacteria live all over your body including the mouth and vagina. Taking antibiotics can affect the bacteria that normally regulate Candida growth. This can lead to Ca ndida overgr owth and a fungal infection. Aspergillus is a fungus found in the environment (soil, air). It can cause infection in the lungs and sinus cavities. Fungal infections can be difficult to treat and life-threatening. You will be giv en antifungal medications to prevent infection. Viral Infections Viral infections after transplant can occur as a result of being exposed to a new virus or reactivation of an old vi rus that is dormant (sleeping) in your body. Viral infections are also difficult to treat and are most common during the first 12 months following BMT. The most comm on infections are caused by herpes simplex virus (cold sores), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella zoster virus (chicken pox, shingles). You will be giv en anti-viral medications to help prevent infection. Bleeding Precautions After transplant, you are at an increased risk for bleeding because your platelet count is low. Your platelets will begin to rise as your bone marrow recove rs. Platelets usually take a few days longer to grow back than white blood cells. Sym ptoms of a low platelet count Nose bleeds Bleeding gums Bruising Bleeding from any body cavity or injury Bleeding longer than usual from a procedure Blood in the urine or stool (which may not be detectable by sight) PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 45 Transf usions Once your platelet counts are below 10,000 (sometimes called less than 10), you may have bleeding when there has not been an injury, and you will receive platelet transfusions. This bleeding may be very serious if it occurs in the brain or other parts of the body. These guidelines will help you prevent bleeding. Take good care of yo ur skin and lips. Moisturize daily a nd as needed. Dry or cracked skin and lips are prone to bleeding, as well as infection. Use only an electric razor. Use a nail file or e mery board to keep finger and toenails groom ed. Avoid use of nail clippers, which may lead to unintended injury or infection. Wear shoes or slippers at all times when you are not in bed and remove them before getting back into bed. Avoid blowi ng your nose forcefully. Avoid high impact exerc ise or any activity that has a potential for injury. Avoid straining with bowel movem ents. If you are constipated, tell your doctor or nurse. Prevent injury to your mouth. Do not use toothpicks or dental floss. Cleanse with a sponge toothette or extra-soft toothbrush, depending on your platelet count. Avoid extremely high temperature foods or sharp utensils. Do not use a rectal thermometer, suppository, enema, tampon, or douche. Report a headache or lightheadedness to a nurse imm ediately. Reme mber to save all urine and stool in the collection hat so we can inspect and test for blood and infection. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 46 Advance Directives Sometimes a patient's cancer proves to be resist ant to all therapies we have to offer. No matter how hard the patient, family, and transplant team try, occasionally the BMT does not work, or insurmountable complications arise and death results. Having a potentially fatal illness, and undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation only point out how fragile life may be. At Roswell Park, we believe that patients should discuss their end of life wishes with their family, loved ones and medical providers to make sure their wishes are honored. All Ros well Park patients are asked to complete Advance Directives, Health Care Proxy, Do Not Resuscitate orders, and the Medical Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) form. Please speak to your transplant team about the purpose of each of the forms, and how to complete them so your wishes will be followed if you become unable to ma ke decisio ns. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 47 Life aft er Transplant Maintaining your health insurance is critical to your long term care and recovery after discharge. All insurance changes should be reported to Patient Regist ration. Please direct any questions or concerns to your social worker. Infertility While infertility can be a side effect of high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation, not all BMT patients will experience this side effect. Please let your BMT physician know if you have any concerns about fertility. Relapse Occasionally a transplant does not achieve its goa l, and the patient's disease doesn't go into remission or reoccurs. This can be devastating to a patient and his or her family. If this happens, there are other treatment options such as new therapies and clinical trials, (studies that are evaluating promising new treatments). Additional cellular therapy or a seco nd transplant may be offered. At times, after considerable discussion with the patient, family, and the clinical team, a consult is requested for palliative care services or hospice services may be offered. This path is meant to provide support to the patient and family to optimize the remainder of life. Your Discharge Discharge planning begins on the day of admiss ion. Several days before your discharge, a check list will be placed on your door. Eve ryone from the BMT team will need to see you and mark in their appropriate sections. Pharmacy will need to see you either the day before or the day of discharge, in the presence of yo ur caregiver, to go over all medications with both of you. On the day of discharge, your nurse will review the medications again along with any other specific instructions. Discharge time should be no later than 11:00 am. After your discharge, you will be cared for as an outpatient. The outpatient BMT Center is open every day. Monday through Friday, the center is open from 7:00 am until 5:00 pm. Hours vary on weekends and holidays. If any problems occur, please call us at (716) 845-1444. For concerns after hours, please call the Roswell Park switchboard at (716) 845-2300 and ask for the BMT physician on call. If you have not received a response within 10-15 minutes, please repeat the call. At yo ur first clinic visit, you should bring your pillbox and all your medications, your sc hedule of medications, and your primary caregiver. Before leaving the BMT Center, please set up your next clinic appointment time along with any addi tional tests or procedures you need. If you live more than 45 minutes away from Roswell P ark Cancer Institute, you will be expected to stay locally up to day + 100 or longer, based upon your medical condition and at your BMT PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 48 physician's discretion. Our social work department will work with you to secure lodging at one of the local facilities approved for post BMT living. Your Ou tpatient V isits You will be seen in the BMT Center the day after discharge. The frequency of clinic visits depends on variables such as transfusion needs, electrolyte replacem ent, hydration, nutrition status, and medication management. We encourage caregivers to accompany you on your visits to the clinic so they can ask questions, and stay involved in your care. Blood will usually be drawn in the phlebotomy department before most clinic visits. If your lab results indicate a red blood cell or platelet transfusion is necessary, you will require treatment while you are in clinic. As a post -transplant patient you may be able to return to your regular hematologists/ oncologists for interim care approximately day +100 after clearance by the BMT physician. Your Day 100 workup will be performed at Roswell Park Cancer Ins titute. It is crucial that you keep your BMT Clinici ans informed about any problems that arise. Please contact the Outpatient BMT Center if you h ave any of these symptoms: Temperature of 100.4\u00b0 F (38.0\u00b0 C) or above Sudden onset of cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing Worse ning fatigue Changes in skin appearance Feeli ng dizzy, lightheaded, or falling Nausea or vomiting not controlled with medication Difficulty urinating Increase in diarrhea and or diarrhea not controlled with medication, or constipation Increase or change in pain Altered mental status Bleeding We ask you to have a caregiver with you so you have help if you are feeling sick. This is a time of recove ry and recuperation but you may feel weak or fatigued, and may not have much appetite. Everyone's recovery time is different and some people take more time than others. Do not get discouraged if yo ur body takes longer to recover; give it the time and rest it needs. Physical therapy (PT) and exercise speeds your recovery. Your post discharge progress will be monitored closely in the BMT Center and the BMT team will be able to answer your questions and keep you informed of your plan of care. If you think of questions or concerns after your visit, please call the BMT Center at (716) 845-1444. Life af ter Discharge Your living space, whether it is your home or temporary housing, should be cleaned in preparation for your arrival. You should not do the cleaning! Your caregiver should be responsible for PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 49 maintaining a clean living space because you should not be exposed to any dusts, molds, or any other bugs. Most infections you get are a result of an overgrowth of the orga nisms that naturally exist in yo ur body. Al though your immune system is slow ly building itself back up, you are not yet ready to fight off infections. Please check with your team about when it is OK to start doing house hold chores again. The best way to prevent the spread of infection - and to keep you from getting sick - is good hand washing! Your family and anyone who comes to visit you should be washing their hands frequently. Other ways to protect yourself from infections When you come to the Center or go out in public, wear the mask the BMT team gave you. You do not need to wear a mask while in the car or at home around healthy family members or if you're out in the yard (unless you live around a construction area). Discourage people who do not feel well from visiting you. Avoid large crowds until you have been cleared by your physician. This includes movie theatres, grocery stores, restaurants, places of worship, and outdoor functions such as football gam es, fairs, etc. If you are unsure please ask a member of the BMT team. If other members of your household become sick with a cold or flu, inform your BMT team. Avoid close contact with them and wash y our hands frequently and thoroughly. Flu shots are recomm ended for all caregivers and close family members. You should wear a mask if you need to be in close contact with the individual or ask the individual to wear a mask around you until recovered. Contact with pets is safe as long as they have remained in the home, do not live outdoors, and all their immunizations are up to date. It is very important to avo id litter boxes, feces, birds, and reptiles. Do not clean fish, turtle, or reptile tanks, gerbil/hamster cages, litter boxes, or clean up after a dog. Birds should not be kept in yo ur house. They carry infections that may be harmful to you. You should not work in the yard or garden or dig in the soil as there are organisms that can cause infections to your weakened immune system. If you have a central venous line or are neutropenic, do not go swimmi ng in pools, oceans, lakes, or hot tubs. Maintaining a clean home is extremely important to preventing you from getting any infections. The patient should not do the cleaning. Here are some guidelines for your caregiver to properly clean to help you stay healthy: Dust, mold and fungus should be minimized Bathrooms and eating areas should be cleaned daily Dirty sponges should be cleaned at least every 3 days either in a dishwasher or washing mac hine Use cleaners with disinfectant properties such as Lysol or Clor ox When dusting, use a damp cloth or a Swiffer Wet Jet or disposable duster PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 50 Make sure air filters are cleaned or replaced frequently Patients should avoid pesticides, solvents and fertilizers Patients should also avoid outside areas where there is freshly mowed grass, hay, disturbed earth, and construction areas Do not have any dental work done, even cleaning, until your physician has said it is safe to do so. Extra measures may need to be taken to prevent an infection or bleeding. We will review your medications at every visit following discharge. It is very important that you take your medications as prescribed and not miss any doses. Ke ep track of any medications that need to be refilled and alert the provider if you do not have any refills, or let the BMT nurse know at yo ur clinic visit. Please call at least 3 days in advance for refills. Protect your skin from direct sun exposure. Some medications cause skin sensitivity when exposed to sunlight. Avoid direct sunlight between 10:00 a.m. a nd 5:00 p.m. because that is when the sun is at its peak. If you must be outside during this time, be sure to wear a hat, sunglasses and a long sleeve shirt and pants. It is recomm ended that you reapply sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher every 30 minutes. Use a sunscreen that is PABA free to reduce the chance of skin irritation. Nutrition Adequate nutrition is very important after your transplant. You need a proper intake of calories, protein, vitamins, and minerals to promote healing and reduce side effects. Some common side effects of treatment - poor appetite, taste changes, sensitivity to smells, mouth sores, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and constipation - may interfere with your nutritional intake. When you are discharged, you must follow the diet guidelines. You must remain on this diet up to day 100, which is ab out 3 months after your day zero (e.g. the day of transplant). Tips to help mee t your nutritional goals You may need to eat 5-6 small er me als rather than 2-3 larger meals a day. To increase calories and protein, nourishing snacks or liquid supplements such as Carnation\u00ae Instant Breakfast, Boost\u00ae, Ensure\u00ae, Isopure\u00ae, or homemade shakes made with protein powder such as Gold S tandard\u00ae Protein Powder may be added between or with meals. You can increase calories by adding these foods when cooking: butter, margarine or oil, whipped cream, high fat dairy products, cheeses, salad dressings or other dips and spreads, nuts and nut butters, and honey or jams. Also, add bread, rice, and pasta to me at and vege tables dishes. Exercisi ng for 10-15 minutes before you eat will help s timulate your appetite. A pleasant atmosphere or meals enjoyed with friends or family can also help stimulate the appetite. Taste changes/sm ell sensitivity Adjust the seasonings and flavorings in your food to accomm odate taste changes. If cooking smells are unpleasant, try cool or chilled foods. Avoid very spicy foods and beverages such as hot sauce, and those with an overpowering aroma. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 51 If you have mouth sores Experiment with different textures of foods. Pureed and soft foods may be easier to eat. Moisten your foods by addi ng extra gravy, butter, margarine, sauces, soups, or broth. Avoid highly fibrous, coarse, and rough foods such as raw fruits, vegetables, and bran products. Avoid very dry foods such as crackers and toast unless consumed with large amounts of liquid. Acidic foods such as tomatoes and citrus fruits and juices (such as orange juice or cranberry juice) may cause discomfort. Nause a/vomiting Try clear liquids, carbohydrates (crackers, toast if you do not have mouth sores, rice, cereal and pasta) and cold foods. Foods more likely to cause nausea are greasy/fried foods, spicy or acidic foods. Avoid foods with strong or unpleasant odors (including during cooking). Constipation Increase fluid and fiber intake by eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grain products, beans, nuts, and dried fruit such as raisins and prunes. Diarrhea Avoid high fiber, high-fat desse rts and snacks, spicy foods, and fried foods. Be sure to replace the fluid lost with diarrhea by consuming adequate fluids throughout the day. Milk contains lactose, a sugar in milk. It may be a factor in aggrava ting the diarrhea. You may ask for medication to help tolerate lactose. Lactose-free milk a nd dairy free alternatives (such as soy or almond milk) are widely avail able. You may need to use lactose-free milk or increase intake of yog urt, with active cultures, until the diarrhea significantly decre ases. Talk to your clinical team about medications that may help relieve these symp toms. Never smoke, chew tobacco or use vapor products. Avoid all alcoholic beverages. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 52 Physical Activity and Recreation to Ma intain Strength and Improve Recovery You may find that once you are discharged home, you are more fatigued than you thought you would be. This is normal. How quickly you recuperate depends on a number of factors including your blood counts, nutrition, and activity level. Regular activity will help y ou regain your strength more quickly, even if you begin with a short walk or a flight of stairs. Independent functioning is a key factor in regaining endurance. It may be difficult to imm ediately resume all of your normal activities when you get home. It is important to do what you can for yourself in or der to regain your strength and independence. It is also important to realize any limits you may have and ask for assis tance as needed. Remember, though, to pace yourself. This simply me ans planning your daily sch edule with the most demanding activities early in the day and allowing for breaks as needed. Space your activities throughout the day and week. Exercise is the most important thing and you need to limit computer/TV screen time to 2 hours a day. Most patients are not physically strong enough to return to the workplace for sev eral weeks or even months. This usually means that you may have an increased amount of free time. Ta ke the opportunity to do som ething you enjoy. Maybe it is time to get back to a hobby, read a good book, visit with friends or family, or do whatever it is you like to do. Getting involved in recreation and leisure activities is an excellent way to increase strength and endurance. These activities are also a great way to reduce stress. Do not hesitate to ask your provider for guidance about your activities. Sexu ality (Please discuss any questions you may have with your c linical team) Intimacy is an important part of a healthy relationship, but some patients may be embarrassed to ask when they can resume sexu al activities after BMT. The decision is based on many individualized factors including recovery of yo ur neutrophil and platelet count. In general, you may have sexual intercourse when you no longer need a transfusion to maintain your platelet count greater than 50,000. Additionally, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than 1,000 without growth factor support. Even if this criteria is met, it is important to wear condoms to protect yourself against Human Imm unodeficiency Virus (HIV), Her pes Simplex Virus (HSV), Human papillomavir us (HPV) or any other viruses or sexu ally transmitted diseas es (such as chlamy dia, gonorrhea, syphilis) that could be transmitted through vaginal or sem inal fluid. Good communication with your partner is needed, as many men and women experience a decre ase in their desire and find they do not have the same interest in sex that they did before their transplant. These are comm on feelings that can relate to your illness, recovery time, medication side effects, and general health. If these problems continue longer than you expect or are causing significant stress on your relationship, please discuss them with yo ur BMT clinician. Many women experience early menopause, which can cause the vagina to become dry and less flexible. The decrease in vaginal secretions can make intercourse painful. There are over the counter water-based lubricants that can help r elieve these symptoms such as KY Jelly\u00ae or Astroglide\u00ae. If the discomfort continues despite using these products, please talk to your BMT clinician for further evaluation. Their recomm endation may depend on your specific diagnosis, history, and associa ted treatment. PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 53 Men may experience difficulty either getting or maintaining an er ection. This issue may be caused by a variety of factors including hormonal levels, supportive medications, chemotherapy, or radiation. We recommend discussing this issue with your BMT clinician for further evaluation or a referral to a specialis t. Immun izations and Vacc ines After having a blood or marrow transplant, you will have some changes, at le ast temporarily, to your body's im mune system. A dult patients who have had a blood or marrow transplant may have only a short-term immune system deficiency. You will need to have your immunizations repeated beginning 6 months after treatment. Annual BMT Clinic In order to maintain our continued comm itment to yo ur successful recovery, the BMT program has established an a nnual clinic to provide follow-up care and information about how to protect your health over the long term. It is open to anyone who has undergone a blood stem cell or marrow transplant (BMT), even if the transplant did not take place at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. The clinic does not replace your regular follow-up clinic visits. It adds an extra level of care, monitoring you for health issues that can arise long after a transplant. It provides you, and the medical professionals who care for you, with important information to keep you healthy as a survivor after a cancer diagnosis. Your Care givers A caregiver is the person who will be responsible for taking care of you after you leave the hospital. Your caregiver must make sure that all of your needs are met. Being a caregiver is an important responsibility and you will need to choose this person very carefully. This person must be able to help you in many different ways while taking care of themselves too. It can be an adjustment for everyone and requires understanding and patience. Choose a primary and a seco ndary caregiver . At least 1 caregiver (the main one) must attend the required caregiver class before you are admitted. Caregiver's responsibilities include: Providing transportation to and from the BMT Outpatient Center and tracking appointments Observi ng changes in your condition and reporting them to the clinic Calli ng for medical care, if needed Monitoring medication schedules Assisti ng with meal preparation and diet restrictions Assisti ng you with personal hygiene needs Assisti ng with medical planning Servi ng as a communication link and advoca te Being physically present with you Giving encouragement Reporting temperatures of 100.4\u00b0 F (38.0 C) or above PE1117 \u00a9 2016 Roswell Park Cancer Institute Patient Education 3/2016 54 Taking Care of the Caregiver Caregivers do so much for you that they will need to take care of themselves too, especially if they are your spouse, parent, or child. Caregivers must remember to exercise, eat a proper diet, and get adequate sleep in order to help you the most. Your caregiver might experience a mix of emotions about taking on this new role. Supporting your caregiver is esse ntial during this time of adjustment. While you are in the hospital, we do not recomm end your caregiver stay every night - this may lead to exhaustion. The caregiver should: take care of their own personal health take a break when they can know their limits and ask for help form a caregiver team to provide backup join a support group (information provided at the caregiver orientation) seek relaxation Helpful Hints for the Careg iver Develop a schedule for the week and include clinic appointments, medications, physical exercise, and central venous line care Maintain a log of what the patient has had to eat or drink Keep a list of questions to bring with you to the next clinic appointment Develop a telephone-calling tree to get information to family and friends Use email or a web site to keep friends and family posted If you are in need of handicap parking, please ask our social worker for the Department of Motor Vehicles Handicap Form. Our BMT clinicians will fill it out and you will then need to return it to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Patient/Donor Confidentiality Blood & Marrow Transplant patients and donors are ALWA YS anonymous to one another for a minimum of 1 year after transplant. In some cases, you are allowed to send anonymous correspondence before one year. Rules about contact vary by country. Please speak with your BMT Coordinator for more information about donor contact. The identity of cord blood donors is confidential. The units are listed by number and cord blood bank. There is never any personally identifying information availa ble. You will be told the gender of the baby and their blood type.
