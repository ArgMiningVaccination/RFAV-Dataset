G436 (5) Receive all services outlined in the plan of care; G438 (6) Have a confidential clinical record. Access to or release of patient information and clinical records is permitted in accordance with 45 CFR parts 160 and 164. \u00a7484.50(c)(6) 45 CFR Part 160 and 164 pertain to requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\"). The HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164), Security Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and C of Part 164), and Breach Notification Rules (45 CFR 164 \u00a7164.400 -414) protect the privacy and security of health information and provide individuals with certain rights rega rding their health information as follows: CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 9 G438 (continued) The Privacy Rule sets national standards for covered entities (health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers that conduct certain health care transactions electronically) and their business associates, including appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information (PHI) and the limits and conditions under which PHI is permitted or required to be used or disclosed ; The Security Rule specifies safeguards that covered entities and their business associates must implement to p rotect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information ( ePHI) ; and The Breach Notification Rule requires covered entities and their business associates to notify affected individuals, U.S. Department of Healt h & Human Services (HHS), and in some cases, the media of a breach of unsecured PHI. The HIPAA Privacy Rule also gives certain patients' rights over their health information, including rights to examine and obtain a copy of their health records, and to req uest corrections. HHAs have unique concerns and risks regarding staff and contractors who transport documents and/or electronic devices containing PHI such as during their visits to patient's homes . Compliance with \u00a7484.50(c)(6) is evidenced by document ation of HIPAA training for all staff and monitoring HIPAA compliance to manage the risk of inappropriate PHI disclosure or unsecured ePHI. Each covered entity and business associate is responsible for ensuring its compliance with the HIPAA Privacy, Secur ity, and Breach Notification Rules, as applicable, including consulting appropriate counsel as necessary.

The patient and representative (if any), have a right to be informed of the HHA's policies for transfer and discharge. The HHA may only transfer or discharge the patient from the HHA if: G454 (1) The transfer or discharge is necessary for the patient's welfare because the HHA and the physician or allowed practitioner who is responsible for the home health plan of care agree that the HHA can no longer meet the patient's needs, based on the patient's acuity. The HHA must arrange a safe and appropriate transfer to other care entities when the needs of the patient exceed the HHA's capabilities; \u00a7484.50(d)(1) When a patient's care needs change to require more than intermittent services or require specia lized services not provided by the agency, the HHA must inform the patient , patient representative , (if any), and the physician who is responsible for the patient's home health plan of care, that the HHA cannot meet the patient's needs without potentially adverse outcomes. Th e HHA should assist the patient and his or her representative (if any ) in choosing an alternative entity by identifying those entities in the patient's geographic area that may be able to meet the patient's needs based on the patient's acuity. Once the patient chooses an alternate entity, the HHA must contact that entity to facilitate a safe transfer . The HHA must ensure timely transfer of patient information to the alternate entity to facilitate continuity of care , i.e., the HHA must ensure that patient information is provided to the alternate entity prior to or simultaneously with the initiation of patient services at the new entity. Also see \u00a7484.110(a)(6)(ii) regarding time frame requirement for the transfer summary. G456 (2) The patient or payer will no longer pay for the services provided by the HHA; G458 (3) The transfer or discharge is appropriate because the physician or allowed practitioner who is responsible for the home health plan of care and the HHA agree that the measurable outcomes and goals set forth in the plan of care in accordance with \u00a7484.60(a)(2)(xiv) have been achieved, and the HHA and the physician or allowed practitioner who is responsible for the home health plan of care agree that the patient no longer needs the HHA's services; G460 (4) The patient refuses services, or elects to be transferred or discharged; \u00a7484.50(d)(4) A patient who occasionally declines a service is distinguished from a patient who ref uses service altogether, or who habitually declines skilled care visits. It is the patient's right to refuse services. It is the agency's responsibility to educate the patient on the risks and potential adverse outcomes that can result from refusing services. In the case of patient refusals of skilled care, the HHA must document its com munication with the physician , who is responsible for the patient's home health plan of care, as well as , the mea sures the HHA CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 12 G460 (continued) took to investigate the patient's refusal and the interventions the HHA attempted in order to obtain patient participation with the plan of care. The HHA may consider discharge if the patient's decision to decline services compromises the agency's ability to safely and effectively deliver care to the extent that the agency can no longer meet the patient's needs. G462 (5) The HHA determines, under a policy set by the HHA for the purpose of addressing discharge for cause that meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (D)(5)(iii) of this section, that the patient's (or other persons in the patient's home) behavior is disruptive, abusive, or uncooperative to the extent that delivery of care to the patient or the ability of the HHA to operate effectively is seriously impaired.

Each patient must receive, and an HHA must provide, a patient - specific, comprehensive assessment. For Medicare beneficiaries, the HHA must verify the patient's eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit including homebound status, both at the time of the initial assessment visit and at the time of the comprehensive assessment. G512 \u00a7484.55(a) Standard: Initial assessment visit . G514 (1) A registered nurse must conduct an initial assessment visit to determine the immediate care and support needs of the patient; and, for Medicare patients, to determine eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit, including homebound status. The initial assessment visit must be held either within 48 hours of referral, or within 48 hours of the pa tient's return home, or on the physician or allowed practition er- ordered start of care date. \u00a7484.55(a)(1) For patients receiving only nursing services or both nursing and rehabilitation therapy services, a registered nurse must conduct the initial assessment visit. Fo r patients receiving rehabilitation therapy services only , the initial assessment may be made by the applicable reh abilitation skilled professional rather than the registered nurse. See \u00a7484.55(a)(2) The initial assessment bridges the gap between when the first patient encounter occurs and when a plan of care can be implemented. \"Immediate care and support needs \" are those items and services that will maintain the patient 's health and safety through this interim period , i.e., until the HHA can complete the comprehensive assessment and implement the plan of care . \"Immediate care and support needs\" may include medication, mobility aids for safety, skilled nursing treatments, and items to address fall risks, and nutritional needs. The clinical record must demonstrate that homebound status/eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit was determined and docu mented during the initial visit. An HHA that is unable to complete the initial assessment within 48 hours of referral or the patient's return home , shall not request a different start of care date from the ordering physician to ensure compliance with the r egulation or to accommodate the convenience of the agency. In instances where the patient requests a delay in the start of care date, the HHA would need to contact the physician to request a change in the start of care date and such change would need to be documented in the medical record. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 17 G516 (2) When rehabilitation therapy service (speech language pathology, physical therapy, or occupational therapy) is the only service ordered by the physician or allowed practitioner who is responsible for the home health plan of care, and if the need for that service establishes program eligibility, the initial assessment visit may be made by the appropriate rehabilitation skilled professional. G518 \u00a7484.55(b) Standard: Completion of the comprehensive assessment . G520 (1) The comprehensive assessment must be completed in a timely manner, consistent with the patient's immediate needs, but no later than 5 calendar days after the start of care. \u00a7484.55(b)(1) The start of care date i s considered to be the first visit where the HHA actually provides hands on, direct care services or treatments to the patient. If an initial assessment is completed without any direct care services being provided by the HHA during the assessment visit, t he date of that initial assessment visit would not be the start of care date. The comprehensive assessment must be completed within 5 calendar days of the first visit where the HHA provides hands on, direct care services/treatments to the patient. G522 (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a registered nurse must complete the comprehensive assessment and for Medicare patients, determine eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit, including homebound status. G524 (3) When physical therapy, speech -language pathology, or occupational therapy is the only se rvice ordered by the physician or allowed practitioner , a physical therapist, speech -language pathologist or occupational therapist may complete the comprehensive assessment , and for Medicare patients, determine eligibility for the Medicare home health benefit, including homebound status. The occupational therapist may complete the comprehensive assessment if the need for occupational therapy establishes program eligibility. \u00a7484.55(b)(3) A qualified therapist (registered and/or licensed by the State in which they practice) should perform the comprehensive assessment for therapy services ordered.

The comprehensive assessment must accurately reflect the patient's status, and must include, at a minimum, the following information: G528 (1) The patient's current health, psychosocial, functional, and cognitive status; \u00a7484.55(c)(1) Completion of the comprehensive assessment should provide the HHA with a complete picture of the patient's status to assist the HHA in developing the patient's plan of care. Assessment of the patient's current health status includes relevant past medical history as well as all active health and medical problems. Assessment of a patient's psychosocial status and his/her functional capacity within the community is intended to be a screening of the patient's relationships , living environment , impact on the delivery of services and ability to participate in his / her own care. Assessment of a patient's functional status i ncludes the patient's level of ability to function independently in the home such as activities of daily living. Assessment of a patient's cognitive status refers to an evaluation of the degree of his or her ability to understand, remember, and participa te in developing and implementing the plan of care.

The HHA must ask the patient to identify her or his own strengths and must also independently identify the patient strengths to inform the plan of care and to set patient goals and measurable outcomes. Examples of patient strengths identified by HH As through observation and by patient self -identification may include : awareness of disease status, knowl edge of medications, motivation and readiness for change, motivation/ ability to perform self -care, and/or implement a therapeutic exercise program, und erstanding of a dietary regimen for disease management, vocational interests/hobbies, interpersonal relationships and supports, and financial stability. The intent of assessing patient care preferences is to engage the patient to the greatest degree possi ble to take an active role in their home care rather than placing the patient in a passive recipient role by informing the patient what will be done for them and when). \"Patient goal\" is defined as a patient -specific objective, adapted to each patient bas ed on the medical diagnosis, physician's orders, comprehensive assessment, patient input, and the specific treatments provided by the agency.

The HHA must follow accepted standards of practice, including the use of standard precautions, to prevent the transmission of infect ions and communicable diseases. \u00a7484.70(a) Standard precautions must be used to prevent transmission of infecti ous agents. \"Standard precautions \" are a group of infection practices that apply to all patients regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status at the time health care is delivered. Standard precautions are based on the principle that all blood, bo dy fluids, secretions, excretions, may contain transmissible infectious agents. The following are six (6) standard precautions, identified by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Healthcare Infection Control Practices Committee (HICPAC) which apply duri ng any episodes of patient care: 1. Hand Hygiene; 2. Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection; 3. Injection and Medication Safety; 4. Appropriate Use of Personal Protective Equipment; 5. Minimizing Potential Exposures; and 6. Reprocessing of reusable medical equipment between each patient and when soiled. 1. Hand Hygiene Hand Hygiene should be performed at a minimum: Before contact with a patient; Before performing an aseptic task (e.g., insertion of IV, preparing an injection, performing wound care); After co ntact with the patient or objects in the immediate vicinity of the patient; After contact with blood, body fluids or contaminated surfaces; Moving from a contaminated -body site to a clean body site during patient care; and After removal of personal protect ive equipment (PPE); The term \"Hand Hygiene\" includes both hand -washing with either plain or antiseptic - containing soap and water, and use of alcohol -based products (gels, rinses, foams) that do CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 34 G682 (continued) not require the use of water. In the absence of visible soiling of hands, approved alcohol - based products for hand disinfection are preferred over anti -microbial or plain soap and water because of their superior micro -biocidal activity, reduced drying of the skin, and convenience. The HHA must ensure that supplies necessary for adherence to hand hygiene are provided. 2. Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection Environmental cleaning and disinfection presents a unique challenge for HHA personnel. The HHA staff have little control over the home e nvironment but must maintain clean equipment and supplies during the home visit, during transport of reusable patient care items in a carrying case in the staff vehicle , and for use in multiple patients' homes. 3. Injection and Medication Safety Safe injection practices , to which all HHA staff must adhere, include but are not limited to: Use of aseptic technique when preparing and administering medications; Not reusing needles, lancets, or syringes for more than one use on one patient; Using single -dose vials for parenteral medications whenever possible; Not administering medications from a single -dose vial or ampule to multiple patients; Use of fluid infusion and administration sets (i.e ., intravenous bags, tubing and connectors) for one patient only an d disposal appropriately after use; Consider ing a syringe or needle/cannula contaminated once it has been used to enter or connect to patient's intravenous infusion bag or administration set; Enter ing medicati on containers with a new needle and a new syringe even when obtaining additional doses for the same patient; Insulin pens must be dedicated for a single patient and never shared even if the needle is changed; and, Sharps disposal is in compliance with ap plicable state and local laws and regulations. 4. Appropriate Use of Personal Protective Equipment Appropriate Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is the use of specialized clothing or equipment worn for protection and as a barrier against infectious materials or any potential infectious disease exposure. PPE protects the caregiver's skin, hands, face, respiratory tract, and/or clothing from exposure. Examples of PPE include: gloves, gowns, face masks, eye protections if there is the potential for ex posure to blood or body fluids of any patient. The CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 35 G682 (continued) selection of PPE is determined by the expected amount of exposure to the infectious materials, durability of the PPE, and suitability of the PPE for the task. 5. Minimizing Potential Exposures Minimizing Po tential Exposures focuses in the home health setting on prevention of exposure for other family members and visitors and the prevention of transmission by the HHA staff while transporting medical specimens and medical waste, such as sharps. 6. Reprocessing of Reusable Medical Equipment Between Each Patient and When Soiled Cleaning and disinfecting of reusable medical equipment is essential. Reusable medical equipment (e.g., blood glucose meters and other devices such as, blood pressure cuffs, oximeter probes) must be cleaned/disinfected prior to use on another patient and when soiled. The HHA must ensure that HHA staff are trained to: 1. Maintain separation between clean and soiled equipment to prevent cross contamination; and 2. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for use and current standards of practice for patient care equipment transport, storage, and cleaning/disinfecting. G684 \u00a7484.70(b ) Standard : Control . The HHA must maintain a coordinated agency -wide program for the surveillance, identification, prevention, control, and investigation of infectious and communicable diseases that is an integral part of the HHA's quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) prog ram. The infection control program must include : (1) A method for identifying infectious and communicable disease problems; and (2) A plan for the appropriate actions that are expected to result in improvement and disease prevention. \u00a7484.70(b) The HHA should have a program for the surveillance, identification , prevention , control and investigation of infectious and communicable disease s specific to care and services provided in the home setting. The CDC defines surveillance as \"the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and evaluation of health data closely integrated with the timely dissemination of this data to those who need it.\" As part of its infection control program, t he HHA should: 1) Observe and evaluate services from all discip lines to identify sources or causative factors of infection, track pa tterns and trends of infections; and 2) Establish a correct ive plan for infection control (if appropriate) and monitor effectiveness of the corrective plan. Cross Reference to \u00a7484.65(a), QAPI Program Scope. \u00a7484.70(b)(1) The HHA must develop a procedure for the identification of infections or risk of infections among patients.

The tasks must not be simulated in any manner, for example, the use of a mannequin is not acceptable. Definitions Pseudo -patient means a person trained to participate in a role -play situation, or a computer -based mannequin device. A pseudo -patient must be capable of responding to and interacting with the home health aide trainee, and must demonstrate the general characteristics of the primary patient population served by the HHA in key areas such as age, frailty, functional status, and cognitive status. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 45 G768 (continued) HHA aides who successful ly completed a competency evaluation prior to January 13, 2018, do not need to repeat the portions of the competency evaluation required to be done while providing services to a patient under 484.80(b)(i), (iii), (ix), (x), (xi). For all HHA aides who receive a competency evaluation after January 13, 2018, however, these skills must be tested while the aide is providing care to a patient. \u00a7484.80(c)(3) The competency evaluation may be completed by more than one RN. The RN(s) performing the competency evaluation should consult with and seek input f rom other skilled professionals in performing the competency evaluation. For example, an RN performing the competency evaluation should consult with a physical therapist regarding an HHA candidate's transfer or ambulation techniques. The RN(s) performing the competency evaluation is ultimately responsible for the competen cy assessment of the HHA aide, however. G770 (4) A home health aide is not considered competent in any task for which he or she is evaluated as unsatisfactory. An aide must not perform that task without direct supervision by a registered nurse until after he or she has received training in the task for which he or she was evaluated as \"unsatisfactory\" and has successfully completed a subsequen t evaluation. A home health aide is not considered to have successfully passed a competency evaluation if the aide has an \"unsatisfactory\" rating in more than one of the required areas.

G788 (3) Was subjected to an extended (or partially extended) survey as a result of having been found to have furnished substandard care (or for other reasons as determined by CMS or the state); or \u00a7484.80(f)(3) \"Sub-standard care \" is defined as care that is non-compliant with federal HHA regulations at a condition - level. If a partially extend ed survey is conducted, but no c ondition -level deficiency is found , then the HHA would not be precluded from offering its own aide training and/or competency evaluation program. If a condition -level deficiency is found during a partially extended or extended survey, then the HHA may complete any training course and competency evaluation program that is in progress, however, the HHA may not (1) accept new candidate s into the program; or (2) begin a new program for two years after receipt of written notice from the CMS Regional Office of such condition -level deficiency. Correction of the c ondition - level deficiency does not lift the two year restriction identified in this standard. G790 (4) Was assessed a civil monetary penalty of $50 00 or more as an intermediate sanction; or G792 (5) Was found to have compliance deficiencies that endangered the health and safety of the HHA's patients, and had temporary management appointed to oversee the management of the HHA; or G794 (6) Had all or part of its Medicare payments suspended; or CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 48 G796 (7) Was found under any federal or state law to have: (i) Had its participation in the Medicare program terminated; or (ii) Been assessed a penalty of $5000 or more for deficiencies in federal or state standards for HHAs; or (iii) Been subjected to a suspension of Medicare payments to which it otherwise would have been entitled; or (iv) Operated under temporary management that was appointed to oversee the operation of the HHA and to ensure the health and safety of the HHA's patients; or (v) Been closed, or had its patients transferred by the state; or (vi) Been excluded from participating in federal health care programs or debarred from participating in any government program. \u00a7484.80(f)(7) The most reliable source of infor mation to assure that an HHA has not been excluded from participating in federal health care programs is the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities on the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) website: https://oig.hhs.gov/exclusions/ . In addition, a reliable source to confirm whether an HHA has been debarred (in accordance with the debarment regulations at 2 CFR 180.300) is the System for Award Management (SAM) , an official website of the U.S. government: https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/##11#1 . G798 \u00a7484.80(g ) Standard : Home health aide assignments and duties . (1) Home health aides are assigned to a specific patient by a registered nurse or other appropriate skilled professional, with written patient care instructions for a home health aide prepared by that registered nurse or other appropriate skilled professional (that is, physical therapist, speech -language pathologist, or occupational therapist). \u00a7484.80( g)(1) The act of assi gning a \"specific patient\" to a HH aide should be an intentional & deliberate decision that takes into consideration the skills of the aide, the availability of the aide for patient care continuity, patient preference (when possible ), and other considerations as determined by the patient's care needs. Most generally, HH aide services are provided in conjunction with and as an adjunct to , a skilled nursing service. When both nursing and therapy services are involved, nursing staff mainta ins the overall responsibility for the written patient care instructions, with input from the other skilled professionals as appropriate. It is possible, however, that a skilled therapist may identify a patient need for HH aide services (as discussed in \u00a7484.80(b)(3) ) in association with a skilled therapy service only. In these cases , the skilled therapist may develop the plan for the HH aide and may perform the required HH aide supervision. Any concerns regarding the HH aide identified by the therapis t as part of the therapist's supervision must be communicated to the HHA clinical m anage r or supervising nurse whichever is appropriate.

Assistance may include items such as: Bringing a medication to the patient ei ther in a pill organizer or a medication container as requested by the patient or caregiver; Providing fluids to take with the medication; Reminding the patient to take a medication; Applying a topical product, such as a non -prescription cream, to intact s kin per home health aide instructions in how to apply it. G804 (4) Home health aides must be members of the interdisciplinary team, must report changes in the patient's condition to a registered nurse or other appropriate skilled professional, and must complete appropriate records in compliance with the HHA's policies and procedures. \u00a7484.80(g)(4) The term \"interdisciplinary\" refers to an approach to healthcare that includes a range of health service workers. The home health interdisciplinary team, which meets together, is composed of the disciplines including MDs, RNs, LPN/LVN, PT & PTA, OT & OTA, SLP, MSW, and HH aides. During interdisciplinary team meetings, all HHA staff involved in the patient's care must be present for, and, where appropriate, should contribute to, any discussion regar ding the patient's care.

The Home Health Agency (HHA) must comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local emergency preparedness requirements. The HHA must establish and maintain an emergency preparedness program that meets the requirements of this section. The emergency preparedness program must include, but not be limited to, the following elements: ***** Guidance specific to HHAs from State Operations Manual Appendix Z***** Under this condition/requirement, facilities are required to develop an emergency preparedness program that meets all of the standards specified within the condition/requirement. The emergency preparedness program must describe a facility's comprehensive a pproach to meeting the health, safety, and security needs of their staff and patient population during an emergency or disaster situation. The program must also address how the facility would coordinate with other healthcare facilities, as well as the whol e community during an emergency or disaster (natural, man -made, facility). The emergency preparedness program must be reviewed annually . A comprehensive approach to meeting the health and safety needs of a patient population should encompass the elements f or emergency preparedness planning based on the \"all - hazards\" definition and specific to the location of the facility. For instance, a facility in a large flood zone, or tornado prone region, should have included these elements in their overall planning in order to meet the health, safety, and security needs of the staff and of the patient population. Additionally, if the patient population has limited mobility, facilities should have an approach to address these challenges during emergency events. The term \"comprehensive\" in this requirement is to ensure that facilities do not only choose one potential emergency that may occur in their area, but rather consider a multitude of events and be able to demonstrate that they have considered this during their deve lopment of the emergency preparedness plan. Survey Procedures Interview the facility leadership and ask him/her/them to describe the facility's emergency preparedness program. Ask to see the facility's written policy and documentation on the emergenc y preparedness program. E0004 \u00a7484.102 (a) Emergency plan. The HHA must develop and maintain an emergency preparedness plan that must be reviewed and updated at least every 2 years. The plan must do all of the following: Facilities are required to develop and maintain an emergency preparedness plan. The plan must include all of the required elements under the standard. The plan must be reviewed and updated at least annually . The annual review must be documented to include the date of the review and any updates made to the emergency plan based on the review. The format of the emergency preparedness plan that a facility uses is at its discretion. An emergency plan is one part of a facility's emergency preparedness program. The plan provides the framework, which includes conducting facility -based and community -based risk assessments that will assist a facility in addressing the needs of their patient populations, along with identifying the continuity of business operations wh ich will provide support during an actual emergency. In addition, the emergency plan supports, guides, and ensures a facility's ability to collaborate with local emergency preparedness officials.

These include, but are not limited to: Natural disasters Man -made disasters, Facility -based disasters that include but are not limited to: o Care -related emergencies; o Equipment and utility failures, including but not limited to power, water, gas, etc.; o Interruptions in communication, including cyber -attacks; o Loss of all or portion of a facility; and o Interruptions to the normal supply of essential resources, such as water, food, fuel (heating, cooking, and generators), and in some cases, medications and medical supplies (including medical gases, if applicable). Emerging infectious disease (EID) threats such as Influenza, Ebola, Zika Virus and others. o These EIDs may require modifications to facility protocols to protect the health and safety of patients, such as isolation and personal protective equipment (PPE) measures. When evaluating potential interruptions to the normal supply of essential services, the facility should take into account the likely durations of such interruptions. Arrangements or contracts to re -establish essential utility services during a n emergency should describe the timeframe within which the contractor is required to initiate services after the start of the emergency, how they will be procured and delivered in the facility's local area, and that the contractor will continue to supply t he essential items throughout and to the end of emergencies of varying duration. Survey Procedures Verify the facility has an emergency preparedness plan by asking to see a copy of the plan. Ask facility leadership to identify the hazards (e.g. nat ural, man -made, facility, geographic, etc.) that were identified in the facility's risk assessment and how the risk assessment was conducted. Review the plan to verify it contains all of the required elements Verify that the plan is reviewed and upda ted annually by looking for documentation of the date of the review and updates that were made to the plan based on the review CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 57 E0006 (1) Be based on and include a documented, facility -based and community -based risk assessment, utilizing an all -hazards approach. (2) Include strategies for addressing emergency events identified by the risk assessment Facilities are expected to develop an emergency preparedness plan that is based on the facility -based and community -based risk assessment using an \"all -hazards\" approach. Facilities must document both risk assessments. An example consideration may include, but is not limited to, natural disasters prevalent in a facility's geographic region such as wildfires, tornados, flo oding, etc. An all -hazards approach is an integrated approach to emergency preparedness planning that focuses on capacities and capabilities that are critical to preparedness for a full spectrum of emergencies or disasters. This approach is specific to the location of the facility considering the types of hazards most likely to occur in the area. Thus, all -hazards planning does not specifically address every possible threat or risk but ensures the facility will have the capacity to address a broad range of related emergencies. Facilities are encouraged to utilize the concepts outlined in the National Preparedness System, published by the United States Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as well as guidance provided b y the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). \"Community\" is not defined in order to afford facilities the flexibility in deciding which healthcare facilities and agencies it considers to be part of its community for emergency planning purposes. However, the term could mean entities within a state or multi -state region. The goal of the provision is to ensure that healthcare providers collaborate with other entities within a given community to promote an integrated response. Conducting integrated planning with state and local entities could identify potential gaps in state and local capabilities that can then be addressed in advance of an emergency. Facilities may rely on a community -based risk assessment developed by other entities, such as publi c health agencies, emergency management agencies, and regional health care coalitions or in conjunction with conducting its own facility -based assessment. If this approach is used, facilities are expected to have a copy of the community -based risk assessme nt and to work with the entity that developed it to ensure that the facility's emergency plan is in alignment. When developing an emergency preparedness plan, facilities are expected to consider, among other things, the following: Identification of all business functions essential to the facility's operations that should be continued during an emergency; Identification of all risks or emergencies that the facility may reasonably expect to confront; Identification of all contingencies for which the facility should plan; Consideration of the facility's location; Assessment of the extent to which natural or man -made emergencies may cause the facility to cease or limit operations; and, CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 58 E0006 (continued ) Determination of what arrangements may be necessary with other health care facilities, or other entities that might be needed to ensure that essential services could be provided during an emergency. In situations where the facility does not own the structure(s) where care is provided, it is the facility's responsibility to discuss emergency preparedness concerns with the landlord to ensure continuation of care if the structure of the building and its utilities are impacted. Facilities must develop strategies for addressing emergency events that were identified during the development of the facility - and community -based risk assessments. Examples of these strategies may include, but are not limited to, developing a staffing strategy if staff shortages were identified during the risk assessment or developing a surge capacity strategy if the facility has identified it would likely be requested to accept additional patients during an emergency. Facilities w ill also want to consider evacuation plans. For example, a facility in a large metropolitan city may plan to utilize the support of other large community facilities as alternate care sites for its patients if the facility needs to be evacuated. The facilit y is also expected to have a backup evacuation plan for instances in which nearby facilities are also affected by the emergency and are unable to receive patients. Survey Procedures (E -0006) Ask to see the written documentation of the facility's risk ass essments and associated strategies. Interview the facility leadership and ask which hazards (e.g. natural, man -made, facility, geographic) were included in the facility's risk assessment, why they were included and how the risk assessment was conducted. Verify the risk -assessment is based on an all -hazards approach specific to the geographic location of the facility and encompasses potential hazards. E0007 (3) Address patient population including, but not limited to, the type of services the HHA has the ability to provide in an emergency; and continuity of operations, including delegations of authority and succession plans. The emergency plan must specify the population served within the facility, such as inpatients and/or outp atients, and their unique vulnerabilities in the event of an emergency or disaster. A facility's emergency plan must also address persons at -risk, except for plans of ASCs, hospices, PACE organizations, HHAs, CORFs, CMHCs, RHCs/FQHCs and ESRD facilities. A s defined by the Pandemic and All -Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) of 2006, members of at -risk populations may have additional needs in one or more of the following functional areas: maintaining independence, communication, transportation, supervision, and medical care. In addition to those individuals specifically recognized as at - risk in the PAHPA (children, senior citizens, and pregnant women), \"at -risk populations\" are also individuals who may need additional response assistance including those who have disabilities, live in institutionalized settings, are from diverse cultures and racial and ethnic CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 59 E0007 (continued ) backgrounds, have limited English proficiency or are non -English speaking, lack transportation, have chronic medical disorders, or have pharmacological depen dency. At - risk populations would also include, but are not limited to, the elderly, persons in hospitals and nursing homes, people with physical and mental disabilities as well as others with access and functional needs, and infants and children. Mobility is an important part in effective and timely evacuations, and therefore facilities are expected to properly plan to identify patients who would require additional assistance, ensure that means for transport are accessible and available and that those invo lved in transport, as well as the patients and residents are made aware of the procedures to evacuate. For outpatient facilities, such as Home Health Agencies (HHAs), the emergency plan is required to ensure that patients with limited mobility are addresse d within the plan. The emergency plan must also address the types of services that the facility would be able to provide in an emergency. The emergency plan must identify which staff would assume specific roles in another's absence through succession plan ning and delegations of authority. Succession planning is a process for identifying and developing internal people with the potential to fill key business leadership positions in the company. Succession planning increases the availability of experienced an d capable employees that are prepared to assume these roles as they become available. During times of emergency, facilities must have employees who are capable of assuming various critical roles in the event that current staff and leadership are not availa ble. At a minimum, there should be a qualified person who \"is authorized in writing to act in the absence of the administrator or person legally responsible for the operations of the facility.\" In addition to the facility - and community -based risk assessm ent, continuity of operations planning generally considers elements such as: essential personnel, essential functions, critical resources, vital records and IT data protection, alternate facility identification and location, and financial resources. Facili ties are encouraged to refer to and utilize resources from various agencies such as FEMA and Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) when developing strategies for ensuring continuity of operations. Facilities are encouraged to refer to an d utilize resources from various agencies such as FEMA and ASPR when developing strategies for ensuring continuity of operations. Survey Procedures ( E-0007) Interview leadership and ask them to describe the following: The facility's patient populatio ns that would be at risk during an emergency event; Services the facility would be able to provide during an emergency; How the facility plans to continue operations during an emergency; Delegations of authority and succession plans. Verify that all of the above are included in the written emergency plan. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 60 E0009 (4) Include a process for cooperation and collaboration with local, tribal, regional, State and Federal emergency preparedness officials' efforts to maintain an integrated response during a disaster or emergency situation . While the responsibility for ensuring a coordinated disaster preparedness response lies upon the state and local emergency planning authorities, the facility must document its efforts to contact these officials to engage in collaborative planning for an integrated emergency response. The facility must include this integrated response process in its emergency plan. Facilities are encouraged to participate in a healthcare coalition as it ma y provide assistance in planning and addressing broader community needs that may also be supported by local health department and emergency management resources. Survey Procedures Interview facility leadership and ask them to describe their process for ensuring cooperation and collaboration with local, tribal, regional, State, and Federal emergency preparedness officials' efforts to ensure an integrated response during a disaster or emergency situation. E0013 \u00a7484.102 (b) Policies and procedures. The HHA must develop and implement emergency preparedness policies and procedures, based on the emergency plan set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, risk assessment at paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and the communication plan at paragr aph (c) of this section. The policies and procedures must be reviewed and updated at least every 2 years . At a minimum, the policies and procedures must address the following: Facilities must develop and implement policies and procedures per the requirements of this standard. The policies and procedures are expected to align with the identified hazards within the facility's risk assessment and the facility's overall emergency preparedness program. We are not specifying where the facility must hav e the emergency preparedness policies and procedures. A facility may choose whether to incorporate the emergency policies and procedures within their emergency plan or to be part of the facility's Standard Operating Procedures or Operating Manual. However, the facility must be able to demonstrate compliance upon survey, therefore we recommend that facilities have a central place to house the emergency preparedness program documents (to include all policies and procedures) to facilitate review. Survey Proce dures Review the written policies and procedures which address the facility's emergency plan and verify the following: Policies and procedures were developed based on the facility - and community -based risk assessment and communication plan, utilizing a n all-hazards approach. Ask to see documentation that verifies the policies and procedures have been reviewed and updated on an annual basis . CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 61 E0017 (1) The plans for the HHA's patients during a natural or man - made disaster. Individual plans for each patient must be included as part of the comprehensive patient assessment, which must be conducted according to the provision at \u00a7484.55. HHAs must include policies and procedures in its emergency plan for ensuring all patients have an individualized plan in the event of an emergency. That plan must be included as part of the patient's comprehensive assessment. For example, discussions to develop individualized emergency preparedness plans could include potential disasters that the patient may face within the home such as fire hazards, flooding, and tornados; and how and when a patient is to contact local emergency officials. Discussions may also include patient, care providers, patient representative, or any person involved in the clinical care aspects to educate them on steps that can be taken to improve the patient's safety. The individualized emergency plan should be in writing and could be as simple as a detailed emergency card to be kept with the patient. HHA personnel should document that these discus sions occurred and also keep a copy of the individualized emergency plan in the patient's file as well as provide a copy to the patient and or their caregiver. Survey Procedures Through record review, verify that each patient has an individualized emergency plan documented as part of the patient's comprehensive assessment. E0019 (2) The procedures to inform State and local emergency preparedness officials about HHA patients in need of evacuation from their residences at any time due to an emergency situation based on the patient's medical and psychiatric condition and home environment. Home bound hospices, HHAs and PACE organizations are require d to inform State and local emergency preparedness officials of the need for patient evacuations. These policies and procedures must address when and how this information is communicated to emergency officials and also include the clinical care needed for these patients. For instance, in the event an in -home hospice, PACE organization or HHA patient requires evacuation, the responsible agency should provide emergency officials with the appropriate information to facilitate the patient's evacuation and trans portation. This should include, but is not limited to, the following: Whether or not the patient is mobile. What type of life -saving equipment does the patient require? Is the life -saving equipment able to be transported? (E.g., Battery operated, transportable, condition of equipment, etc.) Does the patient have special needs? (E.g., Communication challenges, language barriers, intellectual disabilities, special dietary needs, etc.) Since such policies and procedures include protected health information of patients, facilities must also ensure they are in compliance with applicable the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Rules at 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, as appropriate. See (81 FR 63879, Sept. 16, 2016). CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 62 E0019 (continued) Survey Procedures Review the emergency plan to verify it includes procedures to inform State and local emergency preparedness officials about patients in need of evacuation from their residences at any time due to an emergency situation based on the pat ient's medical and psychiatric condition and home environment. E0021 (3) The procedures to follow up with on -duty staff and patients to determine services that are needed, in the event that there is an interruption in services during or due to an emergen cy. The HHA must inform State and local officials of any on -duty staff or patients that they are unable to contact. HHAs must include in its emergency plan, procedures required of this standard. During an emergency, if a patient requires care that is be yond the capabilities of the HHA, there is an expectation that care of the patient would be rearranged or suspended for a period of time, as most HHAs in general would not necessarily transfer patients to other HHAs during an emergency. HHAs policies and procedures should clearly outline what surrounding facilities, such as a hospital or a nursing home, it has a transfer arrangement with to ensure patient care is continued. Additionally, these policies and procedures should outline timelines for transferri ng patients or under what conditions patients would need to move. For instance, if the emergency is one which only is anticipated to have one or two days of disruption and does not pose immediate threat to patient health or safety (in which then the HHA sh ould immediately transfer the patient); the HHA may rearrange services, whereas if a disaster is anticipated to last over one week or more, the HHA may need to initiate transfer of a patient as soon as possible. The policies and procedures should address t hese events. Additionally, the HHAs' policies and procedures must address what actions would be required due to the inability to make contact with staff or patients and reporting capabilities to the local and State emergency officials. Survey Procedures Verify that the HHA has included in its emergency plan these procedures to follow -up with staff and patients and to inform state and local authorities when they are unable to contact any of them. Verify that the HHA has procedures in its emergency pla n to follow up with onduty staff and patients to determine the services that are needed, in the event that there is an interruption in services during or due to an emergency. Ask the HHA to describe the mechanism to inform State and local officials of any onduty staff or patients that they are unable to contact. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 63 E0023 (4) A system of medical documentation that preserves patient information, protects confidentiality of patient information, and secures and maintains the availability of records. In addition to any existing requirements for patient records found in existing laws, under this standard, facilities are required to ensure that patient records are secure and readily available to support continuity of care during emergency. This requireme nt does not supersede or take away any requirements found under the provider/supplier's medical records regulations, but rather, this standard adds to such policies and procedures. These policies and procedures must also be in compliance with the Health In surance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Privacy and Security Rules at 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, which protect the privacy and security of individual's personal health information. Survey Procedures Ask to see a copy of the policies and pro cedures that documents the medical record documentation system the facility has developed to preserves patient information, protects confidentiality of patient information, and secures and maintains availability of records. E0024 (5) The use of volunte ers in an emergency or other emergency staffing strategies, including the process and role for integration of State or Federally designated health care professionals to address surge needs during an emergency. During an emergency, a facility may need to accept volunteer support from individuals with varying levels of skills and training. The facility must have policies and procedures in place to facilitate this support. In order for volunteering healthcare professionals to be able to perform services w ithin their scope of practice and training, facilities must include any necessary privileging and credentialing processes in its emergency preparedness plan policies and procedures. Non -medical volunteers would perform non -medical tasks. Facilities have fl exibility in determining how best to utilize volunteers during an emergency as long as such utilization is in accordance with State law, State scope of practice rules, and facility policy. These may also include federally designated health care professiona ls, such as Public Health Service (PHS) staff, National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) medical teams, Department of Defense (DOD) Nurse Corps, Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), or personnel such as those identified in federally designated Health Professional Sh ortage Areas (HPSAs) to include licensed primary care medical, dental, and mental/behavioral health professionals. Facilities are also encouraged to integrate State -established volunteer registries, and where possible, State -based Emergency System for Adva nced Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals (ESAR -VHP). Facilities are expected to include in its emergency plan a method for contacting off -duty staff during an emergency and procedures to address other contingencies in the event staff are not abl e to report to duty which may include, but are not limited to, utilizing staff from other facilities and state or federally -designated health professionals. Survey Procedures Verify the facility has included policies and procedures for the use of volun teers and other staffing strategies in its emergency plan. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 64 E0029 \u00a7484.102 (c) Communication plan. The HHA must develop and maintain an emergency preparedness communication plan that complies with Federal, State, and local laws and must be reviewed and updated at least every 2 years . The communication plan must include all of the following: Facilities must have a written emergency communication plan that contains how the facility coordinates patient care within the facility, across healthcare providers, and with state and local public health departments. The communication plan should include how the facility interacts and coordinates with emergency management agencies and systems to protect patient health and safety in the event of a disaster. The development of a communication plan will support the coordination of care. The plan must be revie wed annually and updated as necessary. We are allowing facilities flexibility in how they formulate and operationalize the requirements of the communication plan. Facilities in rural or remote areas with limited connectivity to communication methodologie s such as the Internet, World Wide Web, or cellular capabilities need to ensure their communication plan addresses how they would communicate and comply with this requirement in the absence of these communication methodologies. For example, if a facility i s located in a rural area, which has limited or no Internet and phone connectivity during an emergency, it must address what alternate means are available to alert local and State emergency officials. Optional communication methods facilities may consider include satellite phones, radios and short wave radios. Survey Procedures Verify that the facility has a written communication plan by asking to see the plan. Ask to see evidence that the plan has been reviewed (and updated as necessary) on an annua l basis. E0030 (1) Names and contact information for the following: (i) Staff (ii) Entit ies providing services under arrangement (iii) Patients' physicians (iv) Volunteers A facility must have the contact information for those individuals and entities outlined within the standard. The requirement to have contact information for \"other facilities\" requires a provider or supplier to have the contact information for another pro vider or supplier of the same type as itself. For instance, hospitals should have contact information for other hospitals and CORFs should have contact information for other CORFs, etc. While not required, facilities may also find it prudent to have contac t information for other facilities not of the same type. For instance a hospital may find it appropriate to have the contact information of LTC facilities within a reasonable geographic area, which could assist in facilitating patient transfers. Facilities have discretion in the formatting of this information, however it should be readily available and accessible to leadership and staff during an emergency event. Facilities which utilize electronic data storage should be able to provide evidence of data bac k-up with hard copies or demonstrate capability to reproduce contact lists or access this data during emergencies. All contact information must be reviewed and updated as necessary at least annually . Contact information contained in the communication plan must be accurate and current. Facilities must update contact information for incoming new staff and departing staff throughout the year and any other changes to information for those individuals and entities on the contact list. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 65 E0030 (continued) Survey Procedures Verify that all required contacts are included in the communication plan by asking to see a list of the contacts with their contact information. Verify that all contact information has been reviewed and updated at least annually by asking to see evide nce of the annual review. E0031 (2) Contact information for the following: (i) Federal, State, tribal, regional or local emergency preparedness staff (ii) Other sources of assistance A facility must have the contact information for those individuals and entities outlined within the standard. Facilities have discretion in the formatting of this information, however it should be readily available and accessible to leadership during an emergency event. Facilities are encouraged but not required to maintain these cont act lists both in electronic format and hard -copy format in the event that network systems to retrieve electronic files are not accessible. All contact information must be reviewed and updated at least annually . Survey Procedures Verify that all required contacts are included in the communication plan by asking to see a list of the contacts with their contact information. Verify that all contact information has been reviewed and updated at least annually by asking to see evide nce of the annual review. E0032 (3) Primary and alternate means for communicating with the HHA's staff, Federal, State, tribal, regional, and local emergency management agencies. Facilities are required to have primary and alternate means of communicating with staff, Federal, State, tribal, regional, and local emergency management agencies. Facilities have the discretion to utilize alternate communication systems that best meets their needs. However, it is expected that facilities would consider pagers, cellular telephones, radio transceivers (that is, walkie -talkies), and various other radio devices such as the NOAA Weather Radio and Amateur Radio Operators' (HAM Radio) systems, as well as satellite telephone communicati ons systems. We recognize that some facilities, especially in remote areas, may have difficulty using some communication systems, such as cellular phones, even in non -emergency situations, which should be outlined within their risk assessment and addressed within the communications plan. It is expected these facilities would address such challenges when establishing and maintaining a well -designed communication system that will function during an emergency. The communication plan should include procedures r egarding when and how alternate communication methods are used, and who uses them. In addition the facility should ensure that its selected alternative means of communication is compatible with communication systems of other facilities, agencies and state and local officials it plans to communicate with during emergencies. For example, if State X local emergency officials use the SHAred RESources (SHARES) High Frequency (HF) Radio program and facility Y is CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 66 E0032 (continued) trying to communicate with RACES, it may be prudent to consider if these two alternate communication systems can communicate on the same frequencies. Facilities may seek information about the National Communication System (NCS), which offers a wide range of National Security and Emergency Preparedness comm unications services, the Government Emergency Telecommunications Services (GETS), the Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) Program, Wireless Priority Service (WPS), and SHARES. Other communication methods could include, but are not limited to, satelli te phones, radio, and short wave radio. The Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Services (RACES) is an integral part of emergency management operations. Survey Procedures Verify the communication plan includes primary and alternate means for communicating with facility staff, Federal, State, tribal, regional and local emergency management agencies by reviewing the communication plan. Ask to see the communications equipment or communication systems listed in the plan. E0033 (4) A method for sharing information and medical documentation for patients under the HHA's care, as necessary, with other health care providers to maintain the continuity of care. (5) A means of providing information about the general condition and lo cation of patients under the facility's care as permitted under 45 CFR 164.510(b)(4). Facilities are required to develop a method for sharing information and medical documentation for patients under the facility's care, as necessary, with other health care providers to maintain continuity of care. Such a system must ensure that information necessary to provide patient care is sent with an evacuated patient to the next care provider and would also be readily available for patients being sheltered in place. W hile the regulation does not specify timelines for delivering patient care information, facilities are expected to provide patient care information to receiving facilities during an evacuation, within a timeframe that allows for effective patient treatment and continuity of care. Facilities should not delay patient transfers during an emergency to assemble all patient reports, tests, etc. to send with the patient. Facilities should send all necessary patient information that is readily available and should include at least, patient name, age, DOB, allergies, current medications, medical diagnoses, current reason for admission (if inpatient), blood type, advance directives and next of kin/emergency contacts. There is no specified means (such as paper or elect ronic) for how facilities are to share the required information. HIPAA requirements are not suspended during a national or public health emergency. However, the HIPAA Privacy Rule specifically permits certain uses and disclosures of protected health infor mation in emergency circumstances and for disaster relief purposes. Section 164.510 ''Uses and disclosures requiring an opportunity for the individual to agree to or to object,'' is part of the ''Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information,'' commonly known as ''The Privacy Rule.'' HIPAA Privacy Regulations at 45 CFR 164.510(b)(4), ''Use and disclosures for disaster relief purposes,'' establishes requirements for disclosing patient information to a public or private entity authoriz ed by CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 67 E0033 (continued) law or by its charter to assist in disaster relief efforts for purposes of notifying family members, personal representatives, or certain others of the patient's location or general condition. Survey Procedures Verify the communication plan includes a method for sharing information and medical documentation for patients under the facility's care, as necessary, with other health providers to maintain the continuity of care by reviewing the communication plan. Verify the facility has developed policies and procedures that address the means the facility will use to release patient information to include the general condition and location of patients, by reviewing the communication plan E0034 (6) A means of providing information about the HHA's needs, and its ability to provide assistance, to the authority having jurisdiction, the Incident Command Center, or designee. Facilities, except for transplant centers, must have a means of providing information about the facility's needs and its ability to provide assistance to the authority having jurisdiction (local and State emergency management agencies, local and state public health departments, the Incident Command Center, the Emergency Operations Center, or designee). Note: The authority having jurisdiction varies by local, state and federal emergency management structures as well as the type of disaster. For example, in the event of a multi -state wildfire, the jurisdictional authority who would take over the Incident Command Center or state -wide coordination of the disaster would likely be a fire -related agency. We are not prescribing the means that facilities must use in disseminating the required information. However, facilities should include in its communi cation plan, a process to communicate the required information. Note: As defined by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), an Incident Command System (ICS) is a management system designed to enable effective and efficient domestic inciden t management by integrating a combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications operating within a common organizational structure. (FEMA, 2016). The industry, as well as providers/suppliers, use various terms to refer to the same function and we have used the term ''Incident Command Center'' to mean ''Emergency Operations Center'' or ''Incident Command Post.'' Local, State, Tribal and Federal emergency preparedness officials, as well as regional healthcare coalitions, can assi st facilities in the identification of their Incident Command Centers and reporting requirements dependent on an emergency. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 68 Survey Procedures Verify the communication plan includes a means of providing information about the facility's needs, and its ability to provide assistance, to the authority having jurisdiction, the Incident Command Center, or designee by reviewing the communication plan. E0036 \u00a7484.102 (d) Training and testing . The HHA must develop and maintain an emergency preparedness training and testing program that is based on the emergency plan set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, ri sk assessment at paragraph (a)(1 ) of this section, policies and procedures at paragr aph (b) of this section, and the communication plan at paragraph (c) of this section. The training and testing program must be reviewed and updated at least every 2 years . An emergency preparedness training and testing program as specified in this requir ement must be documented and reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis . The training and testing program must reflect the risks identified in the facility's risk assessment and be included in their emergency plan. For example, a facility that identi fies flooding as a risk should also include policies and procedures in their emergency plan for closing or evacuating their facility and include these in their training and testing program. This would include, but is not limited to, training and testing on how the facility will communicate the facility closure to required individuals and agencies, testing patient tracking systems and testing transportation procedures for safely moving patients to other facilities. Additionally, for facilities with multiple locations, such as multi -campus or multi -location hospitals, the facility's training and testing program must reflect the facility's risk assessment for each specific location. Training refers to a facility's responsibility to provide education and instr uction to staff, contractors, and facility volunteers to ensure all individuals are aware of the emergency preparedness program. Testing is the concept in which training is operationalized and the facility is able to evaluate the effectiveness of the train ing as well as the overall emergency preparedness program. Testing includes conducting drills and/or exercises to test the emergency plan to identify gaps and areas for improvement. Survey Procedures Verify that the facility has a written training and testing program that meets the requirements of the regulation. Verify the program has been reviewed and updated on, at least, an annual basis by asking for documentation of the annual review as well as any updates made. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 69 E0037 (1) Training program. The HHA must do all of the following: (i) Initial training in emergency preparedness policies and procedures to all new and existing staff, individuals providing services under arrangement, and volunteers, consistent wit h their expected roles. (ii) Provide emergency preparedness training at least every 2 years . (iii) Maintain documentation of the training. (iv) Demonstrate staff knowledge of emergency procedures (v) If the emergency policies and procedures are significantly updated, the HHA must conduct training on the updated policies and procedures. Facilities are required to provide initial training in emergency preparedness policies and procedures that are consistent with their roles in an emergency to all new and existing staff, individu als providing services under arrangement, and volunteers. This includes individuals who provide services on a per diem basis such as agency nursing staff and any other individuals who provide services on an intermittent basis and would be expected to assis t during an emergency. Facilities should provide initial emergency training during orientation (or shortly thereafter) to ensure initial training is not delayed. With the exception of CORFs which must complete initial training within the first two weeks of employment, we recommend initial training be completed by the time the staff has completed the facility's new hire orientation program. Additionally, in the case of facilities with multiple locations, such as multi -campus hospitals, staff, individuals pro viding services under arrangement, or volunteers should be provided initial training at their specific location and when they are assigned to a new location. Facilities have the flexibility to determine the focus of their annual training, as long as it aligns with the emergency plan and risk assessment. Ideally, annual training should be modified each year, incorporating any lessons learned from the most recent exercises, real - life emergencies that occurred in the last year and during the annual review of the facility's emergency program. For example, annual training could include training staff on new evacuation procedures that were identified as a best practice and documented in the facility \"After Action Report\" (AAR) during the last emergency drill and were incorporated into the emergency plan during the program's annual review. While facilities are required to provide annual training to all staff, it is up to the facility to decide what level of training each staff member will be required to complete ea ch year based on an individual's involvement or expected role during an emergency. There may be core topics that apply to all staff, while certain clinical staff may require additional topics. For example, dietary staff who prepare meals may not need to co mplete annual training that is focused on patient evacuation procedures. Instead, the facility may provide training that focuses on the proper preparation and storage of food in an emergency. In addition, depending on specific staff duties during an emerge ncy, a facility may determine that documented external training is sufficient to meet some or all of the facility's annual training requirements. For example, staff who work with radiopharmaceuticals may attend external training that teach staff how to han dle radiopharmaceutical emergencies. It is up to the facility to decide if the external training meets the facility's requirements. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 70 E0037 (continued ) Facilities may contract with individuals providing services who also provide services in multiple surrounding areas. For instance, an ICF/IID may contract a nutritionist who also provides services in other locations. Given that these contracted individuals may provide services at multiple facilities, it may not be feasible for them to receive formal training for each of the facilities for emergency preparedness programs. The expectation is that each individual knows the facility's emergency program and their role during emergencies, however the delivery of such training is left to the facility to determine. Facilities in whic h these individuals provide services may develop some type of training documentation -i.e. the facility's emergency plan, important contact information, and the facility's expectation for those individuals during an emergency etc. which documents that the i ndividual received the information/training. Furthermore, if a surveyor asks one of these individuals what their role is during a disaster, or any relevant questions, then the expectation is that the individual can describe the emergency plans/their role. Facilities must maintain documentation of the annual training for all staff. The documentation must include the specific training completed as well as the methods used for demonstrating knowledge of the training program. Facilities have flexibility in ways to demonstrate staff knowledge of emergency procedures. The method chosen is likely based on the training delivery method. For example: computer -based or printed self -learning packets may contain a test to demonstrate knowledge. If facilities choose instr uctor -led training, a question and answer session could follow the training. Regardless of the method, facilities must maintain documentation that training was completed and that staff are knowledgeable of emergency procedures. Survey Procedures Ask for copies of the facility's initial emergency preparedness training and annual emergency preparedness training offerings. Interview various staff and ask questions regarding the facility's initial and annual training course, to verify staff knowledge of e mergency procedures. Review a sample of staff training files to verify staff have received initial and annual emergency preparedness training. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 71 E0039 (2) Testing. The HHA must conduct exercises to test the emergency plan at least annually. The HHA must do the following: (i) Participate in a full -scale exercise that is community -based; or (A) When a community -based exercise is not accessible, conduct an annual individual, facility -based functional exercise every 2 years; or (B) If the HHA experiences an actual or man -made emergency that requires activation of the emergency plan, the HHA is exempt from engaging in its next required full - scale community -based or individual, facility -based functional exercise following the on -set of the emergency event. (ii) Conduct an additional exercise every 2 years, opposite the year the full scale exercise or functional exercise under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is conducted, that may include, but is not limited to the following: (A) A second full -scale exercise that is community -based or an individual, facility -based functional exercise ; or (B) A mock disaster drill; or (C) A tabletop exercise or workshop that is led by a facilitator and included a group discussion, using a narrated, clinically relevant emergency scenario, and a set of problem statements, directed messages, or prep ared questions designed to challenge an emergency plan. (iii) Analyze the HHA's response to and maintain documentation of all drills, tabletop exercises, and emergency events, and revise the HHA's emergency plan as needed. Facilities must on an annual b asis conduct exercises to test the emergency plan. Specifically, facilities are required to conduct a tabletop exercise and participate in a full - scale community -based exercise or conduct an individual facility exercise if a community - based exercise is not available. As the term full -scale exercise may vary by sector, facilities are not required to conduct a full -scale exercise as defined by FEMA or DHS's Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP). For the purposes of this requirement, a full scale exercise is defined and accepted as any operations -based exercise (drill, functional, or full -scale exercise) that assesses a facility's functional capabilities by simulating a response to an emergency that would impact the facility's operations and their given community. A full -scale exercise is also an operations -based exercise that typically involves multiple agencies, jurisdictions, and disciplines performing functional or operational elements. There is also definition for \"community\" as it is su bject to variation based on geographic setting, (e.g. rural, suburban, urban, etc.), state and local agency roles and responsibilities, types of providers in a given area in addition to other factors. In doing so, facilities have the flexibility to partici pate in and conduct exercises that more realistically reflect the risks and composition of their communities. Facilities are expected to consider their physical location, agency and other facility responsibilities and needs of the community when planning o r participating in their exercises. The term could, however, mean entities within a state or multi -state region. In many areas of the country, State and local agencies (emergency management agencies and health departments) and some regional entities, such as healthcare coalitions may conduct an annual full -scale, community -based exercise in an effort to more broadly assess community -wide emergency planning, potential gaps, and the integration of response capabilities in an emergency. Facilities should acti vely engage these entities to identify potential opportunities, as appropriate, as they offer the facility the opportunity to not only assess their emergency plan but also better understand how they can contribute to, coordinate with, and integrate into th e broader community's response during an emergency. They also provide a collective forum for assessing their communications plans to ensure they have the appropriate contacts and understand how best to engage and communicate with their state and local public health and emergency management agencies and other relevant partners, such as a local healthcare coalition, during an emergency. Facilities are expected to contact their local and state agencies and healthcare coalitions, where appropriate, to dete rmine if an opportunity exists and determine if their participation would fulfill this requirement. In doing so, they are expected to document the date, the personnel and the agency or healthcare coalition that they contacted. It is also important to note that agencies and or healthcare coalitions conducting these exercises will not have the resources to fulfill individual facility requirements and thus will only serve CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 72 E0039 (continued ) as a conduit for broader community engagement and coordination prior to, during and after the full -scale community -based exercise. Facilities are responsible for resourcing their participation and ensuring that all requisite documentation is developed and available to demonstrate their compliance with this requirement. Facilities are encourag ed to engage with their area Health Care Coalitions (HCC) (partnerships between healthcare, public health, EMS, and emergency management) to explore integrated opportunities. Health Care Coalitions (HCCs) are groups of individual health care and response o rganizations who collaborate to ensure each member has what it needs to respond to emergencies and planned events. HCCs plan and conduct coordinated exercises to assess the health care delivery systems readiness. There is value in participating in HCCs for participating in strategic planning, information sharing and resource coordination. HCC's do not coordinate individual facility exercises, but rather serve as a conduit to provide an opportunity for other provider types to participate in an exercise. HCCs should communicate exercise plans with local and state emergency preparedness agencies and HCCs will benefit the entire community's preparedness. In addition, CMS does not regulate state and local government disaster planning agencies. It is the sole resp onsibility of the facility to be in compliance. Facilities that are not able to identify a full -scale community -based exercise, can instead fulfill this part of their requirement by either conducting an individual facility -based exercise, documenting an e mergency that required them to fully activate their emergency plan, or by conducting a smaller community -based exercise with other nearby facilities. Facilities that elect to develop a small community -based exercise have the opportunity to not only assess their own emergency preparedness plans but also better understand the whole community's needs, identify critical interdependencies and or gaps and potentially minimize the financial impact of this requirement. For example, a LTC facility, a hospital, an ES RD facility, and a home health agency, all within a given area, could conduct a small community -based exercise to assess their individual facility plans and identify interdependencies that may impact facility evacuations and or address potential surge scen arios due to a prolonged disruption in dialysis and home health care services. Those that elect to conduct a community -based exercise should make an effort to contact their local/state emergency officials and healthcare coalitions, where appropriate, and offer them the opportunity to attend as they can provide valuable insight into the broader emergency planning and response activities in their given area. Facilities that conduct an individual facility -based exercise will need to demonstrate how it addresses any risk(s) identified in its risk assessment. For example, an inpatient facility might test their policies and procedures for a flood that may require the evacuation of patients to an external site or to an internal safe \"shelter -in-place\" location (e.g. foyer, CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 73 E0039 (continued ) cafeteria, etc.) and include requirements for patients with access and functional needs and potential dependencies on life -saving electricity -dependent medical equipment. An outpatient facility, such as a home health provider, might test its policies and procedures for a flood that may require it to rapidly locate its on -duty staff, assess the acuity of its patients to determine those that may be a ble to shelter -in-place or require hospital admission, communicate potential evacuation needs to local agencies, and provide medical information to support the patient's continuity of care. Each facility is responsible for documenting their compliance and ensuring that this information is available for review at any time for a period of no less than three (3) years. Facilities should also document the lessons learned following their tabletop and full -scale exercises and real -life emergencies and demonstrat e that they have incorporated any necessary improvements in their emergency preparedness program. Facilities may complete an after action review process to help them develop an actionable after action report (AAR). The process includes a roundtable discuss ion that includes leadership, department leads and critical staff who can identify and document lessons learned and necessary improvements in an official AAR. The AAR, at a minimum, should determine 1) what was supposed to happen; 2) what occurred; 3) what went well; 4) what the facility can do differently or improve upon; and 5) a plan with timelines for incorporating necessary improvement. Lastly, facilities that are a part of a healthcare system, can elect to participate in their system's integrated and unified emergency preparedness program and exercises. However, those that do will still be responsible for documenting and demonstrating their individual facility's compliance with the exercise and training requirements. Finally, an actual emergency event or response of sufficient magnitude that requires activation of the relevant emergency plans meets the annual exercise requirements and exempts the facility for engaging in a community -based full -scale exercise or individual, facility -based mock disaster drill for one year following the actual event; and facilit ies must be able to demonstrate this through written documentation. If a facility activates its emergency plan twice in one year, then the facility would be exempt from both exercises (community -based full -scale exercise and the secondary exercise -individual, facility -based mock disaster drill, table top exercise) for one year following the actual events.

HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 74 E0039 (continued ) Survey Procedures Ask to see documentation of the annual tabletop and full scale exercises (which may include, but is not limited to, the exercise plan, the AAR, and any additional documentation used by the facility to support the exercise. Ask to see the documentation of the facility's efforts to identify a full-scale community based exercise if they did not participate in one (i.e. date and personnel and agencies contacted and the reasons for the inability to participate in a community based exercise). Request documentation of the facility's analysis and response and how the facility updated its emergency program based on this analysis. E0042 \u00a7484.102 (e) Integrated healthcare systems. If a HHA is part of a healthcare system consisting of multiple separately certified healthcare facilities that elects to have a unified and integrated emergency preparedness program, the HHA may choose to participate in the healthcare system's coordinate d emergency preparedness program. If elected, the unified and integrated emergency preparedness program must do all of the following; (1) Demonstrate that each separately certified facility within the system actively participated in the development of the unified and integrated emergency preparedness program. (2) Be developed and maintained in a manner that takes into account each separately certified facility's unique circumstances, patient populations, and services offered. (3) Demonstrate that each separate ly certified facility is capable of actively using the unified and integrated emergency preparedness program and is in compliance with the program. (4) Include a unified and integrated emergency plan that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and (4) of this section. The unified and integrated emergency plan must also be based on and include all of the following: (i) A documented community -based risk assessment, utilizing an all -hazards approach. (ii) A documented individual facility -based risk assessment for each separately certified facility within the health system, utilizing an all -hazards approach. Healthcare systems that include multiple facilities that are each separately certified as a Medicare -participating provider or supplier have the option of developing a unified and integrated emergency preparedness program that includes all of the facilities within the healthcare system instead of each facility developing a separate emergency preparedness program. If an integrated healthcare system chooses this option, each certified facility in the system may elect to participate in the system's unified and integrated emergency program or develop its own separate emergency preparedness program. It is important to understand that healthcare systems a re not required to develop a unified and integrated emergency program. Rather it is a permissible option. In addition, the separately certified facilities within the healthcare system are not required to participate in the unified and integrated emergency preparedness program. It is simply an option for each facility. If this option is taken, the healthcare system's unified emergency preparedness program should be updated each time a facility enters or leaves the healthcare system's program. If a healthcar e system elects to have a unified emergency preparedness program, the integrated program must demonstrate that each separately certified facility within the system that elected to participate in the system's integrated program actively participated in the development of the program. Therefore, each facility should designate personnel who will collaborate with the healthcare system to develop the plan. The unified and integrated plan should include documentation that verifies each facility participated in th e development of the plan. This could include the names of personnel at each facility who assisted in the development of the plan and the minutes from planning meetings. All components of the emergency preparedness program that are required to be reviewed and updated at least annually must include all participating facilities. Again, each facility must be able to prove that it was involved in the annual reviews and updates of the program. The healthcare system and each facility must document each facility's active involvement with the reviews and updates, as applicable. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 75 E0042 (continued ) (5) Include integrated policies and procedures that meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, a coordinated communication plan and train ing and testing programs that meet the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, respectively. A unified program must be developed and maintained in a manner that takes into account the unique circumstances, patient populations, and services offered at each facility participating in th e integrated program. For example, for a unified plan covering both a hospital and a LTC facility, the emergency plan must account for the residents in the LTC facility as well as those patients within a hospital, while taking into consideration the differ ence in services that are provided at a LTC facility and a hospital. The unique circumstances that should be addressed at each facility would include anything that would impact operations during an emergency, such as the location of the facility, resources such as the availability of staffing, medical supplies, subsistence, patients' and residents' varying acuity and mobility at the different types of facilities in a unified healthcare system, etc. Each separately certified facility must be capable of demon strating during a survey that it can effectively implement the emergency preparedness program and demonstrate compliance with all emergency preparedness requirements at the individual facility level. Compliance with the emergency preparedness requirements is the individual responsibility of each separately certified facility. The unified emergency preparedness program must include a documented community - based risk assessment and an individual facility -based risk assessment for each separately certified faci lity within the health system, utilizing an all -hazards approach. This is especially important if the facilities in a healthcare system are located across a large geographic area with differing weather conditions. Lastly, the unified program must have a co ordinated communication plan and training and testing program. For example, if the unified emergency program incorporates a central point of contact at the \"system\" level who assists in coordination and communication, such as during an evacuation, each fac ility must have this information outlined within its individual plan. This type of integrated healthcare system emergency program should focus the training and exercises to ensure communication plans and reporting mechanisms are seamless to the emergency m anagement officials at state and local levels to avoid potential miscommunications between the system and the multiple facilities under its control. The training and testing program in a unified emergency preparedness program must be developed considering all of the requirements of each facility type. For example, if a healthcare system includes, hospitals, LTC facilities, ESRD facilities and ASCs, then the unified training and testing programs must meet all of the specific regulatory requirements for each of these facility types. Because of the many different configurations of healthcare systems, from the different types of facilities in the system, to the varied locations of the facilities, it is not possible to specify how unified training and testing pro grams should be developed. There is no \"one size fits all\" model that can be prescribed. However, if the system decides to develop a unified and integrated training and testing program, the training and testing must be developed based on the community and facility based hazards assessments at each facility CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 76 E0042 (continued ) that is participating in the unified emergency preparedness program. Each facility must maintain individual training records of staff and records of all required training exercises. Survey Procedures Verify whether or not the facility has opted to be part of its healthcare system's unified and integrated emergency preparedness program. Verify that they are by asking to see documentation of its inclusion in the program. Ask to see documentation that v erifies the facility within the system was actively involved in the development of the unified emergency preparedness program. Ask to see documentation that verifies the facility was actively involved in the annual reviews of the program requirements and any program updates. Ask to see a copy of the entire integrated and unified emergency preparedness program and all required components (emergency plan, policies and procedures, communication plan, training and testing program). Ask facility leadersh ip to describe how the unified and integrated emergency preparedness program is updated based on changes within the healthcare system such as when facilities enter or leave the system.

The HHA must organize, manage, and administer its resources to attain and maintain the highest practicable functional capacity, including providing optimal care to achieve the goals and outcomes identified in the patient's plan of care, for each patient's medical, nursing, and rehabilitative needs. The HHA must assure that administrative and supervisory functions are not delegated to another agency or organization, and all services not furnished directly are monitored and contro lled. The HHA must set forth, in writing, its organizational structure, including lines of authority, and services furnished. \u00a7484.105 The roles of the governing body, administrator and clinical manager may not be delegated. In other words, an HHA must ensure that the responsibilities of the governing body, administrator and clinical manager (for the day -to-day operation of the HHA) are not relinquished to another person or organization on an on -going basis. This does not app ly to periodic \"acting\" employees in the absence of the administrator or clinical manager. In addition, the use of payroll services, OASIS transmission contractors, and personnel training programs are not considered to be delegation of administrative and supervisory functions; these are service contracts that the agency may use to optimize administrative and supervisory efficiencies. G942 \u00a7484.105(a ) Standard : Governing body . A governing body (or designated persons so functioning) must assume full legal authority and responsibility for the agency's overall management and operation, the provision of all home health services, fiscal operations, review of the agency's budget and i ts operational plans, and its quality assessment and performance improvement program. G944 \u00a7484.105(b ) Standard : Administrator . (1) The administrator must: G946 (i) Be appointed by and report to the governing body; \u00a7484.105(b)(1)(i) \"Report to\" means the administrator reports directly to the governing body with no intermediaries. G948 (ii) Be responsible for all day -to-day operations of the HHA; G950 (iii) Ensure that a clinical manager as described in paragraph (c) of this section is available during all operating hours; \u00a7484.105(b)(1)(iii) \"Operating hours\" include all hours which the HHA is open and providing care to patients. G952 (iv) Ensure that the HHA employs qualified personnel, including assuring the development of personnel qual ifications and policies. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 78 G954 (2) When the administrator is not available, a qualified, pre - designated person, who is authorized in writing by the administrator and the governing body, assumes the same responsibilities and obligations as the administrator. The pre-designated person may be the as described in paragraph (c) of this section. \u00a7484.105(b)(2) Pre-designation means that the individual who is responsible for fulfilling the role of the administrator in his/her absence is established in advance and approved by the governing body. G956 (3) The administrator or a pre -designated person is available during all operating hours. \u00a7485.105(b)(3) Available means physically present at the agency or able to be contacted via telephone or other electronic means. G958 \u00a7484.105(c ) Standard : Clinical manager . One or more qualified individuals must provide oversight of all patient care services and personnel. Oversight must include the following \u2014 \u00a7484.105(c) \u00a7484.115 (c) defines the qualifications of a clinical manager to be a licensed physician, physical therapist, speech -language pathologist, occupational therapist, audiologist, social worker, or a registered nurse.

G970 \u00a7484.105(d ) Standard : Parent -branch relationship . G972 (1) The parent HHA is responsible for reporting all branch locations of the HHA to the state survey agency at the time of the HHA's request for initial certification, at each survey, and at the time the parent proposes to add or delete a branch. CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 79 G974 (2) The parent HHA provides direct support and administrative control of its branches. 484.105(d)(1)(2) A \"branch\" is an approved location , or site (physically separate from its parent location), from which an HHA provides services within a portion of the total geographic area served by the parent agency. A branch provides services under the same CMS certification number (CCN) as its parent agency. The parent location must provide supervision and administrative control of its branches on a daily basis to the extent that the branches depend upon the parent's supervision and administrative functions in order to meet the CoPs , and could not d o so as independent entities. The parent agency must be available to meet the needs of any situation and respond to issues that could arise with respect to patient care or administration of a branch. A violation of a CoP in a branch would apply to the ent ire HHA. Therefore, it is essential for the parent to exercise adequate control, supervision, and guidance for all branches under its leadership. \"Direct support and administrative control \" of a branch requires that the parent agency maintains responsib ility for: The governing body oversight of the branch; Any branch contracts for services; The branch's quality assurance and performance improvement plan; Policies and procedures implemented in the branch; How and when management and direct care staff are shared between the parent and branch, particularly in the event of staffing shortfalls or leave coverage; Human resource management at the branch; Assuring the appropriate disposition of closed clinical records at the branch; and Ensuring branch person nel training requirements are met. G976 \u00a7484.105(e ) Standard : Services under arrangement . (1) The HHA must ensure that all services furnished under arrangement provided by other entities or individuals meet the requirements of this part and the requirements of section 1861(w) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(w)). CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 80 G978 (2) An HHA must have a written agreement with another agency, with an organization, or with an individual when that entity or individual furnishes services under arrangement to the HHA's patients. The HHA must maintain overall responsibility for the services provided under arrangement, as well as the manner in which they are furnished. The agency, organization, or individual providing services under arrangement may not have been: (i) Denied Medicare or Medicaid enrollment; (ii) Been excluded or terminated from any federal health care program or Medicaid; (iii) Had its Medicare or Medicaid billing privileges revoked; or (iv) Been debarred from participating in any government program. G980 (3) The primary HHA is responsible for patient care, and must conduct and provide, either directly or under arrangements , all services rendered to patients. 484.105(e)(3) The HHA retains overall responsibility for all services provided, whether provided directly by the HHA or through arrangement s (i.e., under contract) . For example, in contracting for a service such as physical therapy, an HHA may require a contracted party to do the day - by-day professional evaluation component of the therapy service. The HHA may not, however, delegate its overall administrative and supervisory respo nsibilities. All HHA contracts for services should specify how HHA supervision will occur. G982 \u00a7484.105(f ) Standard : Services furnished . (1) Skilled nursing services and at least one other therapeutic service (physical therapy, speech -language pathology, or occupational therapy; medical social services; or home health aide services) are made available on a visiting basis, in a place of residence used a s a patient's home. An HHA must provide at least one of the services described in this subsection directly, but may provide the second service and additional services under arrangement with another agency or organization. 484.105(f)(1 ) The HHA must provid e skilled nursing services and at least one other therapeutic service. However, only one service has to be provided directly by the HHA. An HHA is considered to provide a service \"directly\" when the persons providing the service for the HHA are HHA emplo yees. An individual who works for the HHA on an hourly or per -visit basis may be considered an HHA employee if the HHA is required to issue a form W -2 on the individual's behalf with no intermediaries. An HHA is considered to provide a service \"under arr angements' when the HHA provides the service through contractual or affiliation arrangements with other agencies or organizations, or with an individual(s) who is not an HHA employee. Contract services may supplement, but may not be used in lieu of, HHA staffing for services provided directly the HHA. In addition, the use of contracted staff in a service provided directly by the HHA may occur only on a temporary basis to provide coverage for CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION - HOME HEALTH AGENCIES (Updated 5/28/ /2020) (updated 03/01/2021) Tag Number Regulation Interpretive Guidelines - FINAL 81 G982 (continued) unexpected HHA staffing shortages, or to provide a specialized s ervice that HHA employees cannot provide. G984 (2) All HHA services must be provided in accordance with current clinical practice guidelines and accepted professional standards of practice. G986 \u00a7484.105(g) Standard: Outpatient physical therapy or speech - language pathology services. An HHA that furnishes outpatient physical therapy or speech - language pathology services must meet all of the applicable conditions of this part and the additional health and safety requirements set forth in \u00a7485.711 , \u00a748 5.713, \u00a7485.715, section 1861(p) of the Act. \u00a7484.105(g) If an HHA provides outpatient physical therapy services or outpatient speech pathology services it must also meet the conditions of the regulations summarized below, as applicable: \u00a7485.711 Condition of Participation: Plan of care and physician involvement: For each patient in need of outpatient physical therapy or speech pathology services, there is a written plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a physician, or by a physical therapist or speech pathologist respectively. \u00a7485.713 Condition of Participation: Physical therapy services : If the HHA offers physical therapy services, it provides an adequate program of physical t herapy and has an adequate number of qualified personnel and the equipment necessary to carry out its program and to fulfill its objectives. \u00a7485.715 Condition of participation: Speech pathology services: If speech pathology services are offered, the HHA p rovides an adequate program of speech pathology and has an adequate number of qualified personnel and the equipment necessary to carry out its program and to fulfill its objectives. \u00a7485.719 Condition of Participation: Arrangements for physical therapy and speech pathology services to be performed by other than salaried organization personnel [\u00a7485.723 and \u00a7485.727 are applicable when specialized rehabilitation space and equipment is owned, leased, operated, contracted for, or arranged for at sites under t he HHA's control and when the HHA bills the Medicare/Medicaid programs for services rendered at these sites.] \u00a7485.723 Condition of Participation: Physical environment. The building housing the HHA is constructed, equipped, and maintained to protect the he alth and safety of patients, personnel, and the public and provides a functional, sanitary, and comfortable environment. \u00a7485.727 Condition of Parti cipation: Emergency preparedness.

The HHA, under the direction of the governing body, prepares an overall plan and a budget that includes an annual operating budget and capital expenditure plan. (1)Annual operating budget. There is an annual operating budget that includes all anticipated income and expenses related to items that would, under generally accepted accounting principles, be considered income and expense items. However, it is not required that there be prepared, in connection with any budget, an item by item identification of the components of each type of anticipated income or expense. (2) Capital expenditure plan. (i) There is a capital expendi ture plan for at least a 3 -year period, including the operating budget year.
