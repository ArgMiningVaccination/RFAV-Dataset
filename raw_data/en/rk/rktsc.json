Tuesday's recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention comes about a week after the Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to 11. Until this point, the shot was approved for kids only 12 and up. Here's what parents need to know about Pfizer's COVID-19 shot for kids. What's different about the pediatric shot? The COVID-19 vaccine for younger kids is still a two-dose regimen, but the children will receive a COVID-19 shot that is one-third of what was approved for adolescents and adults. The second shot will be given to kids 21 days after the first \u2014 the same schedule as adult doses. The vaccines will be shipped in vials with orange caps to prevent providers from mixing up pediatric and adult doses. Those vaccines could be shipped to North Texas as early as this week. How effective is the shot? The FDA [analyzed data](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use-children-5-through-11-years-age) from 3,100 kids who received Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine to make its decision on the emergency use authorization. The data showed that Pfizer's shot provided an immune response in kids that was comparable to people 16 and older who got the vaccine. The data also found that the shot was 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in kids 5 to 11. Health experts say the strong immune response among young children is important to controlling the pandemic. \"Immunizing the 5- to 11-year-olds is a significant step ... ,\" said Dr. Jefferey Kahn, chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Children's Health. \"The vaccine strategy is the only way we're going to do this. We're all yearning to get back to normalcy, and this is an essential step in getting to that place.\" Why is the pediatric shot a smaller dose? Children's immune systems are different from those of adults \u2014 they're still developing, and therefore respond differently to medications and vaccines. \"The different dose is because you want it to be effective at the lowest possible dose so that you don't have side effects that aren't necessary,\" said Dr. Kristen Kammerer, a pediatrician with Park Cities Pediatrics in University Park. She said that though minimizing the side effects kids experience is a big motivator for the smaller dose, there are benefits to the production of the shot, too. \"A lot of people feel tired, they feel achy when they get the vaccine. If you can make a kid only feel like that for six hours instead of two days, that would be so much better,\" Kammerer said. \"And it's also a production thing, too. If you can get three doses for the size of an adult one, you don't have to buy as much, you don't have to make as much.\" What are the possible side effects? The most common side effects kids experienced after the shot were mild, and similar to those that have been reported in adults: soreness, redness and swelling of the arm, fatigue, headaches, muscle aches, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nausea and a decreased appetite. Similar to what adults report experiencing after getting the Pfizer vaccine, kids reported more side effects after the second dose. Most side effects appeared within two days after vaccination and went away within a day or two, the FDA said. Are serious side effects possible? The FDA noted that it previously identified that the Pfizer vaccine increased the risk of a serious side effect known as myocarditis, or heart inflammation. The side effect is extremely rare, most commonly experienced after the second dose and is most common among boys between the ages of 12 and 17, the FDA said. People who experience this side effect [usually recover quickly](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-health-coronavirus-vaccine-a5ec4f3859650486353dbb9aa99843e6). \"There are going to be some people who are not going to respond appropriately or have adverse reactions to the vaccine \u2014 that occurs with every vaccine \u2014 but it's all a matter of a risk-benefit,\" Kahn said. \"What's the risk of getting a vaccine, and what's the benefit?\" According to the CDC, the side effect was reported in about 12.6 cases per 1 million second doses of the Pfizer shot that were administered, [The New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/health/coronavirus-vaccine-heart.html). Additional research estimated that out of 1 million second doses given to boys between 12 and 17, the Pfizer shot may cause up to 70 myocarditis cases, according to the Times. After conducting its own benefit-risk analysis, the FDA said the benefits of the pediatric vaccine outweigh the possible side effects. Dr. Seth Kaplan, past president of the Texas Pediatric Society who is a pediatrician in Frisco, said it's important to remember that myocarditis is not specific to the COVID-19 vaccine. \"It's actually far more common to have that happen after getting COVID itself,\" Kaplan said. \"But this is a rare side effect of other viral illnesses as well. ... That's not a uniquely COVID thing. Influenza can do this, other viral illnesses like adenovirus can do this.\" Kaplan said the side effect would most likely be experienced within a week of vaccination. \"It would basically be kind of this unexplained fever, fatigue, chest pain, palpitations\" he said. \"The hope is that perhaps with the lower dose, it won't happen as much.\" Do kids get seriously ill if they get COVID-19? In the early days of the pandemic, children were not thought to be at risk of severe illness if they became infected with COVID-19. But health experts say the highly contagious delta variant of the virus has changed calculations. \"We know that since the beginning of this pandemic, there have been close to 2 million children with confirmed COVID infections, that the rates are going up in children,\" Kahn said. \"Children do get sick with the virus.\" In the United States, kids 5 to 11 make up 39% of COVID-19 cases in people under 18, the FDA said. About 8,300 cases of the virus in the age group have resulted in hospitalization. As of mid-October, about 700 people under 18 have died from the virus, about 21% of which were kids between 5 and 11. In Texas, the state health department doesn't have complete demographic data on cases and deaths. But of demographic data now available for just under 100,000 confirmed cases, people 19 and younger made up just over 7,700. Of just under 70,000 COVID-19 fatalities that the state has demographic information on, 109 of them were of people 19 and younger. In North Texas, the average age of hospitalizations went down during the most recent case surge fueled by the delta variant, and pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations [hit a record high in early September. ](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2021/09/07/pediatric-covid-19-hospitalizations-hit-all-time-high-in-dallas-fort-worth-officials-say/) \"We're still seeing a lot of COVID in kids,\" Kaplan said. \"What's interesting is that even as the overall COVID numbers have come down \u2014 and the number of COVID cases in kids have come down \u2014 the number of COVID cases in kids have come down much more slowly. We're now seeing a larger percentage of people who are infected with COVID being children.\" Even though the most recent surge of cases is over, the delta variant is still the main strain of COVID-19 in communities and could potentially make children very ill, health experts say. There's also the possibility that children who get infected with COVID-19 could experience a complication known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a condition that causes inflammation of different body parts and organs. Most kids with MIS-C recover, but it can be deadly. Kahn said Children's Health has treated kids with MIS-C. He said MIS-C symptoms \u2014 like high fevers, high blood pressure, heart issues and gastrointestinal issues \u2014 develop four to six weeks after an initial coronavirus infection. Kahn said the syndrome can develop even after a mild or asymptotic infection. \"There may be consequences to COVID far beyond the acute infection, he said. \"... These kids are very sick.\" Even though case rates are going down, health experts say people should still get vaccinated to prevent further mutations of the virus or another surge. \"We still have a pretty large reservoir of unvaccinated adults and unvaccinated teens,\" Kaplan said. \"We worry about, When is the next surge is going to come? ... By getting protected now, you're making sure that if and when that surge comes, it's less likely to "}
