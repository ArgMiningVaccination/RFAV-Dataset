Dr. Hahnemann, a German physician, made the first discovery of the scientific principles known as homeopathy over 200 years ago. It is based on the premise that certain natural substances are able to stimulate the body's own healing mechanisms, allowing the body to heal itself. After symptoms of a condition have been alleviated, homeopathic remedies can work to reestablish internal order at the deepest levels. Because very small doses are used, healing is accomplished without negative side effects. Homeopathy follows the principle of \"Like Cures Like\" which means that a substance which can cause certain symptoms in a healthy individual when taken in large doses can cure those same symptoms when taken in small doses. As an illustration, a dilute yet medically active homeopathic medicine from onions can relieve the symptoms of teary eyes and a runny nose. Western medicine uses this principle in vaccination therapy where small amounts of a toxin are used to stimulate the body's reaction against that toxin Are Homeopathic remedies safe for children? Yes, homeopathic remedies are almost invariably safer than their allopathic counterparts. However, some Liddell products are intended for adults only. Please be sure to read product \"Directions\" and \"Warnings\" for specific information. Are Liddell\u00ae remedies FDA Regulated? Yes. The manufacture and sale of homeopathic medicine is regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been recognized since 1938 in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of that year. Homeopathic remedies are classified as drugs in the United States.

We have renamed Vit\u00e0l HGH to Vit\u00e0l Age Defiance. The formula remains the same. Where is the HGH in your Vit\u00e0l Age Defiance\u00ae sourced from? The ingredient HGH is a homeopathic form of the growth hormone, which is synthesized and grown in a FDA approved lab, sourced from a live human. How long until users will feel a difference when using Vit\u00e0l Age Defiance\u00ae or Vit\u00e0l II? These products start to work right away, though the changes may be subtle at first. On the average, people notice marked improvement within 2 to 3 weeks, while others may take a week or two longer. Still others feel results in a matter of day. General Questions About Our Products Where can I buy your product locally? Liddell products can be purchased at many Vitamin Shoppes, Natural Grocers (Vitamin Cottages), Clark's Nutrition, City Markets, Sprout's, HEBs, Central Market, and your local health food stores. How do I take Liddell\u00ae remedies? Formulated to pass through the mucous membrane of the mouth and directly into the bloodstream, you simply spray them under your tongue and hold them there for 20 seconds before swallowing. It is best to do this when your mouth is in a natural condition, at least 15 minutes before or after eating. How often should the products be taken? Liddell\u00ae products should be taken three times a day: two sprays in the morning, two sprays in the after- noon and two sprays in the evening. Some conditions require additional doses, so please refer to the dosage instructions listed on the product packaging. Is the alcohol content of the formulas safe? Yes, unless one is allergic to alcohol. Alcohol is used because it: 1) maxi- mizes efficacy; 2) allows for quicker absorption into the body; and 3) prevents the possibility of contam- ination. We use organic non-GMO alcohol. While some of our products vary in alcohol percentage, most contain 20% organic alcohol Can Liddell\u00ae remedies be takenwith coffee, tea or mint? Yes. Liddell remedies are not affected by drinking coffee, tea or eating peppermint, or using peppermint toothpaste. It is, however, best to wait 15 minutes before or after eating, and to have your mouth in a natural condition. What's the one, biggest mistake you can make taking any of these medicines? It's not following the directions! To get the full benefit of Liddell's homeopathic remedies, you must take two sprays under the tongue three times a day, every day. It takes commitment on your part, but it's worth it. Should I keep a broad selection of Liddell\u00ae remedies at home? Injuries and acute illnesses, by their very nature, happen at unpredictable times. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain what you need, therefore it is a good idea to have a range of medicines on standby. Liddell recommends a medicine cabinet containing these basic Liddell remedies: Anxiety + Tension, Stomach Distress, Sinus Congestion, Allergy, Injuries, Insomnia, Tension Headache, Cold + Flu and PMS. Do you test your products on animals? No, we never test any of our products on animals. What is the shelf life of Liddell sprays? The expiration date for Liddell products is five years from the date of manufacturing. The date is printed on each product. Is it safe to combine several Liddell remedies together? Yes, it is safe and effective to combine two or more remedies either by spraying them under the tongue, one after the other, or by spraying them all in a glass containing an ounce or two of water or juice, then swallowing. Is it safe to mix Liddell remedies with other natural medicines or allopathic drugs? Yes, it is safe. In most cases, neither the effectiveness of the Liddell remedy or other medicines or natural products will be adversely affected. Should I expect any negative side effects when taking Liddell remedies? No, you should experience no negative side effects. However, if your body reacts very quickly to a particular remedy, it is possible to feel some signs of slight discomfort. This is a positive indication that the remedy is working. Should this occur, simply reduce the number of sprays in half. The dosage can then be increased to normal after 3 to 4 days. How soon do the products start taking effect? All products begin working immediately, though the body may not feel the effects right away. Please be guided by the information listed on the product packaging. Can an overdose occur with Liddell products? No, if symptoms are severe, you can take a full dose of your remedy as often as every 15 minutes until the severe symptoms subside. Is it OK for pregnant or breast-feeding mothers to use Liddell products? Even though our products have no known side effects or contraindications, a pregnant or breast-feeding mother should always confer with her physician prior to taking ANY medicine, including medicines by Liddell. After conferring with their doctor, many pregnant or breast-feeding mothers choose to take our products because of their efficacy and gentle safety. For these mothers, we have one additional caveat: Our doctor does not recommend that a pregnant or breast-feeding mother take our Vit\u00e0l Age Defiance, Vit\u00e0l II, Female Sexual Energy, or PMS products. During pregnancy and breast-feeding, a mother's hormones will fluctuate as a natural part of the process. Our doctor does not feel that the hormone output of the mother should be modulated during this important time. Help With the Website I can't add my coupon.
