Check your child's weight and height, calculate [body mass index (BMI)](/en/parents/bmi-charts.html), and plot the measurements on a [growth chart](/en/parents/growth-charts.html). 2. Check your child's blood pressure, [vision](/en/parents/vision.html), and [hearing](/en/parents/hear.html) using standard testing equipment. 3. Ask questions, address concerns, and offer advice about your child's: [Eating](/en/parents/feed-preschooler.html). Schedule 3 meals and 1-2 healthy [snacks](/en/parents/preschool-snacks.html) a day. If you have a picky eater, keep offering a variety of healthy foods for your child to choose from. Kids should be encouraged to give new foods a try, but don't force them to eat. Bathroom habits. By now, your child should be able to go to the bathroom alone. [Constipation](/en/parents/constipation.html) may become a problem because some children are embarrassed to use the bathroom at school. Remind your child to take regular bathroom breaks and not to \"hold it.\" Talk to your doctor if you have concerns about your child's bathroom habits. Sleeping. Kids this age generally [sleep](/en/parents/sleep-preschool.html) about 10-13 hours each night. Most 5-year-olds no longer nap during the day. To help your child get enough sleep, you might need to set an earlier bedtime. Development. By 5 years, most kids: - can talk to another person and have more than 3 back-and-forth exchanges - tell a story with at least 2 events - answer simple questions about a book or story after being read to or told - follow rules and take turns when playing games - do simple chores - count to 10 - identify some letters and numbers - write some letters of their name - hop on one foot - button some buttons Talk to your doctor if your child is not meeting one or more milestones, or you notice that your child had skills but has lost them. 4.

This will include listening to the heart and lungs, observing motor skills, and talking with your child to assess [language skills](/en/parents/comm-4-to-5.html). 5. Update immunizations. [Immunizations](/en/parents/vaccine.html) can protect kids from serious childhood illnesses, so it's important that your child get them on time.

Explain that some [parts of the body](/en/parents/teach-about-bodies.html)are private and no one should see or touch them. Tell your child to come to you if someone asks to look at or touch their private parts, is asked to look at or touch someone else's, or is asked to keep a secret from you. - Talk to your doctor if you're concerned about your living situation. Do you have the things that you need to take care of your child? Do you have [enough food](/en/parents/feeding-families.html), a safe place to live, and [health insurance](/en/parents/buy-health-insurance.html)?
