Most often we see the interaction between intention and action in ceremonies such as weddings and birthdays. We also see this balance in everyday conversations and even eye contact. This relationship between intention and action is the foundation of the space I hold during Kambo ceremonies. Whether intention setting is familiar or unfamiliar to you, I encourage you to have an understanding as to why you are seeking to experience Kambo. Having clear intentions can open many doors for one's personal experiences and the opportunity for personal growth. Ceremonies are held in Petaluma, California. Individual and group ceremonies of 2 or more people are available. Please connect with me if you'd like to host a ceremony in your area. What to expect Newly made Kambo points from a Matses Kambo stick Kambo points applied to open gates on the right achilles area Dragons blood is used to protect & support the healing of the open gates after each ceremony. This image was taken three days after ceremony. Kambo is administered through the epidermal (most superficial) layer of the skin by lightly burning \"gates\" for the \"points\" (Kambo secretion) to enter the body. The gates are opened by a thin, non-toxic and non-scented incense stick which is lightly flicked over the surface of the skin. Once the gates are opened and the secretion is being prepared, the participant will drink 2 liters of fresh, non-alkaline water. After the water has been consumed and the secretion has been applied over the open gates, almost immediately the participant can begin to feel the effects. The rhythm of ones experience generally goes as follows, but is not limited to a Rise in blood pressure Feelings of flushing, swelling, lightheadedness/dizziness tingling in extremities or shaking Increase and decrease in body temperature Drop in blood pressure Nausea followed by purging; vomiting, diarrhea and/or emotional purging \"The stomach is emptied with such a great force, that, ultimately, bile is secreted. This seems like an unhealthy process, but it's actually not. The liver binds fat-soluble toxins into the bile and the bile is excreted through the bowels. However, during the digestion process, 90% of the bile is absorbed through the intestinal wall. This is obviously not very useful, because this also absorbs 90% of the fat-soluble toxins. Since the stomach gets rid of all the bile during a Kambo session, a large amount of toxins are excreted, which would normally be absorbed again by the body. Source Once the participant's experience is complete, the points will then be removed from the gates and the sensations will begin to subside. The after-effects of receiving Kambo can differ for each person, but generally, people may feel Very exhausted or energetically awake Subtle or strong emotions; sadness, happiness, calmness Sharpened senses and heightened mental alertness Over the course of days or weeks, one may feel a consistent elevation in their mood, an increase in physical and mental energy, a decrease in response to stressors, enhanced focus and overall, more self awareness. All of these of course, differ for each individual. Preparation Kambo frog's create nests for their offspring by securely wrapping leaves together above water so that once the tadpoles are heavy enough, the leaves give way and the tadpoles are freed into the water. Kambo is best received on an empty stomach, bladder, and bowels so it is important to fast for at least 12 hours beforehand. Alcohol should be avoided for 24-48 hours before sitting in ceremony. Give yourself 2 to 3 hours for each Kambo session, including recovery time and ideally giving yourself the rest of the day off from work or any obligations. Due to the nature of the peptides, your body temperature will fluctuate so it is best to wear loose, comfortable clothing and to bring layers. Women who are menstruating should be aware that Kambo tends to speed up their flow for about 3 days post-ceremony. It is also important to note that Kambo has been used as a way of increasing fertility and as a way of abortion for indigenous Amazonian people. With this being said, it is best for any person who is sexually active to take extra precautions for at least one week after receiving Kambo. Ceremony Cost Each ceremony includes a consultation, nourishing soup and tea post-ceremony and all supplies, including water.

Please note that Kambo is not a medical treatment and one should consult their health care provider in regards to their health plan or any cleansing program. Kambo is a shamanic ritual, indigenous vaccine and ceremonial practice from the Amazon Rainforest. Kambo is not a medical treatment. It is highly recommended that all participants do their own research in regards to the potential risks and benefits of receiving Kambo.
