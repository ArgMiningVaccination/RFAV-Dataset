Moreover, it focuses on rejuvenation therapies that promote the whole body-mind-spirit complex.\" The COVID-19 pandemic brought into perspective the fragility of our existing healthcare ecosystem. While the healthcare industry is soughting answers to make it more inclusive, holistic, and affordable in the post-pandemic world, Ayurveda has been playing a significant role in shaping the discourse around the new-age healthcare system. The current crisis is a powerful reminder of the need for more sustainable healthcare solutions, and Ayurveda is the saving grace we've all been looking for. Before we proceed, let's delve a little deeper into the science of life. AYURVEDA, THE INDIAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM Ayurveda is an age-old science that has prevailed in India since the pre-Buddhist era. It comprises a holistic understanding of health and caters to the whole body-mind-spirit complex. It is a life science that throws light upon corrective diet and lifestyle measures, with somatic practices like Yoga and meditation, use of herbal remedies and medicine, and rejuvenation therapies like panchakarma, self-massages, etc. It seeks to eliminate the root cause of health issues and caters to every individual's unique body constitution. BUTTERFLY AYURVEDA'S CORE IDEOLOGY Butterfly Ayurveda, an emerging health and wellness brand of India, that is also doing cross border sales has played a vital role in educating the masses about Ayurvedic herbs and their use in everyday life with products like Ayurvedic teas, herbal powders, supplements, tonics, and immunity boosters. Butterfly Ayurveda is an organization engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, and marketing of Ayurvedic products. BA offers a whole new spectrum of modern, yet authentic, Ayurvedic products that help integrate the power of Ayurveda into our everyday lives. BA's R&D department is the backbone of the organization. The department's approach could be termed as, \"Validation of Divine Ayurvedic Wisdom through Scientific Knowledge in the Current Era.\" Dedicated to providing qualitative and effective herbal solutions, the R&D department is committed to product development, quality control, and standardization which offers their customers safe and efficacious Ayurvedic medicines and food products. SOME OF BA'S BEST-SELLERS Ratri Chai, a nighttime tea that helps unwind and restore energy levels at the end of the day.

Effective and gentle, these sanitizers became a common favorite with the running clinics and nursing practitioners. DEVELOPMENT OF COVIFLY Butterfly Ayurveda's CORONAFLY/ COVIFLY is an Ayurvedic medicine that was developed after the first wave of COVID hit us all. This Ayurvedic formulation has a broad-spectrum antiviral action and was created with an aim to help boost immunity against COVID-19, treat flu-like symptoms, help people recover, and alleviate symptoms like high fever, sore throat, dry cough, shortness of breath, body pain, and weakness.

They believe that transparency empowers the customers to embrace Ayurveda evermore readily and help them make a better choice.
