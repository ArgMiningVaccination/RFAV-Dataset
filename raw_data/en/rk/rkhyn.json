Large government expenditures were outof the question. Still, civic organizations and local citi-zens lobbied the County Board of Public Instruction toopen a two-year public college for the area's high schoolgraduates who were unable to find employment andcouldn't afford to leave home to attend a university. County School Superintendent Joe Youngblood and Howell Watkins, principal of Palm Beach High School,consulted with the University of Florida and the FloridaState Women's College (Florida State University) andbased the College's curriculum on that of the two univer-sities. Because of the Depression-era budget, teachersat Palm Beach High School volunteered to teach at thecollege for free. A total of 41 students began classes on November 14, 1933, at the new college adjacent to the high schoolin downtown West Palm Beach. Youngblood and Watkins(the first dean of the College) founded and nurtured thefledgling institution until John I. Leonard became PBCC'sfirst president in 1936. Leonard was affectionately knownas \"Mr. Junior College\" because of his dedication to thestudents, the College and the two-year college system. By 1948, the College had outgrown its original build- ing and moved to Morrison Field, a retired Air Forcebase used in World War II, where the library was housedin a vast airplane hangar and the Officer's Club becamethe perfect Student Union Building. Just three years later,though, the Korean Conflict erupted, and Morrison Fieldwas reactivated. The air base later became Palm BeachInternational Airport. So in 1951 Palm Beach Junior College moved yet again, to Lake Park Town Hall, where the quarters were socramped students had to be turned away, and enroll-ment dropped significantly to less than 200. Chemistryclass was held in the jail. The local media dubbed it \"thelittle orphan college,\" but the Lake Park location is remem-bered fondly by its alumni for the camaraderie that existedthere. Master English and Speech Professor Watson B. Duncan taught classes in the nearby church and evenin the hallway. Duncan discovered famous actors BurtReynolds and Monte Markham in Lake Park, as well asTerry Garrity, the author of \"The Sensuous Woman.\" Almost five years later the Palm Beach County Commis- sion donated 114 acres in Lake Worth to the College,and the state gave PBJC $1 million for buildings. TheCollege finally had a permanent home. Harold C. Manor,Ph.D., became president in 1958 directing extraordi-nary growth in enrollment, services and offerings, includ-ing many technical and vocational programs. In 1965, the height of the Civil Rights Movement, the state legislature ordered that black and white two-yearcolleges be merged, and the mostly white Palm BeachJunior College and the all-black Roosevelt Junior Collegebecame one. Six professors and staff members fromRoosevelt were transferred to PBJC, and other facultymembers were transferred to the school district. A periodof adjustment ensued, and such key figures as Profes-sors Samuel Bottosto and Ed Pugh and Paul Glynn, deanand later vice president of student affairs, intervened onbehalf of the new students to make them feel welcome. In the 1970s and 80s the College established satellite centers, then permanent locations in Belle Glade, PalmBeach Gardens and Boca Raton. Edward M. Eissey,Ph.D., president from 1978 to 1996, was the drivingforce behind the building boom and the name changeto Palm Beach Community College in 1988. Current president Dennis P. Gallon, Ph.D., has expanded the College's comprehensive mission with more work-force programs and partnerships with business, indus-try, other educational institutions and various agencies.In 2008, the College received State Board of Educationapproval to offer its first four-year degree, a Bachelorof Applied Science in Supervision and Management.Upper-level courses in this degree program are sched-uled to begin in Fall 2009.

At the end of the spring term, anypart-time student who has accumulated 12 or moresemester hours credit during the combined fall and springterms with a combined term grade point average of 3.8or higher will be placed on the President's List. DEAN'S LIST At the end of fall and spring terms, any student carry-ing a full academic load (12 hours for which they receivecredit, excluding institutional credit) and earning a termgrade point average of 3.20 to 3.79 will be placed onthe Dean's List. At the end of spring term, any part-timestudent who has accumulated 12 or more semester hourscredit during the combined fall and spring terms witha combined term grade point average of 3.20 to 3.79will be placed on the Dean's List. STANDARDS OF ACADEMIC PROGRESS PBCC requires each student to maintain reasonableacademic progress. Any student not maintaining theminimum cumulative grade point average as specifiedin the Standards of Academic Progress (SOAP) policywill be placed on academic probation and could besuspended from college. Financial Aid Student Note: Students receiving Financial Aid are also affected by aseparate \"Standard of Academic Progress for FinancialAid Students Policy,\" listed in the student handbook andat www.pbcc.edu/sap.xml. Preparatory Course Note: Preparatory courses will not be calculated in students'Cumulative Grade Point Average, but will be used incalculations for term Grade Point Averages.Good Academic Status Students who are not on academic probation or dismissalfrom the College are considered in good academic status. Students in credit programs must maintain a cumula- tive grade point average (CGPA) of: 1.4 or better for 1-14 semester hours attempted 1.6 or better for 15-27 semester hours attempted 1.8 or better for 28-45 semester hours attempted 2.0 or better for over 45 semester hours attempted Academic Status Note: The College administration will continually assess the impact of the academic progres-sion policy and make adjustments as necessary to theacademic probation grade point average table above.It is anticipated that the cumulative grade point aver-age required to remain in good academic standing willincrease in the future. Therefore, it is imperative thatstudents meet with an academic advisor regularly todiscuss academic success issues and support servicesand to carefully plan their academic program. Academic Probation Probation will be continued as long as the student fails to achieve the standard cumulative grade point aver-age (CGPA) for the number of hours attempted (see tableabove). Probation will be calculated at the end of eachterm. Transfer students whose CGPA does not meet thestandard for good academic status will enroll onacademic probation. Any student on academic proba-tion will be limited in course load to a maximum of 12semester hours during the fall, spring and summer terms. Students on academic probation are required to meet with an academic advisor prior to registering for subse-quent terms. Academic advisors are authorized to limitthe number of hours and types of courses taken bystudents on academic probation. Academic probationis noted on the student's permanent record. Academic Suspension Academic suspension is the first involuntary separation.Academic suspension results from a student's failure,while on academic probation, to regain good academicstanding or achieve a minimum 2.0 term grade pointaverage (GPA). Suspension requires the student to stayout of school for one semester to reflect on theiracademic goals and level of commitment to education.Academic suspension is noted on the student's perma-nent record. Students readmitted after an academicsuspension will be on academic probation and mustmeet with an academic advisor prior to registering forclasses. ACADEMIC POLICIESAcademic Dismissal Academic dismissal is a subsequent involuntary sepa- ration imposed upon a student who, having been previ-ously suspended from the college and readmitted, failsto regain good academic status or achieve a minimum2.0 term grade point average (GPA). After one calendaryear, students on academic dismissal are eligible toappeal for readmission to the College AdmissionsAppeals Committee. Academic dismissal is noted onthe student's permanent record. An appeal for read-mission is not automatic, and the decision of the commit-tee is final. Note: Students on academic suspension or dismissal are eligible to enroll in PSAV or avocational courses. Attendance at First Class PBCC values instruction that begins at the first class meet- ing and/or lab session. Students who do not attend thefirst day of a class may be dropped from the course,depending upon the individual faculty member's atten-dance policy. It is the student's responsibility to read thecourse schedule notes and/or visit the course Web site. The College policy of reinstating students who have been dropped due to College error supersedes individualfaculty attendance policies. Audit and Withdrawal Policies Students may withdraw online using PantherWeb (www.pbcc.edu/PantherWeb.xml) or audit a class byfiling an official Audit Request Form with the Registrar'sOffice by the audit/withdrawal deadline. Deadlines arepublished in the registration calendar on the inside frontcover of this catalog. In cases of non-standard begin-ning or ending dates, the audit deadline is the last dayof add/drop, and the withdrawal deadline is 65 percentof the course session. Students with questions aboutaudit and withdrawal deadlines should contact the Regis-trar's Office. International students and athletes must get authoriza- tion from their advisor before auditing or withdrawingfrom a class. AUDIT A student may be admitted to certain courses on anaudit basis with the completed request form submittedprior to the deadline. Audit requests will not be processedafter the add/drop period ends. Classes designated asaudit during add/drop do not count as attempts. Studentsauditing a course must attend class, but they are notrequired to take tests and examinations. No auditstudents may change their schedule to seek credit in any course in which they are enrolled. Prerequisites, tuition and all special fees apply. Courses taken for the third or fourth attempt, or for high school dual enrollment/early admission may not beaudited. Students are not permitted to audit collegepreparatory courses, courses under a selected admis-sion program, or vocational credit or noncredit courses.A student may not audit a course in which he or shereceived a grade of C or higher. An instructor may with-draw an audit student (XW) for non-attendance. INSTRUCTOR WITHDRAWALS Instructors may give a non-punitive WX grade for exces-sive absences for up to 65 percent of the course session.No WX grades shall be given after 65 percent of thecourse has elapsed. Instructors may also give a puni-tive (F, N, or U) grade for excessive absences, as definedin their syllabi, up to the end of the term. Courses taken for audit are subject to the same atten- dance criteria; however, instructors may assign a gradeof XW for excessive absences at any time throughoutthe term. Note: Upon the third attempt of a credit course, a with- drawal (student or instructor) or audit will not be permit-ted and the student will receive a grade for the course. STUDENT WITHDRAWALS Students who withdraw from a course will receive a grade of W on their transcript. There is normally norefund for withdrawals submitted after the add/dropdeadline (see the calendar in this catalog for deadlines);however, if a student has certain extenuating circum-stances (such as death of family member or personalhospitalization), a refund may be considered. See RefundAppeals policy in the student handbook. Students consid-ering withdrawing from any course are strongly encour-aged to speak with an academic advisor to discuss anyimpact that a withdrawal may have financially oracademically. Certain Limited Access programs prohibitcourse withdrawals. Speak with your program advisorfor more information. A student may not withdraw from a PSAV course that meets less than two times. The deadline to withdrawfor each course is listed on the student's Class Sched-ule printout. Students are permitted a maximum of twoattempts and/or withdrawals per course. Note: Upon the third attempt, the student will not be permitted to withdraw and will receive a grade for thatcourse. Palm Beach Community College | www.pbcc.edu32ACADEMIC POLICIES 33 2008 - 2009 | Palm Beach Community CollegeEnrollment Status FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE CLASSIFICATION A student is considered a sophomore when the student has completed 24 semester hours of credit, regardlessof the number of terms the student has been in atten-dance. Until 24 hours of credit are completed, thestudent is a freshman. FULL-TIME STUDENT A student is considered a full-time student when enrolledin 12 or more semester hours of credit or 360 or moreclock hours. Although audit and preparatory coursescarry no credit, they are counted toward the student'senrollment status. When determining a student's enroll-ment status for Selective Service deferment or VeteransAdministration benefits, noncredit and preparatorycourses cannot be counted, but must be taken in addi-tion to the required number of credit hours. Institutionalcredits (i.e., college preparatory classes) are includedwhen determining a student's enrollment status. Note: Enrollment status may be defined differently for financial aid recipients. STUDENT MAXIMUM COURSE LOAD Most students are not permitted to enroll in more than 18 semester hours; however, a student who has at leasta 3.2 cumulative average may enroll in a maximum of21 semester hours. Grades GRADE CHANGE PROCEDURE Students may approach instructors to initiate an InformalGrade Appeal process at any time after the final coursegrade is assigned. If students wish to appeal the grade fur-ther, a Formal Grade Appeal process must be initiated nolater than the first thirty calendar days after classes beginin the subsequent fall or spring term. Additional GradeAppeal information is listed in the student handbook. GRADE FORGIVENESS POLICY Courses for which a grade of C or higher was earnedmay not be repeated. The last grade received will beused to calculate the grade point average (GPA). Allgrades from the third and subsequent attempts will becalculated in the GPA. The Forgiveness Policy pertains only up to the time of the awarding of degree and does not extend beyondthat time. No challenge examination (institutional, CLEP,AP, IB, etc.) may be used to forgive a grade. Institutionsto which subsequent transfer is made may not neces-sarily honor this policy.GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA) The cumulative GPA is determined by dividing the totalquality points earned by the total semester hoursattempted (including all transfer credit). Quality pointsare assigned as follows: A = 4 quality points per credit hourB = 3 quality points per credit hourC = 2 quality points per credit hourD = 1 quality point per credit hourOnly the last attempt of a repeated course will be used in computing the grade point average (except for thethird attempts and beyond that will be averaged);however, all grades appear on the student's transcript.The PBCC grade point average is determined by divid-ing the total quality points earned at PBCC by the totalsemester hours attempted at PBCC. The term grade pointaverage is determined by dividing the total quality pointsearned during a term by the total semester hoursattempted during that term. GRADE REPORTS Grade reports are not mailed. Students may access gradesvia PantherWeb - www.pbcc.edu/PantherWeb.xml , or FACTS - www.FACTS.org , using their PBCC Personal Identification Number (PIN). Students who do not knowtheir PIN may obtain it from the Admissions Office afterpresenting legal photo identification.

In those cases wherean NG is not the grade, an S or WX may be issued.ACADEMIC POLICIES 34 Palm Beach Community College | www.pbcc.eduINCOMPLETE GRADES Incomplete grades are automatically changed to puni- tive grades of F, N or U if not made up within 30 calen-dar days after classes begin in the subsequent fall orspring term. It is the student's responsibility to completeall assignments and submit them to the instructor. Classeswith incomplete grades may not be used to satisfy courseprerequisites. REPEATED COURSES AND ACADEMIC AVERAGE Only courses for which a grade of D or F was earned or withdrawals may be repeated. A student may notaudit a course in which a grade of C or higher wasreceived. A student will be permitted a maximum ofthree attempts per course. Attempts include the origi-nal grade, repeats of course grades, audits (initiated afteradd/drop) and withdrawals (student or instructor).Upon the third attempt of a course, a withdrawal oraudit will not be permitted and the student will receivethe grade earned. This grade will be used in qualitypoint average computation. All grades from the thirdand subsequent attempts will be calculated in the gradepoint average. A fourth attempt may be allowed onlythrough the academic appeals process based on majorextenuating circumstances. Fifth attempts are notallowed, and this may not be appealed. Credit can onlybe earned once per course, unless the course is desig-nated as \"repeatable\". Note: Students will be assessed the full cost of instruc- tion (out-of-state tuition), beginning with the thirdattempt for college preparatory and credit courses.Students may appeal the higher cost to the campus regis-trar through the add/drop period. Decisions are basedon state-issued guidelines.Graduation All students, without regard to the degree or certificate to be granted, must meet general requirements for grad-uation from PBCC and fulfill all financial obligations tothe College.

Transfer Degree Palm Beach Community College's associate in arts (A.A.) trans- fer degree is designed for the student who plans to transferto a Florida public university as a junior to complete a bach-elor's degree. Students spend the first two years at PBCC,where they prepare for hundreds of possible transfer majors,then their last two years at a university. During their two years at PBCC, students take the same courses that they would take as a freshman or sophomore at a univer-sity. That means a student plans his/her program of studyaround a planned major or career and the state universityhe/she wants to attend. A student graduates with an A.A.degree from PBCC, transfers to a university, and earns a bach-elor's degree in one of hundreds of different major areasavailable at the state universities. A list of popular Associate in Arts pre-majors is found toward the end of this section, and additional pre-majors are listedon the Web. The A.A. degree requirements include:36 credit hours of general education courses and 24 credit hours of university transfer program courses. It is important that a student select appropriate courses in both the General Education and university transfer programareas. A PBCC advisor can assist with course selection, orstudents can use the FACTS.org online system, as detailedin this catalog section. ASSOCIATE IN ARTS DEGREE TRANSFER PROGRAMS State universities in Florida offer more than 200 differentmajors that PBCC students can pursue. Before planning amajor, students are advised to: speak with a PBCC advisor consult the catalog or the specific department at the univer- sity to which they plan to transfer to confirm which coursesthey should take at PBCC. For a complete list of these programs see www.pbcc.edu/acsv/majors.asp. GUARANTEED TRANSFER TO THE STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM All Florida community college associate in arts graduates are guaranteed certain rights under the statewide ArticulationAgreement listed in Florida Administrative Code 6A-10.024.The Articulation Agreement governs the transfer of studentsfrom Florida public community colleges to the state univer-sity system. Guarantee of university admission does notguarantee admission to a limited access program. In a limitedaccess program, the admissions requirements are more selec-tive and may include a higher grade point average (GPA),higher test scores, auditions and/or portfolios. Selection foradmissions to university limited access programs is compet-itive. However, community college A.A. graduates have thesame opportunity to enroll in these programs as students whobegan at the university.AREAS OF STUDY 45 2008 - 2009 | Palm Beach Community CollegeAA DEGREE FOREIGN LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT For undergraduate admission to a state university, students must have earned two credits of sequential foreign languageat the high school level. If a student did not complete thisrequirement while in high school, the requirement can bemet through successful completion of eight credit hours inone foreign language, or demonstration of proficiency bypassing a College Level Examination Program (CLEP) foreignlanguage test. Satisfaction of this university admissionrequirement may not satisfy a specific university graduationrequirement of foreign language for certain majors. Studentsare encouraged to determine the graduation requirementsfor the university they plan to attend. CHOOSING THE PROPER COURSES TO SATISFY UNIVERSITY ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS All state universities have provided lists of courses that meet admission requirements for each of its majors. These lists,also known as \"common prerequisites,\" detail the requiredcourses needed in both General Education and universitytransfer program courses. In order to have each course atPBCC count towards A.A. graduation and facilitate transferto the desired major at the university, students should targettheir desired transfer university and major early in their course-work at PBCC. Once a student has identified the universityand program, finding the correct courses to take at PBCCcan be accomplished by: 1. Meeting on a regular basis with a PBCC advisor who can track your progress and make sure you are taking the correctcourses for your desired university and major; OR 2. Using the Web site developed by the State of Florida to facilitate student transfer called FACTS.org (FloridaAcademic Counseling and Tracking for Students), whichis detailed at the end of this section. OTHER TRANSFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE ASSOCIATE IN ARTS DEGREE PBCC has transfer agreements with several private colleges and universities from around the nation. Included are all themembers of Independent Colleges and Universities ofFlorida (ICUF). For transfer agreement information, visitwww.pbcc.edu/transfer.xml . GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE A.A. DEGREE Responsibility for understanding and meeting the require- ments for graduation rests with the student.

For example, MGF 1106 Liberal ArtsMathematics will satisfy the associate in arts degree require-ments in mathematics but will not satisfy entrancerequirements for a student who wishes to transfer to an upperdivision business administration program. It is imperative tocheck the FACTS.org Web site to find the correct courses, orsee a PBCC advisor.

This common coursenumbering system is used to assist in transferring coursecredit between participating colleges and universities. Each participating school controls the title, credit, content, and level of each course they offer. The levelis the first number in the course number. It generallytells the year or level at which this course is offered.(Ex. SYG 1010 is a freshman level course.) This numberdoes not affect the transferability of a course. The courselevel numbers at PBCC are as follows: 0* - college prep credit, vocational prep, and PSAV (do not transfer), 1 - freshman year, and 2 - sophomore year. *Some EAP college preparatory courses are level \"1\" courses but do not transfer. These courses will be listedas \"institutional credit\" in the course descriptions. THE COURSE PREFIX The course prefix is a three-letter grouping that stands fora major division of an academic discipline, subject area,or sub-category of knowledge. (Ex. SYG stands forGeneral Sociology). The prefix does not identify thedepartment which offers a course. Instead, the coursecontent determines the prefix given to a course. The course identifier, the prefix and the last three num- bers of the course numbers (Ex. SYG 1010), are assignedby members of faculty discipline committees appointedby the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee.These committees are made up of a balance of facultyfrom two- and four-year, public and private, participatingschools that offer this subject area or specialization. SYG _010 is a survey course in social problems offered by 35 different two- and four-year colleges and univer-sities in Florida. Each school uses \"SYG_010\" to identifyits social problems survey course. The title may vary ateach school and the level code (see paragraph two underFlorida Statewide Course Numbering System) may differ.PBCC offers SYG 1010, American Social Problems. Thefreshman level Problems.\" In science and other areas, some courses will have a \"C\" or \"L\" after the course number. The \"C\" stands for a com-bined lecture and lab course that meets in the sameplace at the same time. The \"L\" stands for a lab course orthe lab part of a course with the same number, whichmeets at a different time or place. GENERAL RULE FOR EQUAL COURSES Transfer of any successfully completed course from oneschool to another school is guaranteed in cases wherethe transfer course has the same course identifier as theone offered by the receiving school. Transferable courseshave the same identifier and equal faculty credentials atthe host school and the receiving school. For example,SYG 1010 is offered at PBCC. The same course is offeredat a participating four-year school as SYG 2010. A stu-dent who has successfully completed SYG 1010 at PBCCis guaranteed transfer credit for SYG 2010 at any partic-ipating four-year school in Florida to which the studenttransfers. The student cannot be required to take SYG2010 again since SYG 1010 is equal to SYG 2010. Witha few exceptions, transfer credit must be awarded forsuccessfully completed equal courses. It must be used bythe participating two- or four- year school to satisfydegree requirements in the same way it would be usedfor the same credits earned by students who attend thereceiving school. Receiving schools have the prerogativeof offering transfer credit for other successfully com-pleted courses in addition to equal transfer courses.

AUTHORITY FOR ACCEPTANCE OF EQUAL COURSES Section 1007.24(7), Florida Statutes, states: Any student who transfers among postsecondary institutions that are fully accredited by a regional or national accrediting agencyrecognized by the United States Department of Education and thatparticipate in the statewide course numbering system shall beawarded credit by the receiving institution for courses satisfacto-rily completed by the student at the previous institutions. Creditshall be awarded if the courses are judged by the appropriatestatewide course numbering system faculty committees repre-senting school districts, public postsecondary educational insti-tutions, and participating nonpublic postsecondary educationalinstitutions to be academically equivalent to courses offered atthe receiving institution, including equivalency of faculty creden-tials, regardless of the public or nonpublic control of the previ-ous institution. The Department of Education shall ensure thatcredits to be accepted by a receiving institution are generated incourses for which the faculty possess credentials that are compa-rable to those required by the accrediting association of the receiv-ing institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses thatare entered in the statewide course numbering system. Creditsawarded pursuant to this subsection shall satisfy institutionalrequirements on the same basis as credits awarded to nativestudents. Questions about the Statewide Course Numbering System and appeals regarding course credit transferdecisions should be directed to Academic Services atPBCC (561) 868-3893 or the Florida Department 1401 TurlingtonBuilding, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0400.
