A 2 DAY CLEANSE  is a short-term detoxification plan that can help reset your eating habits. Learn more about how to do a cleanse safely and effectively.", "sitename": "BetterMe Blog", "date": "2022-09-15", "cleaned_text": "If you've tried one of the popular juice cleanses or one of the many fad diets out there and you're still not seeing results, here's what you need to know. No amount of detox tea, juice, or restrictive dieting can truly reset your body.The most these overpriced and trendy cleanses can do is help you shed water weight, which you'll gain right back as soon as you resume eating solid foods. Furthermore, starvation, calorie restriction, and skipping meals can actually lead to weight gain in the long run ( [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5139007/)). And let's not get started on the potential side effects of these cleanses, which can range from headaches and fatigue to nausea and dizziness. In order to see long-lasting results, you need to make lasting changes to your lifestyle and diet.This 2-day cleanse is designed to help you jumpstart your journey to a healthier you. It works by supporting the function of your liver and kidneys, two organs responsible for cleansing your body of toxins. This cleanse is also rich in fiber, which helps to promote regularity and prevent constipation. By the end of the 2 days, you may feel lighter, less bloated, and more energized. What Does A 2-Day Cleanse Do? Your body has its own [detoxification](https://betterme.world/articles/7-day-vegan-cleanse/) system. Here's a brief look at the main organs involved: - The Liver: The liver is the body's largest internal organ. It filters blood coming from the digestive tract, breaking down toxins and getting rid of them through bile or urine. It also produces bile, a yellowish-green fluid that helps break down fats in the small intestine. - The Kidneys:The kidneys are a pair of organs located in the middle of your back, just below the ribcage. They filter blood and remove waste products, which are then eliminated through urine. - The Colon:The colon, or large intestine, is a long, coiled tube that absorbs water and electrolytes from indigestible food matter. It also eliminates solid wastes from the body. The 2-day cleanse works by nourishing your body with nutrients and supporting the function of these organs. This, in turn, helps your body get rid of toxins more efficiently. The idea is that by giving your body a break from ultra processed foods and other unhealthy substances, you give it a chance to reset. This cleanse is not about starving yourself or depriving your body of essential nutrients. It's about giving your body the nourishment it needs to function optimally and supporting its natural ability to cleanse itself. Aside from dietary changes, this weekend cleanse also involves initiating lifestyle changes that support optimal body function. Can You Lose Weight On A 2-Day Cleanse? You may lose a few pounds on this cleanse, but it's mostly [water weight](https://betterme.world/articles/21-days-cleanse-diet/). The goal of this cleanse is not weight loss, but rather to give your body a chance to reset and promote optimal function. That being said, making healthy lifestyle changes after the cleanse can help you lose weight and keep it off in the long run.These changes may include eating more whole foods, cooking at home more often, and getting regular exercise ( [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221839/)).

Unlike a 2 day juice cleanse, this home cleanse does not require you to purchase any special juices or teas. All you need is a few days' worth of healthy, whole foods and some basic kitchen supplies. Follow the steps below to get started: 1. Clean Out Your Pantry Gear up for the start of a healthy new week by doing a little pantry clean-out. Toss any ultra processed [foods](https://betterme.world/articles/3-day-cleanse-to-lose-belly-fat/), junk food, and unhealthy snacks ( [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6146358/)). This will make it easier to resist temptation during the cleanse. You want your pantry to be stocked with healthy, whole foods that you can easily cook and prepare. Here are a few healthy pantry staples to keep on hand: - Whole grains: oats, quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat pasta - Legumes: beans, lentils, chickpeas - Nuts and seeds: almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds - Healthy fats: olive oil, avocado oil, nut butter 2. Plan Your Meals You'll need to eat 3 meals per day during the [cleanse](https://betterme.world/articles/lemon-maple-syrup-diet/), plus 2 snacks. It's important to plan your meals in advance so that you don't get too hungry or make unhealthy food choices. Each meal should include a source of protein, [healthy fats](https://betterme.world/articles/3-day-cleanse-diet/), and complex carbohydrates. This will help you feel satisfied and give you sustained energy throughout the day. For the 2 day cleanse, you'll need \"detoxifying\" foods that support smooth running of your body's natural detox system. Below are some meal ideas inspired by Dr. Oz's 48-Hour Weekend Cleanse. Breakfast Options Start your morning off with [high-fiber foods](https://betterme.world/articles/5-day-juice-cleanse/) that will help move things along. Option 1: Quinoa With Prunes Quinoa is a complete protein, meaning it has all the essential amino acids your body needs. It's also high in fiber, which is important for gut health ( [15](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/quinoa/#:~:text=Quinoa%20and%20Health&text=Unlike%20some%20plant%20proteins%2C%20quinoa,intolerance%20such%20as%20celiac%20disease.)). Prunes are a natural laxative and can help relieve constipation, but you can substitute with any dried or fresh fruit you like ( [17](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25109788/)). Ingredients: - 1/2 cup quinoa, rinsed - 1 cup water - 1 pinch nutmeg - 1 tsp grated ginger - 1 tbsp flaxseed oil - 1/3 cup chopped prunes - 1/4 cup rice milk (or any other type of milk you prefer) Instructions: - Combine quinoa and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil. - Stir in nutmeg, ginger, and flaxseed oil. - Add prunes and rice milk. Lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until quinoa is cooked through.

Option 2: Kale, Pineapple And Ginger Detox Drink Juicing kale is a great way to get your greens in without having to [eat them](https://betterme.world/articles/5-day-cleanse-to-lose-10-pounds/). Kale is high in fiber and antioxidants, both of which are important for detoxification ( [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22744944/)).Your kidneys will love the antioxidants in kale, and the fiber will help your body eliminate toxins through the GI tract. Pineapple has bromelain, an enzyme that helps with digestion by breaking down protein ( [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3529416/)), and ginger is a natural [anti-inflammatory](https://betterme.world/articles/citrus-diet/) that may [help stimulate bile flow in the liver](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3228982/) ( [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/)).

Ingredients: - 1/2 cup pineapple - 2 large cucumbers - 1 bunch kale without stems (4 cups chopped) - 1/2 lemon, squeezed - 1/4 inch of ginger - 1 bunch of mint (1/2 cup) Instructions: - Juice all ingredients in a blender. Add ice if desired for [consistency](https://betterme.world/articles/weight-loss-mindset/). - Pour into a glass and drink immediately. Option 3: Pineapple, Lemon And Pomegranate Blend-Free Detox Drink This is a great juice to drink first thing in the morning. The pineapple and pomegranate are high in antioxidants, which help protect your cells from damage. The lemon is a good source of Vitamin C. Pomegranate may also have protective effects on the liver ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7074153/)). This drink isn't a meal replacement, so be sure to pair it with healthy breakfast foods that provide protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs. Ingredients: - 3/4 cup unsweetened pineapple juice - 1 lemon - 1 cup unsweetened pomegranate juice - 3 cups water Instructions: - Mix all ingredients together in a pitcher. - Serve over ice and enjoy!

They're also a good source of fiber, which is important for gut health ( [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7770496/)). Dip them in some hummus or guacamole for a satisfying snack. Alternatively, dress them with olive oil and vinegar for a light and refreshing [option](https://betterme.world/articles/low-carb-keto-tacos/). Option 2: Fruit Fruit is a great source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants ( [23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315720/)). Pair them with yogurt or nut butter for a balanced snack. Choose any fruits you like, such as: - Dark berries: blackberries, blueberries, raspberries contain high levels of antioxidants that can help protect your cells - Citrus fruits: lemons, oranges, grapefruits are a good source of Vitamin C, which is important for immune health - Apples: apples are a good source of fiber, which can help with digestion Option 3: Herbal Teas Certain teas can be helpful for detoxification. Try to drink 1-2 cups per day of these teas instead of sugary beverages: - Dandelion tea: dandelion may be a natural diuretic that can help promote healthy kidney function which flushes toxins from the body ( [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3155102/)). - Nettle tea: nettle is a nutrient-rich herb that is rich in vitamins and minerals ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6100552/)). - Ginger tea: ginger is a warming spice that can help to stimulate digestion and has antioxidant properties ( [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92775/)). - Peppermint tea: peppermint is a refreshing herb that is said to help soothe the digestive system ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7767097/)). - Chamomile tea:chamomile is a calming herb that has been used traditionally to help ease digestive discomfort ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2995283/#:~:text=Chamomile%20has%20been%20valued%20as,fevers%20in%20children%20(36).)).

Tofu, tempeh, and edamame can be added to soups, salads, stir-fries, and grain dishes. Be sure to include complex carbs and healthy fats for a complete meal.

They also contain fiber, which is important for gut health ( [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9017484/)). Cruciferous vegetables can be enjoyed cooked or raw. They can be added to soups, salads, and whole grain dishes. They can also be enjoyed on their own with a yogurt-based dip, hummus, or guacamole. Be sure to pair your veggies with protein, complex carbs, and healthy fats for a complete meal. 3. Get Moving You've cleared your pantry and meal prepped in readiness for the 2-day cleanse. Now it's time to get your body moving. Exercise is important for overall health, but it also plays a role in detoxification. It helps to increase circulation and promote the elimination of toxins through sweat. In addition, exercise helps to reduce stress, which can be a trigger for unhealthy eating ( [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1402378/)). Aim for 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise on each day of the cleanse. moderate-intensity activities include walking, swimming, and biking. If you're new to exercise, start with low-intensity activities and gradually increase the intensity over time. 4. Drink Plenty Of Fluids It's important to drink plenty of fluids while you're cleansing. Water helps to flush toxins from the body and keeps you hydrated ( [24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908954/)). Aim for 8-10 glasses of water per day, or more according to your individual needs. You can also drink herbal teas. Just stay away from alcohol and sugary drinks during this cleanse. 5. Sleep Getting enough sleep is important for overall health, but it's also crucial for detoxification ( [5](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/brain-may-flush-out-toxins-during-sleep)). Sleep helps the body to repair and heal itself. It also helps to reduce stress, which can be a trigger for unhealthy eating. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night. 6. Relax The final step in the 2-day cleanse is to relax. Stress can be a trigger for unhealthy eating, so it's important to find ways to relax and de-stress. Some relaxation practices like deep-breathing encourage the lungs to work more efficiently, which helps to promote detoxification. They also improve blood circulation and digestion, both of which are important for detoxification.
