If you're searching for a pediatric naturopath to help you navigate your family's health and wellness journey, we would love to meet you. Autism Dr. Calhoun is a MEDMAPS trained physician who uses a biomedical approach to addressing Autism. At Kith and Kin Wellness, we believe that Autism is a multifactorial disease process that is triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by a collection of environmental factors. These environmental factors can lead to whole-body dysregulation and dysfunction. Dr. Calhoun takes the time to listen to your story and investigate all potential inciting factors, which can include gut dysbiosis, immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, detoxification impairments, nutrient deficiencies, factors-all of which may be treatable with integrative medicine. After a taking a thorough history and physical examination, Dr. Calhoun will present options for advanced lab testing, which can further help determine your child's underlying imbalances. Together, you will decide on a plan of action that best suites your child's needs. We fully believe that Autism is treatable and will not stop in our investigation until we get to the root cause! Behavioral and Mental Health Disorders We are experts in treating mental health disorders in children and adults with non-pharmacological methods. Dr. Calhoun specializes in Advanced Nutrient Therapy, which utilizes nutrients (ie. amino acids, vitamins, and minerals) to correct underlying neurotransmitter imbalances. The four main underlying imbalances we assess for include: ovemethylation, undemethylation, copper overload, and pyrrole disorder. To learn more about each of these imbalances and how it presents, you can watch [Dr. Calhoun's webinar on these 4 main biotypes](https://vimeo.com/430072406). In addition to this form of Nutrient Based Psychiatry, we look for other underlying imbalances, including, immune dysfunction, gut dysbiosis, food sensitivities, and environmental toxicity. If your child is suffering with behavioral/conduct concerns, ADHD, anxiety, OCD, sensory processing disorder, disordered eating or depression, you are in the right place! We have great success in both keeping children from needing medication and also from weaning off of medication! PANS/PANDAS Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS) and Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) are common autoimmune disorders that present with physiological, behavioral, and cognitive challenges. They are often diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), tics (involuntary, purposeless movements), or an eating disorder, but the hallmark of PANS/PANDAS presentation is that the onset is extremely acute, so much so that many parents of children with PANS/PANDAS may report that there was a dramatic change \"overnight.\" In addition, they may have symptoms of depression, irritability, sleep difficulties, anxiety, and have difficulty with schoolwork. It is important to remember that PANS/PANDAS is a clinical diagnosis based on the history of acute onset of symptoms, and does not rely on a single lab test. In order to properly diagnose PANS/PANDAS, we take a thorough and extensive medical history, along with a comprehensive and nutritional physical exam. Because of this, our initial consults are about 1.5 hours in length. It is important that we prioritize this time for our families to ensue you are able to give us all of the necessary details for us to identify and treat the root cause. PANS/PANDAS is associated with an infectious trigger and immune dysregulation, so successful treatment requires identification of the root cause. For PANDAS patients, a recent streptococcal infection, such as strep throat, peri-anal strep or scarlet fever will be identified and treated often times with antibiotics and corticosteroids. PANS is not as easily identified and may be triggered by mycoplasma, viruses, yeast overgrowth, parasites, Lyme and Lyme co-infections, environmental exposures (mold, chemicals, heavy metals, or allergies), and other metabolic factors. Because of the sudden onset and severity of this disorder, we understand how devastating this can be for families. However, with a thorough investigation and appropriate use of natural and conventional interventions, this illness can be treated, flares can be reduced, and children living with PANS/PANDAS can begin to thrive! Eczema Eczema, also called atopic dermatitis, is a common skin condition marked by itchy and inflamed patches of skin. It often first strikes in early childhood, but can impact children and adults at any age. While eczema is apparent on the skin, it is not just a disorder of the skin- it is rooted in immune dysregulation, with features including, elevations in histamine and inflammatory molecules that cause a breakdown of the skin barrier. The goal with eczema treatment is three fold: 1) determine factors that are provoking the immune system, including environmental allergens, environmental toxins, food sensitivities or allergies, and gut dysbiosis; 2) support the immune system in creating a regulated immune response be stabilizing mast cells and creating homeostasis amongst the Th1 and Th2 arms of the immune system; 3) repair the skin barrier and provide symptomatic relief while correcting the underlying imbalance. Autoimmunity Autoimmunity is the state in which the immune system reacts against the body's own normal components, producing disease or functional changes. The human immune system performs a surveillance function, identifying and disposing of antigens\u2014materials such as toxins or infectious microbes that it recognizes as foreign. Sometimes this surveillance process is dysregulated, and the immune system starts to tag and attack healthy cells within the body. Molecular mimicry is one explanation for autoimmune diseases: after the immune system is activated by a food protein, virus/bacteria, or toxic substance whose surface contains antigens similar to those found in the body, the immune system may respond inappropriately by trying to damage these cells with similar surface antigens in otherwise healthy joints, blood vessels, or other organs. When working with autoimmunity, we take a comprehensive root cause approach that includes a thorough evaluation and treatment of the gut microbiome, as 80% of the immune system is within the gastrointestinal tract. We will also evaluate for many other factors, including, environmental toxicity, mold, stress/trauma, infections, and vaccine induced reactions. Other Conditions We Treat Acne Acute Illness Acne Constipation/Diarrhea Hormonal Imbalances Feeding Difficulties Infant Feeding Disorders Mold Disease Seizure Disorders Tic Disordes/Tourettes Naturopathic Well-Child Visits We love working alongside parents to help create an environment for children to thrive. We recognize the gaps in traditional pediatric care, and realized that parents are left to do their own research on how to best support their child in areas such as gut health, environmental health, nutrition, vaccine supports, and more! To solve this concern, we have created the Naturopathic Well-Child Consultations which fill these gaps and support parents in navigating these very important topics. "}
