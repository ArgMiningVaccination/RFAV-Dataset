Because lymphocytes account for only 20 to 40% of the total white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocytopenia may go unnoticed if the WBC count is checked without a differential. The normal lymphocyte count in adults is 1000 to 4800/mcL (1 to 4.8 \u00d7 109/L; in children < 2 years, the normal count is 3000 to 9500/mcL (3 to 9.5 \u00d7 109/L). At age 6 years, the lower limit of normal is 1500/mcL (1.5 \u00d7 109/L). Different laboratories may have slightly different normal values. Almost 65% of blood T cells are CD4+ (helper) T cells. Thus, most patients with lymphocytopenia have a reduced absolute number of T cells, particularly in the number of CD4+ T cells. The average number of CD4+ T cells in adult blood is 1100/mcL (range, 300 to 1300/mcL [1.1 \u00d7 109/L with a range of 0.3 to 1.3 \u00d7 109/L]), and the average number of cells of the other major T-cell subgroup, CD8+ (suppressor) T cells, is 600/mcL (range, 100 to 900/mcL). It is important to note that the lymphocytes in the blood represent only a small proportion of the total lymphocyte pool, and the lymphocyte count may not always correlate with the composition and numbers of lymphocytes in other lymphoid (eg, nodes, spleen) and non-lymphoid (eg, lung, liver) tissues. Similarly, deficiencies of particular subsets of lymphocytes (eg, CD8+, B, NK cells) can also be missed. Etiology of Lymphocytopenia Lymphocytopenia can be Acquired Inherited Acquired lymphocytopenia Acquired lymphocytopenia can occur with a number of other disorders (see table [Causes of Lymphocytopenia ](/professional/hematology-and-oncology/leukopenias/lymphocytopenia#v12504060) [ Causes of Lymphocytopenia ](/professional/hematology-and-oncology/leukopenias/lymphocytopenia#v12504060) ).

Lymphocytopenia may also reflect impaired lymphocyte production arising from destruction of thymic or lymphoid architecture.

Lower lymphocyte counts portend a poor prognosis and an increased likelihood of requiring ICU admission and of dying from the disease.

Avoid giving live vaccines (because of the risk of causing infection) in these patients. Inactive or recombinant vaccines are safe, but their efficacy is variable depending on type and severity of the lymphocytopenia. Key Points Lymphocytopenia is most often due to AIDS, and recently COVID-19, or undernutrition, but it also may be inherited or caused by various infections, drugs, or autoimmune disorders. Patients have recurrent viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections. Lymphocyte subpopulations and immunoglobulin levels should be measured. Treatment is usually directed at the cause, but occasionally, IV or subcutaneous immune globulin or, in patients with congenital immunodeficiency, stem cell transplantation is helpful. Avoid giving live vaccines in these patients. "}
