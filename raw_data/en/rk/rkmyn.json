Wherein (as it were in a Platform) is shewed, What the Labor is; What the Order and Series; And what the Work in our Systeme. In this we will consider, - 1 The Definition and Division of Medicine and Alchymy. - 2 The Method of the Hermonical Systeme; and the Idea of the whol Practice. Chap. 1. Of the Definition of Medicine and Alchymy. I. The Definitions of Medicine which Galen, and most others have brought, are rather Descriptions than Definitions. HIppocrates his Definition is this: Medicine is an adding of things necessary and a substracting of things not necessary. [Page 120](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/140:9?vid=115407) But this includes a Description of the Office of a Physitian: For al Diseases coming either of Emptiness or Fulness, the first is cured by Addition, the second by Substraction. Others Define Medicine thus: Medicine is a Knowledg restoring and preserserving the health of the Body of Man. Others thus: Medicine is a knowledg, preserving Health, and expelling Diseases. Others thus: Medicine prescribes a right Diet to people in Health, and cures such as are sick. But never a one of these are true Definitions: - 1 Because Medicine it self doth not this, but it appoints such things as do it, and that not alwaies neither. - 2 Health is the Proposition of the Art of Physick, and its End is the obtaining of it; and it is necessary for a Physitian to know by what means Health may be maintained being present; and restored, being absent. Herophilus had another Definition. Medicine is the Knowledg of things Healthful, not Healthful, and Neuters, between both. Things are said to be Healthful or Unhealthful, three waies: - 1 As a Body. - 2 As a Cause. - 3 As a Sign. [Page 121](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/141:9?vid=115407)A Body is said to be Healthful when it is in health, Unhealthful when diseased. A Cause is Healthful which causeth Health, Unhealthful which causeth Diseases. The Sign shews Health a coming; Unhealthful which shews encrease, or il end of the Disease. The knowledg of Neuters is two-fold. - 1 In respect of Desidence, when any declines from the integrity of Action, and receives hurt thereby. - 2 A Neuter of Recovery, when any first of al begin to mend of a Disease. Hence others make another Definition of Medicine, which is this: Medicine is an Art which conserveth sound Men in Health, restores the Sick, and preserveth Neuters from Diseases. Or if you wil have it plainer thus: Medicine is the Knowledg of things Natural, not Natural, and against Nature. But this belongs to the Practice, and Definition is only Theorical; whence it appears that they are imperfect. I shal satisfie my self with this short, yet compleat Definition. II. Medicine is an Art of Healing well. This Definition is perfect, consisting of Genus and Form. [Page 122](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/142:9?vid=115407)As for Genus, 'tis an Art (as we shewed you before, that Medicine was an Art. The Form is manifested in this word Healing, by which it is made to differ from other Arts. And I ad the word Well, to shew a difference betwixt the skilful Physitian and a Mountebank. And this Definition contains, not only al the parts of Medicine, but also al the Offices of a Physitian. III. Alchymy is an Art of dissolving all Natural Compound Bodies from that whereof they Naturally consist, thereby making them purer and stronger, and fitter Medicines for the Physitians use: Or may serve for the perfecting and transmuting of Mettals. Some hold Alchymy to be nothing else but a separation of what is pure from what is impure: But this is too general by half; for an Apothecary doth so when he scrapes the dirt off from Roots: neither doth he any less when he clarifies and strains Syrups. And although it be true an Alchymist doth this, yet is not his Industry limited under such a Bound as this is: For his work is not only external, but he penetrates to the internal parts, dissolves and separates Natural Bodies from what they Naturally consist of; he severeth what is profitable from what is unprofitable; he purifieth, altereth, and perfecteth al, and if need be joyns them together again. You have the Definition: The Division follows. [Page 123](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/143:9?vid=115407) Chap. 2. Of the Definition of Medicine and Alchymy in general. I. Medicine is either Theorical or Practical. THere are those that reject this Definition, as not accurate enough. - 1 Because by this means it is not divided into opposite parts. - 2 Because al Medicine is one Discipline, and hath but one Habit, namely, Practical and Operative. - 3 Because al Disciplines take their Denominations, not from particular things which are handled in them, but from the Subject and End to which they are directed. - 4 Because, although some things which are handled in Medicine seem to belong to Theorical Discipline, yet because al of them are not handled in respect of knowledg, but directed to some common operation or end, they are partly referred to the Subject, and partly to the End. We thought good to hold fast this Definition, not only because it is found in the Schools of Physitians, but also confirmed by reason and Authority; for both Hippocrates and Galen confessed, A Physitian ought to be a Natural Phylosopher: And the words Naturallist, and Physitian are the [Page 124](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/144:9?vid=115407) same: And that Natural Phylosophy is divided into Theorick and Practick, we prove by these Reasons: 1 Phylosophy, as the Ancients very wisely said, is a kind of Physick to cure the Diseases of the Mind. The Diseases of the Mind may be divided into two Parts. - First, Dulness of the Understanding; the effects of which is, Ignorance of the Truth. Secondly, Corruptions of Manners; the effects of which, is, A vicious Life. The Speculative part of Phylosophy is a Medicine for the first. The Practical part for the last. - 2 Because every Man naturally desires Knowledg, both of those things which pertain to Humane actions, which the Practice of Moral Phylosophy wil amply instruct you in; as also of those things which make for the finding out of Truth; which knowledg Speculative Phylosophy wil bestow upon you. - 3 Because the Subject of Knowledg is the Understanding which is two fold, Speculative and Practick, as Aristotle wel teacheth in his Ethicks: Therfore Phylosophy must also be two fold, Practick and Speculative. - 4 Because the Basis of Phylosophy is to direct the life of Man in an happy way. But to this belongs [Page 125](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/145:9?vid=115407)both Speculation and Practice, therefore Phylosophy is two fold, viz. Speculative and Practick. - 5 Because every Learning tends to some good end: to attain which, is required Knowledg, which is the Speculative part; and Operation, which is the Practick. - 6 All Learning was invented to direct those operations of Man which are in our own power, and so al viciated by the Fal of Adam. There are three sorts of Actions then, which may be rectified by Learning. - 1 The Operations of the Understanding, which are rectified by Speculative Phylosophy. - 2 The Operations of Appetite both Rational and Sensitive, which are rectified by Moral Phylosophy. - 3 Very many other operations of Man, either inherent in their Members, as Running and Leaping &c. Or acted upon other things, as Building, Painting, &c. And so both Mechanical Arts as wel as Liberal, are rectified by Practick Phylosophy. - 7 Because the Unity and Distinction of Knowledg, are taken from the Uniny and Distinction of the Object. But the Objects or Matters of Knowledg are three; for they fall either under the Action, or Effect, or only under the Knowledg: [Page 126](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/146:9?vid=115407)For whatsoever is only Speculative, was not made only to look upon, but to be produced to act or action. Hence you see that this division of Phylosophy into two parts, namely, Theorick and Practick, is very good: And if of Phylosophy, then of Physick, which indeed is but the putting of Phylosophy into practice, the one being Essential the other Remote. II. Theory is the remoter, or more common part of Medicine delivering a certain Method both of Medicinal matter, and preserving the Health of Man. It is indeed, to speak briefly, the Proaemium, or Preparation to Practice: It consists in the knowledg of things Natural, both General and Special; as also of things against Nature. III. Practice is the next, and Essential part of Medicine, giving a Reason of the Means both of preserving and restoring Health. This comes to the very Operation and End of Medicine, and indeed is the very Essence of it: It stirs up Nature, incites her to action, tels her what must be done: It administers aid to Nature where she is too weak, and routs her Enemies when they are too strong for her. IV. The parts of Practical Medicine are two, First, called not Natural; Secondly, Proper, or Method of Cure. This is Galen's Division; namely, First of all [Page 127](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/147:9?vid=115407) concerning the use of things not Natural, which respects most the Diet and ordering of the Body. Secondly, The Method of Curing, which concerns the administration of necessary Medicines. For a Physitian considering that his Duty is no less to look after present Health, than to restore it when it is lost: therfore although things not Natural appertain to the Theorical Part; yet in this respect it is broughr into Practice, and is made the first part of it: For as Theory is to be considered under a double Nature; namely, as a man is either Healthful or Sick: So Practice works upon both these Natures, namely, things not Natural to preserve Health; things Medicinal to cure Diseases. Moreover, The Medicinal part of Physick is double, General and Special: General which shews the Method of Curing: Special which shews the Instruments to cure by. V. Alchymy, or Hermetical Phylosophy is Theorick and Practick. Theorick by Paracelsians is divided into Vital and Local. By Vital they understand things Natural. By Local, things against Nature. VI. Practical Alchymy is divided by Paracelsians into Method and the Instruments of Healing. [Page 128](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/148:9?vid=115407)In Method they observe not only Physical Indications, but also the motion of the Heavens. As pertaining to Instruments; they consider the Difference, Composition, and Proportion of Medicines both Chyrurgical and Physical; they never regard Diet much in the Cure of Diseases: and this Paracelsus not only taught, but also practised; for he would drink with his Patients night and day, or else he is belyed. Thus you have the general Definition of Medicine: What follows now but that we give you an Idea of our Hermonical Systeme in two Tomes. Whereof the first shal contain the Theorick, and the latter the Practical part. Tome I. Of the Theorical part of Medicine. THis is divided into two parts, Remote and Neer. Remote, which is common both to Physick and Natural Phylosophy, and is called the Knowledg of things Natural, is either General or Special. [Page 129](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/149:9?vid=115407) Of the General Knowledg of things Natural, Or the Object of Medicine and Alchymy. 1 THe General knowledg of things Natural, is the Remote part of the Theory of Medicine; which treateth of the Object of Medicine, or Matter of curing; the Natures, Parts and other Accidents of al Elementary Bodies. By others 'tis called in non-Latin alphabet . 2 The Common Affections thereof, as also the Species, are to be considered. LIB. I. The Common Affections are called Special. 1 SToicheiologia Special, is that which delivers the common Principles of Elementary Bodies. 2 It is derived from in non-Latin alphabet ; which signifies an Element, an , which signifies to speak. 3 Its Parts are either the first, or those which arise from the first. 4 The first are Principles, Elements, and the Qualities which are in the Elements. [Page 130](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/150:9?vid=115407)5 Parts arising from the first, are Mixture and Generation, and the Temperament which ariseth from the Mixture of Qualities. Chap. 1. Of Principles. 1 A Principle is that whereby one thing or another gets its beginning. 2 And this is called either the First, or a rising from the First. The first is called Nature Naturing; the second, Nature Natured. 3 The First is, by which, and from which all things are made; but that subsisteth by it self, and draweth the original of its Essence from nothing; and therfore Plato in his Phoedon cals God, Nature Naturing. 4 That which hath his Original from the first, which we cal Nature Natured, is that by which all Natural things subsist, and from which they borrow their Name, viz. Natural. 5 Nature then is double, Universal and Particular. 6 Universal is the Power of the God-head spread through the whol World, according to which Nature acts. 7 This is taken, - 1 For that Divine Vertue which God hath planted in al things. - 2 For the Influence of the Stars, by which he acts it in al things. [Page 131](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/151:9?vid=115407)3 For the Moderater, and Nourisher of all Natural Bodies. - 4 The Pithagoreans, call'd it God himself; Virgil, an Internal Spirit; and Plato, the Soul of the World. 8 The Particular Principle or Nature, is every Natural Body taken as consisting in Matter and Form. 9 Matter, is the first Subject by which things are made. 10 Form, is the Manner, or Example they are made by. Chap. 2. Of Elements. 1 AN Element, according to Philip Melancton, is a Simple Body, containing in it the Seeds of all mixt Bodies. 2 It is two-fold, either Opacous, which is an Object of the Sight; or Transparant. Transparant either more or less. Less, as the Water. More, as the Air and Fire. 3 The Earth is an Element obscure, cold, and dry. 4 The Water is an Element less cleer, very moist, and somthing cold. 5 The Air is an Element very cleer, somthing moist, and very cold. 6 The Fire is an Element, cleerest, dryest, and hottest. [Page 132](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/152:9?vid=115407)7 Elements and Principles differ: - 1 Elements are Corporeal; Principles Incorporeal. - 2 Principles are the Objects of Reason; Elements of Sence. - 3 Principles are first and immediate, Elements compounded of the Principles, for they consist of Matter and Form; and if you wil take Elements as Principles, then take them as Sensible Principles, consisting of Matter and Form. Chap. 3. Of the three Principles of Alchymists which are contained in every Natural Body, and give it its Constitution: as also of the Faculties and Properties of the Elements and their Number according to the Doctrine of Hermes. 1 IN this particular, Alchymists reject the Opinion of Aristotle altogether. 2 According to Paracelsus, the first Matter of al things is a certain great Mystery, not perspicable to Sense, which contains in it somthing after an hidden and invisible way. 3 According to the Opinion of later Alchymists [Page 133](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/153:9?vid=115407) it is an Essential Subject containing all Forms in it: or a certain Punct from which all things flow, and to which they return as to their Center. Plato cals it the Soul of the World. 4 The Principles are either such things as are Simple, or Bodies composed of them. 5 Simples are such as consist of themselves, from whence al other things come, and to which they return. 6 Compounds are such as are made of these Simples, and return to them again: and they are divided into Bodies, Formal and Material. 7 Both Simples and Compounds then, are, either Invisible, as Formal and Spiritual: or Visible, as Material and Corporeal: and these are contained in every individual Substance. 8 Those that are Invisible, are contained within those that are Bodily: as the Soul is in the Body, and the Spirit in whatsoever lives, whereby it not only preserves it self, but begets its like. 9 They are double, Active, and Passive. 10 Actives, are nothing else but the Forms of Natural things, which God gave by his blessing at the first, and they have continued ever since. 11 Passive, as Seeds, Roots, Plants, Constellations, &c. 12 Seeds are a vital beginning, containing within it self the Spirit of what it is a Seed of, by which it produceth again its own Body, Tast, Color, [Page 134](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/154:9?vid=115407) Quality, Magnitude, and Figure. 13 Constellations are ordained by their Motions to order the Actions of Natural things, both of Herbs, living Creatures, and Minerals to concoct their Nourishment, to separate their Excrements, to supply them in matters belonging to Procreation and Increase, both continually and constantly. 14 Roots, are that which dispose to Action, Maturity, and Fruitfulness, both Plants and Trees. 15 Seeds act by another invisible way, and have a strange kind of Power within them to beget their like, having their like within them only in respect of Power, and they are, - 1 Of Living Creatures provoked by the power of Venus. - 2 Of Plants, shut up in their Seeds. - 3 Of Minerals, which is cover'd with a bulk of Rubbish. Al these have hidden Spirits in them. 16 The Formal Principles, or Active Bodies are three; whereof two are moist, and one dry: The two moist are, Mercury and Sulphur: That which is dry, is Sal. These, Hermetical Physophers cal Spirit, Soul, and Body. These three Principles, although they are Spiritual, yet being joyned with Simple Elements, they make up Material and mixt Bodies. [Page 135](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/155:9?vid=115407)17 Mercury is that sharp, penetrating, pure, and Aetherial Body; that Aerial, Subtil, and Spiritual Substance, the next Instrument of Life and Form. 18 Sulphur is that moist, sweet, oyly, viscuous Substance, the food of heat indued with a glutinative Quality. 19 Sal, is that salt, dry and purely terrene quality, representing the Nature of Salt, indued with wonderful Vertues, having power to dissolve, coagulate, clense, evacuate, and to perform such like actions. 20 The Visible Elements are two; one dry, which is the Earth; the other moist, which is the Water. 21 The Earth is a Body separated by the Water from Sal, Sulphur, and Mercury; It is called Terra damnata, Ashes, and Caput mortuum. 22 The Water is an insipid flegm, destitute both of Sal and Sulphur, only moistening, without any manifest strength or force. 23 There are two Elements then you see, Earth and Water. 24 The Air, seeing it cannot be separated, is therefore mixed with Sulphur, or more especially with Mercury. 25 We acknowledg no other Fire, than that which they cal in English the Sky; the Greeks Aether, from burning. [Page 136](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/156:9?vid=115407)26 The Heaven is then the fourth Formal or Essential Element, or rather the fourth Essence extracted from Elements and Principles. You have the Principles and Elements: The Qualities follow. Chap. 4. Of both first and second Qualities. 1 QUality is an Affection of Body which demonstrates what it is, or the Form which moveth the Sences. 2 Qualities are either the first, because they are in Elements and Simple Bodies: or such as arise from the first, and are called Compounds. 3 Quality, is either manifest or hidden. 4 Manifest and first, is either Active, as Heat and Cold: or Passive, as Driness and Moisture. 5 Heat is the first Quality which heateth. 6 Cold is the first Quality which cooleth. 7 Moisture is the first Quality which moistneth. 8 Driness is the first Quality which dryeth. 9 The Heaven, according to Plato and the Astrologers, is the first Principle of Heat: according to the Peripateticks, it is Elementary Fire. 10 You have the first Qualities: Those which arise from them follow: And they are either Simple or Mixed. 11 Simple, are such which principally consist from the first, as - 1 Rarity and Lightness, from Heat, which moves upwards. - 2 Thickness, from Cold; which moves downwards. - 3 Softness and Thinness, from moisture; which yeilds to touching. - 4 Hardness, from Driness; which resists touching. [Page 137](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/157:9?vid=115407) 12 You have the Simple Qualities; the Mixt follow, which are, Tast, Smel, and Color. 13 Tast, is a Quality arising from a straining of an Earthy Body through a Moist, by the force of Heat. 14 It is double, Mean and Extream. 15 Mean, causeth Sweetness and Fatness, consisting of an hot and moist Quality. 16 Extream is that which shews, - 1 More Heat, as sharp, bitter, and Salt. - 2 Remiss Heat, or rather Cold, as Tart, Austere, and Sower. 17 A sharp tast proceedeth from strong heat, and thin driness, as in Pepper, Onions, &c. 18 Bitter, hath not so subtil a Driness, nor yet so strong an heat, as in Wormwood. 19 A Salt tast, hath a thicker Driness, and less Heat, as in Salt. 20 A Tart tast, consists of very much Cold, or else of very remiss Heat and Driness, as in Crabs, Verjuyce, and wild Pears. [Page 138](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/158:9?vid=115407)21 Austere, consists of less Coldness and Driness, as in our English Grapes. 22 Sowr, consists of a thin driness, and mean cold, as in Vinegar. 23 You have the Tast; the Smel follows: Smell. is a Quality arising from the straining of Moisture through Driness, caused by Heat. 24 'Tis either Mean, as Sweet and Fat; Or Extream, in which, - 1 By greater Heat, it is Sharp, Bitter and Salt - 2 By remiss Heat, it is Tart, Austere, and Sowr. 25 You have the Smel; the Color follows: Color (according to Philip Melancton) is mixture of Transparant Bodies with Opacous. 26 It is either Simple, or Mixed. 27 Simple is that which immediately consists from the qualities. 28 It is either exactly Mean, as Redness; or less Mean, as other Colors. 29 You have the the Manifest Qualities; the Hidden follow: Which are certain special Vertues, which Physitians can give no Reason for. 30 These are two-fold, which the Learned cal Idiocratia, and Pathema. 31 Idiocratia, is a Property working by it self, for which a Reason cannot be given; neither [Page 139](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/159:9?vid=115407) doth it cal for help from any thing else. And so Fennel cures the Eyes, and Peony the Fallingsickness. 32 Pathema consists in Sympathy and Antipathy: Sympathy, is a mutual Love one thing hath with another. Antipathy, is a Hatred in the like Nature: Both of them are Natural, and may cleerly be seen both in Living Creatures, Plants and Minerals. And now by the leave of my Author: I would fain demand of some of the Rabbies of our times, Whether God when he made the Creation, made not a Rational piece of Work? If so, Whether a Reason may not be given for every thing in the Creation? If that be granted me too, then, What hidden Vertue can there be in things? I cannot indure such sleepy businesses which are maintained by few, the Brats of Dr. Ignorance, and Dr. Laziness excepted. 33 You have the Principles, Elements, and Qualities of the Dogmatists, which Hermetical Phylosophers very ingeniously comprehend in Principles, Visible and Invisible. Mixture and Generation arising from these now follows. [Page 140](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/160:9?vid=115407) Chap. 5. Of Mixture and Generation in the General. 1 HEre come Two things to be considered: - 1 General: That which is needful to Generation and Putrefaction, as Alteration and Mixture. - 2 Special: as Generation and Putrefaction, or the Temperature which comes from Mixture and Alteration. 2 Alteration, is a Motion or Effect whereby another quality is procured. 3 And it is either Simple or Compound. 4 That is Simple which contains but one quality in it, and operates either in Actives or Passives. 5 In Actives, it is a Heating, which is an Alteration whereby the Cold is expelled, or else a cooling, wherby Heat is served with the same Sawce. 6 In Passives, it is a moistning, whereby Dryness is converted into Moisture: or else a Drying, whereby Moisture is changed into Driness. 7 A Compound Alteration is that which contains more qualities in it self, and 'tis called Concoction. 8 Concoction, to wit, of mixt things (for the Concoction of Living Creatures is another manner of business) is an Alteration tending to Perfection. [Page 141](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/161:9?vid=115407)9 It is Three-fold, Maturation, Elixation, and Assation. 10 Maturation, is a Concoction, by which the Fruits of Trees and Plants wax ripe. 11 Elixation, is a Concoction made by the Heat and moisture of a thing which is within it self; as things putrefie. 12 Assation, is a Concoction made by external Heat and Driness, as Meat is roasted. Chap. 6. Of Mixture according to the Opinion of the Dogmatists, and Hermetical Phylosophers. - FIrst, According to the Opinion of the Dogmatists: - 1 Mixture is an Union of Bodies to be mixed for Alteration. - 2 In matters of Passion, it consists in qualitie or substance. Matters Active, are imployed in acting. - 3 The four Elements are in al mixt Bodies according to form and quality. - Secondly, According to Hermetical Phylosophers. 1 They can by no means close with this Doctrine; for they demand (seeing Mixture is a certain Motion) Who is the Mover? By what Powter he Elements tend to Mixture in such just [Page 142](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/162:9?vid=115407)2 The Mover is a Vital Principle indued with Knowledg, the Form, Species, Seed, Constellation by whose Power and Knowledg such Divine Offices of Mixture are administred. 3 Transplantation is a certain accident of Mixture and Generation, when not that which is intended, but another thing is Generated: And this comes to pass two waies: - First, By a confusion of Seed; and so of a Horse and a shee Ass a Mule is ingendred: Or the Seeds of many Plants put close together, will produce but one Plant. - Secondly, By Degeneration, when not the same Seed comes up which you Sow; so Wheat often degenerates into Darnel. Chap. 7. Of Generation according to the opinion of Dogmatists and Hermetical Phylosophers. 1 GEneration is a Mutation from qualities, having respect to the Nature of each Subject. 2 For as Philip Melancton saith, Heat being tempered with cold, and joyned with driness and moisture, is a mixt body of al qualities and Elements. 3 Putrefaction is an Alteration bringing Corruption, from whence is bred Consent. 4 Consent is a Transit of one thing into another by certain Nurseries, [Page 143](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/163:9?vid=115407)5 According to Hermetical Phylosophers. Generation is the progression of the Seminal Spirit out of its Fountain and vital Principle into the Stage of the World: whereby of Invisible it becomes Visible, and produceth Color, Smel, Tast, Heat, Cold, Moisture, Driness. Magnitude, and Form, and all Ornaments of Body; and by this Renovation maintains a perpetuity of its own Species. 6 Whatsoever new things we see every day, they had a being before in the Seeds. 7 Whatsoever we see corrupted here every day, they are not brought again to nothing, but return again to their Fountains from whence they came. 8 For this cause are Elements necessary to Generation, which are the Wombs that contain the Seeds, and Principles of al Bodies. 9 The Places, Elements and Bodies must be agreeable to the Seeds; for the Seeds themselves have this Power, to find out what is agreeable to their own Natures; and therefore such Seeds grow Naturally in hot places, such in Cold, such in Moist and such in Dry. Sulphur is best found in one place, Mercnry in another, and Salt in a third. 10 The Seeds perform their Progress and Operation by the help of the sensible Mechanical spirits. [Page 144](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/164:9?vid=115407)11 The Mechanical Spirits are such as are adorned with an inbred Knowledg, and instructed with an Artificial Workmanship, whereby they cause Tast, Color, Smel Order, and Proportion in Natural things: He that dreams of Spirits without these endowments, dreams of nothing but Vapor and Smoke. 12 In this inferior Globe, are three famous differences of Generation; namely, of Living Creatures, Plants, and Minerals. 13 In Living Creatures, the Seminal Matter is contained in the Natural Balsom; in the Vital, Sulphur; in the Vital spirit, in the Mummy, in the Radical and first matter, &c. 14 The Generations of the superior Globe, are certain, but far different. For in the Coelestial Sphears, they continue perfect til the Consumation of al things. 15 Generation comes not by Putrefaction as people think: Putrefaction doth but administer heat, wherby the vital vertue is stirred up to action: For as in the Earth it were a Madness to think that one Plant was changed into another by Putrefaction: so above the Earth, Living Creatures beget their like, not by Putrefaction, but by the Vital spirit of the seed. [Page 145](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/165:9?vid=115407) Chap. 8. Of Temperaments. 1 TEmperament is either the end of the Mixture, or the Form of the thing mixed, or the Principle of Natural Facultie. 2 The Soul makes use of the Temperament as an Instrument to perform its Actions. 3 Temperament is the Principle without which actions cannot be performed: Take away the Temperature of a Particular part, and the Natural Actions thereof cease also. 4 The Temperament of Living Creatures is one thing, and of Creatures without life another; and yet some question whether there be any Creatures without life or not; and my self (by the leave of my Author) could afford to be one of them. 5 The Temperament of Living Creatures is either Total or Partial. 6 The Total, is either Influential or Radical. 7 Influential ariseth from the Elements. 8 Radical, is the Justice, or due giving to every one his own. 9 Justice, is Simple or Compound. 10 Simple is Four-fold, Hot, Cold, Dry, and Moist. 11 Compound is Four-fold, Hot and Moist, Hot and Dry, Cold and Moist, Cold and Dry. [Page 146](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/166:9?vid=115407)12 Temperament is to be considered in respect, - 1 Of Sex. - 2 Of Age. - 3 Of Place or Region. - 4 Of the Seasons of the Year. 13 It is called Temperament, - 1 For its Excellency. - 2 Absulutely, or Comparatively. - 3 By act or power of acting. - 4 By it self, or by accident. Also it is either Healthful or Sickly, either alone by itself, or with Flux of Matter. Fluxes of Matter which hinder Temperament are Blood, Choller, Flegm Melancholly. 14 Al these, Hermetical Phylosophers cal Salts, which are of divers abilities. And thus much of the Common Affections: The Species followeth, to wit, A Body with Life. A Body with Life. 1 It is either not sensible as Plants and Mettals: or sensible, as Living Creatures. 2 Living Creatures are either Rational, or Irrational. 3 Irrational, are Beasts; of which, some have Blood, and some have none. 4 Such as have Blood, some have Feet, and some have none. [Page 147](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/167:9?vid=115407)5 Of such as have Feet, some have two, as Birds; some have four, as Beasts. 6 Of such as have no Feet, some have Fins, as Fishes; some no Fins, as Serpents. Of al these in Order. The second Part of the first Tome. Of Living Bodies, not Sensible, and Sensible. 1 A Living Body not sensible, is that which we cal Vegetative. 2 It is either perfectly Living, as Plants; or imperfectly, as Mettals. 3 The Doctrine of Plants is called Botanical. LIB. I. Of Art Botanical. 1 ART Botanical, is the Anatomy of Plants. 2 The Instruments to be compared for this Art. as also for all other Arts, are Skill and Exercise. [Page 148](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/168:9?vid=115407)3 The Parts of this Art are Two, The shewing the Reason of them, and the History of them. The shewing the Reason of Plants. 1 It is the first part of Art Botanical, which finds out the common Natures of Plants from their Causes. 2 A Plant is a Vegetable Essence, growing for the most part out of the Earth or Water. 3 Its parts are two, A Body, and a Soul, by which the Body is nourished, encreased, and brings forth seed. 4 The Kinds of Plants are two, Simple and Compound. The simple are Garden and Wild. 5 The parts of a Plant are like or unlike. 6 As in men there are Ages, so there are in Plants, and also in Herbs; namely, before they run to Flower: in flower, in seed, or Fruit, and when they shed their seed or Fruit. 7 Of Herbs, some are nourishing, as Wheat, Barly, Oats; some less nourishing, as Violets, Marjoram, Lavender; some Medicinal, as Saffron, Ginger, Zedoary, &c. You have had the Reason; the History of Plants follows. [Page 149](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/169:9?vid=115407) LIB. II Of the History of Plants. 1 THe History of Plants, is the second part of Art Botanical: and it treats of the several kinds of Plants. 2 We divide the whol History of Plants into ten parts: namely, - 1 Fungous. - 2 Mossie. - 3 Reeds. - 4 Pulses. - 5 Solid. - 6 Such as stain not. - 7 Such as do stain. - 8 Such as are of the Nature of Poppies. - 9 Such as are propped up. - 10 Such as strengthen. 3 Of these, some are more rude, as such as are Fungous and Mossie; others more absolute and perfect, as the other eight. - 1 Such as are Fungous, contain Toad-stools, so called of their killing property: Fungus, a funere dictus. - 2 Mosses, contains both such as have narrow and broad Leaves. - 3 Reeds, of which sort are all such as bear their Fruit in Cods. - 5 Such as are solid, are Fern, Ivy, &c. - 6 Such as stain not are Endive, Succory, Scabious, Carduus &c. - 7 Such as wort, Spurge, Plantane, Mints, Arrach, , Beets. al sorts of Poppies, Mallows &c. - 9 To such as are propped up, belong Ivy, Sarsaparilla, Vines, Cucumers, all sorts of Climers. - 10 Strengthening Plants, are Willow, Olive, Mirtle Bay, Oak &c. 4 You have Botanical Art: Exercise remains, which is done two waies; by Analysis and Genesis. 5 In Plants, five things are especially to be regarded; Name, Color, Gathering, Place, and Nature. Thus you have a Body perfectly living in Plants, that which lives in Mettals follows. [Page 151](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/171:9?vid=115407) LIB III Of Metalography, or Knowledg of Mettals. 1 MEtalography is the Anatomy of Mettals. 2 Mettal is a Body imperfectly Living, growing for the most part in the Veins of the Earth. 3 Of Mettals, some are more ducible, some less. 4 More Ducible are First and Second: First are, Quick silver and Brimstone: The Second are, Natural or Artificial. 5 Natural are more precious, as Gold and Silver: or less precious, as Copper, Iron, and Lead. Artificial, are Steel, Pewter, or Brass. 6 Mettals less Ducible, are hard, or such as people throw. 7 Such as are hard, are some more precious, and such as are called Gems; or such as are taken for Gems. 8 Of Gems, some have many colors, others but one. Such as have many Colors, are either more or less Transparant. 9 More Transparant are Crystalline, Diamond, Saphire, Emerald, the Load-stone, Alectoris, and Lapis Chrysopas Hematites, Chrysolite, Aetites, Beril. 11 Stones improperly taken as Gems are, - 1 Such as are taken from Creatures living in the Water, as Pearls, Crabs-eyes, stones of the Perch, and Carp &c. - 2 Such as are taken out of Land Creatures, as those that are taken out of Snakes, Toads, Snails, Lapis Lincis, Bezoar &c. - 3 Such as are taken out of flying Creatures, as Alectorius, or Cock stone; Celidonius, or Swallows a Vultur and Lapwing. 12 Mettals which are thrown up and down, are some Common, others not Common. Common are stones of al sorts, Sand, Flints &c. Not Common are either, - 1 Earths: as Terra L\u00e9mnia: Terra Armenia: Terra Sylesia: Chalk Auripigmentum: Chrysocolla: Sanderach: Glass. [Page 153](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/173:9?vid=115407) Another Division of Stones. 1 OF stones, some are more precious, some less. Those which are more precious, alter by a quality Manifest or Hidden. They that alter by a way Manifest do it according to the first or second quality. 2 According to the first quality; they are cold - 1 In the first Degree: as Jacynth: Saphire: Emerald. - 2 In the second Degree: as Ruby: Carbuncle: Granate: Sardine. - 3 In the fourth Degree: as Diamonds. 3 By the second manifest quality they resist Poyson less precious are either altering or purging. Such as alter do it by a way either Manifest or Hidden. Manifest by a first or second quality. 6 Such as alter by a first quality, are either hot: as dry: as Sand. 7 Such as alter by a second quality are binding: as Lapis Asius: clensing, as that Arabick stone that dryeth the Hemorrhoids. Or Glutinating, as Galactices, Melites. Or Scarifying, as Galaxia. Or breaking the stone, as Lapis Lincis, and Judaicus. Or retaining the Birth, as Lapis Aetitis being tied to the left Arm, staies the Birth: Being boyled in Beer, or put into Bread, he that hath stolen any thing from you cannot either eat or drink. Or provoking the Terms, as the stones of Oysters, a dram of them being taken in Wine. Or resisting Poyson and Inchantment, as Selenites, and Amyanthus. The Stone in the head of a Toad being born about one, easeth the pains of the Reins, and hindreth the breeding of the stone. 8 Stones less precious, altering by a hidden quality, are Spongites, Pantarbes, which draws Gold as the Load-stone doth Iron. stone, Load-stone, the Pouder whereof being drunk in Juyce of Fennel cures the Dropsie. All Stones found in the heads of any Fishes whatsoever, being beaten into Pouder, and drunk in Wine, break the stone in the Body of Man, and give easie Labor to Women in Travel. The stone of a Vultur, and of a Lapwing, Lapis Lyncurius, Coral, ten grains being given to an Infant in breast milk for the first food it takes after it is born, keeps [Page 155](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/175:9?vid=115407) a Child from ever being troubled with the Falling sickness. Another Division of Stones. OF Stones, some are Red, others Green, some Yellow, others Purple, some Black, others White, and some of such a Color, we know not what denomination to give it. - I. Stones of a Red Color, are - 1 Anthracites, which burns like fire: being put into the fire it ceaseth burning; being sprinkled with Water, it burns again. - 2 Baalagius. - 3 Carbuncle. - 4 One kind of the Swallows stone; for if you take yong Swallows out of their nest & cut them open before they touch the ground, between the time they are hatched, and the next full Moon; you shall find two little stones in their Ventricle, the one of which is Red, the other Black. The Red cures Feavers, and causeth love between people: The Black one being bound under the Armpit, helps the Falling-sickness; or if you wil, you may beat it into Pouder, and drink it in some Liquor, for the same use. - 5 Red Coral is good against the Falling-sickness. - 6 Granate. - 7 Hematites. [Page 156](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/176:9?vid=115407)8 Red Jacynth. - 9 Lychnis. - 10 Ruby, which being worn in a Ring takes away evil Dreams. - 11 Sardine; which is an excellent Remedy against Poyson, and vain Fears; and quickens the Wit. - 12 Red Carniolus. - II.

[Page 162](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/182:9?vid=115407) Mettals. 1 SOme alter by Conservation, some by Corruption. Those which alter by Conservation, do it by a Quality either Manifest or Hidden. They which alter by a way Manifest, do it by a first or second Quality. By a first Quality they are Temperate, as Gold; or Intemperate, namely, Hot and Dry, or Cold. 2 Those which are Hot and Dry, are so either - 1 In the second Degree, as Iron, and Crocus Martis, Cynnabaris. - 2 In the third Degree; as Vert-de-greece, Burnt Brass, Scales of Brass, Allum, Salt Niter, Brimstone, Chalsites.

But whether Beasts be Rational or no, is more than my Author can tel: I am deceived if he do not contradict himself in this very particular, for in his first Book, Chap. 8. he confesseth that Man learned both Physick and Alchymy from the Beasts: Is not he that teacheth more knowing than he that is taught? If my Author be minded to leave the Truth, and follow Aristotle, he should have said so. But to follow my Authors Method, and to leave his failings. The Doctrine of Bruits is called Zoography: but the special knowledg of Men Physiologie. [Page 164](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/184:9?vid=115407) LIB. IV. Of Zoography. 1 ZOography is the Anatomy of Bruits. 2. Of Bruits, some are Insecta, others whol. 3 Insecta, are either such as have Wings, or such as have none. 4 Such as have Wings, are such as - 1 Have but two Wings, as Flyes, Gnats, Butter-flyes. - 2 Such as have four Wings, as Bees Wasps, Grashoppers, Beetles, Cantharides. 5 Such as have no Wings are such as go upon the ground, as Emmets, Spiders, Palmer Worms, Woodlice, Locusts, Moths, Fleas. Of these some walk, some creep, some leap. 6 Such as are whol, are such as either live in one place or in divers. 7 Such as live in divers places, are such as live both on the Land, and in the Water. 8 Such are Otters, Water Rats, Sea Horses, Crocodiles, Crabs, Frogs. 9 Such as live only in one place; are - 1 Such as fly, as Birds. - 2 Such as live upon the Earth, as four footed Beasts. [Page 165](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/185:9?vid=115407)3 Such as live in the Water, as Fishes. Of Flying Creatures. 1 These that fly in the Air are called Birds. 2 Besides those parts which they have common with other living Creatures, they have some peculiar to themselves: as - 1 Instead of a Mouth, some have a crooked Beak, as Kites, Hawks, Eagles, Parrots. - 2 Some have a straight Bil, as Crows, Ravens, Mag-pies, Storks. - 3 Some have a broad Bill, as Ducks and Geese. - 4 Some have a sharp Bill, as Wood-pickers, Thrushes and Finches. - 5 Some have short Necks, as Crows &c. - 6 Some have long Necks, as Storks Cranes, Swans, &c. - 7 Some their Tails stick out right, as Hawks, Black-birds, Mag pies, &c. - 8 Some their Tails are crooked, as Cocks. - 9 Some their Tails stick upright, as Ostridges - 10 Some walk, and some hop. - 11 Some seldom fly at all, as Peacocks, Hens, &c. Of four footed Beasts that go upon the Earth. 1 They are either with Horns, or without Horns. [Page 166](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/186:9?vid=115407)Such as have Horns, are either greater or lesser. 2 The greater are either Domestical, as Bulls and Cows: or Savage, as Stags, Unicorns, Rhinocerots Wild Asses. 3 Of Beasts without Horns, some are Domestical, and others Savage. Domestical are either greater, as a Horse, an Ass, a Mule: or lesser, as a Sheep, a Hog, a Cat, a Dog. 4 Savage Beasts are greater or lesser. The greater are, a Lyon, an Elephant, a Dromedary, a Leopard, a Wolf, a Cammel, a Pardel, a Bear, a Tiger, &c. The lesser are, a Fox, an Ape a Dormouse, a Hedg-hog, a Mouse, a Coney, &c. Of Creatures living in the Water. 1 A Fish is a Creature of a cold and moist substance, long Body and lives only in the Water. 2 They have no Necks, but their Heads are joyned to their Breasts: Their Liver is usually divided into two parts. But whereas my Author saith, they have no Lungs, he is mightily besides the Cushion; for many River Fish have Lungs; neither can they live with out breathing, as Carps, Pikes. &c. He was mistaken before in saying Bees have but four Wings, or else I am mistaken in thinking they have six. 3 Of Fishes, some live in the Sea, Some in the Rivers; some have scales, some have none. [Page 167](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/187:9?vid=115407)4 Thus much of Zoography: In which my Author hath taken much pains to little purpose. Tome I. Part III. Of special Physiologie: Or, the Subject and Object of the Physitian. 1 SPecial Physiologie is the Theorical part of Medicine, and treats of things according to Nature. 2 The things which constitute our Nature are, Elements Temperaments, Humors, Spirits, Faculties, and Parts. 3 The common Affections of Man are to be considered as Elements and Temperaments, of which before. Or else the special. 4 Special parts of Man are, Soul and Body. The knowledg concerning the Soul is called Psychologia: The knowledg concerning the Body is called Anatomy. [Page 168](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/188:9?vid=115407) LIB. I. Of the Faculties and Functions of the Soul both General and Special. 1. PSychologie is the knowledg of the Soul. 2 The Soul is Proper or Common. 3 Common, is either more or less Common: More Common is that which we cal Vegetable, and is in al living Bodies. Less Common is that which we call Sensible, and is only in Men and Beasts, and not in Plants. But by my Authors leave, Why not in Plants? I think Aristotle hath led al the World into Errors. If it were my present scope, I could prove both by Scripture and Reason, that Man consists of three parts, Spirit, Soul, and Body: But to let this pass, Our London Gentlemen that Nurse Curiosities in their Gardens, know wel enough, that divers Plants are sensible, and few that have written Herbals, but have written of them. Besides, 'tis apparant, That vulgar Herbs which we tread upon when we walk the Fields are not only sensible of what is present, but also have a fore-knowledg of a thing before it comes; else what's the reason the Leavs both of Cynkfoyl and Trefoyl usually appear not only disordered, but also discolored twenty four [Page 169](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/189:9?vid=115407) hours before a storm comes. It were a good thing if men would first learn to know themselves, they might know the better what's in Herbs afterwards. But to return. 4 The Soul of Man consists in Faculties and Functions. 5 Of these Faculties, some are incited in Man, others Influential. 6 The Influential parts are three, Animal, Vital, Natural. 7 The Animal is double, Sensitive and Intellective. 8 The Sensitive is either Apprehensive or Motive. The Sensitive is called Sense. 9 The Senses are Internal or External. 10 The External are five, Seeing, Hearing, Tasting, Smelling, and Feeling, 11 The Internal Senses are, Common sense, Fancy, and Memory. 12 Motive senses are two-fold, Appetite, and Motive according to place. 13 Appetite is three-fold. - 1 Natural, as the desire of Meat and Drink. - 2 Affectional, as the Motion of the Will. - 3 The desire of Pleasure. 14 The Intellective Animal Vertue is called Understanding, and consists either in doing or suffering. 15 Of the Vital Faculty are three differences. - 1 The Vital Spirit. - 2 The Pulsifying Spirit. - 3 The Faculty causing Anger. [Page 170](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/190:9?vid=115407) 16 Of the Natural Faculties, some are more, some less Principal, or administring. 17 The more Principal are three. - 1 Nourishing, which preserves the Body. - 2 Increasing, which brings it to its just bigness. - 3 Generative, which begets its like, thereby preserving the Species. 18 Less Principal or Administring, are subservient, some of them to Nourishment, others to Increase, and a third sort to Generation. 19 To Nourishment and Increase are four subservient. - 1 Digestion. - 2 Attraction. - 3 Retention. - 4 Expulsion. 20 That which peculiarly administers to Generation, is the seed. 21 You have the Faculties. The Functions follow, which are but the Eeffects of the Faculties. 22 The Functions are either Ingrafted or Influential. 23 The Influential are three, Animal, Vital, Natural. [Page 171](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/191:9?vid=115407)24 The Animal Function is called Knowledg, and is three-fold, Understanding, Sensation, Motion. 25 Understanding, is the Apprehension, Composition, and Division of a thing; as also Discourse, which is a Reasoning or Ordination. 26 Sensation is either Internal or External. 27 The Internal Species of it are, Judging, Composition and Conservation of a thing: The External are, Dividing, or Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting, or Feeling of it. 28 Motion is double, Appetite, and change of Place. 29 Appetite, because it is a Motion of the Mind, is not properly called a Motion of the Body, but rather of the Will, and ought to be directed by Reason; of which before. 30 Mutation of place, is either Total, or Partial. 31 Total, is Going, Flying, Swimming, Creeping. 32 Partial, is Breathing, and Pulse, of which latter we shal speak in its proper place. 33 Breathing is a mixt Action, partly Animal, partly Natural. Its parts are, Inspiration, and Expiration: One of which is Free, the other Coactive. 34 The Function of the Vital Faculty is called Life. [Page 172](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/192:9?vid=115407)25 Life is distinguished into three Ages, Incr\u00e9asing, standing at a stay, and Decreasing. 26 Increasing Age contains, Infancy, Childhood, and Youth; standing at a stay is called Man-hood. 37 Decreasing is called Old Age, and is divided into Gravity and Decrippedness, or Doting. 38 The Functions of the Vital Spirit according to Galen are three. - 1 The Generation of Vital Spirit. - 2 The stirring up of the Pulses. - 3 The stirring up of the Affections. Of the two first of which we shal speak in their proper places. 39 The Affections are either Simple or Mixed. 40 The Simple are, the Object of Good or Evil; and of both of them, either present or to come: The Object of Good stirs up the Will. 41 This happens when things fal prosperously either with our selves or others: If the business fal wel with our selves, it moves Joy, Gladness, Vaporing, which should do so when it fals wel with others, but it usually produceth Envy. 42 The Object of present Evil is grief of mind; the species or differences of which are, Affliction, Sadness, Grief, Desperation, Pain, Envy, Lamentation, Mourning, Care. 43 The Object of Good to come, is Hope; the Companions of which are, Ambition, Covetousness, [Page 173](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/193:9?vid=115407) Desire, Anger, Lust: The Concomitants of anger in this Nature are, Bitterness, Cruelty, Wrath, Hatred. 44 The Objects of Evil to come are, Fear, Astonishment, Dread, Slothfulness, Quivering, Horror, Terror. 45 Mixt Affections are, Anger as it is joyned with Sadness, Hatred, Shamefac'dness, or Zeal. 46 The Natural Function is commonly called Vegetative; and it is more Principal or less Principal. 47 More Principal is Nourishment, Increasing, or Generation. 48 The Parts of Generation are either Common or Proper. Common are, Copulation, Conception, Perfection of the Child, and bringing of it forth into the World. 49 The Proper parts of Generation are, - 1 Uniting of the Seed. - 2 A Delineation of the Parts. - 3 A filling of the Parts with Flesh. - 4 An absolute forming of the Child. 50 Natural Functions less Principal are, Attraction, Retention, Digestion, Expulsion. 51 Appetite, is either of Nourishment, or, of Copulation. Appetite of Nourishment, is either of Meat, or of Drink: Of Meat, is called Hunger; of Drink, Thirst. 52 Digestion is either Natural or Artificial: [Page 174](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/194:9?vid=115407) Natural is either Publick or Private. And thus much of Psychologie. LIB II. Of the Anatomy of the Body. 1 ANatomy teacheth the Dissection of the Body of Man. 2 The Body of Man is a Mass made of Earth, and other Elements which we see and feel, and is not much unlike to the Body of Beasts. 3 The Parts thereof are two, Containing, and Contained. 4 The Containing are such as have Form and solid Substance, and consist of themselves without the help of any other parts. 5 To find out the parts Contained, is required Knowledg and Dissection. The Difference of the Parts is the Object of Knowledg. 6 Of the Parts, some are Similar and Simple, others Dissimilar and Compound. Similar Parts. 1 Similar Parts are Ten. - 1 The Skin. - 2 Membrana. - 3 Fibrae, or strings. - 4 Bones. [Page 175](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/195:9?vid=115407)5 Cartilages. - 6 Nerves. - 7 Arteries. - 8 Veins. - 9 Ligaments. - 10 Muscles. To these you may ad (if you please) Fat, Marrow Hair, Nails, &c. 2 Of these, some are Properly so called, others Improperly. 3 Properly so called, are such as are Spermatical, or Fleshy. 4 Spermatical are either simply such, or Secundum quid. 5 Simply such, are either softer or harder. 6 Softer are the Skin, Membranae & Fibrae. 7 The Skin is either the outward or Scarf-skin; or inward, and true Skin. 8 The Membranae are either with Names, or without Names. 9 With Names, are such as are Common, or Proper to certain parts. 10 Common are such as compass the Flesh, the Muscles, and the Bones. 11 Proper to certain parts or particular, are such as are subserviant to the three Ventricles, viz. The Highest, Lowermost, or Middlemost: Or if I would speak a little plainer than my Author doth, I would say, the Brain, Liver, and Heart. [Page 176](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/196:9?vid=115407)12 Those of the uper Vehtricle are some within the Skul, some without, and some, belonging to the Face. Without the Skul is the Pericraneum. Within the Skul the Pia and Dura Mater. 13 The Membranae of the Face, are either of the Eyes, or of the Ears. Of the Eyes there are seven, and they are called by these Names, - 1 Adnata. - 2 Cornea. - 3 Aranea. - 4 Innominata. - 5 Retina. - 6 Vitria. - 7 Uvia. As for the Ears, they have but one only Membrana, and that is called Timpana. Anglice, A Drum. And now give me leave to leave my Author a little, and tel my Country men what use this same Membrana is of: I would fain make them wise; if I could but do so, I should think I had lived long enough. The Membrana (which is but a kind of skin) reflects the outward sound to the Internal Sences. When a Man speaks, the voyce comes from him, But how come you to hear it? Thus: As a House casts an Eccho to a Voyce; so this skin casts the Eccho of all Voyces to the Sences: And that which causeth Deafness, is an impediment lying [Page 177](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/197:9?vid=115407) either within or without this Skin. 14 The Membranae of the middle Ventricle are six. - 1 Diaphragma. - 2 Mdiastinum. - 3 Pleura. - 4 Pericardium. - 5 Sygmoides. - 6 Trisulsae. 15 Those of the lower Ventricle are nine, and called by these nine names, - 1 Allantoides. - 2 Amnios. - 3 Chorion. - 4 Darton. - 5 Erythroides. - 6 Mesenterium. - 7 Omentum. - 8 Peritoneum. - 9 Scrotum. 16 The Tunicle of the Arteries is either superior, or inferior. 17 The Fibrae are either constituting or subservient. 18 Constituting are those which make up the substance of the Muscles, and they take their Original, partly from the Nerves, partly from the Ligaments. 19 Such as are subservient are, Direct, Oblick, and Transverse. [Page 178](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/198:9?vid=115407)20 The harder spermatical Parts, are Bones and Cartilages. The Bones. 1 The Bones of the Body of Man, take them Universally are 318. Of which, some are of the Ventricles, others of the Limbs. The Ventricles have gotten one hnndred and forty: Of which, the uper Ventricle hath some the middle others, and the lower Ventricle the remainder. 2 The uper Ventricle hath seventy and seven: of which, the Head hath got some, and the Neck the rest. The Head hath fifty nine; of which, the Skul hath some, and the Cheek other some. 3 The Skul hath fourteen, to wit, Each Ear three, called by name, Inchus, Malleus, and Stapes. The Forehead: 1 The hinder part of the Head: 1 The Temples, 2 The Crown of the Head. 2 And those two which are called Sphoenoides and Ehmoides. 4 The Cheeks have got forty five; whereof some are superior, some inferior, and some common. The superior are twelve: the inferior only one (but that's a good big one.) Those which are common to both are the Teeth, which are, or should be in Number thirty two. 5 The Bones of the Neck are eighteen; of which, eleven belong to the Os Hyois; the word [Page 179](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/199:9?vid=115407) is derived from to gape. (Take notice of the Ignorance of our Chyrurgions: Ask them what Hyois is, they can shew it you, but cannot tell what it is.) The rest are the Vertebrae, or joynts of the Neck and are in Numbea seven; of which, some have Names, and the rest have none. Those which have Names are called, Atlas, Epitropheus, and Axis. 6 The Bones of the middle Ventricle or Breast are forty three in Number, and thus distinguished: 1 Clavicula on each side: 1 Scapula on each side. The Sternum, or Bone before the Breast, which is three fold. The Vertebrae, or Joynts are twelve. The Ribs are a Dozen; of which, the seven upermost are called true; the other five, Bastard Ribs. 7 The lower Ventricle hath twenty Bones. Os Coccix, three fold: Os Coxendix two: Illium two. The Vertebrae, or Joynes of the Loyns are five; of which, two of them were Christned, namely the first, which is called Nephrites; and the last, which is called Asphalites. All the rest have no Names. 8 You have the bones of the Ventricle: The Bones of the Limbs follow which are in number one hundred, seventy, and eight. Of these, the Hands have gotten some, and the Feet the rest. 9 The Bones of the Hands are eighty six which the right Hand and the left, have equally shared [Page 180](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/200:9?vid=115407) between them; namely, forty three apiece: viz. Between the Shoulder and the Elbow, one: Carpus, or the Wrest eight: Cubitus, or the Bone between the Elbow and the Wrest, two; the greater of which is called Vlna the lesser, Radius. The Fingers fifteen: The Metacarpus, or distance between the Wrest and the Fingers, hath four: The Bones called Sesamina are twelve; and one between the bone of the Wrest, and Metacarpus. We wil confess Dr. Reade saith there is but sixty: but we wil leave the matter to be judged by Dr. Experience. 10 The Bones of the Feet are ninety two according to my Author (but according to Alexander Reade but sixty four) I shal follow my Author now, and leave Dr. Reade for the present. Of the Bones of the Feet, the right side hath gotten one half, and left the other for the Left. The right side hath one Bone in the Thigh: 1 Patella: 2 In the Knee. Two in the Leg: of which, one is called Phibula, and the other Tibia. In the Instep seven, called by these Names. 1 Astragatus: 2 Calx: 3 Naviculare: 4 Cubiformae: 5 Cuneiformae, the lesser greater, and middle. The Metatarsus (or distance between the Instep and the Toes) hath five. The Toes fourteen; of which, the great Toe hath two, and the other three apice. Sesamina twelve. In Ancient people there is a bony substance opposed to [Page 181](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/201:9?vid=115407) the Cubiformae. Also there is a little Bone in the Articulation of the little toe. These if you reckon the left foot to have no fewer than the right, wil amount just to the number of ninety two. 11 The connexion or joyning together of the Bones is also to be considered; which are general or particular. 12 General is the joynting of al the bones. 13 Particular is the connexing of som particular Bones. 14 And that is divided into Arthrosis and Symphysis. 15 Arthrosis is divided into these Species, - 1 Diarthrosis. - 2 Arthrodia. - 3 Gynglimos. - 4 Synarthrosis. - 5 Sutura. - 6 Harmonia. - 7 Gomphosis. 16 Symphysis, is a connexion of bones by Continuity, by means either of Cartilage, Nerve, Ligament, Flesh, or Muscles. Cartilages. 1 The Cartilages in the body of Man are held to be seven. And though my Author name but so many; yet some whose Eyes are in their Heads have found out very many more. It may be my [Page 182](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/202:9?vid=115407) Author saw none but old men dissected; for those parts which are Cartilages in Children, turn to be Bones in Ancient people. 2 Thus much for Spermatical parts which are simply so. Those which are Spermatical Secundum quid, are either more principal or less principal. 3 More Principal are Nerves, Arteries, Veins. Nerves. 1 Nerves take their Original from the Brain, and are either softer or harder. 2 The softer are either Principal, or arising from the Principal. 3 The Principal are seven Pairs: Bauhinus saith eight. - 1 The first of these are the Optick Nerves, - 2 The second is Parmotoreum. - 3 The third goes to the Muscles of the Face. - 4 The fourth to the Tongue and the Pallat. - The fifth to the Ears, and the are Instruments of Hearing. - 6 Par vagum, or the wandring pair. - 7 The seventh pair comes to the Tongue, and are the Instruments of Speaking. - 8 The eight pair is distributed to some of the Muscles of the Eye. 4 Arising from the Principal of the Softer are, such as arise from the third, fourth and sixt pairs: [Page 183](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/203:9?vid=115407) From the third arise four Branches; from the fourth, three; from the sixt a rise some that are scattered both to the middle and inferior Ventricle. 5 The harder Nerves are either Principal, or arising from the Principal. 6 The Principal are thirty Pair: Seven of the Neck; twelve of the joynts of the Breast; five of the Loyns; six of the Os Sacrum. 7 Such as arise from these, are those that are branched from them to the Hands and Feet. Arteries. 1 Arteries proceed from the Heart, and are either Principal, or arising from the Principal. 2 Principal, are either such as proceed from the Heart, as the great Artery called Aorta; or the Vessels of the Lungs, which are, - 1 Aspera Arteria, or the Wind-pipe. - 2 Venosa Arteria. 3 Those which arise from the great Artery are two. - 1 The lesser Trunk ascending. - 2 The greater Trunk descending. All the rest of the Arteries which are innumerable are branched from these two. [Page 184](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/204:9?vid=115407) Veins. 1 Veins are either Principal, or arising from the Principal. The Principal are, - 1 Vena Porta, which is distributed in the inferior ventricle. - 2 Vena Cava by the branches of which all the Body is nourished. Between the Branches of which, and the Branches of the Vena Porta is no intermixture. - 3 The Arterial vein, which is distributed only to the Lungs. 2 Arising from the Principal are either from the Vena Cava, or from the Vena Porta; of which some are Christned, some are not; I would have said, some have Names, and some have none. 3 The Branches of the Vena Porta that have Names are, - 1 Coronaria, if my Author be not mistaken; for I have a shrewd suspition Coronaria is a Branch of the Vena Cava. It is that which nourisheth the Heart, and is in form of a Crown, from whence it takes its name. It is a smal Branch which the Vena Cava sends to the Heart to nourish it, after it hath passed the Pericardium. The Vena Cava carrying Natural Blood to the Heart to be converted into vital Blood; first nourishes the Heart, that so it [Page 185](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/205:9?vid=115407)may be able to perform its Office; Nature being none of Pharaohs Task-Masters; that will not set the Heart to make Bricks, but it will give it straw to burn them with. - 2 Cystica; and if I be not mistaken, this the vein that carries the Choller to the Gall. - 3 Gastriea, signifies the Belly. - 4 Epiplois. - 5 Gastroepiplois. - 6 Hemorrhoidalis. - 7 Meseraicks. - 8 The Sweetbread, which it seems my Author takes for a vein: Neither can our Chyrurgions at present living, tell what the true use of it is. Their general consent is, That it keeps the vessels from being hurt by the Backbone. Give me leave to shoot my bolt a little, (and you know a Fools bolt is soon shot) All late Anatomists hold. - First. That the Original of the Meseraick (or if you please) the Lacteal veins, is the Sweetbread. - Secondly, All hold (nemine contradicente) that the Liver delights in sweet things. - Thirdly, General consent of Physitians also agrees, That the Meseraick veins carry the Chyle from the Bowels to the Liver. These being taken pro confesso, my own Opinion is, That the Office of the Sweetbread is to give the Chyle a sweet tast that so the work [Page 186](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/206:9?vid=115407) of the Liver may be pleasant to it, and not distastful. 4 The Trunk of the Vena Cava, is either Superior, or Inferior. - 1 From the Superior arise many veins of note, - 1 Cephalica. - 2 Basilica. - 3 Mediana, or the middle vein. - 4 Salvatella. - 5 Cornalis: and there my Author hit the Nail on the head. - 6 Solitaria. - 2 From the Inferior, the chief veins are, - 1 The Emulgent Veins. - 2 The Seminal Veins. - 3 Saphaena. - 4 Hip Veins. 5 You have the Principal parts Secundum quid. Less Principal are Ligaments and Muscles. Ligaments. 1 Very few Ligaments have proper names. 2 Some belong to the Head of Man; others to the Trunk, and others to the Limbs. 3 The Ligaments of the Head are such as either, - 1 Knit the Head with the Back-bone. - 2 Knit the Tongue to the Jaws; and Oh [Page 187](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/207:9?vid=115407)what pity is it they did not knit it closer; what a deal of mischief might then have been saved! - 3 Such as knit the uper Jaw to the lower. 4 The Ligaments of the Trunk are such as knit the Members either internally, or externally. 5 The Ligaments of the Joynts are two-fold, - 1 Some knit the Bones together. - 2 Others imbrace the Tendons like a Ring. 6 A Tendon is no hing else but the extremity of a Muscle, by which it moves the Joynts. Muscles. 1 The Muscles in all the Body are in Number 395. according to my Author: of which he saith, some belong to the ventricles, and others to the Limbs: But according to Dr. Read, they are but 270. Popular Applause sounds out the praise of Dr. Read in Muscles. My Authors Works are sufficient to speak for him: The Use which I shal make of it, is only for Information, to shew what an uncertain Master They say so, is. 2 The Ventricles have 181. Of which, some are Superior, others Inferior, and a third sort Mean between them both. 3 Superior are 95. Of which, some belong to the Head in general: others to certain parts. [Page 188](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/208:9?vid=115407)4 Those which belong to the Head in general are nine pair: of which, seven extend the Head, and compass it about, the other two bow it. 5 The Muscles of the other parts are 86. wherof, - 1 The Ear hath ten, saith my Anthor: and Dr. Read is just of the same Judgment: of which saith he, there is four pair on the outside, and two on the inside. The truth is I could never see any at all; perhaps the Reason is, because I never wore Spectacles. 'Tis probable there may be two Muscles on the inside of the Ear; but those eight on the outside the Ear, came newly from Utopia, in the good Ship called the Ignorance. That Beasts move their Ears by a proper or voluntary motion is certain; but that Men do, unless they move Head and al I never yet saw, and as little beleeve. What an abominable Master is Tradition? Who would have thought my Author Partlicius, and old Alexander Reade, should have been led by the Nose by him? Because Asses move their Ears, must al Men be Asses? And now I have left my Author a little, I care not if I leave him a little longer, and shew you whence this Error sprung; as also what it is. - First, They say, The external Muscles of the Ear are four pair. - 1 They coyn one pair, and cal them Par Attollens; and these they say lift-the Ears up; [Page 189](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/209:9?vid=115407)but whether I know not, unless it be upon the Pillory. - 2 Par deprimens, and they pull them down; but mine stick up stil, and so do every honest mans. - 3 Par adducens, and they move them forward. - 4 Par abducens, and they pul them backward. 'Tis wel Democritus is dead, or else he would have burst his heart with laughing at this and died no other death. - 1 They coyn one pair, and cal them Par Attollens; and these they say lift-the Ears up; - Secondly, The internal Muscles of the Ear (they say) are two; One inward, and the other ontward: And if there be any Muscles at al about the Ears, these are probably like to be they. We wil now shew you, what may probably be the Cause of these Errors. They thought Galen was a famous man (and so he was) and rather than they would make a famous man infamous, they would be infamous themselves. Reade confesseth the motion of the Ears is obscure; and so indeed it is, being clouded with a Mist of Ignorance. - 1 The first pair is called Attollens, or lifting up, which is nothing else but a part of the Frontal Muscle fixed neer the Ear, which when you lift yp your Forehead, lifts up a part of the Ear too, though not by a proper motion of the Ear. - 2 The second is Par deprimens, or pulling down, which is nothing but one part of the Muscles [Page 190](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/210:9?vid=115407)of the Cheeks, the Tendon of which being fastned to the Ear, and by pulling down the Cheeks, pulls down the Ear also. - 3 The third is Par adducens which is nothing else but a part of the Musculus cutaneus. - 4 The fourth pair is only the transverse Muscles of the Head. Substract me but these Muscles cleverly, and shew me any other Muscles of the Ears of Man, with the help of a Perfpective Glass (if you can.) But then they run to the old Argument, Galen said there was such: and I'le warrant you our Authors are as confident of it, as the Pigmies were of their killing Hercules. But to return to my Author. - 2 The Buccae four. - 3 The Jaws four. - 4 The Forehead two. - 5 The Bones of the Hyois four. - 6 Of the Lips five. - 7 The Larynx nine (Reade saith ten.) - 8 The Tongue five (Reade saith eight.) - 9 The Cheeks ten. - 10 The Nostrils eight (Reade saith sixt.) - 11 The hinder part of the Head two. - 12 The Eyes twelve. - 13 The Eye-lids four. What do you think the Mind of God is, by this difference of Authors? Surely (Courteous Readers) to make you studious Occulatus unus testis is worth ten Ear-witnesses, and you wil find it so in the winding up: But it is denied the Planets to have Latitude without the Zodiack and therefore I return. 6 The Muscles of the middle Ventricle are 65. I shal now let Dr. Reade alone, for I cannot walk very fast with two Clogs upon my Feet. - 1 The Diaphragma. - 2 Mhe Muscles of the Back are eight. - 3 The Intercostals are forty four. - 4 The Breast twelve. 7 The Inferior Ventricle hath 21. whereof, - 1 The Abdomen hath ten. - 2 The Fundament three. - 3 The Yard four. - 4 The Stones two. - 5 The Bladder two. (Dr. Reade had seen the second, had he not been pur-blind.) 8 The Joynts have 214. Of which, some belong to the Hands, others to the Feet. 9 To the Hands belong 104. according to my Author; 53. according to Reade: I must follow my Author because of translating. Of these, some belong to the Right Hand, some to the Left. Those belonging to the Right Hand are 52. to wit, - 1 The Fingers thirteen. [Page 392](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/212:9?vid=115407)2 Between the Shoulder and the Elbow, eleven. - 3 Between the Elbow and the Wrest, eight. - 4 The Wrest and parts adjacent, ten. - 5 The Metacarpus, ten. The Left Hand hath just so many as the Right. 10 The Feet have 104 Of which, some belong to the Right side, others to the Left. The Right side hath 52. viz. - 1 The Toes, twenty nine. - 2 The Thigh, four. - 3 The Instep, four. - 4 The Metatarsus, four. - 5 The Hip-bone, seven. - 6 The Share-bone, four. If a man is minded to be wise, his readiest way is, Not to pin his Faith upon the sleeve of Authors; for let an Author be never so excellent, his Works may be abused by a Printer. And of all the Authors which ever I translated, I never read one more vilely printed than this is. I confess I have corrected the Printer in many places where he most notoriously failed; but in this I cannot, as you shal easily find if you observe the disagreeing of his Numbers. Very unwilling was I to do the good soul any wrong, because he was ingenious: But finding an inability in my self, I called help of others that were but they were gotten so deeply together by the Ears one with another, that they could afford me no satisfaction: Wherfore I desire the Reader, - 1 Not to impute the failings to my Author, but to the Printer, whose I am confident they were. 2 To take Counsel of my Brother, the Son of my Mother, Doctor Experience. You have the Spermatical Parts: the Fleshy Parts remain. Flesh. 1 Flesh is commonly accounted to be of three sorts; to wit, Musculous, Glandulous, and Common Flesh. 2 You have such as are properly called Similary Parts. Those which are improperly called so follow: Of which, some are solid others fluid: Such as are fluid belong to the Parts contained; such as are solid are, Hair, Fat, &c. But why my Author reckons Fat among the solid Parts, I know not. nor I think himself neither. Dissimilar Parts. 1 Are two-fold, Superior and Inferior. Superior is called the Head, or Animal Ventricle: Its parts are the Head and Neck. 2 The Parts of the Head are, the Skul, and the [Page 394](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/214:9?vid=115407) parts within it, and without it. The Parts without the Skul, are either the Face it self, or other parts. 3 The Parts of the Skul are Bones, Pericranium, Dura Mater. The Bones are 59. The sutures of the Skul are three, Coronalis, Sagitalis, and Lamdoides: to which you may ad those of the Temples called Mendosae. 4 The Parts without the Face, are either Lateral, and on the sides as the foremost, and hinder part of the Head: or else the top, as the Crown. 5 The parts of the Face are, - 1 The Forehead. - 2 The Temples. - 3 The Eyes. - 4 The Ears. - 5 The Nose. - 6 The Cheeks. - 7 The Mouth. - 8 The Hollowness. - 9 The Chin. The Eyes. 1 The Parts of the Eyes are, - 1 Such as compass them about - 2 Such as give them their Form. - 3 Such as move them. 2 Such as compass them about are, - 1 The Eye-lids. - 2 The Eye-brows. - 3 The Glandulae, or Kernels. [Page 395](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/215:9?vid=115407) 3 The Eye-lids are either Superior of Inferior 4 The Parts which form the Eye, are either Interior or Exterior. 5 The Exterior are, - 1 The white of the Eye. - 2 The Iris. - 3 The Apple of the Eye. 6 The Humors are three. - 1 Aqueal. - 2 Christalline, and - 3 Vitrial. 7 The Tunicles are seven: - 1 Cornea. - 2 Uvea. - 3 Arnea. - 4 Retina. - 5 Conjunctiva. - 6 Opacia. - 7 Secundina. 8 The parts which cause Motion are, the Muscles and Optick Nerve. The Ears. 1 The parts of the Ears are either External or Internal. The External are holes by which the sound passeth, and are in number five; three [Page 396](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/216:9?vid=115407) without the Skul, and two within. 2 The Internal parts of the Eir are, - 1 The Nerve, which brings the Sence of Hearing. - 2 The Timpanum. - 3 Two Bony substances of each side. - 4 Three smal Bones knit together by a Skin, or Membrana; whereof the first is called Malleus, the second Incus, the third Stapes. The Nose, Cheeks, and Mouth. 1 The Parts of the Nose are Internal or External. 2 The External are the Nostrils, the sides, and the Bridg in the Middle. 3 The Internal are, the Cribrum, and Caruncula. 4 The Parts of the Cheeks are two. The Superior which is called Mala: And The Inferior which is called Buccae. 5 The parts of the Mouth, are either Fleshy or Bony. 6 The Fleshy parts are, the Lips, Tongue, and Pallat the Gums, Jaws, Gurgulio, Larynx, and Tonsillae. 7 parts are 32. Teeth; of which, the uper Jaw hath one half, and the lower Jaw the other. [Page 397](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/217:9?vid=115407)8 The Cavities are three, Conchola, Labirinthus and Coclea. 9 The Chin is that part where the Beard grows. 10 Thus much for the parts without the Skul: the parts within the Skul follow, which are called Brain. 11 Parts of the Brain are two, Cerebrum, and Cerebellum, from both which arise the Marrow of the Back; as also all the Nerves. 12 The Parts of the Brain are. - 1 The Glandula Pituitaria. - 2 Fornix. - 3 Infundibulum - 4 Nates, and Testes. - 5 Pelvis - 6 Penis. - 7 Plexus - 8 vermi formis. - 9 Rete Mirabile. - 10 Sella. - 11 Pia Mater. 13 Thus much of the Head: Now follows The Neck. 1 The Parts of the Neck are Internal or External. External are either before, as the Throat; or behind, as the Neck. |The internal are,||The Wind-pipe, and||The Passage of Food.| 2 You have the Animal Ventricle, or Superior part: Inferior The or Vital Ventricle. Parts of the middle Ventricle are are either,||Before, as the Breast; or||Behind, as the Back.| 3 The parts of the Breast are either Fleshy, as the Muscles, the Breast and the Nepples: or Bony, as the Sternum and the Ribs: or Skinny, as the Pleura. 4 The parts of the Back are, the Shoulders, the scapula, the Back-bone, the Vertebrae, and the Marrow. 5 The Interior parts of the middle Ventricle are, the Involucra, the Bowels, and the Channels. 6 The Involucra are, the Pleura, Mediastinum, Diaphragma, and Pericardium. 7 The Bowels are two, - 1 Vital, as the Heart. - 2 Spiritual, as the Lungs. [Page 399](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/219:9?vid=115407)8 In the Heart are considerable, - 1 Two Ventricles; the Right, and the Left. - 2 Its Motion, or Pulse. - 3 Two deaf Ears. - 4 Eleven Valvulae. - 5 The Coronal Vein. 9 Parts of the Lungs are, - 1 The Lobi, which are divided, - 1 Into Right and Left. - 2 Into Superior and Inferior. - 2 The Vessels which enter the Lungs, and they are three: - 1 The Wind-pipe. - 2 The Venal Artery. - 3 The Arterial Vein. 10 You have the middle Ventricle: the lowermost yet remains. The Lowermost, or Natural Ventricle. 1 The parts of the Lower Ventricle are either External or Internal. 2 The External are, - 1 Behind, as the Loyns and Hips. - 2 Before, as the Belly. - 3 On the sides, as the Hypochondria. 3 The Loyns consist of five Bones, under which the Kidneys are placed. 4 The parts of the Hips are either Bony, as the Hip bones, Os Sacrum, and Coccix: or Fleshy, as the Buttocks. [Page 400](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/220:9?vid=115407)5 The parts of the Belly, are either Similar, or Dissimilar. - 1 Similar, as the Paeritoneum, Omentum, and Mesenterium. - 2 Dissimilar, as Stomachalis, the Navel, and Abdomen. 6 The Hypochondria are two; the Right, and the Left. 7 You have the Exterior Part: the Interior are the Bowels. The Bowels serve either for Nourishment, or Generation. 8 Such as serve for Nourishment, are either for Digestion, or Evacuation. For Digestion are, - 1 Such as belong to the first Concoction, as the Tunicle of the Stomach: Or - 2 Such as belong to the second Concoction, as the Liver. 9 The Parts of the Ventricle are two: the Tunicles, and the Mouths. 10 The Tunicles are in number three; and the Mouths two. 11 The Liver is placed in the Right Hypochondria, under the Diaphragma. Its parts are two: - 1 The Uper, from whence ariseth the Vena Cava, which carries the Blood to the Heart. [Page 401](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/221:9?vid=115407)2 The Inferior, from whence ariseth the Vena Porta which carries the Chyle from the Bowels to the Liver. Both these consist of red Flesh, called Parenchyma; throughout which, the veins of the Liver are disseminated. 12 You have the Digestive Bowels: the Bowels dedicated to Evacuation follow, which are, the Gall, Spleen, Reins Bladder, and Guts. 13 The Channels of the Bladder are two: the one of which is turned upwards, the other downwards. 14 The Reins or Kidneys are two, placed under the Liver and Spleen, and receive the watery Humor from the Liver by the Emulgent veins and having clarified it, send it to the Bladder by the Ureters. 15 In the Bladder consider, - 1 Its two Tunicles. - 2 Its Neck. - 3 Its Bottom. - 4 The Hairs which draw and retein the Urine. 16. The Guts are either the uppermost, and smal ones: as the Duodenum, Jejunium, and Illium: or else the lowermost, and thick ones, whose names are Caecum, Colon, and Rectum, or the strait Gut. 17 You have the Bowels dedicated to Nourishment. [Page 402](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/222:9?vid=115407)Those which serve for Generation, are either common to both Sexes, or peculiar to one. 18 Those which are Common both to Man and Woman are the Seminal Vessels, as the Stones, Parastatae, and Pecten. 19 The Testicles or Stones are two: The Parastatae are two Vessels placed at the Mouth of the Pecten. 20 The Peculiar Vessels to each Sex are, In Men, the Yard; in Women, the Womb and Matrix. Of al these, see more in my Directory for Midwives. The Branches, or Limbs. 1 The Limbs are, the Hands and Feet. 2 The Hand is divided into, the Arm, the Cubit, and the Hand it self. 3 The Hand it self consists of many parts, Carpus, Metacarpus, Nodi, Vola, Hypothener, Palma, Pecten, five Fingers called by these Names. - 1 Pollex, the Thumb. - 2 Index the Fore Finger. - 3 Medius, the Middle Finger. - 4 Annularis, the Ring Finger. 5 Auricularis, the Little Finger. The Nails. 4 Parts of the Feet are three, the Thigh, the Leg, and the Foot. [Page 403](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/223:9?vid=115407)5 Parts of the Leg are two, the Calf & the Shin. 6 Parts of the Foot are, Talus, Malleolus, Calx, Planta, Ancle, the Instep, the Heel, the top of the Foot, the Sole of the Foot, the Toes, and the Nails. Another Division of the Parts. 1 Hitherto of the Parts as they are Similar or Dissimilar. We shal now speak a word of them as they are Organical: and so they are either more or less Principal, and formed either of Blood, or of Seed. 2 The perfect Organical parts are two-fold, Principal and Administring. 3 The Administring are three-fold, - 1 Such without which the Action cannot be performed. - 2 Such by which the Action is performed better. - 3 Such by which it is performed safer. 4 The Principal parts of the Body are four, the Brain, Liver, Heart, and Testicles. The Administring are, - 1 The Nerves, which administer to the Brain. - 2 The Arteries which administer to the Heart. - 3 The Veins, which administer to the Liver. [Page 404](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/224:9?vid=115407)4 The Seminal Vessels, which administer to the Stones. 5 Less Principal are two fold, some common to the whol Body; others only to some particular part. 6 Such as are common to the whol Body are, Fat Flesh, Cartilages, Skin, Ligaments, Membranae, Bones. 7 Those which belong to some particular part are, Arteries, Nerves, Marrow of the Back, Veins, Spermatick Vessels. 8 Some parts only are subservient to themselves, and to no other part, as the Gall, Spleen, and Bladder. 9 You have the knowledge and difference of the Parts: the Administration and Dissecting of them remains. Of the Administration, Dissection, Or Anatomy of the Corps. 1 THe Body of Man consists either of Ventricles, which are the Principals; or else of Limbs. 2 The inferior Ventricle is that which is the dwelling place of the Natural Spirits. I. The Anatomy of the inferior Ventricle. All Dissections begin here, because the Excrements [Page 405](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/225:9?vid=115407) contained in the Guts, wil soon putrifie, and to hinder the Dissection of other parts. 2 The inferior Ventricle is all that part of the Body, which compassed round with the Swordlike Cartilage above, with the Os Pubis beneath, and with the Ribs on each side. 3 Its parts are two, Forward and Backward. 4 Forward, the Greeks cal Epigastrium; the Arabians, Mirach: the parts of which are, - 1 The Superior, or Hypochondria. - 2 The Middle, or the Region of the Navel. - 3 The Lower, or Hypogastrium. 5 The hinder part is either Superior, which makes the Loyns; or Inferior, which makes the Hips. 6 It is otherwise divided into two parts; namely The parts containing, and the parts contained. 7 The parts containing, are either Proper or Common; the Common are, Scarf-skin, Skin, Fat, a Panicle. Proper are, Muscles, the Peritoneum. The oblick Muscles are four, two ascending, and two descending. The Muscles called Piramidales are four, wherof two are straight, and the other transverse. 8 The Parts contained, some belong to Man when he is in the Womb, and some when he is out. - 1 Those that belong to man while he is in the Mothers Belly are, the Navel Vessels, and Skins that cover him: which are amply described in my Directory for Midwives. - 2 Those which belong to Man out of the Womb are subservient some to Nourishment, others to Propagation. [Page 406](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/226:9?vid=115407) 9 Those that belong to Nourishment, are either for turning Food into Chyle, or for turning Chyle into Blood. 10 Those which turn Food into Chyle, some make the Chyle, as the Stomach; others are joyned to the Mesenterium. 11 They are, - 1 Such as help towards the Concoction of the Chyle, as the Omentum and Sweetbread. - 2 Some distribute and perfect the Chyle, as the Duodenum, Jejunum, and Illion. - 3 Other take away the Excrements, as the great Guts. 12 Those which conduce to the making of Blood, are, - 1 Some prepare the Blood, as the Meseraick veins. - 2 Some make it into blood, as the Liver. - 3 Some distribute it to the body being made as the Vena Cava, and its branches. [Page 407](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/227:9?vid=115407)4 Some receive the Excrements of Blood, as - First, Choller, the thinnest of which is taken by the Gall: the thickest is carryed to the Right Gut by a Vessel for that purpose. - Secondly, Melancholly, the Receptacle of which is the Spleen, which concocts it, and with the best of it, nourishes it self: other of it, it sends up to the Stomach to provoke appetite: and some it sends down somtimes to the Hemorrhoidal Veins. - Thirdly, The watery blood is carryed to the two Kidneys, who having separated the blood for their own Nourishment, send the Water down to the bladder. 13 The parts which are subservient for propagation, are either belonging to Men or Women. Belonging to Men are, - 1 Such as carry the Matter whereof the Seed is made, and prepare it, as the Vasa Preparantia: or work it together, as the Corpus Varicosum: or give it its Generative power, as the Stones, which are sustained by the Muscles called Cremasters. - 2 Such as carry the Seed from the Stones, being perfected, as the Vasa Deferentia. - 3 Such as receive the Seed and keep it, as the Glandulae Prostatae. - 4 Such as contain an Oyly Substance, to [Page 408](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/228:9?vid=115407)make the Passage slippery. 14 The parts of Generation in Women are, - 1 Such as carry the Matter to be made into Seed, as the Spermatical Vessels. - 2 Such as make it into Seed, as the Corpus Varicosum, and the Testicles. - 3 Such as receive it, as the Womb. 15 The Internal parts of the lower Ventricle are subservient to the other. - 1 Either to Nourishment, as the Vena Porta, and Cava, and their Branches. - 2 To vital Heat, as the Arteries. - 3 To Sence and Motion, as the Nerves and Arteries. You have the Anatomy of the lower ventricle: the Anatomy of the middle ventricle or breast follows. II. The Anatomy of the Middle Ventricle or Breast. 1 The Breast is properly that part which is compassed round with the Ribs, separated from the lower ventricle by the Diaphragma. It is the seat of the vital Spirit: neither is it altogether bony like the Skul, for then it could not move: neither altogether Fleshy like the lower ventricle, for then it could not be sustained: but it is moved by Muscles, and Articulated by bones. [Page 409](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/229:9?vid=115407)2 It is divided into the former part, which is called the Sternon: the hinder part called the Back: and on both sides by the Ribs. 3 The Parts of it are either Containing, or Contained. The Containing are either Common or Proper. Common are the Scaf skin, Skin, Fat, Membranae, and Panicles, 4 The Proper are soft or hard. The soft are either properly so called, or improperly. Properly so called are Muscles, which are either of the Breast, or of the Neck: Of the Breast are such as are either upon the Ribs, or between them, and therfore are called Intercostals. 5 Those upon the Ribs are placed either above, as Pectoralis, major & minor. Those that are placed below are, Cucularis, Rhombdoides, Serratus posticus Splenius, Complexus: These are without. The Triangular Muscle is within. 6 The Intercostal Muscles are eleven External, twelve Internal. The Diaphragma is common to both sides. 7 The Muscles of the Neck, are some in the hinder part of the Neck, as Cucullaris, Levator, , Complexus, the greater and lesser straight Muscles, the uper and lower oblick Muscles, the transverse Muscles, Scalenus, Spinatus. , Choracohyoides, Oesophygies, Longi. 8 The Muscles improperly called soft, are the Bodies of the Breasts, the Pleura, and Mediastinum. 9 The proper parts containing which are hard, are the Bones and Cartilages. The Bones are, - 1 Before, as the Sternum, which consists of three or four Bones, and the two . - 2 On the sides, as the seven true Ribs, and the five Bastard Ribs. - 3 Behind, as the twelve joynts in the Back. 10 Cartilages; some serve for the inarticulation of the Ribs with the Sternon; others the bastard Ribs end in; and the Sword-like Cartilage in the bottom. 11 The parts contained, are Bowels or vessels. Bowels are the Heart and Lungs. 12 The Heart of Man is covered with the Pericardium. The vessels belonging to the Heart are four, - 1 The Vena Cava. - 2 The Arterial Vein. - 3 The Venal Artery. - 4 The great Artery. To these vessels are appointed certain Shutters; two resemble a Miter, and three the Letter S. and [Page 411](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/231:9?vid=115407) are therfore called Sygmoides. The ventricles of the Heart are two, to each of which is adjoyned a deaf Ear. 13 The vessels of the Lungs are, the Windpipe, the Arterial vein, the venal Artery. 14 The vessels contained are veins, nerves, and arteries. 15 The Bones are either the Joynts of the Back, which are twelve; or the Joynts of the Neck which are seven; or the two shoulder bones which are joyned together with Cartilages and Ligaments. 16 You have the middle ventricle: the upper follows. III. The Anatomy of the Higher Ventricle, or Head. 1 The Head is the third ventricle: the Seat of the Animal Spirit, the Principle of Sence and Motion: It is placed in the highest part of the Body, partly for the Eyes sake, that so they may see the further; partly for the Brains sake, the Rational part may not be disturbed by the Irrational. 2 The parts of the Head, are either such as have Hair, or such as have none. Both of them are either Containing, or Contained. The Containing are Proper or Common. [Page 412](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/232:9?vid=115407)Common are the Scarf-skin, the Skin, Fat, and Fleshy Panicle. 3 Proper parts are either internal or external. The External are, the Pericraneum, and the Skul. The Internal are, the Pia and Dura Mater. 4 The Bones of the Skul are fourteen, whereof some are proper to the Skul alone; others common to the uper Cheek, as the Cuneiformi, and Spongeosum. 5 The proper to the Skul are twelve, whereof six make up the Skul. The Fore-head hath one, the fore part of the Head two, the hind part one, the temples two: these are joyned together by either true or counterfet sutures. The true are three, Sagittalis, Coronalis, and Lambdoides. The Counterfet sutures are six. 6 The things contained by the Skull is the Brain. The substance of the brain is either that which is soft, or the Cerebellum, from both which arise the Marrow of the back. The Nerves, some of them arise from within the skul, of which are seven or eight pair; most of which are distributed upon the Head, and Organs of Sences. The rest of the Nerves arise from the Marrow of the back, rather from the brain of the back (if people would but learn to call it by its right name.) They are in number thirty pair, and are distributed amongst the parts below [Page 413](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/233:9?vid=115407) the Head, being all covered with three skins apiece. 7 The vessels are veins and arteries. The veins arise from the Jugulars; two of which are distributed within the skul, and three without. 8 Of the Face, some parts are Containing, others Contained. The Parts Containing are Proper or Common. The Common are scaf-skin, skin, Fat, and Panicle. 9 Proper parts of the Face are Muscles, as two of the Fore-head, two of the Eye-brows, two of each Eye-lid, eight of the Nose, four Muscles of the Ears, six of the Lips, the Bucca two, the inferior Cheek ten. Bones of the Forehead and Eyes six, of the Nose three, of the uper Cheek twelve, of the lower one. Cartilages, of the Nose five, of each Ear one. 10 The parts of the Face contained, are either the seats of the Sences, or else the vessels. 11 The seats of the sences are, - 1 The sight, which is contained in the Eyes. - 2 Smelling, in the Nose. - 3 Hearing in the Ears. - 4 Tasting, in the Mouth. 12 The parts of the tast are two-fold; some compass the Mouth about, some are contained in the Mouth. [Page 414](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/234:9?vid=115407)Those which compass the Mouth about are the Muscles common to the and the Lips, which are two each side; the uper Lip two on each side; the lower Lip one on each side: the lower Cheek five on each side. 13 The parts of the tast contained in the Mouth are, - 1 The Instrument of tast and speech, the tongue, which hath ten Muscles, and the Muscles of the Jaws eight. - 2 The Larynx, whose Cartilages are five, and Muscles sixteen. - 3 The Os Hyois, consisting of five bones, and nine pair of muscles. - 4 The . - 5 The teeth, which in people grown up is usually sixteen in each Jaw; namely, four Cutters, two Dog-teeth, ten Grinders. My Author hath kept a fearful racket about the Tast, and written more than I can beleeve: I have often heard, the teeth were instruments of biting, but never of tasting before. It is in vain to object, That a mans teeth may be set on edg by eating sowr things, Ergo they tast: So wil a Sythe by cutting Crabs (as they know that are accustomed to Mow) Must it therfore be capable of the sence of tasting? 14 You have the Ventricles: the Limbs remain, which are the Hands and Feet. [Page 415](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/235:9?vid=115407) IV The Anatomy of the Hands. 1 The Hand is an Instrument of all Instruments; it is that whereby a Man defends himself, wounds his Enemies, and is very necessary for the learning of al Arts and Sciences. 2 That is called the Hand which reacheth from the Shoulder to the top of the Fingers; and is divided into the Arm, the Cubit, and that which vulgarly is called the Hand. 3 The parts are Containing, or Contained. The Containing are Common and Proper. The Common are, Scaf-skin, Skin, Fat, Membrana, and Fleshy Panicle. Proper, is the Membrana of the Muscles. 4 Parts Contained, are Muscles, Vessels, and Bones. The Muscles are fifty five, if you ad those four of the Shoulder; and they belong either to the Shoulder, or to the Arm, or to the Cubit, or to the Hand. 5 The Muscles of the Arm are seven. - 1 Pectoralis, draws it to. - 2 Dectois, lifts it up. - 3 Latissimus, & Rotundus major, draw it down. - 4 Superscapularis, superior and inferior, move it in a Circular Motion. - 5 The fifth is called Subscapularis. [Page 416](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/236:9?vid=115407)6 The Muscles of the Cubit are four: two bended as Biceps & Branchiaeus; two extended, as Longus & Brevis. 7 The Muscles of the Hand are fourty; of which, the Fingers have twenty nine; the other part of the Hand eleven. 8 The Vessels of the Hand, are Veins, Arteries, and Nerves. 9 The vein of the hand is a part of the axilla vein. 10 It is divided into the superior Branch, which is called Cephalica; and the Inferior which is called Basilica. 11 The Cephalica is divided into two Branches. - 1 The Internal, which together with the Basilica, make the Median. - 2 The external, which maketh the Salvatella. 12 The Basilica is either the Right, called the Liver vein; or the Left, which is called the vein of the Spleen. 13 The Artery is a Branch of the Axillar Artery. 14 After it hath passed the Elbow it is divided into two Branches. - 1 The first is that which Physitians feel when they say they feel the Pulse. - 2 The second passeth internally to the Fingers. 15 The Nerves arise from the Marrow of the Back; either from the fifth, sixth, and seventh Joynts in the Neck; or else from the first and second [Page 417](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/237:9?vid=115407) of the Breast, and are divided into many Branches, and are distributed amongst the Muscles and Skin. 16 You have the Anatomy of the Hand: the Foot remains. V. The Anatomy of the Foot. 1 The Foot is the Instrument of Walking, and contains all that part that is between the Hipbone, and the top of the toes, and imitates the Hand as much as may be. It is divided into three parts, the Thigh, the Leg, and that which we cal the Foot; which is also divided into three parts, Tarsus, Metatarsus, and the Toes. 2 Parts of the Foot, are either Containing or Contained. The Parts Containing are either Proper or Common. The Common are, Scarf-skin, Skin Flesh, Membrana, and Fleshy Panicle. Proper, is the Membrana of the Muscles. 3 Parts contained, are Muscles, Vessels, and Bones. The Muscles are either the thigh, leg, foot, or toes. 4 The Muscles of the Thigh are eleven; of which, - 1 Five stretch it out, as Gluteus major, Me dius & minor, Iliacus, Externus Piriformis, as Lumbalis, internus, & Lividus. - 3 The other move it Circularly. 5 The Muscles of the Leg are ten, whereof - 1 Five bend it, as Longissimus, Gracilis, Senervosus, Biceps, . - 2 Some extend these four, Membranosus, Vastus, internus, externus & . - 3 The other Muscle Popliteus moves it oblickly. 6 The Muscles of the Feet are eight, of which - 1 Five extend it, as Castrominius, internus & externus, Plantaris, Soleus, Tibiaeus Posticus. other three bend it, as Tibiaeus anticus, and the two Periei. 7 The Muscles of the Toes are twenty three, whereof some bend them, some extend them, and others draw them transversly. 8 The Vessels of the Feet are, Veins, Arteries, and Nerves. 9 The Vein of the Leg is branched. - 1 Into the Saphaena, which passeth by the inside of the Ancle, where it is branched into four parts, and distributed amongst the Toes. This is the vein which is opened in afflictions of the Womb and Head. - 2 Ischias, which passeth by the outward part of the Leg. [Page 419](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/239:9?vid=115407)3 That which passeth to the Muscles. - 4 Suralis, which at the Knee is divided into two Branches, the one takes the inside, the other the outside. 10 The Artery is divided above the Knee, and administers Branches both to the Skin, and al the Muscles. 11 The Nerves arise from the Marrow of the Back, and pass through either the Joynts of the Loyns, or the Os Sacrum. 12 The Bones in each Foot are forty six, One of the Thigh, one Patella, two of the Knee, two of the Leg, and forty of the Foot. Thus you have the Parts Containing. The Parts Contained are such as are fluid, soft, and upheld by others. Parts Contained. 1 Parts contained are either Humors, or Spirits. 2 Humors are either Natural, or Influential. 3 Natural is that which is called Humidum Radicale. 4 Influential, is either Primary, or Secundary. - 1 Primary, is either Natural or not Natural. - 2 Natural, is either, - 1 Nourishing. - 2 Excrementitious. - 3 Participates of both. 5 Nourishing, is Blood and Flegm. [Page 420](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/240:9?vid=115407)Excrementitious is either Profitable, or Unprofitable. 6 Profitable, is Milk, Seed, the Water of the Blood, and the Water arising from the first Concoction. 7 Unprofitable are, Tears, Snot, Spittle, Menstruis Blood, Sweat, and Urine. 8 Those which are both Excrementitious and Nourishing are, Choller and Melancholly. 9 Humors not Natural, are the same with these; only they keep not a due Decorum, in Quantity, Quality, Motion, and Rest. 10 They offend in Quantity two waies, either by Abundance, or Defect. 11 Abundance or Repletion is two-fold, Plethora, and Cacochymia. 12 Cacochymia is either Simple or Compound. Simple is of Choller, Flegm, and Melancholly. 13 The failings of Quality, are either more Common, or more Proper. More Common are, Corruption, Putrefaction, Malignity, Crudity. 14 More Proper are, in respect of certain Humors, and so, - 1 Choller corrupted is, - 1 Vitiline, or like Yolks of Egs. - 2 Eruginous, like Vert-de-greece. - 3 Prassine, like Juyce of Herbs. - 4 Azure. [Page 421](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/241:9?vid=115407)2 Flegm is, - 1 Acide, sowr like Vinegar. - 2 Vitrial, like melted Glass. - 3 Salt, like Brine. - 4 Gypsum, like white Mortar. - 3 Melancholly adust, proceeding either of burnt Blood, burnt Choller, or salt Flegm. 15 Thus much of Hmors: the Spirits remain. 16 Spirits are insited in, or influential. 17 Spirits insited in are two, either innate Moisture, or innate Heat. 18 Spirits Influential are, either Vital or Animal. 19 The Innate Spirit, according to Hermetical Phylosophers, is, An Astral and vital Body, a Natural Balsom, a vital Sulphur, and a vital Mummy. Hitherto of a Corporal Anatomy: A Vertual Anatomy follows. Hermetical Phylosophers. 1 They have a double kind of Anatomy; the one Local, the other Essential, Vital, or Formal. 2 The Local (say they) is that which every Butcher doth when he cuts open an Ox or a Calf; which although Hermetical Phylosophers do not reject, yet they would not have Physitians spend all their daies in pering upon that, and neglect businesses of greater import. 3 A vi tal Anatomy is that which dissolves every [Page 422](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/242:9?vid=115407) Body into its first Principles: He that drives such a Model of Physick, ought to be wel versed in the Natures and Properties of Seeds; the Office of Elements and Principles; the Generation and transplantation of Roots; the Motion and Influence of the Heavens, and Heavenly Bodies; the Disposition not only of Dead, but also of Living Bodies. They do not cal that Lump of Flesh only, the Heart, which others do; but whatsoever hath vital heat in it. They cal every Cavity the Stomach, nay, every place in which there is any Concoction: Every place contains any fruitful Seed is a Womb with them. But the main Basis of their Art is the Harmony of the Creation, and the due Consideration of that notable Agreement between things above, and things below. Tome I. Part IV. Of Vertual Anatomy, Or the Harmony between the Macrocosm and Microcosm. VErtual Anatomy teacheth the Harmony between one part of the Creation and another; [Page 423](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/243:9?vid=115407) the Analogical Comparation and Reductions of things; therby fetching its remedies, and learning their strengths and vertues from the Book of Nature, not of Galen. 2 For whatsoever is in the Universal World is also in Man; not according to a certain superficial similitude as some Fools prattle; but in Deed, and in Reality, are contained in him whatsoever is in the whol Theater of the World. 3 The Spirit of a Man communicates with God himself; the Rational Soul with the Angels; and the Body with the Stars and Earth. 4 Paracelsus, and most other Hermerical Phylosophers, hold that Man hath a double Body: the one Natural, Elementary. visible, and tangable, which was first made of the Slime of the Earth: the other Invisible, Insensible, deduced from the Coelestial Influence of the Stars; and this Crollius cals the Genius of Man; his Domestick Laris, the Instructer of Wise Men (for he cannot abide Fools.) 5 This Analogical Comparation is to be considered in a double Manner. - 1 In respect of the Heavenly Bodies themselves. - 2 In respect of Medicines caused by their Influence. Of these, the Galenists knew either very little, or nothing at all. [Page 424](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/244:9?vid=115407) LIB. I. Of the Analogical Comparation of the Heavens with the Body of Man. 1 ALL things that are above, are to be found in things below: or if you would have it a little plainer; Terrestial things are in Heaven after a Celestial manner: Celestial things upon Earth after a Terrestial manner: And this, none but a few people that are scarce wel in their Wits wil deny. 2 We shal only here give you the Sum of the Analogy and Harmony of the Universal World with the Body of Man, which we shal (God willing) treat more plainly and fully of in our Harmony of both Worlds. - First, Of the Coupling of the Celeftial Orbs with our Bodies and Eyes. - Secondly, Of the Coupling of the Sun and Heavens with our Rational Soul. - Thirdly, Of the Comparation of the Beams of the Sun with the Spirits of Mans Body. - Fourthly, Of the Comparation of the Sun with the Heart of Man - Fiftly, Of the application of the Heat of the Sun to the Native Heat of Mans Body.

Or - 2 With the Body of Man, and that is called Signatura. LIB. II Of the Influential Harmony. 1 INfluential Harmony is that which teacheth the Influence and Dominion of the Planets both over Diseases, and the Medicines which to cure them. [Page 426](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/246:9?vid=115407)2 The Course of the Planets Diseases according to the Nature of each Planet, upon those parts of the Body which they rule: so Saturn the Spleen, Jupiter the Liver, and Mars the Gal; the Sun the Heart Venus the Reins, the Lungs, and the Moon the Brain. 3 So the of Saturn proceed Melancholly, failings of the Spleen, and Afflictions of the Hypochondria. Jupiter causeth distempers and obstructions of Liver, Cachexia, Dropsie, yellow Jaundice. Mars causeth al distempers of the Gall, the Stone, and Obstructions, Fulness and Emptiness. The Sun causeth distempers of Heart, faintings, weakness. Vinus causeth the Stone in the Reins. Mercury the Phthisick, Pleuresie, Asthma, and Cough. The Moon causeth Diseases of the Brain. I confess I am not altogether of my Authors Opinion in some of these; and what my Jugdment is, you may find if you please to peruse my Semeiotica Uranica. 4 Diseases are cured either by Sympathy or Antipathy. 5 A Disease is cured by Sympathy, when it is cured by such remedies as are under the Planet that rules the part afflicted: And so such Medicines are under the Dominion of the Moon and [Page 427](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/247:9?vid=115407)Mercury, help the Brain: and if Mercury cause the Disease, your only way is to use such Medicines as are under the Dominion of Jupiter: Not only because of the Antipathy between him and Mercury; but also because Jupiter is in the House of the Moon. 6 Diseases are cured by Antipathy, when they are cured by the Remedies of the contrary Plannet, and that two waies. - 1 When their Houses are contrary, and so Mars cures the ill effects of Venus. - 2 When their Natures are contrary: so Saturn cures the ill effects Venereal Lust causeth. LIB III. Of the Faculties of Simples, which the Dogmatists make use of to find out their Natures. 1 EXperience and Signiture first found out the Vertues of Plants: so Hemlock was found out to be hurtful by Experience. 2 Signature is either External or Internal. 3 External is a meer accidental business, the Basis and Foundation of which, is nothing else, than the Form or Figure, Color or Feeling of a Plant. [Page 428](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/248:9?vid=115407)4 Internal is the Temperament or Quality, which is the Principle and Foundation of their and Vertues. 5 The Temperament or Qualities consist most in their Tast, less in their Smel. 6 The by which their strength and are known, ar nine: - 1 Three testimonies of heat, as Sharp, , and Salt. - 2 Three give testimonies of Cold, as Tart, , and Sowr. - 3 Three give testimonies of temperance, , Fat and . 7 Seing Simple Medicines have two Qualities, and somtimes three; then the first is called Simple and Elementary, which ariseth from the of the four . The other is called , which ariseth from the consistence of the & diversity of Proportion. Besides these two, some have a third Quality, which is Purging, and is by called Hidden, because it is from al Block heads. 8 In general some Simples conduce to Health, others to Ornament. 9 Such as conduce to Health, are either Alterating, or Evacuating. 10 Alterating are either Common, or appropriated to some certain part. 11 Such as are Common do it either by a Quality, or by a Hidden. [Page 429](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/249:9?vid=115407)12 By they it, by the first, second, or third degree. 13 First Quality is either Temperate or . Intemperate is Hot, Cold, Moist and Dry. 14 These Qualities they call D'grees, but might properly have called them Orders: Galen cals them Numbers. 15 The Orders of Intemperature, reach to four Degrees, both in respect of Heat, Cold, and Dryness, but not of Moisture, although my Author affirm it, because Moisture is inconsistent both with Heat and Coldness, it being dried by the one, and congealed by the other. 16 The second Faculties of Simples, are such as these: - I. Emollient, as Butter, Saffron, &c. - II. &c. - III. Hardning, as , &c. - IV. Making thin, as Chamomel, &c. - V. Making thick, as , and most cold Herbs. - VI. Opening, as Garlick, Gall &c. - VII. Binding, as - IX. Drawing, as Birthwort, Pepper - X. Discussing, as Southernwood, - XVI. Putrefying, Aconitum, - XVII. Causing as Mustard-seed. - pain, as Oyl of Dill, &c. - . Stupefying, as Opium, Hemlock, &c. 17 The third Faculties arise from the Conjunction of the first and second. Such are, - I. Suppuring, as Saffron, White Lilly Roots &c. - II. Breeding Flesh, as Barly Meal, &c. - III. Glutinating, IV. Scarrifying as - V. Provoking the Terms, as Annis, &c. - VI. Bringing a Callus, as Terra Samia &c. - VII. Stopping the VIII. Pectorals, Milk, , Smallage, &c. - X. Breeding Seed, as Pease, Beans, - XI. Extinguishing Seed, as Rue, swellings, as Marsh-Mallows, Orris, &c. 18 You have the Manifest Qualities of Simples: the Hidden Qualities follow. [Page 431](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/251:9?vid=115407)19 , all the cannot tell what to make of; only their Ancestors gave them with good- : They have nothing to say for the of them, but only Tradition, and by that they are led by the Noses as they use to lead Bears along the street: And in so doing, pray tell me how much they differ from Empericks. 20 You have the common Altering Qualities: the Proper follow, as they are attributed to certain parts of the Body. Such should write plain English; they are such as are appropriated to the Head, Breast, Heart, Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Break the Stone, Cherish the Womb, and the Joynts. 21 You have such as Alter: those that Evacuate Chacochymia follow: And they do it by a Quality either Manifest or Hidden. 22 They which Evacuate by a Manifest Quality, are either washing, clensing, or making slippery. 23 They which Evacnate by a Hidden Quality (as they cal it) do it either Insensibly, as Sweating; or Sensibly: and that either upwards, as Vomiting; or downwards, as Purging by Urin or Stool. 24 Purging is either Moderate, or Strong, and [Page 432](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/252:9?vid=115407) certain Humors, as Choller, , , and Water. You have the Qualities of Simples conducing to Health: those conducing to Ornament should follow; which because they rather consist of Compounds than of Simples, we wil refer them to their proper place. 26 Thus have you the qualities of Simples considered in General; what now remains, but that we enquire after the Special Anatomy of . 27 In every Medicine we must consider its common Affections, and its Species. 28 Its Common Affections are either its Subject, as the place of gathering and preserving of them: or Adjunct, as the time of gathering of them, and the time of their durance. 29 According to Species, the Medicine is made either of simple bodies, or of mixed. Of simple Bodies, as Fir, Air, Water, Earth. 30 Of mixt Bodies, either such as have life and not sence; or such as have life and sence: Such as want sence, are such as come out of the Sea, or out of the Land, as Mettals, Plants, and their parts. Thus you have the Signatures of the , which are no certainer than they should be: The Signatures of Hermetical Phylosophers follow; which if you try, you shal find a little more certain. [Page 433](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/253:9?vid=115407) LIB. IV. The Signatures of Hermetical Phylosophers, both Internal and External, by which they find out the Vertues of things. 1 A Signature is either Internal, or External. 2 External is that which shews the Efficacy of a thing, and somtimes the Temperature. 3 It contains - 1 The Signatures of Men taken from other Living Creatures. - 2 The Signatures of Plants, by their similitude to some part of the Body of Man. - 3 The Signatures of Diseases. - 4 Medicines which help by similitude. 4 Internal Signature is the Principle, Cause, , and Foundation, shewing the Vertue and Efficacy of a thing; and it is called Vital Essential, and Formal or Anatomy. 5 These Internal Principles are three, Sal, Sulpher, and Mercury. 6 In these three constituting and vertual Principles, the qualities, that is, Tast, Smel, and Color [Page 434](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/254:9?vid=115407) are found; not by imagination and guess only, but in Reality and Truth: namely, The Tasts are most found in the Salt, the Smel in the Sulphur, and the Colors in the Mercury. 7 These three are found in every Elementary Body: These are the things that bring it forth, and preserve it being brought forth: By these it flourisheth, and is furnished with divers Operations. 8 None of these three Principles are found alone, but doth partake of some of the other; for Salt by the benefit of these two Salts, Sal Nitre, and Sal Armoniack, contains in it self a certain Oyly substance, and Mercurial: The Sulphur retains a certain Salt substance and Mercurial: And Mercury retains a certain Sulpurous, and Salt substance; but it retains the name of that which it partakes most of. Now what Analogy there is of these three with our Body, I shal open (God willing) more plainly when I come to our Harmony, which I promised before. 9 Thus you have the Remote Theorick of : the Neer follows. [Page 435](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/255:9?vid=115407) Tome I. Part V. Of that part of the Theorick of Physick which is called Pathologia. 1 THE next part of the Theory of Physick is that which explaineth the Universal Constitution of Man. 2 In every Constitution four things are to be considered, - 1 The Disposition of the part to act. - 2 The Action. - 3 The Cause of the Action. - 4 The Consequence of the Action. 3 Every Constitution of the Body is included under these three Differences, namely, Good, Bad, or neither of them both. 4 Health is Good; Sickness Ill; Neutrality neither of them both: Therfore Medicine is the knowledge of things Healthful, Unhealthful, and Neuter. 5 Healthful, Unhealthful, and Neutrality, is taken three waies, 1 As a Body. 2 As a Cause. 3 As a Sign. [Page 436](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/256:9?vid=115407)6 A Body is said to be Healthful that enjoyes Health. The Cause of Health is that which either brings it, or preserveth it being obtained. A Healthful Sign is that which shews the Body to be in Health. 7 An Unhealthful Body is that which is surprized with a Disease. The Cause is that which causeth the Disease. The Signs are, - 1 Such as shew the kind and greatness of the Disease, and they are called Diagnostical: Or - 2 Such as shew the Event of the Disease, and they are called Prognostical. 8 Neutrality, is when the Body is neither perfectly wel, nor yet sick, between which two Extreams is a great Latitude: For when a Man begins to fail in performing his Actions, before he fals absolutely sick it is called a Neutrality of sickness when a man begins to recover again it is called a Neutrality of Health. 9 The Causes of this Neutrality are no way ; neither are the Signs absolutely Demonstrative. 10 The knowledge of things Healthful is called Hygiena, or Diet; under which also, the knowledg of things Neutral is comprehended. The knowledg of things Unhealthful (if you regard [Page 437](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/257:9?vid=115407) the ) is called Pathologie; but if you regard the Practice, . 11 Pethal gie is part of Medicine which explaineth against Nature. 12 The which are against Nature in Man are - 1 The Disease, which consists in the parts. - 2 The Cause which consists in the things contained of which we before.) - 3 The Symptomes which consists in the Functions and Operations of the . 13 The Common and Species are to be considered in Pathologie. 14 The Common is that which unfoldeth the Accidents of the Disease. 15 It is called , and LIB. I. Of Semeiotica, or the Doctrine of Signs. 1 SEmeiotica delivers the Doctrine of 2 Physical Signs are either Healthful, Unhealthful, or Neutral. 3 Some Signs cal to Memory the state past; Others shew the state present, and they are either General, or Special. [Page 438](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/258:9?vid=115407)The General are Diagnosticks and 4 Diagnosticks are Common or Proper. 5 Proper are three-fold, - 1 Some are taken from the Kind of the Disease. - 2 Others from the Cause. - 3 Others from the part of the Body afflicted. 6 The signs of Diseases are known by the Excrements, the Pain, the Nature of the place Afflicted, the Color of the Nails, Tongue, and Face. 7 Of the signs of the Causes; some shew the Cause either present, as the Color, Nature, and pain of the part afflicted the Excrements: or else Antecedent, and they are General and Special. 8 General are, the Disposition of the Mind, Dreams, Diet, and Exercise before used. Special shew either Plenitude, or the Humor afflicting, as Blood, Choller, Melancholly, Flegm, Watery Humors, and Wind. 9 Signs of the part afflicted are Excrements, the Action of the part , Pain, the scituation and nature of the place. 10 The Part afflicted may be afflicted either by it self, or by Consent, for somtimes one Disease remits by the encrease of another; and this is Primar, or Secundary. 11 Primar, which is properly inhaerent in some part. 12 , which is done by Consent of [Page 439](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/259:9?vid=115407) the Parts: And this is done. - 1 By Sympathy, as when the foulness of the Stomach causeth the Head to ach. Or - 2 By Translation, as when the Matter that causeth the Disease out of one part of the Body into another: And is two-fold. - First, When it passeth out of a more Noble, into a part less Noble. - Secondly, When it out of a part less Noble, into a part more Noble. Prognostical Signs. 1 Prognostical Signs judg of a present, or to come. 2 The Signs of a Disease present, are Apparant, or Supervenient, or Decretory. 3 Apparant and supervenient signs are of Concoction or Crudity; or signs of Health or Death. 4 Signs of Concoction or Crudity are all the Excrements, both Urine and Dung. 5 Pronostical from the Urine are. - 1 If it be thin, meanly thick, or very thick. - 2 If it be cleer or troubled; if so, whether it be cleer when it is pissed out, and troubled afterwards; or troubled when it is pissed out, and grow cleer afterwards; or troubled when it is pissed out, and remain so. [Page 440](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/260:9?vid=115407)3 By the Color, namely , black whitish, blackish yellow, . - 4 By the things, contained in it, namely, clouds, sand, , things like scales of Fish, &c. 6 Prognosticks are taken from the Dung, either from its substance, , or quantity. 7 Signs of Health or , are taken from the strength of the Disease, as also from the strength of the Diseased; and they are either primary or Secondary. 8 Primary are taken either from the strength of the , which the Constitution of the Body ; as also the Animal, and Natural Functions: from the strength of the , which the kind, greatness, durance, and of the sheweth. 9 signs of Health and Death are taken, - 1 From the Affliction of the Vital and Natural spirit. - 2 From the Excrements, as Urine, Dung, vomiting, sweating, bleeding. - 3 From the Habit and qualities of the whol Body, and every part of it. - 4 From such things as hurt or help the sick, [Page 441](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/261:9?vid=115407) Signs of Death, according to the Opinion of Hermetical Phylosophers. Hermetical Phylosophers take the signs of Death from Physiognomy. - 1 From the Eyes, when they sink deep in the Head, and are discolored. - 2 From the Nose when it is sharp; the Ears and Lips, cold, pale, or discolored. - 3 The Teeth, Nails, and Hair looking deadish, which somtimes happens a fortnight, or three weeks before the party dies. - 4 The skin of the Fore head, and all the Body, looking of a swarthy, palish, or dead color. These and many other, you may find Methodically laid down in the Presages of Hippocrates, which you may find at the latter end of my Vranica; or Judgment of Diseases by Astrology. You have the Apparant Progonostical Signs: the Decretory, or Critical follows. Of the Crisis, and Critical Daies. Crisis is a vehement change of a Disease either to Health or Death. - 1 Crisis is, - 1 Perfect, which is either Healthful or Mortal. [Page 442](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/262:9?vid=115407)1 Imperfect, which makes the sick either better or worse. - 2 Of Critical signs, some go before, some accompany, and some follow after. - 3 Of such as go before, some shew the time of the Crisis, and others the Manner of it. - 4 Such as shew the time of the Crisis, shew the state, and Declination of the Disease. - 1 Such as the encrease of the Disease, shew its swiftness, and unequalness, and its time of vehemency. - 2 Such as shew its state, shew to what height its vehemency and vigor-wil arise to, and what symptoms it wil produce. - 3 Such as shew its declination, shew how these symptoms will have remission, and when. - 5 Such as shew the Manner of the Crisis are, - 1 Either Universal, which gives Judgment by the kind of the Disease, and its Motion, the part afflicted, and the Nature of the sick. - 2 Particular, which shews the kind of Excretion, or Imposthume. - 6 Excretion is made either by bleeding, sweating, vomiting, stool, Urine, Menstruis Blood, or the Hemorrhoids. - 7 Signs declaring an Impostume, are such as declare either the Impostume it self, as length of [Page 443](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/263:9?vid=115407)a Disease, thinness of Urin, a winter season an imperfect Crisis; or the place of the Impostume, as the condition of the humor offending, the strength of Nature, weakness and pain in some certain part. 8 The signs accompanying a Crisis, are either Excretion or Imposthumes. In Excretion there comes to be considered, the quality of the Humor, the quantity, time, and manner of casting it out. In an Impostume are three things to be considered; Where it is; Whence it comes; and, What the occasion of it was. - 9 The Consequents of a Crisis are taken, - 1 From the quality of the Body. - 2 From the Animal, Vital, and Natural Functions. - 3 From al the Excrements Universally. - 10 Critrical daies are begun at that very hour that the sick finds himself manifestly to be taken ill: An exact Rule for which, you have in my Astrological Judgment of Diseases. - 11 The Foundation of Critical daies is gathered from the Moon, because if she be wel affected she disposeth the Humors to the best advantage: if il affected, she shews encrease of the , as being but a servant to bring down the Influence of the other Celestial Bodies to the Earth. - 12 Critical daies, according to the motion of the Moon are four, [Page 444](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/264:9?vid=115407) - 1 The Place she is in at the Decumbiture. - 2 Her quartile to that place. - 3 Her opposition to that place. - 4 Her second quartile to that place. Thus you have the more General Semeiotical part, consisting of Diagnosticks, and Prognosticks: The Special follows, namely, The Doctrine of Urine and Pulses. LIB. II. Of the Doctrine of Pulses. 1 PUlse hath his Original, First, From the Motion of the Heart, Secondly, Of the Arteries, by Distention and Contraction, which Physitians call Systolae and Diastolae, and their use is to preserve Vital heat in the Body. 2 In the Pulse are four things to be considered - 1 The Reason, and knowledg of them. - 2 Their Differences. - 3 Their Causes. - 4 Their Significations. 1 The Reason of observing, and knowing the Pulse. 1 In this consider, - First, The Precepts of Feeling the Pulse; of [Page 445](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/265:9?vid=115407)which, some concern the sick Body, others the means of its cure. - Secondly, The Principles which are necessary to distinguish the Pulse. 2 The Difference of Pulses. 1 Of Pulses, some are absolutely , others relatively such. 2 Absolutely such are either Simple or Compound. 3 Of simple are six kinds. - 1 In the quantity of Distention, as great, mean, smal. - 2 In the quantity of the Force as vehement, moderate, weak. - 3 In Motion of Time, as swift mean, slow. - 4 In quantity of Time, and Rest; as often, Mean, seldom. - 5 In quantity of the Artery, as soft, mean, hard. - 6 In perfusion of the Artery, as full, mean, empty. 4 Compound are such as consist of the mixture of some of these simples. 5 Relatively such are reduced either to Order or Disorder; Equality, or In quality. 3 The Causes of Pulses. 1 The Causes of Pulses, some are Primary, [Page 446](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/266:9?vid=115407) the Pulse; some secundary, changing and altering the Pulse. 2 The Primary, or Efficient Causes of the Pulse are, - 1 The Vital spirit, either strong or weak. - 2 The Instruments are the Arteries, either wide or narrow, soft, or hard. - 3 The use of the Pulse is, the conservation of vital heat in the Body. 3 The secundary causes which change the Pulse are, - 1 Natural, as the Temperament, Habit, sex, and age of the Body. - 2 Nor Natural, as air meat and drink, exercise and rest, sleeping and watching, fulness and emptiness, and affections of the Mind. - 3 Things against Nature, as Diseases and their symptomes. 4 Prognosticks by the signification of the pulse. 1 Greatness of the Pulse shews Heat. 2 Vehemency, shews strength of the Faculties. 3 A weak Pulse, shews weakness of Nature. 4 Diseases of Love, give an unequal and inordinate Pulse. But herein let none mistake my Author; for [Page 447](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/267:9?vid=115407) though Diseases of Love give alwaies such a , it doth not therfore of necessity follow, That such a Pulse alwaies shews Diseases of Love. An Hermetical Consideration of the pulse. 1 The Pulse is felt in five several places: for it is not enough to feel it in the Wrest (as Physitians now a daies do, that care not how little they do for their money) Let it be felt then, first in the Hands and Feet, then in the Breast, then under the Armpits, and last of all in the Temples. If these agree together, all wil go wel enough: if not, mind these things that follow. 2 The Pulse hath four Vertues, - 1 Of Tartar, which causeth a Pulse either hard, circular, or slow. - 2 Mineral, which is either subtil or obscure. - 3 Of Health, which is equal and mean. - 4 Of Disease, which shews either Tartar or Mineral. - 5 Strange, giving signs either of Heat or Coldness. NOTE. 1 When all the Pulse beat at one and the same time, it is a laudible sign. 2 Health is not only found out by the feeling [Page 448](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/268:9?vid=115407) of the Pulse, but also by the color of them. 3 When the Pulses are wel color'd, it is a good ; Evil, if discolor'd. 4 When the place of the Pulse is hotter than the rest of the skin, the Body is diseased. 5 If the Pulse be Mineral, put a little cold water upon the place, and if the Pulse stop for a while, it is a good sign. 6 If the Disease come of heat of Blood, you may know it thus: Wet a piece of Silk in Role-water, and lay it upon the Pulse, that part of it upon the Pulse will sooner dry than the other part. 7 If the Pulse be hard in one place, and soft in another, the Disease is Chronical. 8 When the Body is near Death, the Pulse is strongest in the Fore-head, not so strong at the Neck, weaker in the Hands, and weakest of all in the Feet: for the lower parts of Men die first. 9 IN al Apoplexies, the stronger the Pulse is, the worse. 10 In Frenzies, Falling-sickness, and Madness, it is a good sign when the Pulse is the same out of the Fit, that it is in the Fit. 11 In Bloody Fluxes, and all other Fluxes of the Belly, though the Pulse remain as it did in Health, give no credit to it: for in such Diseases, the Pulse remains til Death, and somtimes a quarter of an hour after. [Page 449](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/269:9?vid=115407)You have the Consideration of the Pulse: The Consideration of the Urine follows. LIB III. Of Vrine. 1 URine is the Wheyish part of the Blood, separated by the Vertue of the Reins. 2 In it consider the Inspection, Signification, and Difference. 3 In the Inspection of Urine, consider the Acception and Caution. 4 Cautions are, - 1 The Causes changing the Urine, as Temperament, Sex, Age, and Diet. - 2 The Urines of Beasts, or somthing else brought for the Urine of Men, which is easily known by Smel. The Significations and Differences of Vrine. 1 It discovers the Constitution of the Parts by which it flows, as the Reins, Ureters, Bladder, and . 2 It shews the disposition which is in the Liver and Veins. [Page 450](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/270:9?vid=115407)3 It shews the disposition of those parts by which the peccant matter can be sent to the Veins or Urine. 4 In Urine, consider the Liquor it self, and the things contained in it. In the Liquor it self, consider the substance, quality, and quantity. 5 In the substance, consider the Body and cleerness. 6 The Body of the Urine is either, - 1 Thin; in color white, Saffron, like Gold, or Reddish. - 2 Mean; of the color of Gold, Saffron, or reddish. - 3 Thick; which is a Mixture of al colors, and somtimes Oyly. 7 The Perspicuity of the Urine is either cleer or troubled; and it is of three sorts: - 1 Such as is cleer when 'tis made, and troubled afterwards. - 2 Such as is troubled when 'tis made, and cleer afterwards. - 3 Such as is troubled when 'tis made, and so continues. The quantity of Urine is either Moderate, Much, or Little. 9 The quality consists in smel or Color. The smel of Urine is either sweet or stinking. 10 In the Color, consider the Causes and Difference. [Page 451](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/271:9?vid=115407)11 The Cause of the Color of Urine, is the heat of the Bowels, and mixture of other Humors, and it is either white, citrine, subcitrine, of the color of Gold or Saffron, red and bloody, green, blue, and black, which is the worst of al. 12 Things contained in the Urine, are either Essential or Accidental. 13 Essential is, - 1 Towards the bottom of the Urine, which being white, light, and equal, is very good: but being black, is very bad. - 2 In the middle of the Urine, which being white, light, and equal, is indifferent; if it be black, it is dangerous. - 3 Clouds on the top of the Urine are but seen, and when they are seen, they portend but little good; and the blacker they are, the they are, because they carry the Image of Death. 14 Accidental is double; for either it an incertain, or certain place in the Urinal. 15 Such as occupy an incertain place, and somtimes fly up and down in the Urine, and somtimes settle in the bottom, are somtimes like Bran, somtimes like scales of fish, and somtimes like thrids. 16 Such as keep one certain place, are either in the bottom, as red and white gravel, little clods of blood, worms, thick flegm like snot: or else in the top, as wind fat, and things like Cobwebs. [Page 452](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/272:9?vid=115407) Hermetical of Vrine. 1 Urine is Salt, separated from undigested . 2 Of Urine, some is Exterior, some of Blood, and others Mixed. 3 Exterior Urine is that which comes of what we eat or drink, that is of our Nourishment; neither hath it any other Indication than what belongs to the Stomach, Liver or Reins. It is called also the Urine of Tartar, because it comes of congealed Tartar, or . 4 It is two-fold, Sound, or unsound. Sound is when there is a Tincture of Sulphur with it, and yet notwithstanding it is not alwaies of a Gold Color, but somtimes redder; and somtimes paler. 5 The Urine of Tartar is known by the Circle, which if it be only of a color, it shews Tartar, and the separation which is made in the three Members, Stomach Liver, and Reins. 6 The Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury may be discerned in Waters, For the Bottom shews the Mercury. The Settling neer the Bottom, the . And the Tincture the Sulphur. 7 The Urine of an unsound Man is two-fold, , and of Nourishment. [Page 453](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/273:9?vid=115407)8 The of Tartar is three-fold. - 1 Alcolita, which signifies Congealation, and the Tartar of the Stomach. - 2 Scatea, signifies Putrefaction, and the Tartar of the Liver. - 3 Tremula, which signifies stopping, and the Tartar of the Reins. 9 The Urine of Nourishment is Dreggy, and signifies a failing in the Attractive Vertue. 10 The Urine of Blood is when a Circle is in the of a different Color and it tends commonly to Redness, and is the messenger of grievous . 11 The substance of Urine is three fold; Thick, Cleer, and Diaphanous, or like Cristal. You have the : the Symptomes follow. LIB. IV. Of Symptomes. 1 SYmptomes taken more generally, are an effect shewing the strength of Nature: More specially, they are an Accident proceeding from the Disease. 2 In Symptomes we are to consider the and Causes. [Page 454](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/274:9?vid=115407)A Symptome is either Primary, or Secundary. 3 Primary, is a hurting of the Actions or Functions. - 1 Either of the Animal, in respect of sence or motion. - 2 A lessening or depravation of the Vital in Quantity or Quality. - 3 A corrupting of the Natural. 4 Secundary, is either a change of the Quality, or a vice of the Excrements. The change of the quality is two-fold; either Common to al the Sences, or Proper to one. Common to al, are the Bigness, Number, Figure, Motion, or Rest changed. 5 Proper are, the Simple Effects of the Body: and they are either to be seen, as the color in the yellow Jaundice; or to be smelt, as a stinking Breath; or to be heard, as noise in the Ears; or to be tasted, as bitterness and saltness in the Throat: or to be felt, as the heat in a Feaver. 6 Excrements offend, either in substance, or in quality, or in quantity, in manner, or in time. 7 The Causes of Symptomes are either the first, or arising the first. The first, are a hurt of the Functions, either of the Animal, as the Brain, Sences, and their Organs: or of the Vital, as Diseases that afflict the Heart and Lungs: or of the Natural, as such Diseases as afflict Nourishment and Generation. [Page 455](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/275:9?vid=115407)8 Arising from these, are the change of qualities; whether arising from the Simple Affects, or the vice of the Excrements. 9 The Causes of the Simple affects of the Body are, the hurting of the Natural Functions; namely, Attraction, Retention, Digestion, Expulsion, from whence vicious humors arise. 10 The Cause of vicious Excrements, is these vicious Humors, which offend in quantity, quality or substance. 11 Thus you have the Common Affection of Pathalogia: The Special remains, which are Aethiologia, and Nosologia. LIB. V. Of the Aethiologie of Diseases. 1 AEThiologia is that Art which declareth the Causes of Diseases. 2 The Causes of Diseases are either General or Particular. 3 The General are, the Theological, or Physical. 4 The Physical are either bred with us, or come afterwards. 5 Those that are bred with us, are either Natural, or against Nature, through fault either [Page 456](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/276:9?vid=115407) of the Seed, or of the Mothers Blood. 6 Those which come afterward, are either External or Internal. The External Causes of Diseases. 1 The External Causes are either more necessary, or less necessary. 2 More necessary are the six things not Natural: namely, Air; Meat and Drink; Sleeping and Watching; Exercise and Rest; Fulness and Emptiness; and Affections of the Mind. 3 Air begets Diseases, either by Inspiration, or Respiration, and changeth our Bodies by a Quality manifest or hidden; and that according either to the Heaven, or the Wind. 4 Nourishment changeth our Body, according to its Quality, Quantity, and convenient Use. According to its Quality, Intemperancy, Matter, or Substance. - 1 According to Intemperancy; when it is hotter, colder, dryer, or moister than agrees with our Bodies. - 2 According to Matter, when it is either too thick, or too thin of Juyce. - 3 According to Substance; when it is before it is eaten. 5 According to quantity, when we eat so much that we over power the Vessels: or so little that our Bodies want Nourishment. [Page 457](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/277:9?vid=115407)6 Sleeping and , when they are , or not taken at times. 7 Exercise and Rest , - 1 In Quantity; when they are either too much, or too little. - 2 In Time; when they are taken . 8 Fulness and -. - 1 Emptying offends, either when it is ; or when it is too much. - 2 Retention offends the , and that in respect of either , , or Seed. 9 Affections of the Mind stir up ; when they grow immoderate, as Anger, joy, , and . 10 Causes of Diseases less are four, - 1 things as compass us about, as , , , &c. - 2 things as we take in; as Minerals, , Living Creatures, not wel prepared. - 3 Evacuation of Blood, and immoderate . - 4 External Motion as Running, Riding, &c. Internal Causes of Diseises. 1 and all his Apes, deny any containing of a Disease. [Page 458](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/278:9?vid=115407)2 Internal Causes are either Containing, Contained, or such as cause violence: but most properly things contained. 3 All Heredetary Diseases come from Causes containing. Things contained as they are causes of Diseases, are against Nature, as Humors, Vapors, or Wind. 4 The Internal causes are either by themselves, or by accident, or according to place. 5 The cause which stirs up a Disease by it self, are either through fault of Quantity or Quality. Through fault of Quantity, is either a want of Blood and Spirits, or a superabounding of Blood, which is called Plethora. 6 Want of Blood and Spirits, proceeds, - 1 From the Constitution of the Body. - 2 From outward heat, as of the Air, Fire, &c. - 3 From fasting. - 4 From Purging. - 5 From Watching. - 6 From Labor. - 7 From Joy. 7 A Redundance of Blood, or a Plethora, distempers both Heart and Liver, and is most incident to people of idle lives. 8 The fault of the quality is called Cacochymia, which is either, 9 Confusedly of all things contained; or particularly of some of them; as - 1 Of Humors, as a hot, cold, moist, or dry distemper. - 2 Of Matter, when the Humors are too thick, or too thin, hard or turbulent. - 3 Of the Form, when the Blood or Spirits are corrupted by putrefaction of humors. [Page 459](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/279:9?vid=115407) 10 Choller, Melancholly, Flegm, Watry Humors, and Wind. 11 The Causes of Choller are, - 1 A hot and dry Temperament of the Liver and Heart. - 2 A frequent concourse of cool Air. - 3 Hot and dry Nourishment. - 4 The Evacuations of Choller stopped. - 5 Vehement Exercise. - 6 Immoderate Watching. - 7 Anger. 12 Choller, is either Natural, or against Nature. Natural is either Nourishing, or Excrementitious. Against Nature, is either in the Liver, or in the Vessels. 13 The Causes of Melancholly are, - 1 A dry Liver and Heart, and a stopped Spleen. - 2 Cold and dry Air. - 3 Much feeding upon gross food. [Page 460](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/280:9?vid=115407)4 Usual Evacuation stopped. - 5 Care, and much Watching. - 6 A sad life. 14 Melancholly is either Natural, or against . Natural is either Nourishing, or Excrementitious. Against Nature is hot and sharp. 15 The Causes of a Cacochymia of Flegm are these, - 1 A moist Temperature of the Heart and Liver. - 2 A cold and moist Stomach. - 3 Cold and moist Air. - 4 The use of cold and moist food. - 5 The avoiding of Flegm by the Mouth and Fundament stopped. - 6 An idle lazy life. - 7 Much sleep. - 8 Leading a life without Care. 16 Flegm, is either within the Veins, or without. Within the Veins, it is either Natural, or against Nature. Natural is either more or less Nourishing. 17 The Causes of a Cacochymia of Water are, - 1 The Stomach cold, the Liver and Spleen stopped. - 2 Cold and moist Air. [Page 461](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/281:9?vid=115407)3 Moist Food. - 4 Retention of usual sweating, or urine, or accustomed Evacuation. - 5 An idle life. - 6 Immoderate sleep. - 7 Sadness. 18 The Causes of a Cacochymia of Wind are, - 1 A cold and moist Stomach. - 2 Cold Air. - 3 Windy Meat. - 4 Retention of Excrements. - 5 Idleness. 19 The Internal Causes of Diseases by Accident, or according to the seat of the Body, are either in the first, second, or third Region. A Cacochymia may occupy al the Regions of the Body, or but one of them. A Plethora is conversant in the second and third Regions only, or in but one of them. What my Author means by Region here, I know not, unless he mean the Ventricles. 20 The humor is gathered together in any part, either by Congestion, or by . 21 In every Fluxion are four things to be considered, - 1 The matter which is moved. - 2 The way by which it is moved. - 3 The part sending it. - 4 The part receiving it. [Page 462](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/282:9?vid=115407)22 The Matter flows either by Transmission or Attraction. 23 The Causes of Transmission are either, the violence of the Matter, or the plenty of it, stirring up the Expulsive Faculty. 24 The Causes of Attraction is unnatural heat, Grief, Motion, Rubbing, Consent of Parts. 25 You have the Universal Causes both Internal and External: The Particular follow. The Causes of the Diseases of the Parts, both Similar, Organical, and Common. 1 The Causes of the Diseases of the Similar parts, are either Evident, or Antecedent, and Consequent. 2 Evident are such as make a desperate attempt upon al the Body, and afflict the Spirits, the Humors and Substance of the parts: if they be strong there wil be some quoil to get them out again. 3 Antecedent and Consequent, though they be of another temper and quality; yet they afflict the parts of the Body by Contagion. 4 The Cause of Organical Diseases are, of Conformation, Magnitude, Number, or Place. 5 Of Conformation are the Figures of the Parts, Passages, Cavities, or Superficies. 6 The Figures of the Parts are inverted, either [Page 463](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/283:9?vid=115407) through the fault of the Seed, or Womens Blood in the Womb, or default of the Midwife at the Delivery, or by the fault of the Physitian in giving Physick after the delivery; or by accident, as blood-letting Convuisions &c. 7 The Causes of of the Passages and Cavities are either of too much dilation, or too much straitness. 8 The Causes of Dilation are, either opening Medicines, or the Expulsive Faculty strong, and the Retentive weak. 9 Dilation of the Vessels proceeds either from the plenty, and quantity of Humors, or else from their quality. 10 Diseases of straitness proceed either from Obstruction or Constipation, Contraction, or Compression. 11 The Causes of Superficial Diseases are roughness and smoothness. Of roughness are such things as are sharp, clensing and corroding. Of smoothness, such things as are Glutinous. 12 The Causes of the greatness of the Disease are, either encrease, as plenty of Matter, strength of Nature, Wind, &c. Or decrease, as weakness of the Spirits, defect of Matter, Wounds, Bleeding, Putrefaction. 13 The Causes of accidental Diseases, and their Symptomes, are understood by themselves: [Page 464](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/284:9?vid=115407) but of Compound Diseases by the Causes of the Simple. 14 Thus-much of Aethiologie: Nosologie follows, which is either General, or Special. LIB. VI. Of General Nosologie. 1 GEneral Nosologie is that Art which sheweth the and of Diseases. 2 A Disease is an Affect against Nature, wherby the Actions of the Body are viciated. 3 A Disease is Essential, or Accidental. 4 An Essential Disease is Particular or Common. Particular, are either Similary, Organical, or Dissimilary. 5 Similar, is - 1 A Distemper either Simple, as Hot, Cold, Moist, or Dry: or Compound, as Cold and Moist, Cold and Dry, Hot and Moist, Hot and Dry. - 2 Immoderation of the Matter, as when the Part is either too hard, or too soft, too loose, or too much bound, too thick, or too thin. - 3 A Corruption of the whol Substance, [Page 465](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/285:9?vid=115407)which is either Infectious, or Venemous. 6 An Organical is, either of the Conformation, Number, and Bigness, or Place. 7 A Disease of Conformation is either in the Form, or passages of the Body. 8 A Disease of Bigness, is when the Members of the Body are either bigger or less than they should be. 9 A Disease of the Number, is when the Members are either more or less than they should be. 10 A Disease of the place is, when Members are not in their right places, as in Ruptures and Dislocations. Accidental Diseases. 1 Accidental Diseases are either in respect of Number, or Composition: and both of them are either Singular or Manifold. 2 Singular, is either Simple or Compound. Simple is either by it self, or with company. 3 Manifold, is either Implicite, Joyned, or Disjoyned. 4 Joyned is, when the Effect of one is the Cause of another. 5 Disjoyned are such as lie in parts. 6 Implicite Diseases are, when divers parts conspire together to afflict one Function, as a Pleuresie and an Asthma both afflict the Lungues, [Page 466](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/286:9?vid=115407) and by the Lungues the Breathing. 7 The Substance of some Diseases is like a Tenant at will, quickly removed, the Cause being taken away, as Feavers: Others by tract of time are become Habitual to the Body, as Hectick Feavers. Diseases according to the Place. 1 According to the Place, they are taken either from the Subject, or adjunct. Those which are taken from the Subject are taken either from the Parts, or from the Constitution of Man. Those which are taken from the Adjunct, are taken in respect of the Region and Air. 2 The Diseases of the Body are either Universal or Particular. Universal, as Feavers; or Particular to some parts of the Body, as pain in some particular Member, &c. 3 A Disease, by reason of the Constitution of a Man is taken, - 1 From the Nature of the Man, and so is more familiar to one Complexion than another. - 2 From the Age, and so is most familiar to Child-hood, Youth, Manhood, old age. - 3 From Sex, and so is most familiar to Men or Women. [Page 467](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/287:9?vid=115407)4 In respect of the Region, - 1 Some are scattered up and down here and there, and are called Sporadical. - 2 Others are Common, and are called Pandemical. - 3 Some are proper to one place, as Agues to Fenny Countreys, and are called Endemical. - 4 Others rage at some particular times, and are called Epidemical. Diseases according to Time. 1 They are taken in respect of the Time of the Disease, or the Time of the Yeer. 2 The time of the Disease is taken according to the parts of the Disease, or the Disease it self. 3 The parts of a Disease are, the Beginning, Encrease, Station, and Declination. 4 The Disease it self is to be taken in respect of its Continuing. 5 The Continuing of a Disease is either short, Long, or Chronical. Short is either with danger or without danger: and in both, it is either very Acute, or Acute; and in these, either Symply, or by Degeneration. 6. In respect of the Continuance of it; it is either Continual or Intermitting. 7 In both these consider, their Beginning, Encrease, [Page 468](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/288:9?vid=115407) Station, and Declination. 8 In respect of time, some Diseases are most frequent in the Spring; some in Autumn, some in Summer, some in Winter. Diseases according to Custom. 1 They are taken according to the Nature, or according to the Event of the Disease. According to the Nature, it is either Gentle or Malignant. 2 According to Event, it is either Healthful or deadly, curable, incurable, or threatning relapse. Diseases according to Magnitude. 1 A Disease is either great or smal. 2 A Disease is great, either by it self, or by accident. By it sesf three waies: - 1 In respect of its kind, proper Essence, or Cause. - 2 In-respect of its active Power. - 3 In respect of its ill Conditions, or ill Symptomes A Disease is great by Accident, - 1 In respect of the part afflicted, if that be Noble; as a Disease in the Head is greater than one of the Toe. [Page 469](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/289:9?vid=115407)2 In respect of the Faculty of the Body that is hurt by the Disease; and so deprivation of Sences is greater than the Tooth-ach. Diseases according to Cause. 1 They are caused either Essentially, or according to Consent. 2 Some are inbred, or Hereditary: others not Hereditary, but advantitious. 3 Advantitious are of Blood, Choller, Flegm, Melancholly: and each of these are either Internal, or External. 4 Thus much of Nosologia in the General: the Special follows. 5 Special Nosologie is, that which Numbers up al the special Diseases which afflict Nature. 6 These arise either from Natural Causes, or External. 7 From Natural Causes, are either Universal, which occupy the whol Body as Feavers: Or such as occupy only particular parts of the Body: Of both which in order. [Page 470](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/290:9?vid=115407) LIB. VII. Of Feavers. A Feaver is a heat against Nature, proceeding from the Heart to the rest of the Body. 2 Its Considerations are, - 1 The common Affections, namely the disposition of the Body, and the Signs. - 2 The Differences of the Feavers. 3 The Disposition of the Body is either Internal, or External. Internal in respect of Temperament, Sex, and Age. External in respect of Heat, either of the Fire, Sun, or Bath, drinking Wine, use of Spice, and hot Meats, or heat of Air. 4 The Signs are General as swift Pulse and frequent, heat of Body, and failing of strength. 5 The Differences of Feavers are taken, - 1 From the Quality of the Subject. - 2 From the Quantity. - 3 From the Essence. 6 Feavers from the quality of the Subject are taken, - 1 From the Feeling; as such as come with [Page 471](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/291:9?vid=115407)cold fits at the first, or without cold fits. - 2 From the Sight; as with red high color, or swarthy color. - 3 From the Tast; as such as proceed of salt Flegm. 7 Feavers from the Quantity are either continually great, mean, or but light, short, or long, most violent in the night, or in the day. 8 A Feaver from the Essence of the Subject, is either common to al, as Pestilential Feavers: Or, 9 Proper only to those that keep ill Diet. 10 A Pestilential Feaver is caused by breathing in a Venemous and Malignant Air. 11 The Causes of Feavers properly to be considered are, - 1 Of the Heart; as a Hectick Feaver. - 2 Of the Spirits joyned to the Heart; as one day Feaver. - 3 Of Humors joyned to the Heart; as a continual Feaver. 12 The Degrees of a Hectick Feaver are four: A Consumption - 1 Of the Fat of the Heart. - 2 Of the Moisture between the and the Heart. - 3 Of the strings of the Flesh consuming. - 4 Of the strings of the Flesh consumed, and is called Marasmus: And this is two. fold. - First, Of Cold and Driness, as happens to [Page 462](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/292:9?vid=115407)all people that die with Age. - Secondly, Of Heat and Dryness, which is contrary to Nature, and the disease now mentioned. 13 Feavers that have their Original from the Spirits, are, - 1 One-day Feavers. - 2 Such as last three daies; as Synochus non putrida. - 3 Such as encrease from the beginning to the end, called Achmastica. - 4 Such as decrease from the beginning to the end, called Parachmastica. - 5 Such as stand alwaies at one stay, as . 14 Of the Humors ariseth Synochus, or a continual Feaver, either of Inflamation or Blood, or Blood which is not putrefied: or of Choller which is putrefied. 15 A putrefied Feaver is either Primary, or not Primary. 16 Primary, is either Continual, or Intermitting 17 Continual is, - 1 Without Remission, coming of thick Choller, as a continual burning Feaver. - 2 With Remission, which is ordinate or inordinate; and so you have either a Remitting, Quotidian, Tertian, or Quartan Feaver; which are according [Page 473](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/293:9?vid=115407)as the Chollrer is in heat or thickness. 18 An Intermitting Feaver, which is that we usually call an Ague, proceeds of thin Choller, mixed in smal Veins. Indeed (though my Author do not say so much) the cause of an Ague is Choller within those veins appropriated to the Circulation of Blood. 19 Agues are Simple or Compound. Simple are Quotidian, Tertian, and Quartan, Compound are compounded of them. 20 A not Primary or Symptomatical Feaver ariseth from putrefaction without the Vessels, and is incident only to some particular part. 21 You have the Universal Affects in Feavers: the singular follow, which are either Internal or External.

Pandemical Afflictions. 1 Pandemical or Common Afflictions are such as invade men universally, and they are either Enmical, or Epidemical. Endemical are proper to the Place. Epidemical to the Time. 2 Endemical Diseases by a certain perpetuity, are addicted to certain Places, Regions, and Cities, [Page 493](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/313:9?vid=115407) as Agues to the Fenny Countries in England. 3 Epidemical Diseases rage at some particular times, as Pestilences, smal Pox, &c. LIB. X. Of the Pathologie of Hermetical Phylosophers. 1 IT is of smal Moment, and not worth distinguishing, between the Disease, the Causes, and Symptomes; for the Cause, the Disease, and the Symptomes differ not in property, but only in power and act; as a Physitian that is asleep, differs from one that is awake; and as Sulphur kindled, differs from Sulphur not kindled; and as Salt dissolved, differs from Salt not dissolved; and as Mercury sublimated, differs from Mercury not sublimated. 2 The Roots of Diseases lie hid in the Body; which being in time separated, exalted and kindled, produce the Disease, and change of the Pulse. 3 For in Agues the Root of the Disease is in the Body in the intermission of the fit, though the Heart be not over-heated: Also in Falling-sicknesses the Root of them lies in the Body, though there be a months difference between the fits. 4 Paracelsus teacheth, That a Disease is a Substance, [Page 494](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/314:9?vid=115407) and declares it by an Example; as in the yellow Jaundice, the Center of which is in the Gall, yet it brings no harm to the man while it is in his Center, til it be diffused in the Body among the Blood. 5 Hermetical Phylosophers consider here only two things; namely, the Original of the Disease, and the Difference. 6 The Opinion of Alchymists concerning the Original of Diseases is two-fold: One of the Ancient, and another of the Modern, which latter seems to be the truest. 7 Ancient Hermetical Phylosophers, referred the Original of Diseases to the Seed of them: even as Plants arise from their own seeds; so do also Diseases from their specifical and peculiar seeds in the Body of Man. 8 For as the beginnings of all Natural things proceed from the influential operation of the Srars upon the Seeds; so by reason of the corruption of the Nature of Man, there is contained in his Body, the seeds of al Diseases, which by the influential operation of the Stars in time shew themselves. 9 For to think that Diseases come from the Elements is ridiculous, for both Elements and Elementary Bodies are but the Wombs in which these Seeds are nourished. 10 In seeds is the form of the thing whereof it [Page 495](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/315:9?vid=115407) is a seed, potentially placed; and by power of these, are al actions performed: proceed Tasts, Colors, Heat, Cold, , ; they contain in them, Vital , Hardness, Softness Thickness, Thinness, Roughness, Smoothness, and what not. 11 The Original then of these Seeds of Diseases is this: Although at the first al were created pure, and void of corruption and death; yet after the of our first Parents, the Curse came upon them, and gave them a new Tincture; and so the Seeds of Diseases came as wel into the Body of Man, as Thorns and Thistles on the Earth. 12 The Seeds both of Death and Diseases come thus into Man: The being cursed for the sin of Adam, brought forth many impurities, as Arsenick, , and many other both hot and cold poysons, as Opiats; nay in the purest Creatures there remains so much which is as wel able to hurt, as what is pure in them to help. Living Creatures, as Beasts, &c. live by Plants and Herbs. Man by Beasts, and the Fruits of the Earth: The impurity of which is that which causeth so many several sorts of Diseases to the Body of Man. 13 That there is such a seed of Diseases in Man, may appear by this: Because we find many Diseases to be Hereditary, nay, to continue individually, [Page 496](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/316:9?vid=115407) many times to three or four generations, which could not be unless the Seed of the Disease were inherent in the procreative Vertue. 14 Somtimes Children are troubled with Diseases which were not heeded in their Fathers, as men that never had the Gout, beget Children which in time come to have the Gout; judg the like by the falling-sickness, &c. The Reason is, All Seed must have a time to grow, and the Seed was not come to maturity in the Parent as it is in the Child: Contrary to this; Many times we find that such as have the Gout, beget Children which never have it; and those that have the Falling-sickness the like: The Reason of this is either, - 1 Because the impurity is separated by the strength of the Natural Balsom in the Womb: Or - 2 Because the Root of the Disease is grown old, and able to bear fruit no more. 15 That a Hot, Cold, Moist, or Dry Distemper, or Humors, should be the cause of a Disease, is absolute non-sense to affirm; they are but the Effects, as Heat is the Effect of Life, and not the Cause of it: The Cause of a Disease must be somthing which is real, and endued with a power to produce such Effects. 16 Humors are a certain Fantastical Invention; but imagine there be such things, they cannot produce Diseases. - 1 Because they are not in the . - 2 Because the Humors arise from the Disease, and not the Disease from the Humors. - 3 Because no Humor is either Salt, or Sowr, or hath any other Tast; neither hath it any Salt or Tartar in it: And 'tis a most rediculous piece of non-sense to say Humors are burnt; for bring a Humor to the fire it presently exhales away. [Page 497](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/317:9?vid=115407) 17 The Modern Alchymists derive the Original of all Diseases from these three Principles, Mercury Sulphur, and Sal, because they are endued with Vertues, Faculties, and Properties of al sorts: from whence come infinite Varieties, Tasts, Colors, Smels, by which various kinds of Diseases are bred. 18 They hold the Causes of Diseases to be ten: - 1 Mercurius Pneumosus. - 2 7 Sulphur Coagulatum. - 8 Sal Calcinatus. - 9 Sal Resolutus. - 10 Sal Reverberatus. 19 Pneumosus, is an Aethereal Spirit; the the of [Page 498](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/318:9?vid=115407) the Mover and Guider of Actions; and it is thought to remain in the Ventricles of the Brain: It seems he understands the Animal Spirit by it. This Mercury is somtimes made so thick, that against Nature it is shut up in Skins, in Cavities of the Body; and so being made Material, changeth its name, and is called Wind: It causeth Swellings, Kings Evil, Apostemes of Wind, and whatsoever Disease the Galenists say comes of Wind. 20 Mercurius Cremosus, or Mercury distilled, is the Ark of our Life, the food and nourishment of the other aethereal fire, 'tis true Lac Virginium (that in the Colledges Dispensatory is but a Puppet in a Play) the true Radical Moisture, the Subject of Generation, Sweet, Liquid, Rare, and Penetrating. This Mercury being separated from the power of the former, whether by the solid parts of the Body, or by Food, is somtimes so circled about by ascention and descention, that it Sublimatus, is the acute Spirit of Radical Moisture, quick, penetrating, aerial, subtil, a lively and spiritual substance, and the next instrument of Action: This somtimes waxeth hot, but it doth not burn, and flies up and down, whatsoever it laies hold on, it breaks, and pains, from whence comes , vehement incombustible, hot; 'tis the Leaven of the Body whereby al things are digested: By the Concoction and Digestion of this Spirit (namely, when it is hindred from performing its Function) come al those painful congelations in the exterior parts of the Body, as the Gout, &c. 23 Sulphur congealed, is most pure, white, sweet, moving the Pulse, and distributing the heat throughout the Body: From this Sulphur congealed, arise al inflamations whatsoever, as Quinsie, Pluresies, &c. as also Feavers. 24 Sulphur resolutum, is a moist and soft substance, gently moistening all the parts of the Body: it is ful of Spirit and accomodated to Generation. From this Sulphur, Alchymists derive those sleepy Diseases (not from coldness, as Galenists prate) as Lethargies, Coma, Catalepsis, &c. I wonder in my heart why Galenists should hold these Diseases to come of cold, seeing they confess sleep is caused by a sweet vapor sent up to the Brain. 25 Sulphur coagulatum: From this some Alchymists derive all Fluxes: Others (and those more properly) derive them from Sal. 26 Sal calcinatus, is the Balsom of Life; that firm, fixed, earthy Body, compounding Mercury [Page 500](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/320:9?vid=115407) and Sulphur in one, and making the whol Body solid: From this (if it melt in the Body as somtimes it doth) ariseth Cachexiaes, Dropsies, and al Diseases of Flegm: If Nature can expel it, thence ariseth Sweating. 27 Sal resolutus is a liquid Body, sweet in tast, of a binding faculty, by its pleasantness nourishing and preserving the Body: This is the Necter the Poets said the Gods drunk. If this suffer Congelation, it grows hard, and this is the original of the Gravel and Stone. 28 Sal reverberatus is the general Clenser of Nature: It clenseth the Body of its filth, by opening, cutting, purging, provoking vomit, urine, and sweating, whereby it purgeth and quickeneth the Body: From Tetters, Botches, Boyls, Carbuncles, the French Pox, and the Scurvy, and all Diseases that afflict the Blood. The Differences of Diseases. 1 Of Diseases, some are Simple, some Compound. Compound Diseases the Alchymists stand not much upon; because they are only an impediment of the Actions. 2 The Differences of Simple Diseases, the Ancients laid down not so accurately, but the Modern most accurately. [Page 501](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/321:9?vid=115407)3 Of Diseases, some are from the Seeds, others without the Seeds; for Diseases of the Instruments of Strength, the Figure of the Body, and solution of Unity, as Wounds and the like, cannot arise from the Seeds; but only such as afflict the similar Parts. 4 They hold two kinds of Seeds of Diseases: - 1 Iliastrum: that is when the Seed produceth a Disease, as Pears, Apples, and Nuts, produce their like Trees: Of this Nature are Dropsies, yellow Jaundice, Gouts, &c. - 2 Corruption, as Pestilences, Feavers, Pluresies, &c. 5 They hold five Beings of Diseases. - 1 Immediately from God: as the Pestilence in Davids time. - 2 Influential from the Stars. - 3 Natural: when it happens through default of Nature. - 4 Mental: when it proceeds from the imagination, either of the sick himself, or of some other; under which head, Witchcraft is included. - 5 Venemous: which contains all Poysons, both Natural and Artificial. 6 All Diseases may be divided into these four Heads; to which all other Diseases may be reduced as to their Fountains. - First, The Falling-sickness: to which may be reduced, the Palsie, Convulsions Vertigo, Melancholly, Apoplexy, and fits of the Mother. - Secondly, The Dropsie: to which may be reduced, al Imposthumes, the yellow Jaundice and Cachexia. - Thirdly, The Leprosie: to which may be reduced, al Ulcers. - Fourthly, The Gout: to which may be reduced, the Chollick, Stone, Head-ach, Toothach, &c. [Page 502](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/322:9?vid=115407) 7 Of Diseases, some are Coagulated, others Resolved; for some consist of the impurity of the seeds, the fruits of which turns to Coagulation: others to Resolution. Diseases arising from Coagulation or gnawing in the Stomach. Al Diseases of the Head and Throat: all Diseases that come of parts stopped, as the Chollick, stone, and all difficulties of urine. Diseases of Resolution are, all such as come by opening of those parts of the Body which should be stopped, as Fluxes of all sorts, Running of the Reins, &c. 8 Diseases are two-fold; some proceed from the Food we eat; others from Celestial Influence. First. Those which come by the Food we eat, [Page 503](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/323:9?vid=115407) come by the impurity thereof, which ought to be separated and expelled by the usual waies. But when Nature is not able to administer her Functions as she ought to do the Disease takes Root in the Body, which brings forth fruit in its proper and appointed time. That which causeth these Diseases to take Root is Opportunity; for they search out a place where the Natural Balsom is weak, and the Spirits proper for the nourishing such an untoward Seed: as Hemlock and Henbane grow neer the places where they empty Jakes, and Wormwood neer Iron works, because there both Earth and Air is convenient for them. And then secondly, Such as come by Celestial Influence, take Root in our Bodies by the Air we breath in: for as by the Blessing upon the Creation we receive our nourishment from it; so by the Curse upon the Creation we receive the Causes of Diseases by it: God is as the Sealer, that the Seal, and our Bodies the Wax that receives impression from it. 9 The most exact difference of Diseases is drawn from these three principles, Mercury, Sulphur, and Sal. Of Mercury come all Diseases of sharp and sowr Vapors, Falling-sickness, Apoplexies, Palsies, al kinds of Defluxions and Rhewms, all Malignant and Epidemical Diseases arising either from Poyson or Infection of Air. [Page 504](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/324:9?vid=115407)If Sulphur be immoderate, it causeth of al sorts, , al , Let so man wonder that Feavers and sleepy Diseases should come from one and the same Cause; you admiration wil quickly so soon as you are unchained from Galen, and a little better acquainted with Dr. Reason: for the immoderate of Sack causeth sleep as well though it be extream hot, as the immoderate taking of Hemlock, Poppy, or Henbane, which are extream cold: The Reason is not in the Bodies of the Creatures themselves, but in the Sulphurous quality of them. From Salts all Internal take their Original, as Imposthumes, Ulcers, , Bleeding, Heat, and stoppage of Urine; and according to the kinds of Mercury, Sulphur, and Sal, so are the kinds of Diseases, as we shewed you before. I have now done, after I have told you, That Alchymists by the Seeds and Roots of Diseases, understand nothing but the Causes of them. 10 To this Division pertain al Diseases of Tartar: It is called Tartar, because of that similitude it hath with that Tartar that is found in Wine; because it heats and burns the Body as Tartar doth. Tartar in the Body of Man is a certain Juyce coagulated: This Juyce is taken from our Nourishment [Page 505](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/325:9?vid=115407) by eating Beasts; and it is inherent in the Beasts we eat by eating Herbs. But when in the Microcosm al the internal Faculties work in a due order: This Tartarial matter is separated from the due nourishment, and cast our by Nature. There are two things which cause the retaining of it. - 1 The weakness of the separating, or expulsive Faculty. - 2 The immoderate taking of Food, whereby there is such plenty of it, that the expulsive Faculty is not able to cast it all our and so it lies in the Body, grows thick, and produceth those effects we mentioned before. That we may make this appear the more lucidly, and as cleer as the Sun when he traces over the Nemean Lyons Back, consider the very same things in the Macrocosm. You see in that the Earth is in some places more pure, in others more impure; you see the Water is purer in one place than in another, as every Laundress can tell you, and yet al Water comes from the same Fountain and Original, namely the Sea: You see the divers difference in divers Nations in Corn and Wine, and the divers effects they produce; and therfore what wonder is it that this Tartarial matter being separated principally in the Stomach, should produce [Page 506](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/326:9?vid=115407) such different effects in the Body of Man, as the Stone in one place, and the Gout in another. 11 There are four kinds of Tartars, Viscuous, Bolar, Sandy, and Stony; and one of these contains in it more Salt, another less: Thence it comes to pass that one afflicts the Body with more pain than the other; for the more Salt there is in the Tartar, the greater is the pain: for in Tartar is contained all the species of Salt, which is that which causeth the biting or paining quality of all Minerals and Plants, as common Salt, Allum Vitrial, Salt , Sal gem Sea Water, Aron, Nettles, Ars-smart; and therfore it is no wonder if the differences of Tartarial Diseases be so manifold. 12 The Diseases of the Stomach arise from the impurest parts of the Tartar: for if a Bolar Muccilage which is tough, viscuous, and alluminous, possess the sides of the Tunicle of the Stomach, there ariseth a stoppage of the vital Spirits, which are the Authors of al Natural actions, whereby they being taken Prisoners, they cannot execute their Office in separating the pure Nourishment from the impure; and so the digestion comes to be weak, flow, and as faulty as either. And if these Tartarial Spirits be very strong, they easily overcome the inbred Spirit of Man: If they be mixed with much Salt, they turn into and stone; if pure of themselves, without [Page 507](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/327:9?vid=115407) much Salt, they cause Consumptions and pinings away; if impure, they are changed into another Nature, they turn Antimonial, and cause Vomiting; if Aerial, they cause Corrosions, and Pains, especially in the Stomach; if Vitrial, they cause a Dog-like Hunger, because by the swiftness of their motion they catch and consume what is given for Nourishment: for according to the Opinion of Severinus it is the Spirits that cause Hunger, draw, concoct, and coagulate whatsoever is taken into the Body of Man, which the stronger they are, the more swiftly they perform it; the purer they are, the better they perform it. 13 As for Diseases coming by Celestial Influence, Quercitanus affirms they come through the breathing in of the Air; but if you ask him how the Air comes afflicted, he gives you Ignoramus instead of Billavera. He and Fernelius say, It is a Hidden Matter; 'tis somthing, but they know not what: But Severinus (a man that waded a little deeper than the addle Brains of vulgar Physitians could reach to) in his Book of Celestial Influences, proves, That they come from the several Constitutions of Heaven, the several Influences of Stars arising from the several Conjunctions with the Malevolents. 14 To make all a little plainer in the winding up that so we may be the better understood. The Diseases in Man are three fold. - First, Such as come from Fire and Air, which are the two Elements that generate the Spirit of Man, whence come all Epidemical Diseases, and such as come by the Influence of the Heavens. - Secondly, Such as come of Air and Earth, which two Elements cause the Tartar, and all Diseases which we noted before, to proceed therefrom: of which the Ancient Physitians wrote little, knewless, and practised none. - Thirdly, The Seed of the Parents, which contains in it, - 1 The Course of the Elements, from whence arise al acute Diseases. - 2 The Courses of the seven Planets, from whence come Chronical Diseases, which last as long as the said Course of the Planets remain uncontrouled by others; and this may be known by the Government of the Planets themselves: as the Sun governs the Heart, the Moon the Brain, Saturn the Spleen, Jupiter the , Mars the Gall, Venus the Reins, and Instruments of Generation, and the Lungs: And all Diseases whatsoever keep their Court in one of these places. - 3 The four Courses of the Humors, which Alchymists cal Salts, Cabalists Humors, and so do Galenists for fashion sake. [Page 509](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/329:9?vid=115407)4 The four Courses of the Qualities or Complexions, namely, Heat and Moisture, Cold and Moisture, Heat and Dryness, Cold and Dryness. [Page 508](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/328:9?vid=115407) You have the Theorical part of Medicine: The Practical follows. TOME II. Of Practical Medicine. 1 PRactical Medicine is that which tends to, and endeavors at the end of Medicine, namely, the Health of Man. 2 The Parts of it are, Hygiena, and . You shall have the Interpretation of both words, when you come to the Explanation of them. [Page 510](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/330:9?vid=115407) Tome II. Part I. Of Hygiena. 1 Hrgiena is the first part of Practical Medicine, which teacheth the right use of the six things not Natural, for the preservation of Health. 2 To the causing of Health belongs a good temper of the Similar Parts, a due conformation of the Instrumental Parts; both which are attained by a due use of the six things not Natural. 3 The signification of the word Hygiena, is a defending of Health: it consists chiefly in Diet. Diet belongs both to the Healthful, and to the Sick: in both of them to the Knowledg and Method of using the things not Natural. 4 Things not Natural are in a Medium between things Natural, and those against Nature: For neither do they constitute our Nature, as things Natural do; neither do they afflict it as things against Nature do: being well used they are good, ill used they are bad. 5 The knowledge of things not Natural consists this, - 1 That we know how many they are. - 2 That we know what Efficacy they have. [Page 511](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/331:9?vid=115407) 6 Things not Natural are six. - 1 Air. - 2 Nourishment. - 3 Exercise and Rest. - 4 Affections of the Mind. - 5 Sleeping and Watching. - 6 Fulness and Emptiness: or if you will, Casting out and retaining in. These Galen reduceth to three Heads. - 1 Of taking in: As Nourishment and Air. - 2 Carriage of the Body: As Exercise and Rest; Sleeping and Watching; Affections or Perturbations of Mind. - 3 Casting out: as the Excrements both of the Bowels and Bladder, Sweat, and Seed in Copulation. I. Ayr. 1 Air either preserveth the Body of Man, or changeth it. Wholsom Air preserveth it, unwholsom changeth it. That which preserveth the Body of Man is, - 1 Temperate in the first , namely, Heat, Cold, Driness and Moisture. - 2 Pure: and the more Trees there is, the purer is the Air, because the Leaves of [Page 512](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/332:9?vid=115407)the Trees correct the Air (though my Author leave it out, give me leave to put it in.) - 3 Cleerness of the Air. - 4 Air moved by gentle Winds. - 5 Watered by gentle Showers. 2 The Body of Man is corrupted by the Air two waies. - 1 By Accident. - 2 By itself. - First, By Accident: as corrupted Vapors, Fens, the Propinquity of the Sea, which fils the Body ful of Salt Humors; Jakeses, and stinking Ditches, as also by dead Carkasses. - Secondly, By it self, or its own Distempers, being too Hot, too Cold, too Moist, or too Dry. 3 The Air the Body of Man, - 1 By breathing it in. - 2 By an insensible drawing of it through the Pores of the Skin; and that's the Reason the skins of people of divers Regions, are of divers colors. 4 The Constitution of the Air changeth our Bodies five waies; and by them you may know (if you have but wit enough) how to a Discase by changing of Air. - 1 Consider the Scituation of the Place, whether Hilly, Level, or Fenny. - 2 The of the Earth, whether , [Page 513](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/333:9?vid=115407)or Barren, Woody, or Champion. - 3 The variety of Winds. - 4 The Neerness either of the Sea or Lakes. - 5 The Seasons of the Year. II. Nourishment. 1 Nourishment is that Substance, which encreaseth and Nourisheth our Bodies: and 'tis two-fold. - 1 Properly and truly: such are Nourishments which nourish our Bodies. - 2 Improperly: such are Nourishments which by a Medicinal Vertue alter the failings of the former, and yet notwithstanding nourish too. 2 The Nourishment we take in hurts our Bodies three waies, - 1 In Quantity, when we more than we can digest, and thence comes Crudity. - 2 In Quality, when the Food is too hot, too cold, too moist, too dry; each of which Diseases of its own Nature. - 3 In Substance, when it is of too thick , and this breeds Obstructions, and all the the Diseases coming thereof. III. Exercise and Rest. 1 , is a laborious Motion of the Body, [Page 514](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/334:9?vid=115407) altering both the breath and pulse in respect of Motion. 2 Exercise is either General, or Particular. General is of the whol Body, which either helpeth or hurteth. 3 Exercise helpeth when 'tis Moderate: and it helpeth thus, - 1 It makes the Body strong. - 2 It encreaseth Natural Heat. - 3 It moves the Spirits, whereby the Vapors and Excrements pass through the Pores by Insensible Transpiration. 4 Too much Exercise , because it Distempers, or Solution of Unity. 5 Particular Exercise is of some of the Parts; as Running to the Feet, Singing to the Breast, and Fighting to the Arms. 6 Rest, either profiteth or hurteth. It profiteth, - 1 When 'tis Temperate, for that recollects the tired Spirits. - 2 When it follow Moderate Exercise. 7 Too much Rest hurteth, - 1 It causeth cold Diseases. - 2 Hinders the expulsion of the Excrements. - 3 Duls Natural Heat. - 4 the Digestion of the Food. [Page 415](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/335:9?vid=115407) IV. Sleeping and Watching. 1 Sleep profiteth and hurteth. It profiteth, - 1 Because it recruiteth the tired strength of the Body. - 2 It rallies the scattered Spirits. - 3 It cals back the heat to the inward parts. - 4 It helps Digestion. - 5 It routs Care from the Heart. - 6 It settles a mutinous and troubled Mind. - 7 It recruits a dry Constitution with Moisture. 2 Immoderate Sleep hurts, - 1 Because it duls the Spirits, and makes them . - 2 Makes dul Wits, and bad Memories. - 3 Procures abundance of crude Humors. - 4 Spoils Natural Heat. 3 Watchings either profit or hinder. If they be moderate, they profit: For, - 1 They quicken the Spirits and Sences. - 2 They distribute the heat into the parts of the body. - 3 Helps to expel the Excrements, 4 Immoderate Watching hurts; - 1 Scatters the Animal Spirits. - 2 It dries the Body, especially the Brain. [Page 516](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/336:9?vid=115407)3 It encreaseth Choller. - 4 It's the Cause of hot Diseases. V. Affections of the Mind. 1 Of Affections of the Mind, some tend to Health, as moderate Ioy, and Content of Mind. Some hurt all Perturbations of the Mind whatsoever. To name some of them; - 1 which heats blood and spirits, stirs up the Humors, sets all the Body in a hubbub, and ingenders Feavers. - 2 Immoderate Joy: which sends all the Spirits to the External parts of the Body, and leaves the Principal unguarded. - 3 Fear; which cals all the Spirits inwards, and leaves the outward parts unguarded. - 4 Sadness: which consumes the Spirits by piece-meals, causeth , and thereby hinders Concoction is this all the mischief doth, for it dries the Body, and fils it as ful of Melanoholly, as an Egg is full of meat. VI. Fulness and Emptiness. I think that which Physitians vulgarly translate Fulness and , might better be translated Casting , and Keeping in: or if you will have [Page 517](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/337:9?vid=115407) me spit a few Scholastical Phrases, Excretion and Retention. - 1 It is an excellent good principle when people cast out what should be cast out, and retain what should be retained; and perform them both in a due manner. - 2 When such things are retained as ought to be cast out, imagine Urine, Dung, Spittle, the Menstruis, it hurts. - 3 When such things are out which ought to be retained, as immoderate Bleeding, immoderate flowing of the Menstruis, it can do no good. Thus you have the things not Natural: It follows now that we shew you a Method how to use them, that so we may not seem like Pharaohs Task-masters, set you to make Bricks, and not give you straw. The Vse of things not Natural preserving Health. 1 a common Rule that we should use a Mediocrity in al things not Natural; and have a special regard to former Customs. 2 The Use of the Air, is according to its Substance, and Quality. According to its Substance, it ought to be pure, clear, thin, and open. 3 According to its Quality it ought to be according to the Nature and Complexion of the [Page 518](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/338:9?vid=115407) Party; And therefore as the Eternal and only Wise God hath ordered the differences of Airs in this Nation: so hath he ordered differences of Complexions in men suitable to it. 4 Of Nourishments: The Substance, Quantity, Quality, Time and Manner of administring diligently to be heeded; al which are to be to the Complexion of the Eater, and the strength of his Nature. 5 The Rule of Quantity is this; That the strength of the Body may be refreshed, and not oppressed. 6 The Rule of Quality is taken from the Nature of the Food: the Nature, Custom, and Pallat of the Eater: the season of the Yeer: the Climate, and the Position of the Heavens. 7 The time of giving it is, the accustomed times of eating, and when hunger cals for it. 8 The use of Motion and Rest, Sleeping and Watching, and Affections of the Mind; consists in Manner and Time. 9 The use of Excretion or Evacuation is various. 10 Evacuation is either Natural or Artificial, Universal or particular. 11 Universal Evacuation is Purging, Vomiting, , Bleeding by , by the , or by Horse-Leeches, or by the Menstruis, Bathing, Sweating, Pissing. [Page 519](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/339:9?vid=115407)12 Particular Evacuation are of the several Parts. The Vse of things not Natural in Diseases. 1 The first thing that here comes to be heeded is, That you have a special care such things not Natural be used, as are contrary to the Disease, and its Cause. 2 Although a Physitian ought to have a special care of al six of them; yet amongst them all. Nourishment seems to bear away the Bell. And, 3 In Nourishment have a care of the five things we told you of before, viz. Its Substance, Quantity, Quality, Time, and Manner of giving. 4 As concerning the Substance of the Nourishment, note, That so much as Nature is employed in overcoming the Cause of the Disease, so much slenderer ought the Diet to be; because Nature when she employs much of her strength in opposing the Disease, is not so wel able to mind a hard digestion: Also the acuter a Disease is, let the Diet be the slenderer. 5 The Quality of the Nourishment, let it be such as strengthens Nature, and opposeth the cause of the Disease: And is to be considered, - 1 According to Custom. [Page 520](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/340:9?vid=115407)2 According to the Disease. - 3 According to the Natural Constitution of the Body. 6 As for the Time of eating, regard must be had to the Custom of the Party when he was in Health: only take this Caution, In intermitting Diseases, give no food in the time of the , unless urgent necessity, or failing of strength cal for it. 7 Thus much of the first part of Practical Medicine, called Hygiena: the second part follows, which is called Therapeutica. Tome II. Part II. Of the Proper Practical Part of Medicine, called Therapeutica. THerapeutica, is that part of Medicine which teacheth the Art of curing Diseases: For the Art of Medicine is three-fold: To , to Preserve, and to Cure; therfore the Operations of Medicine must needs be three-fold also; Conserving, Preserving, and Curing. 2 The Efficient Causes of these Operations are, Nature and Art. The Instrumental Causes by [Page 521](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/341:9?vid=115407) which these Operations are performed are, such are to Nature, and coutrary to the Disease. The manner of acting this is, quickly, safely, . 3 The way and manner of finding out matters of Help, fold: - 1 The Method by Indication. 4 then is either General or Special. General is performed by the Method of ring: the Special by . LIB. I. Of the Method of Curing. 1 THe Method of Curing is a General way, common to every Particular, shewing by Intention and Indication the way of Cure for every Disease. 2 Its parts are two, Intention and Indication. 3 Intention, is that Scope which a Physitian propounds to himself, when he undertakes a Cure; the parts of which are Eight. - First, Whether it be to be done, yea or no. - Secondly, What is to be done, whether Alteration, Purging, or Restoring. [Page 522](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/342:9?vid=115407)Thirdly, By what Remedies, it is to be done: whether by Cooling Heating Purging, or the like: and whether by Liquid or Solid Romedies. - Fourthly, How much is to be done: whether much or little, in what Measure or Degree. - Fifthly, In what Manner it is to be done: whether by Degrees, or Speedily; whether continually, or by intermission. - Sixthly, At what time it is to be done: whether in the beginning, encrease, or state of the Disease. - Seventhly, In what Order; what's to be given in the first place, what in the second, what in the third: what is to be given alone by it self, and what with other things. - Eightly, In what place, and in what manner. General Indications. 1 Indications are to be considered Generally, and Specially. 2 General Indications, according to the mind of , are Sixteen: - 1 From the Disease, which lies in the Body and calls for its Cure. - 2 From the Temperature of the whol Body. - 3 From the part of the Body afflicted by the Disease. [Page 523](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/343:9?vid=115407)4 From the strength of the Patient. - 5 From the Air the Patient is in. - 6 From his Age. - 7 From his Custom. - 8 From his peculiar Nature. - 9 From the Sex of the Patient. - 10 From the Exercise which he used. - 11 From the length, or shortness of the Disease. - 12 From the four seasons of a Disease, namely, the beginning, encrease, station, and Declination. - 13 From the particular fits of the Disease. - 14 From the ordinary Functions of Nature, - 15 From the strength of the Medicine. - 16 From the influence of the Stars. 3 Special Indication is either Physical, or Mathematical. Physical Indication. 1 Physical Indications are, Parts declaring, and parts declared. 2 The Part declaring is somthing observed in the Body, either according to Nature, or else against Nature. 3 It is either Primary, or Secundary. 4 Primary is three-fold: The Disease; the Cause of the Disease; and the Faculties. [Page 524](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/344:9?vid=115407)These may be thus distinguished. - 1 It sheweth, what the Disease is, by means it came, and whether it may be cured. - 2 The Symptomes which are proper and peculiar, namely, the and Form of the part afflicted; and the Disease afflicting. 5 Secundary is, - 1 That which is joyned to the Indication, that which shews that from whence the Indication is drawn. - 2 The Knowledg of what hinders Indication. - 3 The knowledg of what opposeth it. 6 Parts declaring shew, how much, how, when, in what order, by what place and way you must act. 7 How much, shews the Natural Temper of the Body, as also of the part afflicted, and compares them with the greatness of the Disease, and the Scituation of the part. 8 How, shews the strength of the sick Body, and the strength of the part afflicted. 9 At what time, hath a double signification, - 1 Of things present, which require remedy. - 2 Of things absent, which require prevention. 10 In what order, shews either that which regards [Page 525](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/345:9?vid=115407) the Efficient Cause or that which occasion calls for: for many times the violence of the Effect must be remedied before the Cause can be medled with. 11 The Place, and by what Way; the Figure and Scituation of the place declares. 12 Parts declared, are they which help those declaring. 13 They are either Primary or Secundary. 14 Primary is three-fold: Preservative, Curative, and . 15 Indication Preservative, shews the Antecedent Cause of a Disease, which must be taken away by its contrary. 16 Preservative Indication is taken, - 1 From the Internal or Antecedent Cause. - 2 From the Substance of the Matter offending. - 3 From the Quality of the abounding Humor. - 4 From the Motion of the Peceant Humor. 17 From the Motion of the Peccant Humor is a four-fold Remedy indicated. Viz. - First, : which is done divers waies: Viz. By Bleeding, Cupping Glasses, Rubbing of the opposite part, Binding, Hot Baths, Clysters, Blisters, &c. - Secondly, Intercepting Medicines, which stop [Page 526](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/346:9?vid=115407)the Passages, that the Humor cannot come to the afflicted place, whence they are called Defensive, and to be given in the intervalles of the fit. - Thirdly, Such as draw the Humors from the part afflicted, to another part. - Fourthly, Such as Repress, and Repel the Humor, as al Binding Medicines. 18 The Curative Indications of a Disease are such as are remedied by contraries. 19 It is either Simple, which is the Indication of a Simple Disease: Or Compound, which is the Indication of a Compound Disease. 20 An Indication of a Simple Distemper is, Cold of a hot Disease; Heat of a cold Disease; Driness of a moist Disease; Moisture of a dry Disease; Hardness of a soft Disease; Softness of a hard Disease; Antidotes, and Counter-poysons to Venemous, Pestilential, and Contagious Diseases. 21 Indications of an evil Composition, is Reduction; as making strait, crooked things; making rough, such things as are smooth; and smooth, such things as are rough; lessening and encreasing Members, &c. 22 Conservative Indication is maintaining things by their likes. 23 The Foundation of Medicine lies in this, To preserve things by their likes, and take away things by their contraries. [Page 527](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/347:9?vid=115407) Mathematical Indications. 1 Mathematical Indications are taken from the change of the Celestial Bodies; which by their Benevolent, or Malevolent Intercourse, work alterations in our Bodies: Therefore Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna, all harp'd upon the same string, That whosoever was a Physitian, must needs be an Astrologer. 2 This Indication consists in the conservation of Health, in the seasonable application of a Medicine, and in the opening of a vein. 3 Medicines are unseasonably applied. - 1 In very hot, or very cold times. - 2 The giving of Medicines ought to be avoided, at the rising, or setting of hot Stars, either Cosmically, or Heliacally. Such are, , Cor Leonus, both the Dog Stars, and Hercules. - 3 They are to be avoided when the Malevolents are Aspected one to another, or to the Moon. - 4 Take no purging Medicines when the Moon is in Signs ruminating, or in the Forms of such Beasts as chew the Cud, namely, Aries, Taurus, and Capricorn, because then they are easily vomited up again. - 5 When the Moon is Aspected to Jupiter, [Page 528](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/348:9?vid=115407)Nature is so strengthened, that the operation of the Medicine is hindred. - 6 The Moon in the ascending part of the Circle, cals the Humors upwards; and so easily provoketh Vomiting, but hinders Purging by stool. 4 The unseasonable breathing of a Vein wonderfully weakens Nature, and brings exceeding much danger to the Body of Man. 5 Hinderanees to Bleeding are, - 1 Immoderate Heat and Cold; for Nature is rather to be cherished than weakned at such times, and Bleeding weakens the Natural Sprits. - 2 The Moon being in the Sign governing the Member you bleed. - 3 The Moon in Conjunction, Square, or Opposition with the Sun, Saturn, or Mars; or with the Dragons Head, or . - 4 The Moon in Signs Attractive, as , Leo, and Sagittarius. The Method of Cure, according to the Opinion of Hermetical Phylosophers. 1 As long as the Radical Moisture remains in its Quantity, no Disease is felt. 2 There is but one common Mummy of all Men, and but one Vital Spirit, therefore a Medicine may be Universal: For all Diseases are nothing [Page 529](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/349:9?vid=115407) else, but the Function of the Mummy and Vital Spirit hindered. 3 The Cure of Diseases is either Universal or Particular. Universal is the taking away the Roots of it, or the impurity which causeth the Disease either, - 1 Derived from the Seed of the Parents. - 2 Through fault, or ill use of Nourishment. - 3 Through External Impression. 4 The Subjects of Universal Cure, is the four kinds of Diseases, to which all the rest may be referred, as to their proper Fountains and Principles, viz. -, Dropsie, Leprosie, Gout: He that can cure these, wil easily cure all the other Diseases incident to the Body of Man. 5 Universal Cure, may be perfected by an Universal Medicine, or Remedy agreeable to Mans Natural Balsom. 6 Universal Medicine is nothing else than a Medicine which by strengthening Nature expels all the Diseases thereof. 7 It is called Quintessence, Balsom, Natural Spirit, Vital Principle Mercury, Mummy, Elixar Sulphur, A Secret, Sol, an Aethereal Spirit diffused through all Natural things; the Fountain of Heat and Vigor, quickning Animals, making Vegetables grow, and forming Minerals and Mettals in the Earth. 8 The same Quintessence is in the Body of [Page 530](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/350:9?vid=115407) Man, and although it keep its Court in the Heart, yet it is diffused through the whol Body, and produceth divers actions, according to the diversity of the parts. For Example. In the Sensitive parts it produceth Sence: In the Movable parts, Motion; and in the Stomach it concocts the Food into Chyle. 9 If any Disease like an Enemy assault the Body, it rallies up its forces to oppose it, gives it Battel upon the Critical daies, and if it can overcome it, it triumphs over it. 10 Therfore this Spirit and Quintessence being produced from the Macrocosm, and taken into the Body: That which is Natural in the Body being strengthened with these Axilliary Forces so stoutly opposeth any Disease, that it quickly routs it, and expels whatsoever is vicious out of the Body. 11 Concerning this Universal Medicine, I find three Opinions among Authors: - First, Some hold, That it doth it not by a Primary, but by a Secundary way, namely, as it strengthens Nature, for if Nature, or that Natural Balsom of a Man be strengthened by an Universal Medicine, it soon shews its power in all the parts of the Body, and leaves not so much as the very Tincture of a Disease, because it labors to preserve it self. - Secondly, Severinus attributes a power to the Universal Medicine, not only to strengthen the [Page 531](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/351:9?vid=115407)Natural Balsom and Spirits, but also by the purity, and its purifying of Nature, to take away all Causes and Seeds of Diseases whatsoever. - Thirdly, Wolfgangus attributes these effects to the Universal Medicine, That it so disposeth al evil humors of what quality or malignity soever they are, or by what name soever they are called, that it resisteth no Medicine which after the Vulgar Method is given for them; but stoutly joyns forces with it to help it to perform its Office; and removes al impediments which lie in the way; yea, so powerful it is in its operation, that it can be hindred by nothing, but by the express will of the Creator. The Cure of particular Diseases. 1 In a Disease the Roots and Seminary Tinctures are not alwaies first to be taken away, but oftentimes the Fruits, Symptomes, Fits, and Pains are first to be mitigated: as an Aspiring man is somtimes to be staved from his Throne, before he is to be taken out of the World: So a Disease is somtimes to be kept from coming to his Exaltation, before he be thrown out of his House, viz. the Body of Man: that so those parts of the Body which he hath weakned, may be strengthened. 2 Be the Dsease what it wil, let your care be greater to fortifie the spirits than to overcome the Disease. [Page 532](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/352:9?vid=115407)3 Particular Diseases are expelled. - First, By helping Nature with such Remedies as expel the Disease, as Vomits, Purges, Medicines which provoke Urine and Sweating, Medicines which strengthen, case pain, and please the Brain with sweet Smels. - Secondly, Specifical Remedies appropriated to certain parts of the Body: as Ceptralick Remedies in Diseases of the Head; Ocular Remedies in Diseases of the Eyes; Cordial Remedies in Diseases of the Heart Feavers, and Pestilences; Pectorals in Diseases of the Breast; Stomachicals in Diseases of the Stomach; and so likewise in all Diseases, to have a special care of the Parts of the Body they afflict. 4 In Diseases which afflict the whol Body generally, and yet have their special fixed Roots, as have most and Consumptions, be sure you strengthen Nature first, and if she want help, help her afterwards. 5 If the impurity of the Disease be violent, as happens usually in Feavers and Inflamations, you will make mad work if first you go to purge it out: Concoct it first by Medicines, and bring it into better manners, and when you have altered the property of it, then you may safely purge it out. 6 Radical Impurities are removed by Resolution, not by Concoction as in Chronical Diseases, [Page 533](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/353:9?vid=115407) as in of Tartar, as Dropsie Leprosie, &c. If you look to cure these by Concoction, you may look till your Eyes drop out of your Head. The God of Nature hath left in Nature certain Remedies which speedily cure them by Resolution, Consumption, and Destruction; and these, Physitians (which build their Faith upon Galen, and not upon the God of Nature) call Properties. 7 The Effects of some fits, namely, when they cause much heat of Blood, must be remedied by Concoction. 8 In all Chronical Diseases, as also in some Acute. First, he sure the Patient go to stool wel, before you administer other Remedies; that so Nature may have a passage to expel her Enemy by, when you help her to expel him. 9 The Disease being expelled, and the Party cured, strengthen that part of the Body which was weakned by the Disease. 10 Chymical Medicines are so to be prepared that they weaken not Nature her self, as well as the offending Matter. You have the General Therapeutical part in the Method of Physick: the Special follows. [Page 534](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/354:9?vid=115407) LIB. II. Of both General, and Special Evacuation. 1 EVacuation is either of Plethora, or Cacochymia. 2 Evacuation of Plethora is either flow sensible. 3 Slow, is done either by slender Diet and Labor, and the right use of the six things not Natural. 4 Sensible is either Chyrurgical, or Pharmaceutical. Chyrurgical Evacuation. 1 Consists in Blood-letting, , and the use of Horse-Leeches. 2 The Parts of Chyrurgy are two: - 1 Chyrurgical Administrations. - 2 Chyrurgical Instruments. 3 Its Administrations are to be considered, as necessary to Life, or to Safety. 4 The way of administring is according to the , and of the places afflicted with the Discase. 5 The Instruments which a Chyrurgion ought [Page 535](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/355:9?vid=115407) to use, ought to be fitted to his Operations, both Manual, and Medicinal. The Evacuation of Cacochymia. 1 It is either Universal or Particular; of which, the Universal ought alwaies first to be used: The Particular are, Purges, Vomits, Provocation of Urine, and Sweating. 2 Purges are either weak or strong; and are divided into Electuaries, Pills, Pouders, and Potions; of which, some are Universal which take away the whol Cacochymia. 3 Vomits, are such as provoke vomiting; which are either Simple, as the drinking of warm Water; or Mixed. 4 Diureticks are such, which provoke Urine, and break the stone. 5 Medicines which provoke Sweat, are such Simples or Compounds as resist the French , and other Diseases which come of Flegm and Melancholly, as China, Sarsaparilla, Box, and Guajacum, and the Decoctions, or Compositions of them. 6 Particular Evacuation of Cacochymia is, that which is done by Purges, appropriated to certain parts of the Body, both Internal and External. 7 Internal parts of the Body, are. - 1 The Head, as Sneezings, Mouth Waters, [Page 536](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/356:9?vid=115407)and such particular Medicines as purge the Head. - 2 The Breast and Lungs, by Pectorals and Lohochs. - 3 The Stomach, by Vomits. - 4 The Bowels, by Purges and Clisters. - 5 The Womb, by Pessaries and Injections. 8 The External parts are from Cacochymia, by Sweating, Blisters, and Causticks. LIB. III. Of Medicaments. 1 WHatsoever changeth our Body, and bringeth it from a not Natural, to a state Natural, is Medicament. 2 In Medicaments are to be considered their Differences and Operations. 3 As Nourishment, so Remedies are three-fold, - 1 Such as are Nourishing, which encrease, restore, and refresh our Bodies. - 2 Such as are venemous and spoil our Bodies. - 3 Such as perform both, according as they are used. 4 Of Medicines, some conduce to the Health, [Page 537](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/357:9?vid=115407) others to the addorning of the body. 5. Such as belong to , do it either by Nature or by Art. 6. Such as doe it by Nature, need but little preparation of the Artificer and are taken from Vegetables, Minerals, and living creatures. 7. From Vegetables, are taken either whol bodyes, or Parts of them, as Roots, Woods, Pith, Bark, Leaves, Tops, Flowers, Seeds, Fruts, Juyces, Gumme, Rosen, Liquors, Oyls. &c. 8. From living Creatures are taken either their whole bodyes or parts of them, as Hornes, Marrow, Flesh, &c. Or what they ingender, as Milk, Eggs, &c. Or what they labor for, as Hony, Wax, &c. Or their Excrements, as Vrine, Dung, Gal, &c. 9. Medicines taken from Mineralls are either proper or improper. - First, Proper, as Sulphur, Antimony, Vitriol, and Mettals, which are no less than seven, nor no more, viz. Gold, Silver, Lead, Tinne, Iron, Copper, Quicksilver. - Secondly, Improper as. - 1. Earths, as Terra Lemna, , Bole Armoniack. - 2. Stones, more pretious and less preti ous. - 3. Salts. - 4. Iuyces made thick. [Page 538](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/358:9?vid=115407)The of all these you may find before in our Vertual Anatomy. 10. Such medicines are called Compounds, when many Ingredients are mixed to make up one Medicine: And this is the glory of the Apothecary. 11. The art of an Apothecarie consists in composition and preparation of medicine. 12, This is either common or Alchymical; Both of them either Generall or Special. LIB. IV. Of the Generall Composition of Medicine. 1. IN the Composition of a Medicine are requiered, the thing to be composed and the choyce of it. The thing to be composed is either more or less Principal. 2. The Principal is the from which the Medicine takes his denomination; as takes its name from the Herb which is in it: And this is first found out by Indications. 3. Less is, Those which are mixed with the Basis to make up the Medicine: And it consists of Two Parts, either Mixture Preparation. [Page 539](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/359:9?vid=115407)4. There are required in Composition of Medicines, - 1 Correctives. If the Basis of the Medicine be stronger than it ought to be. - 2 Helpers. If they be weaker, thicker, slower than it ought to be. - 3 Directors. Which are appropriated to some certain part of the Body. - 4 Such things as are appropriated to keep the Medicines from putrifaction, as Honey, Sugar, &c. 5. The Requisites of a Composition are Three, Quantity, Measure, and Quid pro quo. 6. You have the General Composition; The Preparation follows. The Opinion of Hermetical Phylosophers, concerning Composition. 1 The Causes of Composing Medicines which Galenists affirm, Alchymists do altogether reject. 2 There is no Disease but hath his own proper and peculiar Medicine and Remedy: and every place furnisheth you with Simples enough for its Cure. Ergo. A Multiplicity of huge Compositions is altogether needless. 3 The Malignant Quality of Medicines is no [Page 540](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/360:9?vid=115407) way lessened by their Corrigents, but increased: As also, That the weakness of a Purge may be amended by stronger Purges, wants Experience to prove it. Ergo. The Malignity of the Medicine, (whether it be too weak, or too strong) needs no correction: seeing the mglignity may be taken away by the Art of an Alchymist, and what is pure, remain. 4 You need no attenuating Medicines, for if they be rightly prepared by the Art of the Alchymists, they will be thin and penetrating enough. 5 You need no strengthning Medicines, for if the ill Properties of the Medicine be taken away, nothing will remain but what is good: and what is good is strengthning. 6 You need not compose Medicines to make them endure, for it is the ill Properties of them which makes them to corrupt, which are taken away by the Alchymists. 7 You need ad nothing to make them have a Pleasant taste, for all Chymical Preparations are pleasant. [Page 541](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/361:9?vid=115407) LIB. V. Of the Common of preparing Medicines by the Art of the Apothecary. 1 IN the Preparations of Medicines are to be considered, The Cause and Effect. The Cause is either Efficient, or Final. 2 The Efficient Cause is either Active or Instrumental. Active, is either Primary, as God and Nature: Or Secondary, as the Apothecary. 3 The Apothecary acteth by Heating, Insolation, Cooling, Quenching, Nourishing, Infusion, Melting, Dissolving, making salt, colouring, perfuming, preserving, cutting, clipping, filing, rasping, washing, beating, rubbing, scraping, pressing, straining, boyling, putrifying, sifting, Extracting, scumming, clarifying, distilling by Asconsion, and 4 The Instruments of an Apothecary, are, Stills, Mortars, Knives, Shears, &c. 5 The End is double, - 1 The Preservation of Health, and restoring it being lost. [Page 542](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/362:9?vid=115407)2 The Preservation of Beauty, and restoring it being lost. 6 The Effects consists in the Remedies prepared; which is, - 1 In the Substance. - 2 In the Adjuncts: As the Form, Order, Time of during, and Shop they are kept in. 7 From the manner of the Substance, Compound Medicines, are some for Health, some for Ornament. Those which regard Health, are either taken inwardly, or applyed outwardly. The Method of Curing, is, First to take away the Cause, Afterwards to correct the Symptomes. 8 Such as are taken inward, are some Fluid, and some not fluid. Such as are Fluid, are either more or less Fluid. 9 Such as are more Fluid, are Waters, Wines, Decoctions, , Vinegars. Less Fluid, are Syrups, Julips, &c. 10 Such as are not Fluid, are either Moist or Dry. Such as are Moist, are Balsoms, Electuaries, Conserves, Preserves, Lohochs, Rob, Muccilages, Extracts. 11 Such Dry, are Pills, Lozenges, Troches, Powders, &c. [Page 543](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/363:9?vid=115407)12 Bathes, Cataplasmes, and Plaisters, &c. 13 Such Medicines as either preserve or restore Beauty, are either Moist or Dry, &c. LIB. VI. Of the Chymical Preparation of Medicines. 1 ALchymy is an Art perfecting Medicines, reducing pure Essences from mixt Bodies, That so the may be the purer, healthfuller, and safer. 2 The Object of Alchymy is a mixt Body, which is Dissolvable, and subject to . 3 Mixt Bodies are of Three kinds, - 1 All kind of Plants, and all their Parts, as Roots, Barks, Branches, Flowers, Leavs, Fruits, Seeds, Gums, Rozins, &c. - 2 The Seven Mettals. All Minerals and Stones both Precious and not Precious, Salts, and Juyces. - 3 Living Creatures either whole or their Parts, or that which comes of them, as Milk, Egs, and Cheese. [Page 544](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/364:9?vid=115407)4 In Alchymy is to be considered the Signification of the Words and Medicines, and the preparation of them. 5 In the Preparation we are to consider the Composition and Preparation it self. Of the Composition or Mixture of Medicines, we have told you before, what Opinion Alchymists have. The Requisites of Composition are Measure and Dose. 6 In Preparation consider the Cause and Effect. The Cause is Efficient or Final. The Efficient is acting or helping: Acting is the Alchymist, who acteth by Solution and Coagulation. 7. The Parts of Chymycal Operation are two, Solution and Coagulation, or if you please, Corruption and Generation. 8 Solution is the First part of Practical Alchymy, which takes a part the Compositions of Medicines, and attenuates them. 9 It consists in Calcination, or Dissolution. Calcination is done by Corroding or Burning. 10 Burning is done either by Combustion or Reverberation, Combustion is turning into ashes, or into Glass: Reverberation is either shut or open, which is done by the Fire of the Furnace. 11 Dissolution is when Bodies are dissolved; and it is either Subtil or Microcronical, Microcronical, is either Elevation or Descention. Elevation is Dry or Moist. Dry is called Sublimation, Moist Distillation. 12 Distillation, is either Right or Oblique. 13 Descension, is either Cold or Hot. Hot is that which is usually called Distillation by Descention. Cold Descention is either Deliquium or Filtration. All things that are dissolved by Cold, are coagulated by Heat. 14 Macrocronical, is Exaltation or Digestion. Exaltation is Circulation and Ablution. Ablution is Imbibition or Cohobation. 15 Digestion is either Putrefaction or Extraction. Putrefaction is to change the old Nature of a thing into a new. 16 Fusion, or Liquefaction is Simple, or not Simple, and performs its Office either by Ashes or Antimony. 17 Coagulation is the second part of Alchymy, which by privation of Moisture, reduceth moist Bodies into Solid. 18 It is Cold or Hot. To Coagulation is referred Fermentation and Fixing. 19 You have the Efficient Cause acting: The Helping follows, viz. Place and Fire. 20 The Place, or the Subject of the Matter is, either that which receives the vessels, as a Furnace: [Page 546](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/366:9?vid=115407) Or that which receives the Matter as vessels. 21 In the Furnace are to be considered the Parts and Differences. The Parts of a Furnace are four. 22 The Differences of Furnaces are various, according to their different Uses; of which, some are open, some shut. 23 Such as are open, are called either, Probatorius, Domesticus, or . 24 A shut Furnace, is either Simple or Compound. Simple is either for Calcination, or Dissolution. For Calcination is either Cementatory, or Reverberatory. 25 Dissolving is either by Ascention or Descention. By Ascention is either Dry or Moist. By Descention is that where by we dissolve the Matter by driving the moisture downwards. 26 Compound Furnaces are, - First, : which is also called Phylosophicus, and Arcanus. - Secondly, : where, by one fire, and little labor, divers Furnace are cherished. Others called Piger Henricus. 27 To these are added Instruments which Alchymists use, as Iron Tongs, Iron Plates, Bellows, &c. [Page 547](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/367:9?vid=115407)28 You have the Subject receiving the Vessels into it: The Vessels which receive the Matter follow. 29 Of the Vessels, some are put to the fire, some are not. Those which are put to the fire, are either made of one Matter, or else of divers. 30 Vessels made of one matter, are either of Glass, or Mineral. 31 Of Glass, is either a Phial, or Circulatorium. Glasses are used in Solutions and Coagulations. 32 The Circulatoria are of divers kinds; of which, three bear away the Bell: A , , and the Phylosophical, or Hermetical Egg. 33 A Mineral vessel, is either Mettal or Earth. Mettal serves either for Subtillation or Infusion. For Subtillation is made either of Brass or Bladder: For Infusion is a Funnel. 34 Earthen Vessels contain either the Matter it self, or other vessels. 35 They which contain the Matter it self, are either Fusory, or not Fusory. 36 Those which contain other vessels are, Kettles, Cauldrons, Earthen Pans, Crocks, Trevets. 37 Vessels which are chosen according to the pleasure of the Workman, are made of Earth, Glass, Mettals, &c. Some of these are Superior, [Page 548](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A56500.0001.001/368:9?vid=115407) some Inferior. Superior, as Alembicks: Inferior, as Retorts, &c. 38 You have the Instruments, and the Place: Heat and Fire follows. 39 Heat is Natural, or Artificial. Natural is by the Beams of the Sun. 40 Artificial is Simple or Mixed: Simple is by Digestion, or Separation. 41 Digestion is by Anthannor, or Horsedung, or Hay, or Straw. 42 Heat separated is either gentle or strong. Gentle is of a Bladder or Ashes. Strong is either Impedited or Free. Impedited is of Sand, Filings of Iron. 43 Free heat is of Coals, either with flame, without flame, or Reverberatory. 44 A mixt heat is that which serves both for digestion and separation; and is called a Bath. Baths are two sold: Balneum Mariae, and Balneum Roris: namely, when the Vessel is heated by the Ascending Vapor. 45 You have the Efficient Cause. The final Cause of Preparation is, The preservation of Health, and other uses belonging to the Life and Ornament of Man. 46 You have the Cause: The Effects follow; which consists in the Order of preparing Medicines, and their application to Dileases. 47 From the Substance, some Chymical Medicines conduce to Health, others to Ornament: Such as conduce to Health, are either fluid or not fluid. Fluid are, Waters, Spirits, Tinctures, Oyls, and Quintessences, &c. Such as are not fluid are, Sublimates, , Glasses, Regulus, and Chymical Pouders, &c. 48 To my God alone in Trinity and Unity, be all Honor and Praise, for ever and "}
