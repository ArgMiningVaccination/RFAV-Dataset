In 1989 an HIV-positive patient who had undergone allogeneic (nonself) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)\u2014a procedure that entails the exchange of a patient's blood-forming cells for those from a donor\u2014for [lymphoma](https://www.britannica.com/science/lymphoma) was found to be HIV-negative following transplantation. The patient died shortly after from [tumour](https://www.britannica.com/science/tumor) relapse. The most-popularized case involved a 42-year-old man, Timothy [Ray Brown](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ray-Brown), who had been cured of both [leukemia](https://www.britannica.com/science/leukemia) and HIV, as described in 2009 in The New England Journal of Medicine. Brown, who came to be known as the \"Berlin patient\" (because he was treated at the Charit\u00e9 hospital in that city), had been cleared of HIV following [stem cell](https://www.britannica.com/science/stem-cell) transplantation for [acute](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acute) myeloid leukemia and was no longer on antiretroviral therapy. His doctors purposely selected a donor whose cells carried an HIV-resistant mutation in a gene known as CCR5. Brown was still living without HIV in 2019, when another person, the \"London patient,\" later identified as Adam Castillejo, was apparently cured of HIV infection following stem cell transplantation (Brown died in 2020 from leukemia, which had returned and spread to his central nervous system). Castillejo, who underwent stem cell transplantation to treat [cancer](https://www.britannica.com/science/cancer-disease), was still HIV-free in 2020. Two other adults, who came to be known as the \"Boston patients,\" suffering from lymphoma, were reported in 2013 to have been cured of HIV/AIDS by HSCT; however, HIV reemerged in both Boston patients the following year. A major challenge facing the permanent cure of all these patients was that each likely harboured HIV in latent reservoirs despite stem cell transplantation; thus, rather than being entirely free of infection, the patients were only \"functionally cured.\" Also in 2013 a young child was reportedly cured of HIV infection. The child had been born prematurely in a Mississippi hospital, where the mother, who had not received antiretroviral therapy or prenatal care, underwent testing during labour which confirmed that she was HIV-positive. Her doctors immediately transferred the baby to the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Just 30 hours after birth, the baby was started on a three-drug antiretroviral [regimen](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regimen), before test results revealed HIV infection. Normal [protocol](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/protocol) in such a case would have been to use a prophylactic regimen of one or two drugs. Within days the baby's viral load dropped, and within one month the [virus](https://www.britannica.com/science/virus) became undetectable. In 2014, however, the report of a cure proved false. In 2022, using a novel method involving stem cell transplantation with [umbilical cord](https://www.britannica.com/science/umbilical-cord) blood, scientists reported curing HIV infection in a woman of mixed racial background, opening the way to potentially curing others with diverse racial backgrounds. The woman underwent the [transplant](https://www.britannica.com/science/transplant-surgery) as part of her treatment for leukemia. In addition to cord blood, she also received partially matched blood from a first-degree relative, which researchers suspect [bolstered](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bolstered) her [immune system](https://www.britannica.com/science/immune-system) while the transplanted cord blood cells grafted onto her [bone marrow](https://www.britannica.com/science/bone-marrow). The woman had been free of HIV for 14 months at the time the scientists publicly declared her functionally cured of the [disease](https://www.britannica.com/science/disease). [ More From Britannica What's the Difference Between HIV AIDS? ](/story/whats-the-difference-between-hiv-and-aids) [Robert [The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica](/editor/The-Editors-of-Encyclopaedia-Britannica/4419) HIV and pregnancy HIV-positive women can transmit the virus to their babies during [pregnancy](https://www.britannica.com/science/pregnancy), labour, or delivery or while [breast-feeding](https://www.britannica.com/science/suckling). Mother-to-child HIV transmission\u2014also known as perinatal, or vertical, transmission\u2014is the most-common means by which children become infected with HIV. If a woman does not take preventative antiretroviral therapy, the chance of passing on the virus to an infant is approximately 15 to 30 percent, and rises to as high as 45 percent with prolonged breast-feeding. Mother-to-child HIV infection can be prevented through HIV testing, so that women know their HIV status, as well as through the prevention of unintended pregnancies among HIV-positive women. However, many HIV-positive women want to become pregnant. In such cases, the risk of mother-to-child [transmission](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/transmission) can be reduced substantially, to less than 2 percent, with antiretroviral drugs taken by the mother before birth and at the time of delivery and with formula feeding. The risk of transmission can also be reduced with antiretroviral drug therapy in the newborn for several weeks after birth. Antiretrovirals taken during the first trimester of pregnancy may place the [fetus](https://www.britannica.com/science/fetus) at risk for developmental defects. Elective (scheduled) [cesarian section](https://www.britannica.com/science/cesarean-section) (C-section), performed prior to labour or the [rupture](https://www.britannica.com/science/hernia) of membranes, can lower the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission. However, HIV-infected women who deliver by [C-section](https://www.britannica.com/science/cesarean-section) are at increased risk of complications, including [fever](https://www.britannica.com/science/fever) and hemorrhage, when compared with HIV-infected women who deliver vaginally. In many countries the increased risk of maternal death due to complications from surgery for C-section may outweigh the decreased probability of HIV transmission to the infant. Programs focused on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission face a variety of challenges. Some women, for example, may refuse to take an HIV test or may have a fear of HIV-based [discrimination](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/discrimination). Other women fail to seek follow-up care. In some countries HIV-positive women who are pregnant face discrimination from medical care providers, which discourages the women from returning to clinics for follow-up visits. In addition, some women are afraid that their children will be taken away from them because the women either are HIV-positive or engage in high-risk behaviours such as intravenous [drug use](https://www.britannica.com/topic/drug-use) or sex work. Factors that can raise the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breast milk include the mother's desire to avoid [health](https://www.britannica.com/topic/health) risks associated with feeding infants formula mixed with unclean water, which is especially [problematic](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/problematic) in less-developed countries. Likewise in those regions, formula may be unavailable or may be prohibitively expensive. Some women also face cultural pressure to breast-feed. In such settings additional doses of antiretroviral drugs, if available, may help decrease mother-to-child transmission during breast-feeding. Among serodiscordant couples (where one member is HIV-positive and the other is not), HIV-positive women who want to become pregnant can do so through [artificial insemination](https://www.britannica.com/science/artificial-insemination), which provides complete protection to the uninfected male partner (though it does not protect the baby). Sperm washing is used when HIV-positive men wish to father a child with an HIV-negative woman. Sperm washing entails the separation of sperm cells from the HIV-infected [seminal fluid](https://www.britannica.com/science/semen). That process ensures that the sperm cells are free of the virus. The sperm are then used to fertilize the woman via [in vitro fertilization](https://www.britannica.com/science/in-vitro-fertilization) (IVF) or artificial insemination. [Sperm](https://www.britannica.com/science/sperm) washing, artificial insemination, and IVF, however, are available to only a small minority of patients. Thus, for the vast majority of serodiscordant couples, [sexual intercourse](https://www.britannica.com/science/sexual-intercourse) remains the only option for conceiving a child. HIV transmission rates are reduced for those couples who receive antiretroviral therapy and for those who are not coinfected with other sexually transmitted agents. [Annie Dude](/contributor/Annie-Dude/9562741) Social, legal, and cultural aspects As with any [epidemic](https://www.britannica.com/science/epidemic) for which there is no cure, tragedy shadows the disease's advance. From wreaking havoc on certain populations (such as the gay [community](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community) in [San Francisco](https://www.britannica.com/place/San-Francisco-California) in the 1980s) to infecting more than one-third of adults in sub-Saharan African countries such as [Botswana](https://www.britannica.com/place/Botswana), [Swaziland](https://www.britannica.com/place/Eswatini), and [Zimbabwe](https://www.britannica.com/place/Zimbabwe) at the turn of the 21st century, AIDS has had a devastating social impact. Its [collateral](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collateral) cultural effect has been no less far-reaching, sparking new research in medicine and complex legal debates as well as intense competition among scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and research institutions. Since the mid-1980s the International AIDS Society has held regular conferences at which new research and medical advances have been discussed. In order to raise public awareness, advocates promote the wearing of a loop of red ribbon to indicate their concern. Activist groups lobby governments for funding for education, research, and treatment, and support groups provide a wide range of services, including medical, nursing, and hospice care, housing, psychological [counseling](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/counseling), meals, and legal services. Those who have died of AIDS have been memorialized in the more than 48,000 panels of the [AIDS Memorial Quilt](https://www.britannica.com/topic/AIDS-Memorial-Quilt), which has been displayed worldwide both to raise funds and to emphasize the human dimension of the tragedy. The [United Nations](https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Nations) designated December 1 as [World AIDS Day](https://www.britannica.com/topic/World-AIDS-Day). Regarding access to the latest medical treatments for AIDS, the determining factors tend often to be geographic and economic. Simply put, developing nations often lack the means and funding to support the advanced treatments available in industrialized countries. On the other hand, in many developed countries specialized health care has caused the disease to be perceived as treatable or even manageable. That perception has fostered a lax attitude toward HIV prevention (such as [safe sex](https://www.britannica.com/topic/safe-sex) practices or sterile needle distribution programs), which in turn has led to new increases in HIV infection rates. Because of the magnitude of the disease in [Africa](https://www.britannica.com/place/Africa), in sub-Saharan Africa in particular, the governments of that region have tried to fight the disease in a variety of ways. Some countries have made arrangements with multinational pharmaceutical companies to make HIV [drugs](https://www.britannica.com/science/drug-chemical-agent) available in Africa at lower costs. Other countries, such as [South Africa](https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa), have begun manufacturing such drugs themselves instead of importing them. Plants [indigenous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indigenous) to Africa are being scrutinized for their usefulness in developing various HIV treatments. In the absence of financial resources to pay for new drug therapies, many African countries have found education to be the best defense against the disease. In [Uganda](https://www.britannica.com/place/Uganda), for example, songs about the disease, nationally distributed posters, and public awareness campaigns starting as early as kindergarten have all helped to stem the spread of AIDS. Prostitutes in [Senegal](https://www.britannica.com/place/Senegal) are licensed and are regularly tested for HIV, and the clergy, including [Islamic](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Islam) religious leaders, work to inform the public about the disease. Other parts of Africa, however, have seen little progress. For example, the practice of sexually violating very young girls has developed among some HIV-positive African men because of the misguided belief that such acts will somehow cure them of the disease. In sub-Saharan Africa the stigma associated with [homosexuality](https://www.britannica.com/topic/homosexuality) and the illegal nature of that [sexual orientation](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sexual-orientation) in some countries there have discouraged gay men from seeking treatment for the disease and have severely hindered the extension of AIDS outreach programs to that population. In 2009 the [incidence](https://www.britannica.com/science/incidence-epidemiology) of AIDS among homosexual males in certain African countries was found to be alarmingly high\u2014some 10 times higher than in the male population at large. Furthermore, many homosexual men in those areas were reportedly unaware that the disease could be transmitted from male to male. In the opinion of many, only better education can battle the damaging [stereotypes](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stereotypes), misinformation, and disturbing practices associated with AIDS. Laws concerning HIV and AIDS typically fall into four broad categories: mandatory reporting, mandatory testing, laws against transmission, and immigration. The mandatory reporting of newly discovered HIV infections is meant to encourage early treatment. Many countries, including [Canada](https://www.britannica.com/place/Canada), [Switzerland](https://www.britannica.com/place/Switzerland), [Denmark](https://www.britannica.com/place/Denmark), and [Germany](https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany), have enacted mandatory screening laws for HIV. Some countries, such as [Estonia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Estonia), require mandatory testing of prison populations (in response to explosive rates of infection among the incarcerated). Most of the [United States](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States) requires some form of testing for convicted sex offenders. Other legal and international issues concern the criminalization of knowing or unknowing transmission (more prevalent in the United States and Canada) and the rights of HIV-positive individuals to [immigrate](https://www.britannica.com/topic/immigration) to or even enter foreign countries. In 1987 the United States added AIDS to its list of [communicable diseases](https://www.britannica.com/science/infectious-disease) that prevent an infected person's entry into bans against persons infected with HIV. On January 4, 2010, U.S. Pres. [Barack Obama](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Barack-Obama) lifted the U.S. ban, declaring that it contradicted the country's goal of serving as a leader in the global fight against AIDS. In the United States some [communities](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities) have fought the opening of AIDS clinics or the right of HIV-positive children to attend public schools. Several countries\u2014notably [Thailand](https://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand), [India](https://www.britannica.com/place/India), and [Brazil](https://www.britannica.com/place/Brazil)\u2014have challenged international drug patent laws, arguing that the societal need for up-to-date treatments supersedes the rights of [pharmaceutical](https://www.britannica.com/technology/pharmaceutical) companies. At the start of the 21st century many Western countries were also battling the reluctance of some governments to direct public awareness campaigns at high-risk groups such as homosexuals, prostitutes, and drug users out of fear of appearing to [condone](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/condone) their lifestyles. For the world of art and popular [culture](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/culture), HIV/AIDS has been double-edged. On the one hand, AIDS removed from the artistic heritage many talented photographers, singers, actors, dancers, and writers in the world. On the other hand, as with the tragedy of war and even the horror of the [Holocaust](https://www.britannica.com/event/Holocaust), AIDS has spurred moving works of art as well as inspiring stories of perseverance.
