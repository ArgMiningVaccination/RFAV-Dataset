In simpler words, a vaccination is the injection of a killed or weakened organism that produces immunity in the body against that organism. The immune system is the body 's defense against Vaccinations are produced by developing a live, but weakened or inactive form of a disease. This weakened form of the disease, is then introduced into the body via injection, inhalation, or ingestion. Providing the body with this inactive version of the disease, the body's natural defense mechanisms are triggered and begin creating antibodies against the disease, which in turn, allows - Vaccinations/Immunization, allows for individuals to become resistant to infection, caused by a pathogen. Vaccines, either oral or injected, are prepared with a weakened or dead disease causing microorganisms /pathogens. This vaccine is given with the intensions of provoking a immune response to the disease, on a minor level. This vaccination allows for the immune response to create antibodies, and memory cells, so that if infected with a strong version of the pathogen, the body will be immune. The controversial debate regarding the safety of vaccinations continues to captivate the masses; however we must understand whether the side effects from the vaccine outweigh the risk of the disease it may prevent. There is only one way to prevent the disease cervical cancer, and that is through examination, not vaccination. The vaccination available to aid in prevention of cervical cancer has some effectiveness and in many cases ineffectiveness, in preventing Human Papillomavirus. In essence, the most reliable method of prevention is regular visits with your physician. Vaccines and vaccinations are two different things. A product that produces immunity from a disease and can be administered through needle injections, by mouth, or by aerosol is called a vaccine (Basics). The injection of a killed or weakened organism that produces immunity in the body against that organism is a vaccination (Basics). A vaccine can help prevent many different and serious diseases. When you get a vaccine it will work with your body to try and protect it. When a vaccine enters your body it will create a complex system of cells and organs that evolve to fight off infectious microbes inside of your immune system (Basics). Much of the immune system's work is carried out by a group of different specialized cells, each type designed Vaccinations are a type of treatment using non active forms of a virus to create immunity to a disease. They were created in 1796 by Edward Jenner when he gave a 13-year-old boy a tiny dose of dead cowpox. Shortly after the boy was immune to the disease of smallpox.Vaccines are beneficial to society in that they save money in medical costs, save people's lives, are effective in stopping diseases from spreading and in some instances even eradicating the disease entirely. The intervention of this study was the exposure to total antibody-stimulating proteins and polysaccharides found in such vaccines, which were determined the total dosage of antigens received by each shot of vaccine containing The history of vaccines began with the creation of a smallpox vaccination developed by Edward Jenner and ended in extreme debate as more locations require vaccines despite dangerous side effects. Forty-two states have mandatory vaccine policies and many children are required to receive at least 22 vaccinations before the first How does it work? A person is injected with a vaccine containing a harmless version of the bacteria/ virus. Harmless forms of the virus may include a dead/weakened version of the virus or a toxin that is produced by the bacteria/ virus. This enters the body and the immune system will fight off the microbes. The immune system recognises this \"invasion\" and distinguishes your body cells and the harmful cells and so that the macrophages A vaccination is an injection of a weakened strain of an infectious microbe or pathogen that causes the body to undergo artificial active immunity (vaccines.gov). The Influenza vaccine is \"taken from an influenza virus that has been grown in embryonic hens' eggs, highly purified and then killed.\" Once the antigen Mya: Okay, but what about the ones that contain weakened germs? What affect will those vaccines Though it may seem as though the risk of great epidemic, such as the black death, is unrealistic, the risk is still there. Serious illnesses are still present in the world today, smallpox, influenza, etc., and these can be easily prevented through vaccinations. Though the somewhat large, intimidating needle might look like it does more harm than good, ignore that. It is in fact that 90% of child related deaths regarding influenza are those that didn't get vaccinated (cdc.gov.) I will be arguing that vaccines, if optional, should always be taken as a safe method to preventing children from being infected with a serious illness. America is known to be the land of the free. Free to worship ones religion without persecution, free to practice ones customs without judgment, and free to achieve ones dreams without restriction. The question is; where does this freedom reach its limits? What if our freedom of choice negatively impacts another person? The recent outbreak of the measles at Disneyland in California in January 2015 questions the limits of freedom in the US. A total of \"51 measles cases linked to Disneyland\" were reported in the outbreak (Ellis, et al). The outbreak was \"spread among those who had not been vaccinated against the virus. Overall, 82% of those infected in this outbreak were not vaccinated, either because they're too young or because they elected not to be\" (Ellis, et al). Some parents choose not to vaccinate their children with MMR vaccine that prevents against Measles, Mumps, and Rubella because they believe that the vaccine may be more of a dangerous than the disease. However, the choice not to vaccinate not only affects the susceptible child but also One of the greatest remarkable advancement in the modern history of scientific research and discoveries in ensuring better health living and diseases free society in all facets of human existence is Vaccination. So far in the world today, vaccines have been the cure for many diseases and infections, such as Vaccines interact with three main cell types after an infection: macrophages, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes/antibodies (Understanding How Vaccines Work, 2013). The macrophages are the white blood cells that attack and consume the pathogen (Understanding How Vaccines Work, 2013). They leave behind parts of the pathogen, which are known as antigens (Understanding How Vaccines Work, 2013). The when the body comes in contact with the antigen, it recognizes that it is foreign body and that it is dangerous, it signals a response to attack it (Understanding How Vaccines Work, 2013). The antibodies are the cell that attack the antigen left by the macrophages (Understanding How Vaccines Work, 2013). The antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes, and the B lymphocytes are a type of defensive white blood cell (Understanding How Vaccines Work, 2013). The T lymphocytes are another type of defensive white blood cell (Understanding How Vaccines Work, 2013). They attack cells that have already been infected with a pathogen (Understanding How Vaccines Work, 2013). Without these three main cell types, a person would have no chance to fight off an "}
