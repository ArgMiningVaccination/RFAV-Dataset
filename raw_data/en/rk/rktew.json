Lynch, MD BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA (BPH)IS A COMMON DISORDER , with increasing incidence reported with advancing age. Popu- lation studies show the frequency of moderate-to-severe BPHsymptoms to be 8-31% of men in the fifth decade and up to 44% ofmen in the seventh decade. 1Treatment options for symptoms include medications, surgery, and botanical treatments, the latterbeing most common in Europe but enjoying increasing popularityin the United States. Use of plant extracts for the treatment of BPHwas described as far back as 15th century BC Egypt. 2 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines Clinical practice guidelines for BPH were published in 1994 by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.3Diagnosis is pre- sumptive and is based on a constellation of both obstructive and irri-tative voiding symptoms. Obstructive symptoms include decreasedforce of or interrupted urinary stream, straining to void, sensation ofincomplete emptying, and urinary hesitancy. Irritative symptomsinclude urinary frequency, nocturia, and urgency. Interestingly, pro-static enlargement is not necessary for the diagnosis of BPH, asprostate size has not been found to correlate with degree of obstruc-tion or severity of symptoms. 4 Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis and prostatodynia are difficult entities to treat. Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis has an unknown eti-ology and may represent a non-infectious inflammatory disorder.Diagnosis is based on symptoms in the absence of infectious etiolo-gy, including irritative voiding symptoms and perineal a non-inflammatory disorder affectingyoung and middle-aged men with symptoms similar to chronic pro-statitis, as well as hesitancy and possibly interruption of flow.According to Watson and Irwin, the term prostatodynia is used todesignate any unexplained complaints of chronic pelvic pain associ-ated with nonspecific voiding symptoms and/or pain located in oraround the groin, genitalia, or perineum, or the absence of pyuriaand bacteriuria, with or without excess white cells or bacteria, onresults from Gram stain and culture of expressed prostatic secretions Volume 6 Number 10 \u007f October 2003 109-120INSIDE DHEA for women with systemic lupus erythematosus page 112 Clinical hypnosis and surgery page 115 LCPUFAs, infant formula, and blood pressure page 120Thomson American Health Consultants Home Page\u2014 http://www.ahcpub.com CME for Physicians\u2014 http://www.cmeweb.com Alternative Medicine Alert is now available on-line.

Both illnesses present viable opportunities foruse of botanical treatments, like rye grass pollen, as con-ventional medical therapies have not proven to be whol-ly effective. Constituents and Formulation The most commonly used and studied rye grass pollen extract product for BPH is Cernilton, preparedfrom the Swedish rye grass pollen Secale cereale . Cernilton is used by millions of men worldwide and is aregistered pharmaceutical product throughout WesternEurope, Japan, Korea, and Argentina. The extract is pre-pared through microbial digestion of rye grass pollen,followed by water and acetone extraction. Cernilton iscomposed of 60 mg of a water-soluble fraction (CernitinT60) and 3 mg of an acetone-soluble fraction (CernitinGBX) per tablet. Pollen extracts have been found to con-tain at least 21 amino acids, as well as enzymes, coen-zymes, sterols, minerals, trace elements, and all knownvitamins. Gas chromatography studies found the Cer-nitin GBX fraction to contain phytosterols and fattyacids, including alpha-linoleic acid. Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of rye grass pollen is not completely understood, although a number of mecha-nisms have been proposed regarding its beneficialeffects on the prostate. In vitro studies have shown thewater-soluble fraction T60 to inhibit the growth ofprostate cancer cell lines and primary cultures fromBPH specimens. 6Other in vitro data raise the possibility of anti-prostaglandin and anti-leukotriene actions byinhibiting the arachidonic acid cascade. 7Animal studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in rat prostatesize following three weeks of therapy, 8as well as a con- tractile effect on the bladder and a relaxing effect on theurethra in mice and pigs. 9 Clinical Studies Two systematic reviews of rye grass pollen for BPH have been published. A 2002 Cochrane SystematicReview of rye grass pollen for BPH found human trialsto be limited by short duration, limited number ofenrollees, gaps in reported outcomes, and unknownquality of the preparations utilized. 10However, the authors concluded that the available evidence suggestsrye grass pollen is well-tolerated and modestly improvesurologic symptoms including nocturia. Additional ran-domized controlled trials were deemed necessary toevaluate long-term clinical effectiveness and safety ofrye grass pollen. These findings echoed those publishedin the initial systematic review a few years earlier. 1 Two published trials supporting the use of rye grass pollen in BPH are not available in English and, there-fore, were not fully reviewed by the author. The first wasa German double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 103patients followed for 12 weeks, with findings of statisti-cally significant improvements in nocturia and post-voidresidual urine. 11The second was a double-blind Japan- ese trial comparing two proprietary brands of rye grasspollen, Cernilton and Paraprost, the latter being a phar-macological treatment for BPH used primarily in Japanand containing a mixture of amino acids. The investiga-tors found statistically significant self-reported improve-ment of symptoms in the Cernilton group. 12 The most rigorous English language double-blind, placebo-controlled study of rye grass pollen for BPHwas published in 1990. 13Sixty patients awaiting opera- tive treatment for outflow obstruction due to benignprostate enlargement were entered into the six-monthstudy. The study dose was 2 tablets of Cernilton twicedaily. Subjective assessment was based on the Boyarskyscoring scale for symptoms of frequency, urgency, hesi-tancy, intermittency, incomplete emptying, terminaldribbling, and dysuria, with a score of 0-3 for each of 110 October 2003Subscriber Information Customer Multiple more copies: $231 each Outside the United States $369 per year plus GST (Student/Resident rate: $180 plus GST).

Objective criteria for the evaluation of outflow obstruction were urine flow rate, voided vol-ume, ultrasound measurement of residual urine, andtransrectal ultrasound measurement of prostate size.Fifty-three patients were evaluated at the end of the six-month trial, 29 in the Cernilton arm and 24 in the place-bo arm, with findings of statistically significant subjec-tive improvement in 69% of patients. Significantdecreases were noted in both residual urine volume andultrasound determined antero-posterior diameter of theprostate. No significant differences were detected inflow rate and voided volume. Subsequent papers also report positive effects of rye grass pollen on BPH. One open study included 79patients with mild or moderate symptomatic BPH. 14 Subjective assessment was based on the same Boyarskyscoring scale for symptoms, with an average baselinescore of 9.6. Maximum flow rate, average flow rate,residual volume, and mean prostatic volume on transrec-tal ultrasonography were other measured baseline char-acteristics. The dose of Cernilton pollen extract was 2tablets three times daily for more than 12 weeks, withsubstantial improvement noted in nearly all irritativesymptoms, no changes in prostatic volume or urine vol-ume, and no adverse reactions reported. Twenty-eightpatients who achieved good results with short-termtreatment continued treatment for more than a year, withsubsequent findings of decreased prostatic volume andfurther reductions in symptom score and residual vol-ume. The results of this study are difficult to extrapolate,however, as no statistical analysis was performed andthere was no control group. Another study involved 89 BPH patients, 51 of whom received Cernilton and 38 who received Tadenan(Pygeum africanum , traditionally used in Europe for BPH) over a four-month period. 15The two groups were compared using a subjective symptoms score devised bythe author and objective evaluation by physical exam,uroflowmetry, and ultrasound determination of residualurine and prostate size. Subjective improvement wasfound in 78% of the Cernilton group compared to 55%of the Tadenan-treated group. Improvements also werenoted in urine flow rate, residual urine volume, andprostate size. Again, no statistical analysis was per-formed, raising questions about the significance of thestudy. It is interesting that Cernilton outperformed amore widely recognized botanical BPH treatment. Two studies have evaluated the treatment of chronic prostatitis and prostatodynia with pollen extract. Thefirst was an open trial of 15 patients with either diagno-sis suffering with symptoms for periods ranging fromfive months to seven years. 16Nearly all complained ofirritative urinary symptoms, mainly dysuria and fre- quency, and all complained of pain or discomfort. Dura-tion of treatment lasted from one to 18 months. Com-plete resolution of symptoms was found in seven of 15patients and another six patients were markedlyimproved. Most patients (11/15) did not experienceimprovement in signs and symptoms until three monthsafter starting treatment. A larger study of 90 patients treated with 1 tablet of Cernilton three times daily for six months was subse-quently conducted. 17The patients were divided into two groups: those without associated complicating factors (n = 72) and those with complicating factors, such asurethral strictures, prostatic calculi, and bladder necksclerosis (n = 18). This division was employed becauseof significant differences at initial presentation and inresponse to treatment. Subjective symptoms of discom-fort, nocturia, frequency, and dysuria, as well as findingsfrom digital rectal prostate exams and uroflowmetry,were recorded at baseline, three months, and six months.Other measurements included urine leukocyte countsand measurement of complement C3/ceruloplasmin inthe ejaculate, regarded as an extremely sensitive index ofinflammation within the prostate. Patients with associated complicating factors responded poorly to treatment. Both symptoms andurine flow measurements improved in the group withoutcomplicating factors; there was an overall positive clini-cal response in 56 of 72 of these patients. ComplementC3/ceruloplasmin levels were reduced as well, suggest-ing an anti-inflammatory mechanism. Again, lack of sta-tistical analysis and absence of a control group make theresults of this study difficult to apply widely. Adverse Effects Adverse effects were not reported in any of the afore- mentioned studies. Dosage Dosing was different in nearly every study men- tioned, but Graminex, the manufacturer of Cernilton,lists 6 tablets daily as the recommended dose forprostate conditions. Conclusion Rye grass pollen extract appears to be a safe, well-tol- erated, and moderately effective botanical treatment foruse in prostate disorders, with some studies followingpatients for as long as 12 months. More extensive evi-dence supports its use for BPH than for chronic prostati-tis or prostatodynia, though the relative lack of effectivetreatments for these latter conditions makes the use ofrye grass pollen extract compelling. The effect of rye Alternative Medicine Alert 111grass pollen on development of urinary retention or need for surgery with BPH has yet to be determined. Morerigorous controlled studies are needed to fully assess theefficacy of rye grass pollen extract in prostate disorders. Recommendation Rye grass pollen can be an effective, evidence-based herbal treatment for prostate disorders; however, long-term safety data are lacking.

Br A CHRONIC , inflammatory, autoimmune disease of connective tissue characterized by injury to many organs, especiallythe skin, joints, kidneys, nervous system, and mucousmembranes. The American College of Rheumatologyhas developed, updated, and revised criteria for classify-ing SLE. 1Up to 10 times as many women as men are affected by the disease. Clinical manifestations of SLEare very diverse due to its widespread impact. Commonsymptoms include fever, joint pain, a characteristic but-terfly rash, pleural effusion, and nephritis. Patients withSLE usually go through periods of remission and exac-erbation, referred to as flares. SLE frequently leads toglomerulonephritis, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonarydiseases, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Patients havehigh levels of various autoantibodies, especially thosedirected against cell nucleus molecules. Treatment for the underlying disease is not available. Patients are typically instructed to avoid exposure tosunlight and ultraviolet radiation. Active disease andflares are treated with topical steroids, salicylates, sys-temic corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents.Given the adverse effects associated with these medica-tions, agents with better side effect profiles are actively 112 October 2003being sought. One that has generated much interest is the adrenal hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Pharmacology DHEA is a testos- terone and estrogen. DHEA is converted endogenouslyinto its the 2DHEA are metaboli- cally interconvertible and therefore their endogenouslevels follow the same pattern. 2DHEA levels rise in humans, reaching a peak in their mid-20s, and then fallover the rest of their lives. This has led to unsubstantiat-ed claims that DHEA supplementation could be the\"elixir of youth.\" 3 The precise role played by DHEA in normal metabolism is not known, except that it affectsmany body systems. 4 Mechanism of Action Use of DHEA to treat SLE has been explored because of the female preponderance of SLE, low circulatinglevels of DHEA and DHEAS in SLE, the immunomodu-latory effects of DHEA, and the beneficial effects ofDHEA when given to mice with SLE. 4In SLE, serum levels of adrenal androgens are lower than normal.4Sys- temic inflammation leads to a shift in hormone secretionaway from adrenal androgens to maintain cortisol levels.Glucocorticoids are administered to help maintain corti-sol levels. Detailed studies with 72 patients revealed thatthose with SLE had severely reduced serum levels ofDHEA and DHEAS, probably due to changes in theenzymes involved in adrenal steroidogenesis. 5 Clinical Studies An early study involved 10 patients with SLE given 200 mg/d DHEA.6After 3-6 months of treatment, improvements were seen in patients' symptom reportsusing the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), physi-cians' assessments, and need for corticosteroid use. In adouble-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT), 28women mg/d) orplacebo. SLEDAI scores, patients' and physi-cians' overall assessments, and corticosteroid use allimproved significantly over the three months of thestudy (P = 0.022). Those taking placebo had more SLEflares (P = 0.053). Another open study found statisticallysignificant improvements in these same outcomes, com-pared to baseline, when 50 patients took DHEA (50-200mg/d) for six or 12 months. 8 The aforementioned studies enrolled patients with mild-to-moderate SLE. Patients with severe SLE wereenrolled in one study adding DHEA to conventionaltreatment with high-dose corticosteroids, with or with-out immunosuppressant agents. 9Responders were defined as those whose major SLE manifestation wasstabilized after six months. The study authors random-ized 21 patients to either placebo or 200 mg/d DHEA.No statistically significant differences were foundbetween the two groups of subjects. However, the twostudy groups were found to have statistically significantdifferences at baseline in both the severity of SLE symp-toms (P < 0.05) and types of other conditions. Thoserandomized to the DHEA group had greater diseaseactivity and more instances of nephritis. These baselinedifferences may limit the generalizability of theseresults, and reflect a difficulty inherent to the study ofdiseases manifesting a variety of symptoms. 10 The first relatively large RCT assigned 120 subjects to either DHEA (200 mg/d) or placebo.4The subjects were all adult Chinese women with mild-to-moderateSLE who also were taking standard SLE medication(glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants). No signifi-cant differences were found in disease activity scoresusing two measures to compare baseline scores withthose at the end of the six-month study. However, sub-jects taking DHEA had significantly fewer serious SLEdisease flares and went longer before experiencing flares(P = 0.044). Patients' global assessment scores were sig-nificantly improved (P = 0.005), but not physicians'evaluations. DHEA was although expect-ed increases in serum testosterone levels and incidenceof acne did occur. A larger RCT examined the hypothesis that DHEA could allow corticosteroid-dependent women (taking10-30 mg/d prednisone) to reduce their dose withoutincreasing SLE activity. 11The 191 subjects were ran- domized to either placebo, 100 DHEA. Prednisone by predetermined increments ifpatients' SLEDAI scores were stable or improved. Suc-cessful responders were those who achieved a pred-nisone dose of 7.5 mg/d within seven months. The study was continued to nine months if the dose was stillbeing successfully reduced but subjects had not yetreached or become stabilized at 7.5 mg/d. Among all subjects, the higher DHEA dose demonstrated a non-significant trend toward more responders than the lowerdose or placebo (55%, 44%, 41%, respectively). Prior tounblinding, subjects were divided into those with active(SLEDAI score > 2) or inactive disease (SLEDAI score2). Among those with active SLE, significantly greater numbers of responders were found among those taking200 mg/d the baseline SLEDAI score Alternative Medicine Alert 113increased, the proportion of responders increased. The researchers concluded that in future DHEA trials onlythose with active SLE should be enrolled. Adverse Effects Patients taking DHEA have dose-related increases in serum DHEAS and testosterone levels. Use of DHEA,therefore, can lead to androgenic effects. In one study,41% of corticosteroid-dependent patients receivingDHEA (100 or 200 mg/d) experienced an increased inci-dence of mild acne compared to 19% of those takingplacebo (P < 0.05). 11Hirsutism and menstrual abnor- malities also increased, but were not significantly differ-ent from those in the placebo group. Abdominal discom-fort, including stomach cramping and pain, is commonlyreported, but usually is transient and relieved by H2-receptor antagonists. No drug interactions have beenreported with DHEA. Epidemiological studies have noted a positive corre- lation between serum DHEA levels and incidence ofbreast cancer in postmenopausal, but not pre-menopausal, women. 12This correlation needs to be more fully researched, but is of particular concern forobese postmenopausal women. Formulation DHEA is most commonly available as 50 mg cap- sules, with 200 mg usually taken in the morning. DHEAalso is known by its United States Adopted NamesCouncil designation, prasterone, and by its Genelabsformulation, GL701. 11Concern has been raised regard- ing the quality of DHEA products available on the U.S.market because of its regulatory status. The FDA cate-gorized DHEA as an unapproved drug in 1985, makingit available only by prescription. The 1994 Dietary Sup-plement Health and Education Act reclassified it as adietary supplement, making it readily available over thecounter. A 1998 study found commercial products con-taining 0-150% of the labeled amount, with nine of the16 products failing to meet standard pharmaceuticalspecifications of 90-110% of labeled amount. 13 Conclusion SLE is a chronic, debilitating disease with many dif- ferent manifestations. Current conventional treatmentrelies upon the use of medications associated with seri-ous adverse effects. Although only a relatively smallnumber of clinical trials have examined the effectivenessof DHEA in SLE, the results have been generally posi-tive. Reduction in the severity of the illness itself and theability to reduce the dose of concurrent medicationshave been documented. However, none of the studieshave extended beyond one year, which is important given the cyclic nature of SLE and the likelihood thatmedications will be taken for many years. Long-termstudies also are needed to resolve questions regardingadverse effects. Recommendation Adult women with SLE may find symptom relief from 200 mg/d DHEA and/or may be able to reducedoses of other medications. However, DHEA should beemployed only under close medical supervision, espe-cially if other medications are being scaled back. Theready availability of DHEA as a dietary supplementmeans that patients should be advised about where toobtain high-quality products. Recommendations forusing DHEA in men with SLE cannot yet be given asstudies have not been reported with male subjects.

Clinical Hypnosis and Surgery By Steven Gurgevich, PhD THE LATEST FIGURES FROM THE CENTER FOR HEALTH Statistics report nearly 72 million surgical proce- dures performed in the United States in 1996. No oneneeds to be reminded of the financial expense associatedwith surgery, but the cost in terms of anxiety and paincan be just as staggering to the patient. Mind-bodymethods, such as clinical hypnosis and guided imagery,hold great promise in reducing both the psychic costs ofsuffering as well as the financial expense of surgery. Mind-body methods for medical and surgical applica- tions date back to the Ebers papyrus in Egypt, Aescle-pius' sleep-healing temples in ancient Greece, and the\"cult of the magnet\" represented by Franz Antoine Mes-mer. 1,2Although methods were discredited, British physicians Elliotson Esdaile documentedand published hundreds of cases of mesmerism appliedsuccessfully for anesthesia and analgesia in surgical procedures. 3 Esdaile, a surgeon practicing in India in the 1840s, documented major surgery\u2014from limb hypnosis was particularly noteworthy because only5% of his surgical patients died, when the standard sur-gical mortality rate was 40%. He felt that the \"mesmer-ic\" relief of pain accounted for the greater survival. His critics said that it was only out of deference to him as awhite, British doctor that his patients did not complain.He responded that they must be surviving out of defer-ence as well. Ultimately, Esdaile too was discredited andthe Royal Medical Society banned the practice of mes-merism. Esdaile said that \" ... not many of this genera- tion will live to benefit from mesmerism, if they wait tillit is admitted into the Pharmacopoeia.\" For the past two and a half centuries, however, mind- body methods have continued to be used despite resist-ance from some conventional medical institutions. 4Vari- ous methods have been identified by many names, but itwas the British physician James Braid who first used thelabel \"hypnosis.\" 5Finally, in 1955 and 1957, the British and American medical associations deemed hypnosis anacceptable medical procedure. Initial research studiessought to determine whether hypnosis was beneficial.That question has been addressed in numerous studiesand meta-analyses of research findings. 6-9Today, inves- tigations have shifted from determining if hypnosisworks to exploring how and in what ways may it be usedto help surgical patients. For example, Montgomery et al performed a meta- analysis of 20 published controlled studies using hypno-sis in surgical applications. 6They found that the surgical patients in hypnosis treatment groups experience betteroutcomes than 89% of those in control groups across sixclinical outcome categories: negative affect, degree ofpain, amount of pain medication used, physiologicalindicators, recovery time, and treatment time. What is Hypnosis? There are many competing theories as to what exactly constitutes and defines hypnosis. Marmer describes hyp-nosis as a psychophysiological tetrad of altered arousal, attentivereceptive focal concentration, with a correspondingdiminution in peripheral awareness. 11They give exam- ples of naturally occurring trance, such as daydreaming,intense concentration, distraction, and motivation forselective perception. Brown and Fromm call it, \"A spe-cial state of consciousness in which certain human capa-bilities are heightened and others may fade into thebackground.\" 12 Most will agree that hypnosis involves a system of skills and methods that allow the individual's mind andbody to share information more effectively to achieve atherapeutic outcome. One of those methods is called Alternative Medicine Alert 115trance, or a conscious state of awareness, in which an individual can be absorbed in his own thoughts andideas so well that he may perceive and respond to thosethoughts and ideas as if they were real. And most will certainly agree that all hypnosis actu- ally is self-hypnosis. The therapist or clinician providesinstructions and guides the patient in shifting conscious-ness to become absorbed in pleasantly relaxingthoughts, ideas, images, and feelings, and to be distract-ed from aversive or noxious internal or external stimuli.This process is called hypnotic induction. It allows andempowers the patient to experience greater control oversensory and physiological experience, facilitating agreater openness and receptivity to therapeutic sugges-tions. The trance state, along with hypnotic suggestions,is called hypnotic utilization. Thus, there are two mainaspects of the process of hypnosis: induction of tranceand utilization of the trance state. As with most phenomena, there is a normal distribu- tion of ability and receptiveness, which is called hyp-notizability. Most research studies employ one of themany scales designed to measure hypnotizability in chil-dren and adults. 10,13-18Although one would think that greater hypnotizability would correlate with greatertherapeutic response, some have discovered that hypno-tizability does not necessarily correlate with therapeuticbenefit in surgical applications. This is due to the manyco-mediating factors that also influence the responsivityto hypnosis, such as personality, motivation, belief andfaith, positive or negative expectancy, and therapeuticrapport. 19 Hypnosis in the Operating Room: Pain A recent research study by Lang et al garnered high visibility in the popular media.20The authors randomly assigned 241 patients undergoing percutaneous vascularand renal procedures to three groups: standard care (n = 79), structured attention (n = 80), and self-hypnoticrelaxation (n = 82). All patients had access to patient-controlled analgesia with fentanyl and midazolam. Thepatients rated their pain and anxiety on a visual analoguescale (V AS) every 15 minutes during and after the pro-cedure. The investigators found that the standard caregroup used significantly greater amounts of analgesicmedication: 1.9 units vs. 0.8 and 0.9 for the structuredattention and hypnosis groups, respectively. Only onepatient in the hypnosis group became hemodynamicallyunstable, compared to 10 structured attention patients (P = 0.004) and 12 standard care patients (P = 0.0009).The procedure times were significantly shorter (P =0.0016) in the hypnotic group (61 minutes) than thestandard care group (78 minutes) and the structuredattention group (67 minutes). Overall, the study demon- strated benefits of hypnotic relaxation in reducing pain,lessening need for medication, decreasing anxiety, andachieving greater hemodynamic stability. These resultswere consistent with the findings of their previous study,which examined self-hypnotic relaxation during inter-ventional radiological procedures. 21In this previous study, an extra person was available in the operatingroom to guide the patients into visualizations of placesthe patients found pleasant. Mauer et al examined the use of medical hypnosis for orthopedic hand surgery, which commonly results insevere postoperative pain, as well as for the painful ther-apy exercises and wound care required shortly after surgery. 22In a quasi-experimental research design with 60 hand surgery patients receiving either usualtreatment or usual treatment plus hypnosis, the hypnosisgroup exhibited significantly lower measures of per-ceived pain intensity, perceived pain affect, and stateanxiety. The physical ratings of progress were signifi-cantly higher for the hypnosis subjects than the controls,and the hypnosis group had significantly fewer postop-erative complications. Defechereux et al used hypnoanesthesia for 197 thyroidectomies and 21 surgical explorations for hyperparathyroidism between 1994 and 1997. 23The operative data and postoperative course were comparedto 119 patients who had declined hypnosis or werejudged unsuitable for it and underwent general anesthe-sia. The patients using hypnoanesthesia experienced lesspostoperative pain, less analgesic medication usage,shorter hospital stay, and improved postoperative convalescence. Hypnosis in the Operating Room: Nausea and Vomiting Up to 70% of surgical patients receiving general anesthesia experience postoperative nausea and vomit-ing (PONV). Eberhart et al conducted a double-blindrandomized study of 100 patients undergoing thyroidec-tomy. 24Patients were randomly assigned to a suggestion group that had an audiotape playing throughout theentire operation, or to a control group that had a blanktape playing throughout surgery. A classic droperidol-fentanyl-N 2O anesthesia technique was used to preserve the neuropsychological functions required to process thetherapeutic suggestions offered on the audiotape duringthe operation. The suggestion group had significantlyless PONV: 47.2% vs. 85.7% for the control group. also required less anti-emetic treat-ment: 30.6% vs. 68.6% for the control group. Williamset al reported similar findings for a double-blind 116 October 2003randomized study of 60 women receiving peri-operative suggestions during gynecological surgery.25 Enqvist et al studied the pre-operative use of hypnosis to reduce postoperative vomiting in 50 female patientsundergoing breast surgery. 26They randomly assigned the women to control or hypnosis groups. The hypnosisgroup listened to an audiotape daily for 4-6 days prior tosurgery. Hypnotic induction with suggestions for relax-ation and sensations of thirst and hunger (positive sug-gestions incompatible with nausea) were provided. Thepatients in the hypnosis group had significantly lessvomiting: 39% vs. 68% in the control group. They alsoreported less nausea and less need for analgesic medica-tion postoperatively. This study may not fit perfectlyunder our heading\u2014as the intervention came prior tosurgery, not in the operating room\u2014but it is a com-pelling example of how easy it can be to prepare patientswith both self-hypnosis and post-hypnotic suggestionsfor positive therapeutic effects. Hypnosis in the Operating Room: Blood Loss Enqvist et al examined the effects of pre-operative and intra-operative suggestion on blood loss and recov-ery from maxillofacial surgery. 27Sixty patients were assigned to three groups. Eighteen patients listened to ahypnosis audiotape containing pre-operative therapeuticsuggestions (group A), 18 patients listened to a hypnosisaudiotape containing pre- and intra-operative sugges-tions (group B), and 24 patients listened to a hypnosisaudiotape with only intra-operative suggestions (groupC). Each of these groups was compared to a group ofmatched control patients. Groups A and B listened to theaudiotape 1-2 times daily for the two weeks before sur-gery. The audiotapes provided therapeutic suggestionsfor improved healing, less bleeding, lower blood pres-sure, and faster recovery. The audiotape was 17 minutesin length. During surgery, Group B also heard an audio-tape, which contained similar positive therapeutic sug-gestions. No differences in somatic response were foundfor patients in groups A and B assessed with the Stan-ford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale. Group A, whichreceived pre-operative therapeutic suggestions, had 30%less blood loss (P = 0.008) than its matched control.Group B, receiving pre- and intra-operative therapeuticsuggestions, had 26% (P = 0.09) less blood loss than itscontrols. And group C, only receiving intra-operativetherapeutic suggestions, experienced 9% less blood lossthan its control group. Hypnosis in the Operating Room: Wound Healing Ginandes et al published the results of a clinical trial that examined the effect of hypnosis on postsurgicalwound healing in 18 women undergoing reduction mammaplasty. 28,29All the women received the same sur- gical protocol and postoperative care, and were random-ly assigned to usual care, adjunctive supportive atten-tion, or adjunctive hypnosis. The hypnosis group wasseen weekly for eight weeks (two weeks prior to surgeryuntil six weeks after) for administration of a scriptedhypnotic induction. The induction was recorded onaudiotape at each session and provided to the patient.The hypnosis group received therapeutic suggestions fordecreased inflammation, visible soft-tissue restoration,and accelerated tissue remodeling via direct, indirect,structured, and open-ended suggestion. During the eightsessions they also were provided with positive expectan-cy for comfort and rapid wound healing, diminishedbleeding, healing imagery, and hypnotic skills for posi-tive time distortion. The supportive attention group paralleled the hypno- sis group, receiving weekly 30-minute sessions thatemphasized focused attention about feelings toward thesurgery and surgical experience. Digital photographs ofthe incision were assessed at one and seven weeks with awound assessment inventory (WAI) measuring edema,erythema, and exudates (which was substituted for openwound size). Subjective ratings of pain and perceivedhealing at one and six weeks were obtained along withan objective functional recovery assessment, which wasdetermined using an SF-36 health survey completed atenrollment and seven weeks postoperative. Nurse ratings on the WAI were significant for accel- erated healing in the hypnosis group (P < 0.001). Thehypnosis group had the most rapid healing over time,followed by the supportive attention group; the usualcare control group had the slowest rate of healing. Physi-cians' ratings from digitized photographs did notachieve statistical significance, but trends were consis-tent with the pattern observed from nurses' WAI ratings.Similarly, patients also noted a trend toward greaterwound healing in the predicted pattern, but the findingalso did not achieve statistical significance. Pediatric Surgical Applications Children are excellent hypnotic subjects and also experience significant benefits from the application ofclinical hypnosis for surgical procedures. 30,31Lambert randomly assigned 52 children, matched by age, sex,and diagnosis, to hypnosis and control groups. 32The hypnosis group was taught imagery and received sug-gestions for a positive postoperative experience. Thehypnosis group showed significantly lower postopera-tive pain ratings, shorter hospital stays, and less anxietycompared with the control group. Alternative Medicine Alert 117Cost Effectiveness of Hypnosis for Surgery Lang and Rosen examined the cost data for the patients involved in their 2000 study referenced earlier.33 They found that the average cost associated with stan-dard sedation was $638 per case, whereas the cost forpatients receiving both sedation and hypnosis was only$300 per case. This represents an average of more than50% (or $338) cost savings per procedure. Side Effects of Hypnosis and Cautions Clinical application of hypnosis, when administered by qualified practitioners, typically is benign and effec-tive. Perhaps the greatest danger would be in using hyp-nosis to remove pain before it has been adequately eval-uated. However, there can be complications arising outof heightened transference, such as unexpected feelingsof disorientation or hostility toward the clinician. 34 There also have been reports of unexpected amnesia,disorientation, paralysis, and unexpected catharsis.These are not direct and predictable side effects of hyp-nosis per se, and are attributable to the psychodynamicsinvolved, and to the personal characteristics of thepatient. A frequent caution about hypnosis involves its use by untrained or unqualified people. A simple rule of thumbis that a clinician should not be using clinical hypnosisto treat a condition unless he or she also is qualified totreat the condition without hypnosis. Finding Qualified Professionals The majority of states have not legislated or estab- lished guidelines for the certification and practice ofhypnosis. However, the American Society of ClinicalHypnosis (ASCH, www.asch.net) has established aprocess for certifying professionals who have completedaccredited training and approved hours of indivi-dual supervision. Both ASCH and the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis offer training work-shops and scientific programs for physicians, psycholo-gists, dentists, and social workers. Another professionalassociation is the American Psychotherapy and MedicalHypnosis Association (www.apmha.com). Conclusion The public's well-recognized interest in using alter- ative and complementary therapies that can be safe,effective adjuncts to conventional care 35also extends into the operating suite. Prior to the availability of chem-ical anesthesia, hypnosis was the standard form of anes-thesia. It has been shown repeatedly that hypnosis is abenign and effective adjunct for the surgical patient.Results of experimental studies have demonstrated thathypnosis is beneficial in reducing anxiety, lowering pain perception, lessening postoperative nausea and vomit-ing, reducing blood loss, achieving greater hemodynam-ic control, accelerating wound healing, lowering compli-cation rates, shortening hospital stays, creating greatercompliance with postoperative treatment, and enhancingboth patient and clinician satisfaction. And in thosecases where chemical anesthesia is not advisable or safe,clinical hypnosis is an effective option. 36 One of the frequently mentioned deterrents of using hypnosis in surgical procedures is that it may be tootime-consuming. However, many of the studies cited inthis article have relied upon standard scripted hypnoticinductions that can be administered in as little as 10 min-utes. Montgomery et al used a 10-minute standardizedhypnotic induction prior to surgery for women undergo-ing excisional breast biopsy. 8The results demonstrated significantly less postoperative pain (P = 0.001) and dis-tress (P = 0.025). It also has been found that audiotape recordings may be an effective and efficient way of administering hyp-nosis. 37The benefits of hypnosis in surgical applica- tions, along with cost savings and efficiency of adminis-tration, make hypnosis both feasible and accessible tothe rising number of individuals who want to use alter-native and complementary methods to enhance theirhealing experience. Recommendation Questions about the usefulness of hypnosis for sur- gery have been answered both clinically and empirically.The list of benefits of hypnosis for surgical patients, cli-nicians, and health care organizations are expanding andbecoming more rigorously documented. The next great-est question for research on this subject may well be,\"Why isn't hypnosis offered to every patient undergoingsurgical procedures?\" [Editor's note: The author would like to thank Dr. D.

Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementationin infant formula and blood pressure in laterchildhood: Follow up of a randomised con-trolled trial. BMJ 2003;326:953. Goal: To with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) has an effect on blood in life. Design: Follow-up of a randomized, controlled multicenter trial. Subjects: A total of 147 formula-fed children and a reference group of 88breast-fed children (mean age 70.1months). Methods: In 1992, children from six European centers were randomized toreceive either standard infant formula,or a formula supplemented with docosa-hexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonicacid (ARA) that was otherwise nutri-tionally similar, during the first fourmonths of life. Blinding with respect tothe type of formula received was main-tained. Approximately six years later participants had their blood pressuresdetermined and questionnaires werecompleted. Results: The children who had received formula supplemented with LCPUFAshad a lower diastolic and lower meanblood pressure than those who receivedthe non-supplemented formula. Theblood pressure of breast-fed children didnot differ significantly from those whohad received LCPUFAs, but the dias-tolic blood pressure was noted to be sig-nificantly lower than that of the non-supplemented group. Conclusion: Dietary supplementation with LCPUFAs in formula-fed infants is associated with lower blood pressurein later childhood when compared tothose having received standard infantformulae. Study strengths: Multicenter design that ensured sex matching; all centersused the same type of automated bloodpressure monitor. Study weaknesses: Many of the initial study participants were not available forfollow-up (50/126 in the supplementa-tion group, 40/111 in the non-supple-mented group, and 51/139 in the breast-fed group)\u2014the majority of those lost tofollow-up could not be traced or had relocated; data on diet after age 4months were not collected. Of note: The authors state that direct comparison of the supplemented formu-la group and the breast-fed group wasnot possible due to confounding variables. We knew that: Deviations from normal blood pressure in childhood trace intoadulthood; breast milk contains LC-PUFAs, and breast-fed children havelower blood pressures than those fedstandard formulae. Clinical import: Tremendous advances have been made toward the treatment ofcardiovascular disease, yet an increas-ing prevalence of hypertension, heartdisease, and stroke clearly point to aneed for added emphasis on prevention.For those mothers who cannot or whochoose not to breast-feed, supplementa-tion of infant formula with LCPUFAsmay offer their children additionalhealth benefits. Supplemented formu-lae, however, also are associated withadditional cost, and programs must bedeveloped to permit widespread avail-ability across socioeconomic strata.

Ofthe 250 patients surveyed, approximately 80% experienced acute pain after surgery. Of thesepatients, 86% reported moderate, severe, or extreme pain, with more patients experiencingpain after discharge than before discharge. Experiencing postoperative pain was the most common concern (59%) among patients. Almost 25% of patients who received pain medications experience adverse effects; however,nearly 90% of them were satisfied with their pain medications. Approximately two-thirds ofpatients reported that a health care professional talked with them about their pain. In addition to postoperative pain, many patients suffer from postoperative nausea and vomiting. A 1994 study found the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting to be 37%and 20%, respectively. 2 Despite an increased focus on pain management programs, development of new standards for pain management, and efforts to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting, manypatients continue to suffer from pain, nausea, and vomiting after surgery. Several comple-mentary therapies increasingly are being employed to meet patients' postoperative needs. Music therapy and guided imagery A Swedish study compared the effect of intra-operative to postoperative music on postop- erative pain in a controlled trial. 3A total of 151 patients undergoing day case surgery for inguinal hernia repair or varicose vein surgery under general anaesthesia were randomlyassigned to one of three groups: Group 1 listened to music intra-operatively; group 2 listenedto music postoperatively; and group 3, the control group, listened to white noise. Resultsshowed that patients exposed to music intra-operatively or postoperatively reported signifi-cantly lower pain intensity at hours 1 and 2 postoperatively and patients in the postoperativemusic group required less morphine at hour 1 compared to the control group. In an experimental pilot study, researchers examined the effects of music therapy, guided imagery, and standard care on postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting, andlength of stay for gynecologic laparoscopic patients. 4Results indicated that patients in both the music therapy and guided imagery groups had significantly less pain on discharge thanthe patients in the standard care group. Ginger ( Zingiber officinale ) Researchers from Thailand recently published the results of a randomized, controlled clin- ical trial assessing the efficacy of ginger to prevent nausea and vomiting after outpatientgynecological laparoscopy. 5Eighty patients were randomly assigned to group A (n = 40) orEXECUTIVE EDITOR Russell H.

Group A received 2 capsules of ginger (1 capsule contained 0.5 g of ginger powder) one hourbefore the procedure while the patients in group Breceived placebo. Visual analogue nausea scores(V ANS) and vomiting times were evaluated at two, four,and 24 hours after the operation. There was a significant difference in the incidence of nausea between group A (12, 30%) and group B (24,57.5%). The V ANS was lower in group A than in groupB at two and four hours (P < 0.05), but no difference wasfound at 24 hours. Incidence and frequency of vomitingin group A were lower than group B, but this result didnot reach statistical significance. Acupressure A study from the University of Exeter assessed the effectiveness of continuous PC6 acupressure as anadjunct to anti-emetic drug therapy in the prevention andcontrol of nausea and vomiting in the first 24 hours aftermyocardial infarction. 6A total of 301 consecutive patients (205 males, 96 females) were included in thisstudy: The first 125 patients received no additional inter-vention. Subsequent patients were randomized toreceive either continuous PC6 acupressure or placeboacupressure. There were no significant differences between the groups for the whole 24-hour treatment period. Howev-er, the PC6 acupressure group experienced significantlylower incidence of nausea and/or vomiting during thelast 20 hours (18%) compared with the placebo (32%) orcontrol (43%) groups (P < 0.05). The severity of symp-toms and the need for anti-emetic drugs also werereduced in the acupressure group, but these differenceswere not statistically significant. Acupuncture Researchers from South Korea recently conducted a study on the effect of auricular acupuncture on postoper-ative nausea and vomiting. 7One hundred female patients undergoing transabdominal hysterectomy wereentered into the study. The patients were divided intotwo groups (auricular acupuncture treatment group andnon-treatment group) in order to test the effectiveness ofauricular acupuncture. There was no significant differ-ence in age, weight, height, or duration of anesthesiaamong the two groups of patients. There was a significant difference between the con- trol and auricular acupuncture treatment groups in theincidence of vomiting 12 hours after surgery (68% and30%, respectively, P < 0.01). No noteworthy side effects from treatment were observed. In another study, researchers compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture in arthroscopic acromioplasty sub-jects to determine whether they would manifest signifi-cantly better recovery as demonstrated by: UCLA shoul-der scale, improved range of motion, diminished pain,decreased need and duration of analgesic use, andenhanced patient satisfaction. 8 Thirty-five subjects completed the four-month study. Real acupuncture subjects scored significantly better onUCLA shoulder scale (P < 0.000); pain intensity (P <0.022); self-reported analgesic use (P < 0.008); angles ofabduction (P < 0.046); and in six of eight health statusquestionnaire components. The authors concluded thatacupuncture offered significantly greater improvementwith regard to: pain level, analgesic use, range ofmotion, and patient satisfaction. References 1. Apfelbaum JL, et al.
