What Happens When You Smoke Crystal Meth The following video from National Geographic discusses what exactly happens in your brain when you smoke crystal meth and why it is so addictive. Credit: National Geographic Effects of Crystal Meth Abuse Crystal meth works by affecting the communication chemicals dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the brain and activating the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. The [effects of crystal meth](https://drugabuse.com/drugs/crystal-meth/effects-use/) in recreational doses are powerful and can lead to psychological and physical addiction. The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse reports that users initially report feeling confident and powerful, with limitless energy, increased productivity, enhanced sexual performance, and decreased appetite. Once these initial euphoric effects wear off, however, the experience can take a bad turn\u2014with chronic abuse leading to serious and immediate negative consequences: - Anxiety. - Depression. - Mental confusion, psychosis, and paranoia. - Fatigue. - Headaches. - Extreme weight loss. - Picking at your skin, resulting in scabs. - Tooth decay\u2014or \"meth mouth.\" - Sensation of insects crawling on/under your skin. - Jaw clenching. - Seizures. - Respiratory disease. - Heart disease. - Cardiac arrest. - Stroke. - Death.

Human brains continue to develop until the mid-20s, and powerful drugs such as crystal meth can have a major [impact on brain development](https://drugabuse.com/addiction/health-issues/neurological-risks/). Teens may also be unaware of the risks of drug use. In fact, though many youth users acknowledge the health risks and social costs of heavy substance use, they still think of the use of crystal meth more positively than that of heroin or crack cocaine. Drug education regarding the dangers that come with substance abuse is a vital part of crystal meth abuse prevention. Talking with your teen about these risks can help keep them safe. Crystal Meth Abuse Treatment Treatment for methamphetamine abuse may take on multiple forms, depending on the individual's needs. The first phase of treatment\u2014 [detoxification](https://drugabuse.com/drugs/methamphetamine/detox/)\u2014may proceed more smoothly with careful monitoring by experienced medical staff. Withdrawal can be profoundly uncomfortable, and it can sometimes elicit depressive episodes. [Relapse risks](https://drugabuse.com/addiction/relapse/) are therefore high during the period of acute detox. Acute symptoms of abuse are often [treated with medications](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/medications/) to alleviate the discomfort of crystal meth side effects and withdrawal: - Hyperactivity, agitation, or psychotic features\u2014If needed, these may be treated with a dopamine-blocking medication such as haloperidol\u2014an antipsychotic that decreases abnormal excitement in the brain. - Other behavioral and psychiatric effects\u2014 [Benzodiazepine drugs](https://drugabuse.com/benzodiazepines/)such as diazepam (Valium) may be used to relieve anxiety, muscle spasms, and seizures. Therapy for Meth Addiction Treatment Dependence and addiction can often prove difficult to manage due to high rates of dropout and relapse, severe cravings, protracted [mental health issues](https://drugabuse.com/mental-health-drug-abuse/) (including depression and psychosis), and the inability of some users to experience pleasure in the absence of a drug. Currently, there is no widely accepted model for [crystal meth abuse treatment](https://drugabuse.com/drugs/crystal-meth/treatment/). In the past, antidepressants were utilized, but this treatment was not found to be especially effective in the long run. Modern treatment programs use various forms of [counseling or therapy](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/therapy/) to address the issues surrounding abuse and dependence. Therapies that have been found to be effective in treating meth addiction are: [Contingency Management](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/therapy/contingency-management/)\u2014Uses positive reinforcement to keep patients abstinent, leading to longer periods of drug abstinence.
