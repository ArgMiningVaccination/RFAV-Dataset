However, in reprinting this pamphlet it has been revised to make it more complete, and to include the charts of ships' section which were developed at the Navy Yard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Charles Piozet, Director of Personnel. (III) PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION \"Nomenclature of Naval Vessels\" has been prepared primarily for use in the apprentice schools at the various navy yards and stations. It is believed, however, that it will be found useful for reference purposes by engineers, draftsmen, inspectors, and others interested in the construction of naval vessels. The materials developed in the courses of instruction for \"in-service\" training at the Navy Yards, Mare Island, Philadelphia, and Boston, have been used in the preparation of this book. The Design Division of the Bureau of Ships assisted in compiling and revising the material. Charles Piozet, Director of Personnel. (V) INTRODUCTION In its construction, a ship or vessel, like a building, is started on its foundation and carried through to completion by the fitting and securing of its many parts together to form a designed shape. However, the nomenclature of the several members of which the ship is composed and the parts and spaces provided in its erection differs from that used for buildings. The foundation of a ship is called the KEEL and extends FORE and AFT from BOW to STERN, which, when speaking of a building in a similar way, would be from front to back. The STEM is located at the very forward end of the keel and the STERN POST to which the RUDDER is attached is at the after end. The keel is the \"backbone\" of the ship, and extending outward from it to form the \"ribs\" or framing of the ship are the FRAMES, to which steel PLATES are welded or riveted to form the \"skin\" or SHELL of the ship. The ship is divided into it many spaces by \"walls\" called BULKHEADS, and these spaces or rooms are called COMPARTMENTS or TANKS as the case may be. Corresponding to the floors of a building of several stories are the DECKS and PLATFORMS which are made of steel plates laid across steel beams called DECK BEAMS. The \"windows\" of a ship are called PORTHOLES, and entrance into compartments or tanks is gained through DOORS, HATCHWAYS, SCUTTLES, or MANHOLES. The \"chimneys\" are called STACKS or FUNNELS. The ship is driven through the water by the PROPELLER, sometimes called the WHEEL, and it is steered by the RUDDER. Looking from the stern in a direction toward the bow, the right-hand side of the ship is called STARBOARD, the left-hand side, PORT. When a ship is being constructed, the frames are shown on blueprints and are numbered from the forward toward the stern commencing with the first frame at the bow of the ship. The zero point is taken at the FORWARD PERPENDICULAR, which is a design point on the stem of the ship, the first frame aft of this point being called FRAME #1, the second, #2, and continuing consecutively to the AFTER PERPENDICULAR which is a design point located at the after end of the ship. Usually frames on a ship are (VII) evenly spaced; however, in some sections, as for example, the very bow of the ship, the frames are close together due to strength requirements. The various units placed aboard ship are located fore and aft, according to a position, relative to a certain distance from the closest frame; up or down relative to a certain distance above or below a particular deck or the base line; and port or starboard relative to a certain distance from the CENTER LINE of the ship. The following expression is given as an example of ship terms, and shows how a workman would locate himself aboard ship to do a job assigned to him. He steps ABOARD ship from a \"walk\" called a GANGWAY, walks across the deck to either the PORT or STARBOARD side (as the case may be), goes (upstairs) ALOFT or TOPSIDE by means of a \"stairs\" called a LADDER to the DECK above (do not say upstairs or downstairs); or after crossing the DECK, he goes through a HATCHWAY below on the LADDER to the second deck, walks forward along a \"hall\" called a passageway, goes through another HATCHWAY and down the ladder to the first PLATFORM, walks along another passageway and removes a MANHOLE COVER to gain entrance to the COMPARTMENT below, which happens to be located between frames #26 and #35. A naval vessel, when constructed with both an inner and an outer bottom, has a DOUBLE BOTTOM, the spaces between the inner and outer bottoms being called DOUBLE BOTTOM TANKS. This construction provides protection against flooding of compartments and possible sinking of the ship should a hole be torn in the outer bottom. BULKHEADS between compartments and other sections of the ship are made oiltight or watertight to prevent leakage should adjacent compartments be filled with oil or water, respectively. The HULL or SHELL must also be made watertight. The shell plates are laid end to end in rows called STRAKES from stem to stern, some of the strakes being given special names; as, for example, the bottom strake port and starboard next to the keel is called the GARBOARD STRAKE. Plates are usually spoken of by weights instead of thicknesses, said weight being the weight for a square foot of plate surface of a given thickness. A 5-pound plate is a plate 1/8 inch thick, each square foot weighing 5 pounds, and using this as a factor, a 71/2-pound plate would be 3/16 inch thick, a 10-pound plate, 1/4 inch thick; a 20-pound plate, 1/2 thick, etc. (VIII) Various structural shapes are used for framing and strength members in ships. Some of the shapes (shown in cross section) are as follow: (IX) NOMENCLATURE OF DECKS AND NUMBERING OF WATERTIGHT COMPARTMENTS There are two types of decks--complete decks and partial decks. A complete deck is a deck running the full length of the ship and a partial deck is a deck running only part of the length of the ship. Decks are named according to their location above or below the main deck, which is the highest deck extending from stem to stern. A partial deck above the main deck at the bow is called the \"forecastle deck\"; at the or \"poop deck,\" is applied to a partial deck extending from amidships to either bow or stern. A partial deck above the main, upper, forecastle, or poop deck and not extending to the side of the ship is called the \"superstructure deck.\" A complete deck below the main deck is called the \"second deck.\" Where there are two or more complete decks below the main deck, they are called the \"second deck,\" \"third deck,\" \"fourth deck,\" etc. A partial deck above the lowest complete deck and below the main deck is called the \"half deck.\" A partial deck below the lowest complete deck is called a \"platform.\" Where there are two or more partial decks below the lowest complete deck, the one immediately below the lowest complete deck is called the \"first platform,\" the next is called \"second platform,\" and so on. Decks which for protective purposes are fitted with plating of extra strength and thickness are further defined, for technical purposes, as \"protective\" and \"splinter,\" in addition to their regular names. Where there is only one such deck, it is defined as \"protective\" and where there are two, the lower one is defined as \"splinter\" in addition to the regular names. Watertight compartments are specified by letters and numbers. Compartments in each division are numbered beginning at the forward end of each division. The ship is considered as divided into three principle divisions, lettered, A, B, C, from forward aft. Division A.-- This comprises all of the space between the stem and the forward transverse bulkhead of the forward machinery compartment. Division B.-- This comprises all of the space between the forward transverse bulkhead of the forward machinery compartment and the after transverse bulkhead of the after machinery compartment. Division C.-- This comprises all of the space aft of the after transverse bulkhead of the after machinery compartment. The term \"machinery compartment\" is construed as meaning firerooms, boiler rooms, engine rooms, main motor rooms, main machinery --1-- spaces, and compartments in which auxiliaries of the main propelling machinery are located. Where the number of the compartments in the 1 to 100 series exceeds 100 in any principal division, the matter is referred to the Bureau of Ships. These divisions are considered as extending from the keel to the highest deck in the line of the bulkheads, or the bulkheads prolonged. In case the bulkheads do not extend to the highest deck, any space between decks that extends through two of the principal divisions is numbered as if it were situated entirely in the forward division of the two in which it is placed, and has this number only. Main compartments with permanent openings to the top side, such as boiler rooms, are considered as completely bounded by tight structure for numbering purposes. All numbers in each division begin at the forward end of that division. Compartments on the starboard side of the ship have odd numbers; those on the port side, even numbers. All compartments and spaces that are completely bounded by watertight, oiltight, airtight, or fumetight structure are numbered. Where a watertight compartment located below the weather deck is divided into two or more airtight or fumetight spaces by airtight or fumetight bulkheads, the appropriate number is assigned the watertight compartment and each airtight or fumetight subdivision within the compartment is designated by the addition of a suffix to this number. Thus, if watertight compartment A-312L contains a fumetight or airtight longitudinal bulkhead, the space to starboard of this bulkhead is designated as A-312-1L and the space to port as A-312-2L. Oiltight and watertight compartments in each division on the main deck are numbered from 101 to 199, and those on each successive deck or platform below the main deck are number in the next higher hundred series; namely, those on the second deck are numbered from 201 to 299; on the third deck, from 301 to 399, etc. Watertight compartments on the next deck or platform above the main deck are numbered 0101 to 0199, and those on each successive deck or platform above the main deck are numbered in the next higher hundred series, prefixed with a zero. For example, a ship that has a superstructure, forecastle, main, second and third deck, and a first and second platform, the oiltight and watertight compartments are if there are no more platforms||601||to||699| --2-- Upper inner bottom compartments are numbered from 801 to 899 and lower inner bottom compartments are numbered 901 to 999. It will be noted that the prefix zero of a compartment number indicates that the compartment is above the main deck. If there is not a third deck, the compartments on the first and second platforms and in the hold are numbered 301 to 399, 401 to 499, and 501 to 599, respectively. If there is a fourth deck, the compartments on the fourth deck and first and second platforms and hold are 401 to 499, 501 to 599, 601 to 699, and 701 to 799, respectively. On modern destroyers the compartment numbers in each division are as follows: hold||401||to||499| Compartments in each division with no decks, extending from inner bottom or outside plating through two or more deck spaces, such as those in protective layers, engine rooms, boiler rooms, deep peak tanks, fuel-oil tanks on certain battleships, cargo holds, etc., are numbered from 1 up to 100. Boiler and engine rooms are given the lowest numbers, B-1, B-2, B-3, etc. Where there is a half deck owing to the sheer or other cause, or where there is a flat between regular decks, such as cofferdam flat over oil tank, no change in the hundred series in made on account thereof. The above scheme of numbering is intended to give an indication of the vertical location of the compartment which, in connection with the divisional fore and aft location, will give a very fair idea of the position of the compartment. The number of a compartment is always prefixed with the letter indicating the general division of the ship in which it is placed and separated from the number by a hyphen, as A-21, B-3, etc. To define further the contents or main use of a compartment, the compartment number is followed by a designating letter, as follows: |A for storerooms, including:| |Band room. | Refrigerator compartments. Storerooms proper. |Tool and supply rooms. | Unassigned compartments usable as storerooms. |B for battery compartments, including:| |Secondary battery compartments. | |All compartments within turrets, including turret-handling rooms.| --3-- |C for ship control and fire control, including:| |Central. | Coding room. Interior communication. Main communication station. |Plotting room. | Radio rooms. Switchboard room (secondary battery). Torpedo tracking room. |E for machinery compartments, including:| |Blower room. | Boiler room. Distribution room. Evaporator room. General workshop. Gyro stabilizer room. Ice-machine room. Laundry. Main engine room. |Main motor room. | Main operating room. Pump room. Searchlight rheostat room. Shaft alley. Steering gear room. Storage battery room. Thrust block room. Windlass room and chain locker. |NOTE.--The E may be omitted from the main propelling machinery compartments, comprising main engine rooms, boiler rooms, and main motor rooms.| |F for fuel compartments, including:| |Fuel compartments. | Diesel oil compartments. |Relay tank rooms.| |LUB for lubricating oil storage tanks.| including:| |Gasoline |Crew's spaces. | Officers' quarters. |Prisons. | Water closet and wash rooms. |M for ammunition spaces, including:| |Bomb magazines. | Catapult charge magazines. Fixed ammunition magazines. Handling rooms except turret. Mine charge magazines. |Powder magazines. | Shell rooms. Small-arms magazines. Torpedo war head magazines. |V for void compartments, including:| |Cofferdam compartments. | Void double-bottom |Void wing water compartments, including:| |Drainage tanks. | Fresh-water compartments. |Peak tanks. | Reserve feed compartments. --4-- A double-bottom compartment used for feed water is designated B-910 W, for oil B-909 F, if void A-902 V. When a space is devoted to several main purposes, two or more designating letters are used. Thus a living compartment containing a secondary battery guns is designated B-115 B L. NOMENCLATURE OF MACHINERY SPACES Fireroom.-- A compartment containing boilers and the station for \"firing\" or operating same. Boiler room.-- A compartment containing boilers but not containing station for \"firing\" or operating the boilers. Boiler operating station.-- A station from which a boiler or boilers are operated. Boiler central control station.-- A station for directing control of all boilers at boiler operating stations. Boiler emergency station.-- A station for a chief water tender from which he may proceed with minimum delay to any fireroom, boiler operating station, or boiler room from which trouble has been reported. Engine room.-- A compartment in which the main propelling unit or units are installed. Engine operating station.-- A location or compartment from which a main propelling unit or units are operated. Machinery spaces.-- A collective term designating all the major compartments in which machinery under the cognizance of the Bureau of Ships is located. NUMBERING COMPARTMENTS The number of compartments is shown by means of label plates and tags of two types--engraved and embossed. Doors, hatches, and manholes are also numbered by means of label plates and tags. The inscription on door, hatch, or manhole plates is combined with that of the compartment or several compartments to which they provide access. Label plates are placed in a conspicuous location where they may be readily seen. Specifications for labelling are described in the pamphlet \"General Specifications--Appendix 10\" issued by the Bureau of Ships. The following is an example of an inscription taken from the label plate on a door: | 4-16-2 | C.P.O. Stores A-412 The first line of the inscription is the number of the door, the second, the designation of the compartment, and the third, the compartment number to which the door gives access. --5-- From the above it will be noted that the door, hatch, or manhole number consists of two or three parts, separated by hyphens. The first part corresponds to the deck number; the next part, the frame number just forward of the hinge of the door; and the last part, the number of the door, if there is more than one door on the same frame on the deck designated by the first part; if not, the third part may be omitted. For the first part of their numbers, hatches and manholes take the number of the deck through which they are cut. Odd numbers are used in the third part for doors located on the starboard side and even numbers on the port side. For example: Door 3-24-1 is on the third deck, frame 24, or between frames 24 and 25, starboard side. Door 3-24-2 is on the third deck, frame 24, or between frames 24 and 25, port side. Hatch 3-24-2 is on the third deck at or immediately aft of frame 24 on the port side. In the principle living compartments and elsewhere throughout the length of a ship as may be necessary to locate readily a particular place, every fifth frame is numbered in accordance with \"General Specifications--Appendix 10.\" The numbers may be seen on the seen on the beams in a conspicuous place along passageways and other routes of travel and are located as near the bottom edge of a beam as practicable. Abbreviations allowable when inscription are more definite idea of the various parts of the hull of a ship may be obtained by closely examining a ship model in the Apprentice School or Drafting Room, and the plates at the back of this book. --7-- [Glossary of Shipbuilding Terms] Toward the stern of a ship; back; behind; back of; further aft than. ABEAM ABOARD ABREAST Side by side; over against; opposite to. ACCOMMODATION LADDER Stairs slung at the gangway, leading down the vessel's side to a point near the water, for ship access from small boats. AFT Near the stern; toward the stern. AFTER BODY That portion of a ship's body aft of the midship section. AFTER FRAMES Frames aft of amidships, or frames near the stern of the ship. AFTER PEAK The aftermost tank or compartment forward of the stern post. AFTER PERPENDICULAR A line perpendicular to the base line intersecting the after edge of the stern post at the designed water line. On submarines or ships having a similar stern, it is a vertical line passing through the point where the designed water line intersects the stern of the ship. AIR CASING A ring-shaped plate coaming surrounding the stack and fitted at the deck just below the umbrella, to protect the deck from heat and to help ventilate the fireroom. AIRCRAFT CARRIER A vessel designed to carry aircraft and fitted with a flying deck from which aircraft are launched and on which they land. A floating flying field which usually operates as a unit of a fleet. AIR PORT An opening in the side or deck house of a vessel, usually round in shape and fitted with a hinged frame in which a thick glass is secured. The purpose of the air port is to provide light and ventilation to and vision from the interior of the ship. In some instances the air port is also provided with an additional solid metal hinged cover for purposes of protection of the interior should the glass be damaged or to prevent light from showing from within. ALOFT In the top or upper rigging; on the yards; above the decks. AMIDSHIPS In the vicinity of the middle portion of a vessel as distinguished from her ends. The term is used to convey the idea of general locality but not that of definite extent. ANCHOR A heavy iron or steel implement attached to a vessel by means of a rope or chain cable for holding it at rest in the water. When an anchor is lowered to the bottom, the drag on the cable causes one or more of the prongs, called flukes, to sink into or engage the ground which provides holding power. ANCHOR, BOWER The large anchors carried in the bow of a vessel. Three are usually carried, two (the main bowers) in the hawse pipes, or on bill boards, and a third (spare) lashed on deck or elsewhere about the vessel for use in the event either of the main bowers is lost. The weight varies with the size and service of the ship. ANCHOR, KEDGE A small anchor used for warping or kedging. It is usually planted from a small boat, the vessel being hauled up toward it. The weight varies, being usually from 900 to 1,200 pounds. ANCHOR, SEA This is not a true anchor, as it does not sink to the bottom. It is a conical-shaped canvas bag required by the Steamboat Inspection Service to be carried in each lifeboat. When placed overboard it serves a double purpose in keeping the boat head-on into the sea and in spreading a vegetable or animal oil from a container placed inside the bag. It is sometimes called an oil spreader. ANCHOR, STREAM An anchor weighing from about one-fourth to one-third the weight of the main bowers and used when mooring in a narrow channel or harbor to prevent the vessel's stern from swinging with the current or the tide. ANGLE ANGLE BAR A bar of angle-shaped section used as a stiffener and for attachment of one plate or shape to another. ANGLE BULB A structural shape having a bulb on one flange of the angle, used as a frame, beam, or stiffener. ANGLE COLLAR A collar or band made of one or more pieces of angle bar and fitted tightly around a pipe, trunk, frame, longitudinal, or stiffener intersecting or projecting through a bulkhead or deck for the purposes of making a watertight or oiltight joint. See Stapling. ANNEAL To heat a metal and to cool it in such a fashion as to toughen and soften it. Brass or copper is annealed by heating to a cherry red and dipping suddenly into water while hot. Iron or steel is slowly cooled from the heated condition to anneal. APPENDAGES Relatively small portions of a vessel extending beyond its main outline as shown by transverse and water plane sections, including such items as shafting, struts, bossings, docking and bilge keels, propellers, rudder, and any other feature, extraneous to the hull and generally immersed. APRON A reinforcing timber bolted to the after side of the stem. ARBOR The principal axis member, or spindle, of a machine by which a motion of revolution is transmitted. ARCHING Sometimes used in lieu of \"hogging\". AREA OF SECTIONS The area of any cross section of the immersed portion of a vessel, the cross section being taken at right angles to the fore and aft centerline of the vessel. ASTERN Signifying position, in the rear of or abaft the stern; as regards motion, the opposite of going ahead; backwards. ATHWART Across, from side to side, transverse, across the line of a vessel's course. ATHWARTSHIP Reaching across a vessel, from side to side. AUXILIARIES Various winches, pumps, motors, engines, etc., required on a ship, as distinguished from main propulsive machinery (boilers and engines on a steam installation). AWNING A rooflike canopy of canvas suspended above a vessel's decks, bridges, etc., for protection against sun and weather. --B-- Used for the same purpose but on the opposite side to a bosom bar. BACK BOARD A portable back support nicely designed and fitted on the after side of the stern thwart in a small motor or row boat. BACK STAY Stays which extend from all mast levels, except the lower, to the ship's side at some distance abaft the mast. They serve as additional supports to prevent the masts going forward and also contribute to the lateral support, thereby assisting the shrouds. BAFFLE A plate or structure placed in the line of flow of fluids or gases to divert the flow in order to obtain greater contact with heating or cooling surfaces. BALANCED RUDDER A rudder with its axis between the forward and after edge. BALK A piece of timber from 4\" to 10\" square. BALLAST Any weight carried solely for the purpose of making the vessel more seaworthy. Ballast may be either portable or fixed, depending upon the condition of the ship. Fixed or permanent ballast in the form of sand, concrete, lead, scrap, or pig iron is usually fitted to overcome an inherent defect in stability or trim due to faulty design or changed character of service. Portable ballast, usually in the form of water pumped into or out of the bottom, peak, or wing ballast tanks, is utilized to overcome a temporary defect in stability or trim due to faulty loading, damage, etc., and to submerge submarines. BALLAST TANKS Tanks provided in various parts of a ship for introduction of water ballast when necessary to add weight to produce a change in trim or in stability of the ship, and for submerging submarines. BALLAST WATER Sea water, confined to double bottom tanks, peak tanks, and other designated compartments, for use in obtaining satisfactory draft, trim, or stability. BALLASTED CONDITION A condition of loading in which it becomes necessary to fill all or part of the ballast tanks in order to secure proper immersion, stability, and steering qualities brought about by consumption of fuel, stores, and water or lack of part or all of the designed cargo. BALSA A light wood; a South American raft made of light wood. BARGE A craft of full body and heavy construction designed for the carriage of cargo but having no machinery for self-propulsion. BATTEN Long, thin, strips of wood, steel, or plastic, usually of uniform rectangular section used in the drafting room and mold loft to lay down the lines of a vessel, but sometimes thinned down in the middle or at the ends to take sharp curves. A strip of wood or steel used in securing tarpaulins in place. To secure by means of battens, as to \"batten down a hatch.\" BATTENS, CARGO A term applied to the wood planks or steel shapes that are fitted to the inside of the frames in a hold to keep the cargo away from the shell plating; the strips of wood or steel used to prevent shifting of cargo. BATTENS, SEAM Wood seamstraps which connect the edges of small boats having a single thickness of planking. They give additional stiffness to the plank, are continuous, and frames are notched out to fit over them. BATTLE CRUISER A naval vessel having high speed, wide radius of action, guns of large size and range, and moderate protection; often defined as a ship cruiser speed and battleship armament, with full protection against cruisers and smaller vessels and capable of operation in all weather. BATTLESHIP A naval vessel having a large displacement, good speed, large radius of action, maximum armament, maximum protection against gun fire, bombs, and torpedoes, ability to keep at sea in all weathers and to bear the brunt of sea fighting as a line-of-battle ship. BEAM The extreme width of a ship. Also an athwartship or longitudinal member of the ship's structure supporting the deck. BEAM KNEE A bracket between a frame or stiffener and the end of a beam; a beam arm. BEAM LINE A line showing the points of intersection between the top edge of the beam and the molded frame line, also called \"molded deck line\". BEAM, TRANSOM A strong deck beam situated in the after end of the vessel connected at each end to the transom frame. The cant beams which support the deck plating in the overhang of the stern are attached to and radiate from it. BEAM, PLATE ANGLE A beam made from a flat plate, with the flange bent at right angles as by an angle-bending machine. BEARDING LINE A term applied to the intersection of the molded line of planking or plating and the stem, stern post, and keel, usually in connection with wood shipbuilding. BEARER A term applied to foundations, particularly those having vertical web plates as principal members. The vertical web plates of foundations are also called bearers. BEARING A block on or in which a journal rotates; a bearing-block. BELL In pipe fitting, the recessed or enlarged female end of a pipe into which the male end of the next pipe fits. In plumbing, the expanded female portion of a wiped joint. BELL MOUTHED A term used to signify the open end of vessel or pipe when it expands or spreads out with an increasing diameter, thus resembling a bell--also called trumpet mouthed. BELOW Underneath the surf the water. Underneath a deck or decks. BENDING ROLLS A large machine used to give curvature to plates by passage in contact with three rolls. BENDING SLAB Heavy cast-iron blocks with square or round holes for \"dogging down,\" arranged to form a large solid floor on which frames and structural members are bent and formed. BERTH A term applied to a bed or a place to sleep. Berths, as a rule, are permanently built into the structure of the staterooms or compartments. They are constructed singly and also in tiers of two or three, one above the other. When single, drawers for stowing clothing are often built in underneath. Tiers of berths constructed of pipe are commonly installed in the crew space. Also, a place for a ship. BETWEEN DECKS The space between any two, not necessarily adjacent, decks. Frequently expressed as \"Tween Decks.\" BEVEL A term for a plane having any other angle than 90 degrees to a given reference plane. Also, a small tool similarl to a try square except that the blade is adjustable to taking bevels. BEVEL, CLOSED A term applied where one flange of a bar is bent to form an acute angle with the other flange. BEVEL, OPEN A term applied where one flange of a bar is bent to form an obtuse angle with the other flange. Frame bars in the bow and the stern of a vessel are give an open bevel to permit access for riveting to shell and to keep the standing flange parallel to the deck beams. BIBB A cock or valve with a bent outlet; strictly, the bent outlet. BIGHT A loop or bend in a rope; strictly, any part between the two ends may be termed the bight. BILGE The rounded portion of a vessel's shell which connects the bottom with side. To open a vessel's lower body to the sea. BILGE PLATES The curved shell plates that fit the bilge. BILGES The lowest portion of a ship inside the hull, considering the inner bottom where fitted as the bottom hull limit. BILL BOARD An inclined platform, fitted at the intersection of the forward weather deck and the shell, for stowing an anchor. It may be fitted with a tripping device for dropping the anchor overboard. Seldom fitted since the stockless anchor has come into general use. BINNACLE A stand or case for housing a compass so that it may be conveniently consulted. Binnacles differ in shape and size according to where used and the size of the compass to be accommodated. A binnacle for a ship's navigating compass consists essentially of a pedestal at whose upper end is a bowl-shaped receptacle having a sliding hoodlike cover. This receptacle accommodates the gimbals supporting the compass. Compensating binnacles are provided with brackets or arms on either side, starboard and port, for supporting and securing the iron cylinders or spheres used to counteract the quadrantal deviation due to the earth's magnetization of the vessel. This type of binnacle is usually placed immediately in front of the steering wheel, having its vertical axis in the vertical plane of the fore-and-aft centerline of the vessel. BITTER END The inboard end of a vessel's anchor chain which is made fast in the chain locker. BITTS A terms applied to short metal or wood columns extending up from a base plate secured to a deck or bulwark rail or placed on a pier and to timbers extended up through and a short distance above a deck for the purpose of securing and belaying ropes, hawsers, cables, etc. Also called bollards. BITUMASTIC A black tarlike composition largely of bitumen or asphalt and containing such other ingredients as rosin, portland cement, slaked lime, petroleum, etc. It is used as a protective coating in ballast and trimming tanks, chain lockers, shaft alleys, etc. BLEEDER A small cock, valve, or plug to drain off small quantities of fluids from a container or system. BLIND PULLEY A circular block of hard wood with rounded edges perforated by several holes having grooves running from them to one side of the block. One of these blocks is secured to an end of a part of the standing rigging, as a shroud, and another to the chain plate or to some part of the ship and the two are connected to one another by a lashing passing through the holes. Commonly called \"dead eyes\". BLINKER LIGHTS Two electric lanterns secured at the ends of the signal yard and operated by controllers and a telegraph key for use in night signaling by code. BLOCK The name given to a pulley or sheave, or a system of pulleys or sheaves, mounted in a frame or shell and used for moving objects by means of ropes run over the pulleys or sheaves. The prefixes, single, double, triple, etc., indicate the number of pulleys or sheaves in the block. The five principal parts of a block are (a) the shell, or outside frame, (b) the sheave, on which the rope runs, (c) the pin, on which the sheave turns, (d) the strap, by which the hook is held in position and which provides bearing for the pin, and (e) the hook, which may be open, sister, or shackle and fixed or swivel. The opening between the top of the sheave and the shell is called the swallow, that between the bottom of the sheave and the shell is called the breech, and the device attached to the bottom of the block opposite the hook for securing the standing part of the fall to the block is called the becket. BLOCK, CHEEK A half shell block with a single sheave bolted to a mast or other object which serves as the other half shell or cheek. Usually used in connection with halyards. BLOCK, FIDDLE A block having two sheaves of different diameters placed in the same plane one above the other. BLOCK, SNATCH A single sheave block having one side of the frame hinged so that it can be opened to allow the bight of a rope to be placed on the sheave, thus avoiding the necessity of threading the end of the rope through the swallow of the block. Usually employed as a fair lead around obstructions. BLOWER A mechanical device used to supply air under low pressure for artificial ventilation and forced draft, usually of the centrifugal type.

COMPARTMENT A subdivision of space or room in a ship. COMPASS The compass is the most important instrument of navigation in use on board ship, the path of a ship through the water depending on the efficient working and use of this instrument. There are two types of navigational compasses, the magnetic, which has long been in use, and the gyroscopic, which has been developed within recent years. The former is actuated by the earth's magnetism, the latter by that property of a rapidly rotating body by which, when it is free to move in different directions, it tends to place its axis parallel to the earth's axis, that is, north and south. COMPASS, GYROSCOPIC The gyroscopic compass may have one or more gyroscopes. It is usually located as nearly at the rolling axis of the ship as possible and in a protected place. The directive force of a gyroscope, while 100 times more powerful than that of the magnetic needle, is still further amplified by an auxiliary electric motor sufficiently powerful to operate the compass card in azimuth. Repeater compasses, installed wherever desired about the ship, are operated by the master compass containing the gyroscopes by a simple electric follow-up system. The gyroscopic compass is not affected by magnetism from any source. It points to the true north, not the magnetic pole, and hence required no calculations for corrections. It is not affected by cargo or any type of magnetic field which may surround it and it is not disturbed by jars. It has become standard equipment in navies and is coming into more general use on commercial vessels. COMPASS, MAGNETIC There are two kinds of magnetic compasses, the Dry Card Compass and the Liquid Compass. The Dry Compass consists essentially of a number of magnetic needles, suspended parallel to each other, and fastened to the rim of a circular disc that has a paper cover upon which are marked the points of the compass and the degrees. This card rests upon a pivot centered in the compass bowl, which in its turn is suspended by gimbals in the binnacle or stand, the latter having means for lighting the card at night and for adjustment of compass errors due to magnetism of the ship. In the Liquid Compass, the bowl is filled with alcohol and water or with oil. The needles are sealed in parallel tubes and form a framework which connects the central boss with the outer rim, the whole resting upon a pivot in the compass bowl. Upon the rim are printed the points and degrees. The liquid compass is less susceptible to vibration and shock. The \"Standard Compass\" on board ship is a magnetic compass. COMPASS, RADIO This apparatus is used to determine the direction from which a radio wave is sent and the location of the sending station. It consists of a coil of wire wound around a frame and mounted on a vertical shaft which can be rotated. The radio wave is received by the operator, being loudest when the coil is at right angles to the wave and ceasing when the coil is parallel to the wave. Positions are determined by plotting the bearings to two known sending stations. The apparatus is especially valuable when a vessel is sufficiently close to the shore to contact two sending stations. COMPOSITE VESSEL A vessel with a metal frame and a wooden shell and decks. CORDAGE A comprehensive term for all ropes of whatever size or kind on board a ship. COTTER, KEY A solid key or wedge used to secure a wheel on a shaft or the like. COTTER, SPRING A round split pin used to lock a nut on a bolt.

DAGGER PLANK One of the planks which unite the heads of the poppets or stepping-up pieces of the cradle on which the vessel rests in launching. DAVIT A device used to lower and raise ship's boats and sometimes for other purposes. The rotary, or most common type, consists of a vertical pillar, generally circular in section, with the upper portion bent in a fair curve and having sufficient outreach to clear the side of the ship plus a clearance. Each ship's boat has two davits, one near its bow and one near its stern; they both rotate, lifting the boat, by means of blocks and falls suspended from the overhanging end, from its stowage position on deck and swinging it clear of the ship's side. This type of davit is usually stepped in a socket attached to the side of the vessel or on the deck next below the boat deck near the side and held in place at the boat deck by a keeper or bearing. DEAD EYE DEAD FLAT The midship portion of a vessel throughout the length of which a constant shape of cross section is maintained.

Corrections are made from these basic standards for variable density of the water. DISPLACEMENT, DESIGNED The displacement of a vessel when floating at her designed draft. DISPLACEMENT, FULL LOAD The displacement of a vessel when floating at her greatest allowable draft as established by the classification societies. In warships, an arbitrary full load condition is established. DISPLACEMENT, LIGHT The displacement of the vessel complete with all items of outfit, equipment, and machinery on board, but excluding all cargo, fuel, water, stores, passengers, dunnage, and the crew and their effects. Naval and merchant practice differs in one particular; in the former the machinery weights are dry, while the merchant light condition includes the water and oil in the machinery with boilers at steaming level. DOCK A basin for the reception of vessels. Wet docks are utilized for the loading and unloading of ships. Dry docks are utilized for the construction or repair of ships. DOCKYARD A shipyard or plant where ships are constructed or repaired. DOG A short metal rod or bar fashioned to form a clamp or clip and used for holding watertight doors, manholes, or pieces of work in place. DOG SHORES Diagonal braces placed to prevent the sliding ways from moving when the shores and keel blocks are removed before launching. Dog shores are the last timbers to be knocked away at a launching. Also called \"daggers\" or \"dagger shores\". DOLLY BAR A heavy steel bar used to hold against the heads of rivets while the points are being clinched when the space is not sufficient to permit the use of a regular holding-on tool. DOLPHIN A term applied to several piles that are bound together, situated either at the corner of a pier or out in the stream and used for docking and warping vessels. Also applied to single piles and bollards on piers that are used in docking and warping. DONKEY ENGINE A small gas, steam, or electric auxiliary engine set on the deck and used for lifting, etc. DOOR, AIRTIGHT A door so constructed that when closed it will prevent the passage of air under a small pressure.

DOOR, JOINER A light door fitted to staterooms and quarters where air and watertightness is not required. Made of wood, light metal, and metal-covered wood. Metal joiner doors with pressed panels are extensively used. DOOR, WATERTIGHT A door so constructed that, when closed, it will prevent water under pressure from passing through. A common type consists of a steel plate, around the edges of which a frame of angle bar is fitted, having a strip of rubber attached to the reverse side of the flange that is fastened to the door plate. The strip of rubber is compressed against the toe of the flange of an angle-iron door frame by dogs or clamps. DOOR, WEATHERTIGHT A term applied to outside doors on the upper decks which are designed to keep out the rain and spray. DOUBLE BOTTOM A term applied to the space between the inner and outer skins of a vessel called respectively the \"inner bottom\" and \"shell\", usually extending from bilge to bilge and for nearly the whole length of the vessel fore and aft, and subdivided into water or oil tight compartments. In some cases, and generally in warships, the inner bottom is carried above the bilges to a deck at or near the waterline. Where more than one inner skin is fitted, as is sometimes the case, the two spaces are known as the \"lower bottom tank\" or \"void\" and the \"upper bottom tank\". The outer skin is known as the \"shell\", the skin next to it as the \"lower inner bottom\", and the third skin as the \"upper inner bottom\". DOUBLING PLATE An extra plate secured to the original plating for additional strength or to compensate for an opening in the structure. DOWEL A pin of wood or metal inserted in the edge or face of two boards or pieces to secure them together. DRAFT, DRAUGHT The depth of the vessel below the waterline measured vertically to the lowest part of the hull, propellers, or other reference point. When measured to the lowest projecting portion of the vessel, it is called the \"draft, extreme\"; when measured at the bow, it is called \"draft, forward\"; and when measured at the stern, the \"draft, aft\"; the average of the draft, forward, and the draft, aft is the \"draft, mean\", and the mean draft when in full load condition is the \"draft load\". DRAFT MARKS The numbers which are placed on each side of a vessel near the bow and stern, and often also amidships, to indicate the distance from the number to the bottom of the keel or a fixed reference point. These numbers are six inches high, are spaced twelve inches bottom to bottom vertically, and are located as close to the bow and stern as possible. DRAG The designed excess of draft, aft, over that forward, measured from the designer's waterline. The drag is constant and should not be confused with trim. DRIFT When erecting the structure of a ship and rivet holes in the pieces to be connected are not concentric, the distance that they are out of line is called the drift. This should be corrected by reaming the holes, but common practice, which is prohibited in naval work, is to drive tapered pins, called \"drift pins\", into the unfair holes to force them into line. DRIFT PIN A conical-shaped pin gradually tapered from a blunt point to a diameter a little larger than the rivet holes in which it is to be used. The point is inserted in rivet holes that are not fair, and the other end is hammered until the holes are forced into line. DRY DOCK, FLOATING A hollowing floating structure of L- or U-shaped cross section, so designed that it may be submerged to permit floating a vessel into it, and that it may then raise the vessel and itself so that the deck of the dock and consequently the bottom of the vessel is above the level of the water. The bottom of a floating dry dock consists of one or more pontoons or rectangular-shaped vessels with high wing structure erected on one or both sides according to whether the section is to be L- or U-shaped. The deck of the pontoon is fitted with stationary keel blocks and movable bilge blocks which can be pulled under a vessel from the top of the wing structure. Pumps are fitted in the wings by which the dock can be quickly submerged or raised. Floating dry docks are used for repairing and painting the under-water portions of vessels and for docking a damaged vessel. DRY DOCK, GRAVING A basin excavated at a waterway and connected thereto by gates or a caisson which may be opened to let a vessel in or out and then closed and the water pumped out. The dock is fitted with stationary keel blocks and movable bilge blocks, which usually are fitted on rack tracks, allowing them to be pulled under a vessel before the water is pumped out. Graving docks are common in navy yards, and although more expensive to construct than floating dry docks, they are practically permanent and supply a more rigid foundation for supporting a ship. The gate of a graving dry dock is usually a caisson which is a complete vessel in itself, having a strong rectangular-shaped keel and end posts which bear against the bottom sill and side ledges at the entrance of the dry dock. The caisson is designed so that its draft may be adjusted by water ballast until it bears against the sill and ledges and is equipped with flood valves and power pumps to make this adjustment. When a ship is to be docked, sluice valves in the caisson or in the deck structure are opened until the water in the dock reaches the same level as the water outside. The caisson is then floated to one side, allowing a vessel to enter the dock. The caisson is then floated back to close the entrance, completely separating the basin from the waterway, and after the vessel is lined up over the keel blocks the water is pumped out of the dry dock. DRY DOCK, RAILWAY A railway dock consists of tracks built on an incline on a strong foundation and extending from a distance in-shore sufficient to allow docking a vessel of the maximum size for which the dock is built, to a distance underwater sufficient to allow the same vessel to enter the cradle. The cradle running on the tracks may be of wood or steel fitted with keel and bilge blocks and sufficiently weighted to keep it on the track when in the water. A hoisting engine with a winding drum or wild cat is fitted at the in-shore end of the railway which operates the cradle by a cable or chain. This type of dry dock is used for docking small ships. It is commonly called a \"marine railway\". DUCTILITY That property of a material which permits its being drawn out into a thread of wire.

FACTOR OF SAFETY The ratio between either the ultimate strength of the elastic limit of the material and the allowed working stress. The former is usually referred to as the \"nominal factor of safety\" and the latter as the \"real factor of safety\". Elastic materials may have both nominal and real factors of safety, while for those materials having approximately the same values for ultimate strength and elastic limit, the distinction between real and nominal factors of safety is nonexistent.

LAUNCH A term applied to a small power or motor boat. See launching. LAUNCHING A term applied to the operation of transferring a vessel from the building ways into the water. End launching and side launching methods are employed; the former method is used when the vessel is built at an angle, usually at right angles, to the waterfront and the vessel is launched stern first, while in side launching the vessel is built parallel to the waterfront and launched sidewise. In preparing for an end launching, usually groundways, made of heavy timbers are laid with an inclination of about 1/2\" and 5/8\" to the foot parallel to the center line of the ship one on either side of the keel, and spaced about one-third of the beam of the vessel apart. These groundways run the length of the vessel and for some distance out under the water. On top of the groundways are placed the sliding ways, also heavy timbers, and between these two ways is placed a coating of launching grease. The sliding ways are prevented from sliding on the greased groundways by a trigger or similar device and dog or dagger shores. Cradles are built up to fit the form of the vessel, and between the sliding ways and the cradle, wedges are driven and the weight of the ship thus transferred from the building blocks to the sliding ways. After the building blocks and shores are removed, the trigger is released and gravity causes the vessel to slide down the inclined ways. In some cases hydraulic jacks are set at the upper end of the groundways to exert pressure on the sliding ways to assist in overcoming initial friction along the ways. A similar procedure is followed in the case of side launchings, except that more than two groundways are usually used, depending on the length of the ship, and the inclination of the ways is steeper.
