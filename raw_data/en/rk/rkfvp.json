Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome consisting of widespread musculoskeletal pain, thought to be neurologic in nature. It is also associated with fatigue, problems with sleep, mood changes and difficulty focusing. Currently, the cause is unknown, but genetics is thought to play a role. There is no current cure for fibromyalgia. Therefore, treatment targets symptoms of the condition. Fibromyalgia affects around 2% to 4% of the population and is more common in women. The typical age of onset is around 30-50 years of age. Many other conditions may have similar signs and symptoms, so it's important to see your primary healthcare provider to get a complete checkup if you are experiencing symptoms. Fibromyalgia diagnosis The American College of Rheumatology identifies criteria for a fibromyalgia diagnosis as: - Pain and symptoms over the past week, based on the total of number of painful areas out of 19 parts of the body, plus level of severity of these symptoms: Fatigue Waking unrefreshed Cognitive (memory or thought) problems Plus a number of other general physical symptoms - Symptoms lasting at least three months at a similar level - No other health problem that would explain the pain and other symptoms The pain associated with fibromyalgia is commonly described as burning, sore, achy or stiff. Symptoms are typically worsened in cold or humid temperatures, with poor sleep and when under physical or mental stress.
