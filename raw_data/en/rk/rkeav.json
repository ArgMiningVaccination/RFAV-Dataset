Complementary medicine includes herbs, supplements, exercise, massage, and mind-body therapies. Find out how these therapies work and what benefits they may have for you.", "sitename": "WebMD", "date": "2021-04-09", "cleaned_text": "[cause pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/cause-chronic-pain), [fatigue](https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/why-so-tired-10-causes-fatigue), [constipation](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-constipation), loss of appetite, and other unpleasant symptoms. Complementary and alternative treatments may help you relieve these symptoms or ease the [stress](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/default.htm) of living with [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/default.htm). The term \"complementary and [alternative medicine](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-alternative-medicine)\" refers to treatments that are not part of standard medical care. They can include [massage](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits), [acupuncture](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/ss/slideshow-acupuncture-overview), [tai chi](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/video/tai-chi-health-benefits), and herbal remedies. There's some overlap between this term and naturopathy, [homeopathy](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-homeopathy), and [holistic medicine](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/what-is-holistic-medicine). Complementary and alternative therapies for [multiple myeloma symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/multiple-myeloma/multiple-myeloma-stages-prognosis) and treatment side effects include: [Exercise](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/default.htm) - Herbs and [supplements](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/lifestyle-guide-11/default.htm) - Body-based or touch therapies, where a trained practitioner touches your body - Mind-body practices, such as [meditation](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/meditation-natural-remedy-for-insomnia) How They Work Complementary treatments work alongside your regular medical treatments to help you feel better and improve your quality of life. They're not a cure for any type of cancer. If you stop standard [cancer treatment](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/understanding-cancer-treatment) and only use alternative therapies, you could put your life at risk. Complementary and alternative treatments for [multiple myeloma](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/multiple-myeloma/myeloma-overview) may: - Ease [cancer symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/guide/understanding-cancer-symptoms)or drug side effects like [nausea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-nausea-vomiting)or [pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm) - Relieve [stress](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/what-is-stress)and tension - Help you [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/default.htm)better - Give you a greater sense of control over your cancer treatment and life Exercise If you're inactive and out of shape, your cancer treatments may be less effective. [Exercise](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/ss/slideshow-7-most-effective-exercises) can make a difference. It can also help maintain muscle strength, improve your [heart](https://www.webmd.com/heart/picture-of-the-heart) and [lung health](https://www.webmd.com/lung/default.htm), and ease stress as you deal with your cancer. If you'd like to see how exercise can help you, talk to your doctor about a safe way to get started before beginning any new [type of exercise](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/default.htm). Multiple myeloma often causes a drop in healthy [blood cells](https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood) that makes it harder to get enough exercise. As you start to exercise, take it slowly. Don't overdo it. If you have [anemia](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-anemia-basics), you should only do light activity so you don't get [too tired](https://www.webmd.com/balance/how-tired-is-too-tired). If your white blood counts are low, wear a mask to protect yourself from infections if you exercise away from home. Tai chi and [yoga](https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/the-health-benefits-of-yoga) are both gentle forms of exercise that may benefit people with multiple myeloma. Tai chi combines flowing movements with focused [breathing](https://www.webmd.com/lung/how-we-breathe). [Yoga](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/ss/slideshow-yoga-pose-basics) moves you through a series of poses. Research shows that both of these could [reduce stress](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/stress-management) and [anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/default.htm), ease pain and [fatigue](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/ss/slideshow-fatigue-causes-and-remedies), and improve [sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders-faq) in people who have cancer. Physical activity that requires you to support your own [body weight](https://www.webmd.com/obesity/healthy-weight) could reduce the risk of [bone](https://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/features/building-stronger-bones) breaks that comes with multiple myeloma. Go for an easy walk or dance in your living room. If you're up to it, climb a few steps. Stop if you feel any pain. Acupuncture This traditional Chinese therapy may ease several disease symptoms and treatment side effects. In acupuncture, a trained specialist inserts the tips of very thin needles into specific points on your body related to specific symptoms. One study showed that acupuncture may help control nausea, appetite loss, and drowsiness and reduce the need for pain medicine after a [stem cell transplant](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/cutting-edge-16/cancer-stem-cell-treatment), a common myeloma treatment. Cannabidiol (CBD) [Cannabidiol](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-1439-cannabidiol+cbd.aspx?activeingredientid=1439&activeingredientname=cannabidiol+(cbd)) (CBD) is an oil made from the same plant as [marijuana](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/marijuana-use-and-its-effects), but it doesn't contain THC, the substance in pot that makes you high. It's available over the counter in many locations. Early research suggests that [CBD oil](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-175441/cannabidiol+(cbd)+extract+oral/details) could help ease [chemotherapy side effects](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/tips-for-managing-chemotherapy-side-effects) [nerve pain](https://www.webmd.com/brain/nerve-pain-and-nerve-damage-symptoms-and-causes), [CBD oil](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/ss/slideshow-cbd-oil) or any cannabinoid product, talk with your doctor to make sure it won't interact with any of your [prescription drugs](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx). Turmeric Curcumin, the active ingredient found in the spice turmeric, is an [antioxidant](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/antioxidants-your-immune-system-super-foods-optimal-health) that may ease [inflammation](https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/about-inflammation) and swelling. Some very early research suggests that curcumin could work with multiple myeloma [chemotherapy](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/chemotherapy-what-to-expect) to make treatment more effective. But this spice can interact with some cancer drugs. Talk with your doctor before you take turmeric supplements or add a lot of the spice to your diet. Vitamin D People with multiple myeloma often have low levels of [vitamin D](https://www.webmd.com/diet/supplement-guide-vitamin-d). Healthy levels of this vitamin can protect you from bone complications that are common in this type of [blood cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/types-and-differences). Some research shows that [vitamin D](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/video/vtamin-d-and-your-health) may improve bone mineral density and muscle function and lower your risk of falls. The standard dose is 400-600 IU per day. But your doctor may want you to take a higher dose if your [vitamin D](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/ss/slideshow-vitamin-d-overview) levels are low. Body-Based or Touch Therapies Body-based or touch therapies could ease pain and stress or just improve your well-being. You might try some of the following: - Massage therapy can relieve [muscle pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/pain-management-myofascial-pain-syndrome-muscle-pain)and help you relax. Tell your massage therapist you have multiple myeloma and to use light touch to protect your bones, which may be weak. - Reflexology is a type of [foot massage](https://www.webmd.com/balance/foot-massage-health-benefits). The therapist presses on certain points on your [feet](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/foot-pain-causes-and-treatments)to relieve symptoms like pain or nausea or just to help you relax. [Reiki](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/reiki-overview)is a therapy in which a practitioner holds their hands over certain places on your body while you lie still. They don't touch your body. Their [hand](https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/rm-quiz-handfacts)movements are meant to channel healing energy to ease tension or pain. [Aromatherapy](https://www.webmd.com/balance/video/aromatherapy-benefits), or use of fragrant [essential oils](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/essential-oils-neuropathy), can go along with massage therapy or stand alone. It may reduce stress and anxiety or just help you relax. If your [skin](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/picture-of-the-skin)is sensitive due to chemotherapy or [radiation](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-to-expect-from-radiation-therapy), use scented candles instead of oils. Mind-Body Therapies Mind-body therapies use the power of your mind to promote well-being and healing. They include meditation, guided imagery, [music therapy](https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/music-therapy), qi gong, and visualization. These therapies may help ease stress and muscle tension, improve sleep, relieve treatment side effects like nausea, vomiting, pain, and [fatigue](https://www.webmd.com/women/rm-quiz-fatigue-something-else), or just improve the way you feel. What to Know Before You Try Complementary Therapies Before you try any complementary treatments for multiple myeloma, talk to your oncologist. They can tell you whether the therapy is safe for you, if it will interact with your cancer treatments, and if it's likely to be effective. "}
