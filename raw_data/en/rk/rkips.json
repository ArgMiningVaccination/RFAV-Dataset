The growing number of women on active duty and the diverse occupational exposures associated with military service make reproduc tive health issues a special concern for the DoD. In response to this concern, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs directed the establishment of a birth defects registry for military families in 1998. The Deployment Health Research Depart ment at the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) in San Diego was given the responsibility of managing the DoD Birth and Infant Health Re search (BIHR ) program . Objective: The primary objective of the BIHR program is to increase the understanding of the reproductive health effects of military service by providing systematic surveillance of DoD beneficiary births and scientifically rigorous research of maternal, pregnancy, and infant health outcomes , with the potenti al to assess the health of infants captured in the BIHR database into early childhood . Approach: BIHR data analysts have established direct access to large databases for thorough capture of pregnancy and maternal outcomes among military beneficiaries, a nd all birth and health outcomes up to the first birthday in infants born to military families , or beyond for those with continuous care in the system through early school age . Scientific protocols are developed to evaluate epidemiologic associations betwe en these outcomes and specific exposures of concern, including military occupations and military - unique exposures of concern. Value: The BIHR p rogram responds to the needs of military families in addressing their reproductive health concerns with strong science and surveillance. These projects focus research on appropriate health risks and contribute to the understanding and progress in the prevention of maternal, pregnancy, and infant health challenges . Collaboration: The BIHR team has a long history o f collaboration with leading experts from a variety of scientific disciplines. Past or ongoing collaborations includ e projects with professionals from the University of Notre Dame , Dartmouth College , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , the Defense Health Agency Immunization Healthcare Division (DHA IHD), and several pharmaceutical companies . The BIHR program maintains ongoing collaborations with residents and staff at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Scie nces and military treatment facilities. Support: The BIHR program was funded by the DoD Health Affairs and US Department of Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery under work unit number 60504 through FY22 , and is supported under DoD Health Affairs Policy Memo 99 -006. Several specific research protocols received funding through competitive grants from the Congressional ly Directed Medical Research Program, Peer -Reviewed Medical Research Program, administered by the U S Army ; as well as by DHA IHD. FDA post -marketing surveillance studies for specific vaccines receive funding from the vaccine manufacturer. Contacts: The Principal Investigator of the BIHR program and the vaccine focused reproductive health studies is Dr. Ava Marie Conlin . The primary performing site for these efforts is the Deployment Health Research Department at the NHRC in San Diego, CA. The study team welcomes inquirie s and collaborations and can be contacted by phone at 619 -553- 9255, DSN 553 -9255 or by email at USN .NHRC -BirthResearch @health .mil. 2 Updated March 2023 SUMMARY FINDINGS Select Publications - Please contact the BIHR team for a complete list of citations Goodman DC, Romano CJ, Hall C, Bukowinski AT, Mu TS, Gumbs GR, Conlin AS, Vereen RJ, Leyenaar JK.

Pregnancy and posttraumatic stress disorder : associations with infant outcomes and prenatal care utilization . J Matern Fetal Neonatal with current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), no associations with adverse infant outcomes were observed, and these women initiated prenatal care (PNC) earlier and had higher PNC utilization compared to pregnant Servicewomen without PTSD.

This descriptive study examined characteristi cs of US active duty military women associated with a PTSD diagnosis during pregnancy, 2007 -2014. Compared with noncases, PTSD cases were more likely to be White non-Hispanic, unmarried, in the Ar my or Marine Corps, and to have previously deployed. Other demographic and occupational characteristics, comorbidities, and receipt of psychotropic medication differed substantially among PTSD cases and noncases in this large records -based study.
