More than 400,000 deaths resulted from about 200 million cases of malaria in 2017. Currently, there are no malaria vaccines available and the current medications used to treat the disease are failing due to emerging parasite resistance. However, researchers at LSU have developed a malaria vaccine and are working toward making it commercially available worldwide. LSU Department of Pathobiological Sciences Research Assistant Professor Paul Rider has created several anti-malaria vaccines and with support from the LSU Board of Supervisors, he is working on quantifying the specific anti-malaria immune responses generated by vaccination. Rider is one of 12 innovative researchers to receive a Leveraging Innovation for Technology Transfer, or LIFT2, grant made possible by the LSU Board of Supervisors, for his discovery that has the potential to save lives. \"It's difficult to find these types of grant opportunities that enable us to finalize our proof-of-concept data, which is essential for commercialization of this herpes virus-derived malaria vaccine. The LSU LIFT2 grants are unique in that regard and as a tool to spur research in Louisiana that has a large-scale social or economic benefit,\" said Rider, whose work on this project expands previous work in the laboratory of LSU Department of Pathobiological Sciences Professor K. Gus Kousoulas using the Herpes Simplex Virus vaccine, or VC2. The LSU LIFT2 fund supports academic researchers as they advance their innovations and technologies from the lab to the marketplace. By providing a bridge over the critical gap between basic research and commercialization, the LSU LIFT2 fund awards grants to researchers on a competitive basis twice a year to develop market-facing prototypes and to validate the market potential of their inventions. Since 2014, 120 research projects have received funding. More than $4 million has been awarded by the LSU Board of Supervisors through this competitive grant to researchers across all of LSU's campuses. \"University research often plays a critical role in the technological or medical advances that have shaped our society and world. The LSU LIFT2 grants are a vital part of cultivating innovation at universities,\" said LSU Office of Innovation & Technology Commercialization Director Andrew Maas. Innovations include creative and artistic works as well as devices, drugs, software and other more traditional inventions; thus, personnel from all disciplines on all LSU campuses are strongly encouraged to consider an application to further develop an invention which has been previously disclosed to their campus technology transfer office.
