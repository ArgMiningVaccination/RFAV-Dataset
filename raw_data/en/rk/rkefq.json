Culturally competent treatment programs offer Native American healing rituals that provide relief from generational trauma and develop inner resilience. Royal Life Centers' Native American Program (NAP) allows our guests to experience, explore, and reconnect to tribal teachings and ancestral knowledge, helping them cultivate a fulfilling, sober lifestyle. We developed our Native American Program to promote a healing opportunity for both tribal and non-tribal guests at Royal. We are committed to ensuring that our guests recover from addiction and restore life's natural order during our culturally competent treatment program for Native Americans. Our Native American Program for Drug and Alcohol Treatment Royal's Native American Program addresses the mental and behavioral health risk factors involved with drug and alcohol abuse, through the integration of culturally competent activities. In doing so, we hope to motivate native and non-native guests as they participate in Native American healing rituals and progress toward healthier lifestyles for the betterment of themselves, their families, and their community. Chiefly, NAP courses, ceremonies, and peer-support gatherings expose you to the ceremony of healing in an inclusive and respectful environment. We value the importance of inclusivity, believing in its power as a powerful component of healing. For this purpose, guests participating in our Native American Program become a part of a healthy, life-changing movement. In general, tribal healing courses include talking circles and hands-on activities that increase self-confidence and the desire to recover from addiction. Overall, Native American programs work to remove substance abuse in native people and the feelings of social isolation. At the same time, Native American programs offer treatment services that help to increase positive and productive behaviors within tribal communities. We also want to acknowledge the team at Wellbriety in addition to the local tribes of Washington state. The efforts of our team and local tribal leaders who provide insights, support, and guidance have helped us build a successful, culturally competent Native American program. Royal Life Center's Wellbriety-Certified Treatment Programs Royal Life Centers is honored to be a part of the White Bison Wellbriety family as one of only 10 [ Wellbriety Certified Treatment Centers](https://whitebison.org/treatment-centers/). More specifically, we proudly offer our Native American Program for guests undergoing treatment in one of our five facilities located across the beautiful state of Washington. Our NAP is led by competent and highly experienced indigenous staff and consultants, many of whom are White Bison certified Wellbriety trainers. Wellbriety's certification gives us the opportunity to honor the centuries-old traditions of holistic healing in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Above all, Royal upholds the principles of integrity, gratefulness, generosity, respect, and honoring of all of our tribal and non-tribal guests. In collaboration with the Wellbriety movement, Royal's NAP group facilitators introduce you to Native American healing practices to improve your mental and spiritual well-being. In addition, our Native American Program offers education on the triggers of drug and alcohol abuse and its effects. Through Wellbriety's courses, our NAP instills a stronger understanding of cultural identity while addressing the prevalence of substance use disorders within Native American communities. These groups also aim to dismantle the underlying toxic beliefs resulting from generational trauma to help you heal from addiction. Wellbriety & White Bison The Wellbriety movement brings hope, healing, unity, and forgiveness to individuals, families, and communities across the United States and Canada. Treatment centers that join the Wellbriety movement participate in training seminars so that they may integrate Wellbriety courses into their rehabilitation programs for Native people in their communities. Once a substance use treatment center completes the Wellbriety training process, it becomes a Wellbriety Certified Treatment Center. The Wellbriety-certified facility then integrates culturally competent care into the recovery process of Indigenous individuals seeking help for alcohol and substance use disorders.

All in all, culture is an essential ingredient for a healthy life and living in balance in the spirit and natural world for all people. For Indigenous communities, culture is central to a Native person's tribal identity, social status, and physical and spiritual existence. In the same way, our Native American Program ensures that each culturally competent course represents the tribal connection to the guiding principles that lead to a spiritual way of life. Within our culturally competent treatment process, you'll learn about the essential life principles of native ancestors as a way to learn healthy grieving practices through culturally centered modalities.

As a result, you develop the necessary skills for the purpose of instilling healthy grieving behaviors and self-acceptance. Overall, our Native American Program presents an opportunity for a \"new\" beginning for many tribal and non-tribal guests. Regardless of culture or upbringing, guests suffering from substance use disorders resulting from trauma can regain a sense of oneness with their surroundings in Royal's NAP.

The Importance of Culturally Inclusive Treatment Services For recovery to be authentic for each of our guests, we make the integration of cultural traditions a priority. For this reason, we incorporate Native American ceremonies, practices, and crafts to ensure that our guests can honor their traditions. In addition, our Sumner facility has built a sweat lodge for ceremonial healing. Addiction treatment for Native American people needs a foundation of culture, tradition, and values in addition to evidence-based practices. The essence of Native American culture\u2014the spiritual ideology of interconnectedness\u2014enabled a healthy, harmonious existence. Unfortunately, the introduction of European settlers disrupted the cultural practices, harming the Native people's way of life. Following the years of colonial abuse, many natives struggle to find their way back to their cultural roots. In order to revitalize this culture of interconnectedness, we work with you to reinvigorate your spirit's link to your surroundings. Therefore, your participation in culturally competent care will help to bring you clarity and wholeness in recovery. The Significance Behind Our Native American Program We are excited to offer tribal treatment services that specialize in healing Native people. This is because we understand that the inclusion of culture is much more than acknowledging a lifestyle. In fact, culture is the connection to a guiding philosophy of existence for Native people.

Royal Life Centers seeks to heal tribal and non-tribal members with the holistic Native American practices of our Wellbriety-certified treatment programs in the state of Washington.
