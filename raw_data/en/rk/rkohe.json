The unit has explained in detail one of the most important soft skills i.e. Communication. In this unit we shall study other important soft skills that will help youto earn an edge in your personal, social as well as professional life. In fact these soft skills are directly related to your personality and will help you to develop a personality suitable for travel and tourism industry. 1.2 Defining Personality Before we start defining personality, let's have a trip down the memory lane and remember two of your neighbourhood or ol d school friends with whom you have interacted. One is liked by everyone. She/he makes friend very quickly, smiles and greets people. Always a favourite student of teachers as well as favourite of all relatives and neighbours. Everyone enjoys talkingto and being around him/her. The other one always complains and has trouble keeping friends for long. She/he bosses his little siblings at home. Always a troublemaker at school and neighbourhood. Allkids complain that she/ he picks up the fight. Even in the school she/he is never able to be a part of sports team. What is the difference between the two? The difference is their different personalities . The concept of personality is one of the major topics of interest for some of the top psychologist. In this unit we will define it from the view point of social attractiveness of an individual not from the scientific view point. The word 'personality' has its roots in Latin word 'persona' which means a mask. In ol d days in order to represent qualities of a typical character of drama on stage masks were used. Personality in general terms means the unique set of qualities (i.e. physical, mental and emotional attitudes, values, interests) thatIntroduction t o Tourism - II 3make you different from others. Personality is actually how you present yourself to others and how people define you. Your personality is everything about you. Oxford Dictionary defines personality as a combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual's distinctive character . Here the question which tickles our mind is that what all comes under personality? Encyclopaedia Britannica describes personality includes way of thinking, feeling and behaving.Personality embraces moods, attitudes and opinions and is most clearly expressed in interactions with other people. It includes behavioural characteristics that distinguish one person from another and that can be observed in people's relations to the environment and to the social group. The case of two friends discussed in the beginning of this unit also highlights the fact that in simple term personality means social skills. The difference in their social skills like one is friendly, collaborator and other is domineering, troublemaker brings out the differences intheir personality. Thus personality is being used as a general label for the amount of social skill and finesse. 1.3 Determinants of Personality Each individual has unique personality. Have you ever think how personality is shaped? There are certain factors which shape personality of individual called determinants of personality. A survey of works of different psychologist brings forward a plethora of determinants of personality. Here to keep things basic we will discuss the generic determinantsof personality These are: 1. Heredity 2. Culture 3. Family Background 4. Our Experiences through Life and 5. The People we interact with 1. Heredity Oxford dictionary describes heredity as the passing on of physical or mental characteristics genetically from one generation to another. We inherit certain traits, such as the colour of our eyes, the shape of our face and body from our father, grandfather and great grandfather. Mainly these four aspects of personality we inherit i.e, body buil d, physical attractiveness, physical defects and health conditions from our ancestors. Most people are born with a mixture of traits. Heredity forms your basic personality. And then the effects of our environment ad dto our personality development. Environment includes everything and everyone around us. Environment may help bring out certain traits more than others. The other four determinants we will study now constitute ourenvironment. 42. Culture Culture can be defined as the ideas, customs and social behaviour of a particular people or society. We learn values and inclination from our culture and it shapes our behaviour. Behaviour defines our personality. Thus people born in different cultures tend to develop different types of personalities. In India we can find diversity in cultural backgrounds andeach culture has some general features that highlight personality of people of that culture in general. For example, people from Gujarat are more enterprising, people from Haryana are daring and people from Bengal are creative and have great intellectual bend. Also it is notnecessary that all people belonging to a culture showcase the similar personality trait but in general according to culture the dominating personality trait is found in majority of people. 3. Family Background Family is the smallest unit of society. Family is a group of people related by blood or marriage. The foremost influencer after heredity to shape personality of a baby is family. Many aspectsof family like background and education of parents, socio-economic status, the number of chil dren in the family and birth order and extended members of the family such as uncles and aunts influence the shaping of personality to a considerable extent. Think once your liking -disliking, way of problem solving, way of expressing your feelings etc. All are one in other way a reflection of what you have learned from your family. 4. Experiences in Life One of the famous quotes by Julio Caesar - \"Experience is the teacher of all things\" bestexplains this determinant of personality. Your personality might have kindness as a trait but repeated experience in your life where you felt cheated due to kindness can influence yourthis personality trait for future. Suppose three such incidents happened to you with three different individuals in the past few months where you have given money but they never came back to you. What is the probability that you woul d trust another person who comesand asks you for a loan tomorrow? Rather low, one woul d think. Thus, certain personality characteristics are moul ded by frequently occurring positive or negative experiences in life. 5. People We Interact With \" A Person is known by the company he or she keeps\" is a common proverb. We interact with an array of people in our life like - neighbours, teachers, classmates, schoolmates, friends,cousin, colleagues, boss and even strangers etc. People who are alike us in attitude and value we persuade them and associate with them. Even we change our behaviours to get accepted and associated with them whom we like. For instance, we may have to become less aggressive,more cooperative to work successfully in a team etc. Thus, our personality becomes shaped throughout our lives by at least some of the people and groups we interact with. In summary, our personality is a function of both heredity and environment (external factors) that shape it and keep it shaping.Introduction t o Tourism - II 5REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.

The word ' personality' has its roots in Latin word _________ __ which means _______. 3. In simple term personality means _____________________________________________________.4.

A person's neighbourhood has the greatest effect on his or her personality.3. Early experiences are very important to shape personality.4. Personality is natural as well as nurtured. ACTIVITY In terms of the definition of personality that is offered here in this text, write an essay about yourself. Identify what is unique about you. Finally, include in your essay as many factors in your heredity or environment as you can find that affect your daily behaviour and thought. Once you finished the essay above, ask a friend to write a similar essay about you. Once your friend has finished, compare your own essay (the answer sheet!) with that of your friend. How are the y similar? How do they differ? If both you and a friend did the essay suggested above, and then compares your essay about yourself with a friend's essay about him- or herself.How many parts of your essays are similar and how many are different? What factors do you both mention as influencing your personality? 1.4 Personality Devel opment The above discussion on determinants of personality brings to light an age ol d debate that whether personality is natural or nurtured. In this regard, the central view supported byacme psychologist is that each individual is born with basic personality. To cope up with the challenges offered by external environment individual strive to change and develop personality in meaningful ways throughout the lifespan. Thus, personality development is a continuous and multi-faceted process which requires a set of skills that need to be learned and at times unlearned.6The need to develop your personality in line with personal and professional requirements underlines the process of personality development. This is true particularly in the present times where sea-change has occurred in the realm of industries, where now only technicalknowledge of doing things is not the sole criteria of selection and where wide cluster of skills are required to cater to the changing demand of industry. In this assortment of wide cluster of skills the social attractiveness of personality is paramount important. Hence it is clear that an intelligent individual can identify the expectations of the profession he/she wants to pursue and work on the desired personality traits. This will help him/her to have awell developed conducive personality and earn a competitive edge over others. It is more relevant in Tourism Industry where a well developed personality having high social attractiveness is more imperative and demanded thanany other skill set. The reason for same has been discussed in the earlier unit last year. Now the question arises how can we develop a personality which is most suitable for tourism and travel industry? What are the areas of our personality which we shoul d fine tune to become an asset for tourism industry? To answer this question, first we shoul d remember that tourism is a people to people industry where the service provider is an integral part of the tourism product. For example: the comfortof five star hotel room like high quality bed and linen, best of antiques in room, international quality good food, costly furniture etc. are useless if the people serving in hotel lack professional serving attitude, manners, communication skills and have poor hygiene sense etc. Thus, essentially we can say that to have a happy customer (tourist) at the end of the day the people serving in tourism industry shoul d have: 1. Positive Attitude to work. 2. Well Groomed Personality to create first impression. 3. Social Etiquettes & Telephonic Etiquettes. 4. Professional Body Language. Thus, eventually these above - mentioned areas turn into the key aspects of personality which require to be developed to have a desired personality fortourism industry. In succeeding pages we will study these areas to learn how to develop personality for tourism industry. Introduction t o Tourism - II 7REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.

The teacher shoul d then ask students that as a tourism service provider what personality traits they think can be a recipe to make a tourist happy. Give them 10minutes to think over it. Once the students have done with their recipe then the teacher shoul d discuss the following recipe for happy tourist and also discuss the personality traits this recipe highlights. 1. One smile 2. Two eyes 3. One voice 4. One mind5. Two ears 6. One firm handshake The smile gives visitors a warm welcome. Eyes establish direct contact with them. One voice and mind gives the tourist a perception of the enchanting sounds and8picturesque scenery of the region. Two ears are essential for listening to what the visitors are looking for. One firm handshake wishes them a pleasant stay. Spiceit up with a well-trained staff. Bake well at summer temperatures before opening and you will have a visitor information centre to be proud of. (Source: Hospitality and Tourism Activity by New Brunswick, Department of Education.) 1.5 Positive Work Attitude Attitude is another stimulating and mystifying subject of interest to many researchers as well as psychologist. Attitudeand personality has a deep relationship as attitudes play amajor part in determining a person's personality. That is whyit is important to know what attitude is, how attitude affectspersonality and how to have positive attitude at yourworkplace. Attitude as defined by Oxford Dictionary is a settled way of thinking or feeling or evaluation (positive/ negative) about some person, object or issue. Attitude is how we look at things, events, people around us and it all starts inside our head. We can say that attitude is our mental focus on the worl d around us i.e. the socially significantobjects. We can focus it on whatever we want - either on good or bad, positive or negative,problem or opportunity. On what an individual chooses to focus can become a habit, habitforms our behaviour, behaviour becomes part of our psyche, then it is reflected in our activitiesand finally it becomes the core of personality. Thus, by changing our focus (i.e attitude) wecan change our personality. Power of Positive Attitude Researchers have proved that a person who focuses on positive side of anything, be a person,event or object are happier, live longer and become successful in their life as compared to thosewho have negative attitude. The statement of the most influential American Phil osopher William James further strengthens this fact. He had said that \"Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.\" The power of positive attitude has been reinforced by a study of Harvard University also which says that the main driving force to get a good job in eighty-five percent cases is attitudeand remaining fifteen percent is the technical know-how. Thus positive attitude enhancesour personality traits and lifts our personality to a more attractive level both in personal aswell as professional arena of life. Furthermore following points highlight the power of positiveattitude: Introduction t o Tourism - II 91. A positive attitude triggers our enthusiasm. 2. A positive attitude enhances our creativity. 3. A positive attitude makes good things happen. Positive Work Attitude Till now we have understood that a positive attitude is a virtue for one's personality. But to be always positive at your workplace whether school, office or society is not very easy. Everyday we face many ups and downs especially at work place. Sometimes we feel positive andsometimes we feel negative. It becomes necessary for us to handle these ups and downspositively. How we can do this? Following strategies can help us to have a positive workattitude irrespective of any circumstances at work place: 1. Examine Your Attitude Regularly: Every day one shoul d examine his/her attitude towards work, co-workers and boss whether it's positive or negative. Ifit's positive do your co-workers and boss perceive it positively or not? Also if it isnegative then what are the reasons behind it? When you question yourself likethis, you will definitely find a problem, and if problem is there it must have asolution. Then try to solve this problem by adjusting you attitude or if required byeven changing your attitude from negative to positive. 2. Balance Work with Personal Life: Another strategy is to have a mix of fun and work. For this you shoul d establish your priorities in life. Priorities mean somethingthat is more important than other things. At home family shoul d be priority and atwork place office work shoul d be priority .We shoul d not think about work whenat home and also shoul d not allow family concerns disturb our office work. Settingpriorities and meeting them successfully make our attitude more focused andpositive. 3. Focus on the Positive: Always focus on your strengths and successes even if you are not able to be successful in all aspects of your work and in your relationshipsin the job. 4. Communicate: Communication is lifeline of all relationship. When communication stops, miscommunication begins and negativity spreads. Thus it is very importantto communicate effectively as well as listen patiently. You shoul d be able to makeother understand what you want to say and at the same time understand properlywhat they want to communicate. Practice good listening and communication skillsevery day. 5. Turn Unexpected Changes int o Opportunity: Change is inevitable and change10always bring friction. Human beings soon adapt themselves to a routine and any change in it brings negative reactions. Example - Change of Boss or co-worker orjob profile. But one can learn to accept change and remain positive. Focus onwhat one can learn from this change and see the change as an opportunity to learnnew things and grow. 6. Educate Yourself: One shoul d be well -versed in one's job only then one can enjoy it. One shoul d put effort to educate oneself in all areas where improvementsare required. Even if you know your job well always try to update your knowledgeand learn new things. Be a lifelong learner. The more you learn, the more confidentyou will be. 7. Maintain Your Interest: A new job means new challenges and many new things to learn. But with passage of time the challenges become routine affairs and youstart feeling bored and negativity increases .Thus, you shoul d look for ways toregain the interest. Take new initiatives and invent new ideas for doing routinetasks. 8. Maintain a Sense of Humour: Humour can help you to overcome tension at work and see the lighter side of the things. Having a sense of humour does notmean joking or clowning around. Having a sense of humour means developing theability to see positive things and lessen the tension in environment. The famousquote of 34 th President of U.S.A Dwight D. Eisenhower reemphasizes the importance of humour - \" A sense of humour is part of the art of leadership, ofgetting along with people, of getting things done.\" 9. Take Care of Your Health: There is a direct relationship between healthy habits, productivity and positive attitude. A person who has habit of exercising daily willdefinitely have good health and high productivity at workplace. Such individualwill have high positive energy and attitude towards everyone in the office. But ifyou sleep very late, do not exercise in the morning, have low level of energy atoffice definitely your productivity will be less and negative attitude will increase inyou, your boss and also co-workers. Thus poor health habits can affect your jobperformance and your attitude. 10. Dress for Success: Last but not the least. How you dress and how you carry yourself reflects your attitude. In fact this is one of the most important areas ofpersonality development and also our next important topic under study. This pointis explained in later pages as a separate topic. Thus, the above mentioned ten strategies help us to maintain positive attitude and thus can make our personality advantageous for tourism industry.Introduction t o Tourism - II 11REVIEW QUESTIONS 1.

You with your team are representing your school in this project competition. The final day of project presentation is on last Saturday of this month and you want that your schoolwins the best project title. You have to come to school on Sundays to help with a special project. At the same time, your family is moving to a new home. Your family is counting on you to organize the move and help pack. You are exhaustedbecause of the physical and mental demands that are being placed on you. You are torn between your need to spend time at home and your desire to show your mettle as project leader in school competition. Case Discussion: (Moderation by teacher) 1. List three options for dealing with your situation.2. List the option you woul d choose, and explain why you woul d choose it. 1.6 Creating First Impression & Grooming Often you have heard the famous phrase -' First impression is the last impression' . Have you ever thought what this impression is, how it is formed, why first impression is so important12and how one can make first impression extraordinarily? In this section we shall try to answer these questions. According to Oxford dictionary impression is an idea, feeling or opinion about something or someone, especially one formed without conscious thought or on the basis of little evidence. As the definition highlights when we meet somebody for the first time without knowing much about other in totality we create an idea about him/her. Also, the first impression becomes very important because the idea which is created lasts long. In fact a study by Harvard Business School social psychologist, Amy Cud dy, says that if in first few seconds of meeting we are able to show trustworthiness and confidence as leadingtrait of our personality then we earn a long lasting relationship. And these two traits are conveyed not on the basis of one's intelligence or experience, rather than on basis of one's attire and grooming level . Thus one has to work on these two aspects of one's personality to make first impression extraordinary. Attire / Cl othing Attire means the way we dress up. As we judge books by their covers similarly we judgepeople by their clothes. Also the way we dress up show our attitude towards life. It is very important to wear clothes which convey positive about us. But how can we do this especially in our work place? The thumb rule is that we shoul d adapt ourselves to the dress-code of the work place. When we follow the dress -code of the industry than we project an image which gel with the image and work -culture of the work-place. In tourism industry it is very important because the way we carry ourselves convey the image of the company as well as the quality of service. This is the reason why airline employeeswear high quality formal clothes to reassure high quality of service. Thus, at the work place what we wear indicates towards our professionalism. Also two types of clothing are common in tourism industry - Business Formals (generally Monday to Thursday) and Business Casual(generally Friday). The following two images give a description of types of business formals and business casuals prevalent in tourism industry. Grooming The second important area which helps you to create a first good impression is grooming.The Oxford dictionary defines grooming as a noun (derived from 'groom') which means to have a neat and tidy appearance. It is imperative to take care of your overall appearancewhich includes neatness and cleanliness of body and hair. It also includes how we manage accessories which we put up with our clothes like belt, shoes, purse, watch, jewellery etc. Daily grooming is a must -must especially for work place . Your health, as well as the health of others, depends on your practices of personal cleanliness. Also, if we are not well groomed then even the most costly clothes do not help a person to create a good impression. Overdo of make-up and use of accessories can destroy the most professional attire.Introduction t o Tourism - II 13 (Source: Instructional Guide: Business Attire by The University of Texas at Austin14Thus, to have a true professional formal look at workplace one has to take care of many do's and dont's of dressing and grooming. The following general grooming tips help you to be professionally groomed: 1. Hair: Clean and neatly styled, no wet hair, no over the top colours or hairstyles. For Men go for a shorter haircut, and trim chest hair (no hair visible at the neckline!). (Source: Instructional Guide: Business Attire by The University of Texas at Austin)Introduction t o Tourism - II 152. Shoes: Polished and in good condition. 3. Nails: Clean, trimmed, neatly manicured. For women no extreme colors or length. 4. Cosmetics: Makeup shoul d be conservative, aim for a natural, polished look. 5. Perfume/Col ogne: Use very little or not at all, clothes should be odour free (no smoke smell!) 6. Facial Hair: Clean shaven or trimmed very short and neat. 7. Tatt oos: Cover all tattoos if possible. No Tattoo shoul d be visible. 8. Piercings: Remove all facial and body piercings. For women one earring per ear and for Men no earrings allowed. 9. Back-packs: Do not take a back-pack to an on-site interview. 10. Purse: A small, conservative handbag or business tote bag is acceptable. Bag shoul d coordinate with shoe colour. The above details in attire and grooming when taken care of help you to create a positive professional first impression and in this way your battle is half won in the beginning. REVIEW QUESTIONS True and False: 1. Bol d colours such as bright green or pink are good choices for a job interview. 2. Putting too much accessories enhance our professional look. 3. Some employers can mandate that you do not have any facial hair. 4. Ear piercing for men is allowed as professional grooming standard..5. Tattoos shoul d be covered by clothing if possible. 6. Your first job is taking care of yourself. 7. Keeping a wardrobe of professional work clothes is always expensive.8. You want to make sure your appearance stands out in an interview, so that the interviewer concentrates most on how you look. 9. If you aren't certain about the dress code, you shoul d ask your employer. 10. Once you are hired for the job, you don't have to worry about your dress and grooming anymore.16 ACTIVITY Dress and Grooming Checklist: Have each student divide a piece of paper lengthwise down the mid dle. Instruct students to label one half or column \" At the Party\" and the other half or column \"On the Job.\" Instruct each student to make a list of all of the things they need to do-in terms of dress and grooming-to prepare for each of those two situations. Remind them that some things (like taking a shower) will be the same, but that others (like polishing dress shoes) may be different. Give students 5-10 minutes to prepare their personal checklists. When they are finished, come back together as a class and create a master checklist that includes everyone's suggestions. Write this checklist on the board or on overhead. Be sure to allow time for discussion of those items that are questionable. Also be aware that male and female students will have some what different lists. Discuss the dress and grooming similarities and differences between party dressing and being on the job. Which things woul d you only do for the party? Which things must you always do to be professional? Encourage students to revise their personal lists based on the master class list you created. 1.7 Basic Social Etiquettes Another area which helps us to define and shape your personality is Social Etiquettes. Oxford dictionary defines it as 'the customary code of polite behaviour in society or among membersof a particular profession or group.' Etiquette when defined most simply means respect, good manners and good behaviour we project in our social settings be it office, friends or family. It is not just each of these things,but it is all of these things rolled into one. For the purposes of this unit, we will focus on two major areas of business etiquette: Work and telephone. Work /Office Etiquette These days office is the place where we spent more waking hours of a day as compared toour home. Office environment and office people have become a vital part of our life andshape our success in life. It has become imperative to treat our office people and officeenvironment a notch better than family.

Business Telephone Etiquette Think of one day in your life without telephone. Out of all modes of communication thetelephone is the one of the most useful tools in every day communication. It has beenestimated that major percentage of today's business is conducted over the telephone, as it is18an immediate means of communicating. Particularly in tourism industry telephone is the most used way of communication with customer, supplier as well as within the office. The waytelephone call is answered create the image of the company. One can enhance theirprofessional reputation through polite and effective telephonemanners. It has been proved that if we cannot handle telephonecalls professionally then people think twice before doing businesswith the company. That's the reason these days companies havestandard operating procedure of handling phone calls in whichthese aspects are most important: 1. Answering the call 2. Making the calls3. Taking a Message4. Leaving a Message Answering the Telephone Answering promptly that is allowing no more than two or three rings before picking up the handset. An immediate response says a lot about you and promotesgood public relations. Answering with a smile which the caller will hear it in your voice. A cheerful voice begets a happy caller or listener, and a favourable impression is created. Speaking in a warm, audible, clear voice at a moderate phase so that the caller can follow the conversation. Not eating, drinking, smoking or coughing while talking into the mouthpiece. If you have to cough, excuse yourself first, cover the mouthpiece and cough awayfrom it. Always sound professional, pleased to hear from someone and ready to deal with their concerns.

One student will become a irritated customer who is not happy with the service delivered to him during his tour to London. Then two students will play role of customer care executives - one very effective in handling telephone callsprofessionally and one who lacks the basic telephone etiquettes. During the role play teacher shoul d note that the customer care executives follow the do's and do not's of telephone etiquettes. Other students should evaluate the effectiveness of execution and meanwhile learn that how by following telephoneetiquettes we can make an unhappy customer pacified and calm. 1.8 Positive Body Language We have already studied body language and its components last year. It is the study of movements of our body parts like eyes, head, hands, legs, sitting style, walking style etc. Which is called body language . It is also called Gestural Communication or Kinesics . It truly depicts the inner feeling going in our mind. We can fake our words to conceal our true inner feeling but our body movements convey it. Thus, we shoul d know how to depict a positive body language so that we give impression of a well -developed personality. We have to work on following areas of body: 1. Eye contact : Eye contact is the first thing that people look for when they meet usIntroduction t o Tourism - II 21first and good eye contact will give them a feeling of comfort and genuine warmth in your company, maintaining good eye contact shows respect and interest inwhat they have to say. Lack of eye- contact signifies in-attention and lack of interest. 2. Posture: Getting your posture right will automatically make you feel more confident. And when you feel good other people pick up on that. When we feel down we slouched over with your shoul ders drooping down and inward. Thiscollapses the chest and inhibits good breathing, which in turn can help make youfeel nervous or uncomfortable. 3. Head position: With our head position we convey many things .When we are confident and self assured we keep our head level both horizontally and vertically,when we project ourselves authoritative our head is in straight position. Conversely,when you want to be friendly and in the listening, receptive mode, tilt your headjust a little to one side or the other 4. Arms: One of the most interpreted body parts in body - language is arms. It gives away clues as to how open and receptive we are to everyone. We shoul d alwayskeep our arms out to the side of your body or behind your back. It shows opennessand ready to receive new ideas. In general terms the more outgoing you are as aperson, the more you tend to use your arms with big movements. Crossing yourarms is a no-no in meetings or at interview as it can be interpreted as being passive,aggressive or closed to suggestion. 5. Legs: Legs again convey a lot about our inner feelings as these are farthest point from brain and difficult to control consciously. The way our leg moves convey ourstate of mind. When we are nervous, stressed or being deceptive our legs tend tomove around a lot more than normal. Also the way we cross our legs and wherewe cross it at the knees or ankles. Crossing of legs shows that the person isdefensive. Also on the legs depend the angle of your body in relation to others. Itgives an indication of your attitude and feelings towards them. We angle inwardtoward people we find attractive, friendly and interesting. 6. Hand gestures: With hands we make numerous gestures and each conveys definitive meaning. Some are: Palms slightly up and outward is seen as open and friendly. Palm down gestures are generally seen as dominant, emphasizing and possibly aggressive. This palm up, palm down is very important when itcomes to handshaking and where appropriate we suggest you alwaysoffer a handshake upright and vertical, which shoul d convey equality. 7. Mouth movements: Our mouth movements can give away all sorts of clues about us. The most expressive part of mouth is lips. When we twist them to the side when we're thinking or sometimes we use this movement to hol d back an angry22comment that we don't wish to reveal. There are also different types of smiles and each gives off a corresponding feeling - A full smile with the lip coming above theteeth shows genuine joy and a smile that does not reach the eyes is NOT a smilebut manipulation. A full smile is one of the most positive body gestures. By working on above said components of body language we can project a positive body language. When we project a positive body language our personality becomesmore charismatic. In fact, positive body language is reflection of one's positive attitude towards life and ability to project openness of one's personality REVIEW QUESTIONS Fill in the Blanks: 1.

Tourism industry is a people to people, intangibleand glamourous industry which demands professionals which have a right blend of hard skillsand soft skills. This unit has described in the simplest way the importance of personality andhow it is formed. It also explains that with our efforts we can develop our personality asdesired. For it, we need to develop positive attitude. We need to take care of our looks andgrooming and learn the etiquettes of work place and telephone handling. Further, learning ofpositive body language helps us to put up a charsmatic personality. All this makes usemployable for tourism industry and help us to achieve new heights in the tourism industry.Introduction t o Tourism - II 23UNIT - II Introduction t o Tourism-II Contents 2.0 Unit Overview & Description 2.1 Introduction2.2 What is Tourism?2.3 General Impacts2.4 Typology of Tourism Impacts 2.5 Sources of Tourism Information 2.6 Tourism Organisations2.7 Summary 2.0 Unit Overview & Description This unit will introduce students to Tourim and its impact.

Assessment Plan Exercise: Questions & Answers, Role Play and Group Discussion. 2.1 Introduction Today, tourism is one of the largest and dynamically developing sectors of external economic activities. Its high growth and development rates, considerable volumes of foreign currency inflows, infrastructure development, and introduction of new management and educational experience actively affect various sectors of economy, which positively contribute to thesocial and economic development of the country as a whole. Most highly developed western countries, such as Switzerland, Austria and France have accumulated a big deal of their social and economic welfare on profits from tourism. According to recent statistics, tourism providesabout 10% of the worl d's income and employs almost one tenth of the worl d's workforce. All considered, tourism's actual and potential economic impact is astounding. Many people emphasize the positive aspects of tourism as a source of foreign exchange, a way to balanceforeign trade, an \"industry without chimney\"- in short, manna from heaven. For decades tourism industry growth has been a major contributor to increased economic activity throughout the worl d. It has created jobs in both large and small communities and isa major industry in many places. It is the dominant economic activity in some communities. The slogan ' Athithi Devo Bhava ' which means 'guests are like God' truly represents the fact that Indians have been highly hospitable people and this trend is still present in modern India. A guest is considered as highly revered person. Intricate arrangements are generallymade for a guest who visits somebody's home for a holiday or other reasons. The family plans well for the comfortable stay of a guest. Moreover, best crockery and bed sheets are kept in store room just for the usage of the guests.Introduction t o Tourism - II 25Going through a broader picture, the tourist visiting India find our country very enigmatic. They have a quest to watch the villagers walk on the rope, eat the butter with rotis and partake in the ritual dance after sunset. Foreigners love India as it is a storehouse for art, culture, dance and drama. The ethnic culture is present in clothing which attracts several shoppers who love to collect trinkets and serious artifacts. Responsible tourism is conductedby way of giving the tourist the right concept in tours. Their accommodation in government lodges and private hotels is always a luxury. The importance to tourism is essential as they carry the picture of our culture and hospitality. Our courteous attitude reflects our inner self. On the economic context, foreign currency in India can be gathered via tourism. Several tourist spots do well throughout the year and in special seasons they perform exceptionally well in tourism as the foreign and domestic tourists throng the places for sightseeing orholiday trips. A trip for any visitor has to be trouble free. With the betterment in information & technological facilities, the stay of tourists has become more comfortable. Taxi cabs, translation books and a dependable guide all make the trip interesting. The hygiene conditionsin the areas are improving as well as the maintenance of hotels and tourist spots. Ministry of tourism is looking for new ways to encourage tourism in India. It is very much essential for a visitor to enjoy the stay and is enhanced by facilities like road transport, guides and goodhotels. Many hotels & restaurants have multi cuisines to accommodate the choices of foreign and domestic visitors. Tour operators have become more concerned about tourist plans. Complete details about weather conditions, clothes required and facilities are given to thetourists to help them prepare for a holiday. This all has led to the multi-dimensional changesin the tourism and travel industry. This requirement starts with mitigating destination needs with trained manpower for successful tourism management. This unit aims at identifying the need of tourism industry, the information sources available in tourism and exploring the role of the agencies (governmental) for the development of tourism. 2.2 What is Tourism? Tourism refers to that activity which is conducted for a short period of time, more than 24 hours and less than 1 year, for a non-remunerative purpose. Based on the UNWTO definition on tourism, tourism coul d be categorized as: Domestic Tourism: Domestic tourism involves trips made by local residents within their own countries. Example: An American, who lives in New York, takes abusiness trip to Los Angeles. International Tourism: International Tourism involves trips between 2 countries. To a certain country, a visit by residents of that country to another country is an outbound tourism; a visit to that country by residents of another country is aninbound tourism. Example: Trips between Hong Kong and Japan. Hong Kong as the point of origin/point of destination: Visits made by Hong Kong residents to Japan are Hong Kong's outbound tourism; Visits made by Japanese to Hong Kong26are Hong Kong's inbound tourism. International tourists are those who travel to a country other than the one in which they normally live. Why Tourism? Over the decades, tourism has experienced continued growth and deepening diversification to become one of the fastest growing economic sectors in the worl d. Modern tourism isclosely linked to development and encompasses growing number of new destinations. These dynamics have turned tourism into a key driver for socio- economic progress. Today, the business volume of tourism equals or even surpasses that of oil exports, food products or automobiles. Tourism has become one of the major players in international commerce, and represents at the same time one of the main income sources for many developing countries. This growth goes hand in hand with an increasing diversification andcompetition among destinations. This global spread of tourism in industrialized and developed states has produced economic and employment benefits in many related sectors - from construction to agriculture or telecommunications. Thus, answer to the above asked question is delivered by the following impacts made by 'TOURISM' (Taking Case Study as of India): 2.3 General Impacts Generating Income and Empl oyment : Tourism in India has emerged as an instrument of income and employment generation, poverty alleviation and sustainable human development. It contributes 6.23% to the national GDP and8.78% of the total employment in India. Almost 20 million people are now working in the India's tourism industry. Source of Foreign Exchange Earnings : Tourism is an important source of foreign exchange earnings in India. This has favourable impact on the balance of paymentof the country. The tourism industry in India generated about US$100 billion in 2008 and that is expected to increase to US$275.5 billion by 2018 at a 9.4% annual growth rate. Preservation of National Heritage and Environment : Tourism helps preserve several places which are of historical importance by declaring them as heritage sites. For instance, the Taj Mahal, the Qutab Minar, Ajanta and Ellora temples, etc., woul d have been decayed and destroyed had it not been for the efforts taken byTourism Department to preserve them. Likewise, tourism also helps in conserving the natural habitats of many endangered species. Devel oping Infrastructure : Tourism tends to encourage the development of multiple-use infrastructure that benefits the host community, including variousmeans of transports, health care facilities, and sports centres, in ad dition to the hotels and high-end restaurants that cater to foreign visitors. The development ofIntroduction t o Tourism - II 27infrastructure has in turn induced the development of other directly productive activities. Promoting Peace and Stability : Honey and Gilpin (2009) suggests that the tourism industry can also help promote peace and stability in developing country like Indiaby providing jobs, generating income, diversifying the economy, protecting theenvironment and promoting cross-cultural awareness. However, key challengeslike adoption of regulatory frameworks, mechanisms to reduce crime andcorruption, etc. must be addressed if peace-enhancing benefits from this industry are to be realized. 2.4 Typol ogy of Tourism Impacts The impacts of tourism can be sorted into six general categories: 1. Economic 2. Environmental3. Social and Cultural4. Services 5. Taxes 6. Community Attitude Understanding that tourism development may result in many and complex impacts suggests that local elected officials, the tourism industry and community residents need to workcooperatively and carefully to plan for its growth and development. Planning can help createan industry that enhances a community with minimal costs and disruptions in other aspectsof community life. Having broad community involvement and embracing differentperspectives during planning helps identify and resolve concerns that woul d otherwise create problems later. Economic Impact Tourism increases employment opportunities. Ad ditional jobs, ranging from low-wage entry- level to high-paying professional positions in management and technical fiel ds, generate incomeand raises standard of living. Particularly in rural areas, the diversification created by tourismhelps communities that are possibly dependent on only one industry. As tourism grows,ad ditional opportunities are created for investment, development and infrastructure spending. Tourism often induces improvements in public utilities such as water, sewer, sidewalks, lighting, parking, public restrooms, litter control and landscaping. Such improvements benefit touristsand residents alike. Likewise, tourism encourages improvements in transport infrastructureresulting in upgraded roads, airports, public transportation and non-traditional transportation(e.g., trails). Tourism encourages new elements to join the retail mix, increasing opportunities28for shopping and ad ding healthy competitiveness. It often increases a community's tax revenues. Lodging and sales taxes most notably increase but ad ditional tax revenues includeair travel and other transportation taxes, business taxes and fuel taxes. New jobs generatemore income tax revenues. When considering the economic impacts of tourism, it is essentialto understand that tourism businesses often include a significant number of low-paying jobs,often at minimum wage or less. These jobs are often seasonal causing under-employment orunemployment during off-seasons. Labour may be imported, rather than hired locally,especially if particular skills or expertise is required, or if local labour is unavailable. Sometourism-related businesses are volatile and high-risk ventures that are unsustainable.Greater demand for goods, services, land and housing may increase prices that in turn willincrease the cost of living. Tourism businesses may claim land that coul d have higher- valueor other uses. Ad ditionally, non-local owners and corporations may export profits out ofthe community. The community may have to generate funds (possibly through increasedtaxes) to maintain roads and transportation systems that have become more heavily used.Similarly, if ad ditional infrastructure (water, sewer, power, fuel, medical, etc.) is required, ad ditional taxes may also be needed to pay for them. Environmental Impact Areas with high-value natural resources like oceans, lakes, waterfalls, mountains, unique flora and fauna and great scenic beauty attract tourists and new residents (in-migrants) who seekemotional and spiritual connections with nature. Because these people value nature, selected natural environments are preserved, protected and kept from further ecological decline. Lands that coul d be developed can generate income by accommodating the recreational activitiesof visitors. Tourist income often makes it possible to preserve and restore historic buil dingsand monuments. Improvements in the area's appearance through cleanup or repairs and thead dition of public art such as murals, water fountains and monuments (part of making acommunity ready for tourism) benefit visitors and residents alike. Tourism is generallyconsidered a \"clean\" industry, one that is based on hotels, restaurants, shops and attractions,instead of factories. Social and Cultural Impact The social and cultural ramifications of tourism warrant careful consideration, as impactscan either become assets or detriments to communities. Influxes of tourists bring diversevalues to the community and influence behaviours and family life. Individuals and the collectivecommunity might try to please tourists or adopt tourist behaviours. Interactions betweenresidents and tourists can impact creative expression by providing new opportunities (positive)or by stifling individuality. Increased tourism can push a community to adopt a different moral conduct such as improved understanding between sexes (positive) or increased illicit drug use (negative). Safety andhealth facilities and staffing tend to increase but also the safety problems such as crime andaccidents increase. Traditional ceremonies may be renewed and revived by tourist interestor lost in alternative activities.Introduction t o Tourism - II 29Community organizations can be invigorated by facing the opportunities of tourism or overwhelmed by its associated problems. Calamities such as natural disasters, energy shortages, terrorism, political upheaval, disease outbreak, a chemical spill, or even wide spreadnegative publicity coul d shut down tourism abruptly but sometimes can attract curious visitors. Tourism can improve the quality of life in an area by increasing the number of attractions, recreational opportunities and services. Tourism offers resident's opportunities to meetinteresting people, make friendships, learn about the worl d, and expose themselves to newperspectives. Experiencing different cultural practices enriches experiences, broadenshorizons and increases insight and appreciation for different approaches to living. Often,dwindling interest in host cultures is revived by reawakening cultural heritage as part oftourism development, which increases demand for historical and cultural exhibits. This interestby tourists in local culture and history provides opportunities to support preservation ofhistorical artefacts and architecture. By learning more about others, their differences becomeless threatening and more interesting. At the same time, tourism often promotes higherlevels of psychological satisfaction from opportunities created by tourism development andthrough interactions with travellers. Establishing or developing a tourism industry involves expenditure as well as gains/ benefits. If these impacts are taken into consideration from the outset of planning, strengths andopportunities can be maximized. Lists of potential benefits are presented below. Table 1 presents some of the positive impacts of tourism. Table 1: Impacts of Tourism Economic Benefits Tourism generates local employment, directly in the tourism sector and in support and resource management sectors. Tourism stimulates profitable domestic industries, hotels and other lodging facilities, restaurants and food services, transportation systems, handicrafts andguide services. Tourism generates foreign exchange for the country and injects capital and new money into the local economy. Tourism helps to diversify the local economy. Improved road systems and infrastructure that contributes to the entire destination can be justified and supported by the benefits from tourism development. Often the jobs created through tourism can be low-paying and unskilled but they constitute an important step for the poor to improve their economic condition. Increased tax revenues from tourism.30Social Benefits The quality of life of a community can be enhanced by economic diversification through tourism. Recreational and cultural facilities created for tourism can be used by local communities as well as domestic/international visitors. Public spaces may be developed and enhanced through tourism activity. Tourism enhances local community's esteem and provides an opportunity for greater understanding and communication among peoples of diverse backgrounds. Cultural Benefits Tourism can enhance local cultural awareness. Tourism can generate revenue to help pay for the preservation of archaeological sites, historic buil dings and districts. Despite criticism about the alteration of cultures to unacceptable levels, the sharing of cultural knowledge and experience can be beneficial for hosts and guests at tourism destinations and can result in the revival of local traditions andcrafts. Physical Environmental Benefits Parks and nature preserves may be created and ecological preservation supported as a necessity for nature based tourism. Improved waste management can be achieved. Increased awareness and concern for the environment can result from nature-based tourism activities and development. Source: United Nations (2003). Poverty Alleviation through Sustainable Tourism Development , New York. Services Tourism creates opportunities to develop new amenities and recreation facilities that woul d not otherwise be viable in a community. Tourist expectations can upgrade service by localshops, restaurants and other commerce operators. Tourist traffic in a community creates an opportunity for upgraded fire, police, and medical protection that also benefits residents. Traditional services may be forced out or relocated due to competition with tourist interests.Supply shortages may occur temporarily, seasonally or chronically. Water, power, fuel, and other shortages may be experienced with increased pressure on the infrastructure.Introduction t o Tourism - II 31Positive Increases availability of recreation facilities and opportunities. Better standard of services by shops, restaurants and other commerce Improves quality of fire protection. Improves quality of police protection. Taxes Increased retail activity from restaurants and tourist shopping will ad d state and local sales tax revenue. Lodging tax revenue to the city (or state) shoul d increase since travellers account for virtually all lodging tax. Increased tax burdens to expand infrastructure and public services will be passed on to property owners through increased property taxes. Positive Ad ditional state and local sales tax revenue. Lodging tax revenue to city (or state). Community Attitude Visitor interest and satisfaction in the community is a source of local pride. Seeing visitor interest makes local residents more appreciative of local resources that are often taken for granted. As tourism develops, local residents will enjoy more facilities and a greater range ofchoices. Tourism activities and events tend to make living in a place more interesting and exciting. However, heightened tension and community divisiveness can occur over tourism development, pitting tourism supporters against non-supporters. Also, tension betweenresidents and tourists can occur. People will often feel stressed over the new, increasingly hectic community and personal pace of life. They may claim the result is no better than before or perhaps even worse. Where culture is part of the tourist attractions, over-amplification ofcultural traits and creation of \"new\" cultural traits to satisfy tourist tastes may create a phoney culture. Residents may experience a sense of exclusion and alienation over planning and development concerns. They may feel a loss of control over the community's future as\"outsiders\" take over establishments and new development. Over-dependence on non-local developers and an influx of outside businesses creates a sense that the community is being manipulated and exploited by outsiders for the sole benefit of those developers or businesspeople. Hotels built in monolithic cubes or restaurants with standardized franchise designs might clash with local standards and disrupt the aesthetic appearance of the community, damage unique community character, and spread \"sameness.\" Positive Heightens pride in community.32 Greater appreciation of local resources. More facilities and range of choices available. REVIEW QUESTIONS 1. Define Tourism? ________________________________________________________________________________2.

This information underpins most of the industry's activities. It is required for the development of travel itineraries and tour products. It is essential for the successful sale of tourism products to customers. Let's consider some of the ways in which travel and tourism industry personnel develop and update their destination knowledge. You shoul d access as many of these information sources as possible so that you can see the type and range of information available for yourself. Current destination information is distributed within the travel and tourism industry in many ways. Key sources of destination information are listed below. Industry people Industry principals, tour wholesalers, tour operators and national tourism organizations often employ sales representatives to visit other industry firms, particularly retail travel agents and distribute the latest tourism destination and product information. Sales representatives may call on a regular basis or as required. Many tour wholesalers hol d destination and product launches, introducing newIntroduction t o Tourism - II 33destinations and products to those working in other sectors of the travel and tourism industry. This is usually done early in the year when new tour brochuresare being distributed. To expand and update the knowledge of industry personnel, travel and tourism firms and organizations also hol d seminars and workshops focusing ondestinations and products. Where possible, industry personnel undertake educational and familiarisation visits and carries out site inspections to improve their knowledge. Educational, 'famils' and site inspections are usually provided by principals, tour wholesalers ortour operators. Informal discussion with well-travelled colleagues, customers and others is a very valuable source of current destination information. Personal travel is even better. Brochures, Journals and Media National tourism organizations (NTOs) and other government bodies distribute agent's manuals, maps, videos and other destination-specific information. Destination and product updates are a feature of trade journals like Travel trade and Travel Week . The general media, particularly newspapers, journals and television, is an important source of current destination information. Worl d news is important to travel industry personnel. We must know what is happening in destinations worl d-wide since this will have an impact on tourism products and services. Many newspapers and journals also have travel sections or features. Television provides travel shows and documentaries on specific destinations. Visual information ofthis kind is very valuable. Tour brochures and other industry publications like in-flight magazines contain a wealth of destination information. Publications Atlases, maps and publications containing maps are essential to fully understand the relationship between places and how they may be arranged in a sequence to form an itinerary. Maps provide other information too. For example, many mapsindicate the distances between places. Since distance and travel time are related, this type of information is also necessary for itinerary planning. Guide books, a range of reference books and other destination publications are used by industry personnel. Among the industry publications are The World Travel Guide , the Travel Trade Visa Guide and TIM (Travel Information Manual ), usually34accessed these days as Timatic on an industry CRS (computer reservation system). Industry publications of this kind provide us with information on a range of issues,including entry and exit requirements for destination countries, customs regulations and health and safety considerations. Many websites also deal with these issues. Travel literature is also important. It covers personal travel narratives, memoirs, biographies and photographic records of specific places or journeys. Travel literature often provides interesting insights into destinations not otherwiseavailable, thereby ad ding another dimension to destination information. Other sources Travel and tourism industry trade shows open to the industry and/or the public are significant. Many industry staff members undertake formal study to improve their destination knowledge (as you are doing now). Internet, email and fax destination and product updates are a feature of the industry. These are the easiest methods to reach a large number of people quickly, with the latest information.

Although with time and changes in technology, the face of travel agency is changing, yet it still remains an important point ofconnection between the tourist and other service providers such as hotels, cars on hire,airlines, and so on. The varied functions of the travel agency are taken up the many departmentswhich work together and necessitate the travel schedules of a tourist. The various activitiestaken up in a travel agency are as below: 1. Information Provider: Travel agency acts a source of information for the tourists. The informationcan be regarding a destination to aid the customer inchoosing a tour or about airline timings for choosinga flight of convenience. They suggest customers aboutthe activities that they can indulge in at the destination,the accommodation and transportation facilities, etckeeping in mind the budget, age group and interest ofthe customer. All in all they help them to make up theirmind on a destination of their choice by giving them information through brochures,pamphlets or by showing them visuals of a place. They also help the customers withspecial requests such as information regarding weather or if the customer has otherpreferences such as twin room instead of double room, and so on. This is the mostimportant aspect of a travel agents' job as correct information will ease the customer'sand help him/ her in taking a decision; thus ensuring business and revenue generationfor the travel agency. 2. Ticketing: Ticketing is one of the primary activities of the Travel agency. Ticketing refers to both airline and railway ticketing. Air tickets both domestic and internationalare provided by travel agencies and the travel agent will also give choices to the customer by suggesting them different airfares and services providedby different airlines. E.g. low cost airline like indigo will offer cheap priced tickets but do not provide meals, entertainmentinclusive of airfare and also offers less baggage facility.Railway tickets are also provided for both domestic andinternational travel. For example, a customer travelling toEurope might request for tickets or passes for the Euro rail(Eurail), the agent will coordinate with partners abroad forproviding the same to the customer. 3. Tour Packages: A travel agent also acts as a bridge between tour operator and the tourists. A tour package of any major tour operator can be bought from a travelagent. At times a travel agent can also help design a customised tour package as a touristcan get all the services - airport pick & drop, sightseeing, hotel accommodation, bus,train & air travel, documentation etc. under one roof; though the rates may not be asattractive as one given by tour operator. Tour packages no longer means only land base 46tours, nowadays cruises packages are also available with the travel agent and it is one of the activities of the travel agent to make a customer understand about the differencebetween different types of cruises and the facilities provided by each. 4.

What do you - II 473.4 Documentation for Travel In the earlier sections and units you have read about domestic and international travel. You are also aware of inbound and outbound tours and tourists. Just to refresh yourmemory: Domestic Tourist: When a citizen of a country visits a tourist place within his/her own country, then he/ she is known as a domestic tourist and it is domestic tourism. For example, a family from Punjab visiting Nainital or Shimla are domestic tourists. International Tourist: When a citizen of a country crosses the boundary of his country legally to visit another country, then he / she is an international tourist and it is known as International Tourism. An international tourist is furtherdivided into following two categories: Inbound Tourist: When tourists from other countries visit a said country, then they are the inbound tourist s for the said country. In other words, non residents or foreigners visiting a given country are known as Inbound Tourists. This is also known as \"Incoming Tourism\" . For example, a group ofEuropeans visiting India are the inbound tourists for India. In this process a country earns foreign exchange from the visitors visiting. Outbound Tourist: When the citizen of a country visits a foreign nation then they are called outbound tourists of the country. This is also called \"outgoing tourism\" . For example, an Indian visits U.S.A. for a holidays, he is an outboundtourist for India. A tourist might want to visit any destination but as tourism professional you need to be aware of the fact that tourists need to abide by some rules and regulations and certaindocumentations are required for travelling to each destination. The documentation may vary depending upon the destination of choice but certain documents are common and must. These documents are required for domestic, inbound and outbound tourist also. 14 IATA Airlineshave voluntarily come up with a publication called TIM (Travel Information Manual) which guides a tourist about the documents required to visit a destination. 3.4.1 P assport, VISA and other permits A tourist looking forward to travelling abroad must have a passport from the country of origin. Passport is an official document issued by the government of a country to its citizens as a proof that one is a resident of the country. Every passport has a validity period and expiration dates. A citizen can travel out of his/ her country only when he/ she posses avalid Passport. The validity of the passport is also necessary when the tourist or traveller is travelling back to his / her own country.48Similarly to enter any country other than one's own, one must have a VISA from the foreign country. VISA is the permission given by a nation to enter its territory to a traveller. The most popular VISA sought by the travellers are the tourist and business A domestic traveller in India might also have a need for a permit - restricted, protected and inner line permits - to visit some areas. There are still certain areas in India which can be accessed only with permits. For e.g. even for an Indian, to visit few islands in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, a permit is required from competent authority. Documents are very important for a traveller, and hence it is important to look into TIM Manual and also contact the country of visit when in doubt. It is the duty and responsibility of the travel facilitator to ensure that a tourist is travelling with proper, valid documents or elsea visitor can face many problems like Detention, Deportation; and can end up wasting his/her time and money. 3.4.2 Medical Requirements Medical emergencies can cause serious havoc with one's travel plans. The case of Ebola Virus in present time or SARS virus few years back are testimony to the fact that medical emergencies can change one's travel plans. Although as a travel agent or a tourist we cannot predict all themedical fatalities that can happen while on a visit abroad yet for few countries it is mandatory to meet certain medical requirements before travelling to their country. A list of vaccines and other medical requirements for the prospective tourists are provided to the tourist whenhe/ she can apply for a VISA. These medical requirements mostly refer to vaccines against certain diseases and a tourist will have to submit a health certificate by recognised medical practitioner while applying for VISA. For example- for few countries in African and South American continent it is mandatory for a tourist to have Yellow fever vaccination which is a fatal disease. This vaccination's validity is for 10 years. 3.4.3 Travel Insurance Insurance as you are aware is to protect oneself from undesirable incidences or risks. Travelinsurance is one such insurance that provides risk cover to both international and domestic traveller against medical expenses, trip cancellation, accident, financial default of travel Indian Passport Passport of United States of AmericaIntroduction t o Tourism - II 49suppliers, loss of baggage or any other losses incurred during the travel .
