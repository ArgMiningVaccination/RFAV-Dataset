The Center is a successor to the Institute for Environmental Toxicology and the Center for Environmental Toxicology, the latter founded in 1978. While the name of the unit has changed over the years to denote changes in the leadership and academic position, the mission has been the same. For over 30 years, toxicology at Michigan State has provided excellence in training graduate students, facilitating research, and providing service to the State of Michigan when needed. The successes generated in these endeavors have resulted in recognition of Michigan State as a leader in academic toxicology. The Center for Environmental Toxicology was initiated primarily to assist the State of Michigan with environmental contamination issues such as those arising from the PBB (polybrominated biphenyls) incident in the early 1970s. That unfortunate event was initiated by the accidental contamination of feed for dairy cattle with PBBs. These dioxin-like chemicals and dioxin itself remain a major topic of research at Michigan State University. Two years after the founding of the Center for Environmental Toxicology, a dual-degree Ph.D. program in environmental toxicology was offered in conjunction with several cooperating departments. The characteristics of the program were unique at that time as students were required to complete the Ph.D. requirements of a department of their choice in addition to the didactic requirements and toxicology research specified by the Center. The quality of this multi-departmental effort was recognized by the National Institutes of Health in 1989 with the award of a Training Grant from the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences. This grant has been competitively renewed ever since, providing over 20 years of continuous funding. Graduates of MSU's toxicology program number over 200 and can be found in academia, industry, and governmental positions. A TRADITION OF EXCELLENCECIT @MSUmessage from the director5 www.cit.msu.edu T he period of 2012- 2013 was a water - shed academic year for the Center for Integra - tive Toxicology (CIT) in a number of ways. For the first time in the his - tory of our Center, which spans 35 years, the total number of faculty affiliat - ed with the CIT has risen to 62 members, an all time high. Our Center derives many benefits from having such a critical mass of faculty that in - cludes increased student recruitment and participation in our Environmental and Integrative Toxicological Sciences dual major graduate program, a breadth of diverse faculty expertise from which to draw when developing new cours-es and collaborative research initiatives as well as a greater overall sense of community. Another critically important benefit is the increased visibility the CIT receives outside of the MSU campus. With this visibility comes new oppor - tunities for research funding, private sector partnerships, participation on advisory and decision making bodies as well as increased career opportunities for our trainees as they matriculate. All of these feed into the age-old adage, \"excellence breeds excellence\". Commensurate with our increase in faculty, 18 new graduate trainees were recruited into the EITS dual major graduate program in the 2012-13 academic year, which also represents an all time high for any given year. The EITS graduate program can presently boast a total of 48 trainees within our two training tracks. Importantly, the EITS grad - uate program continues to be supported, in part, by a Na - tional Institutes of Health Training Grant, which has been enforce for 24 continuous years and again bringing visibility and prestige to the EITS Program and MSU. However, even more important than the total number is the quality of the trainees that matriculate. In the pages that follow, we have attempted to highlight the fact that our trainees continue to be strongly recruited into positions for which they have been trained within government, industry and academia, in spite of the current economic challenges. Likewise, many of our past trainees have assumed important leadership po-sitions in toxicology, which further promotes visibility for the CIT and our EITS graduate program. A longstanding tenant of the MSU toxicology commu- nity has been excellence in research, in the pages that fol - low, the many significant research accomplishments by our faculty and trainees are featured. Quantity and quality of publications in the peer-reviewed literature continues to be outstanding and extramural funding likewise. Indeed a major funding stream for research and training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows has been the MSU Su - perfund Center Grant. Since its inception in 1988, MSU has successfully maintained continuous funding of this Center Grant securing over $75.6 million in research funding. I am pleased to convey that the MSU Superfund Center Grant has been renewed and will provide support for an addi - tional five years for human health-related research and for remediation technology focused on environmental contam-inants. We are very proud of the legacy as well as continued success of this vibrant multidisciplinary research program that includes 25 faculty and numerous students, postdoc - toral fellows and staff. In summary, I am delighted to express with great pride that the CIT and its EITS graduate program continues to bring national and international prominence to MSU through the many successes of it faculty and trainees. Norbert E. Kaminski, Ph.D., CIT Director MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTORhighlights CIT Annual Report6 This year's highlights showcase the accomplishments of not only the center, but also of the faculty and trainees involved in continuing to expand the quality and leadership of Michigan State University in academic toxicology.Student and FacultyHIGHLIGHTShighlights www.cit.msu.edu7 CIT AWARDED NIEHS SUPERFUND RESEARCH CENTER GRANT The CIT is proud to announce their National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Superfund Center Grant has been renewed for another five years with the award of $14.1 million. The CIT was one of only two programs awarded a Center grant this year. MSU's Superfund Program began in December of 1988 and since that time has received $75.6 million in funding. The overall goal of the program is to continue to conduct human health-oriented research on risks from exposure to chemicals commonly found in Superfund sites and on remediation technologies to eliminate the potential for exposure to chemicals from those sites. T he pollutants under investigation are a subclass of chemicals belonging to the halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon family that bind and activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. These chemicals, which include chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, biphenyls and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, are envi - ronmentally persistent, lipid soluble that accumulate in the food chain leading to human and wildlife exposure. Biomedical pr ojects in the program are aimed at illuminating the interactions of biochemical pathways with the ligand-activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which cause altered responses in the liver and immune system as well as changes in the gut microbiome. Non-biomedical research topic areas include studies of the diversity and physiogenomic responses of dioxin-degrading microbial populations and geochemical parameters governing bioavailability of dioxin-like in soils. A highly integr ated, multidisci - plinary research program is already underway consisting of six research projects and six supporting core units. The research team of 25 investigators includes faculty at Michigan State University, the Hamner Institutes for Health Sciences, Rutgers University, Purdue University, and the U.S. Envi - ronmental Protection Agency. \"T his is one of the few National In - stitutes of Health programs where there is sufficient funding to bring together a large, multidisciplinary group of investi - gators,\" said Norbert Kaminski, principal investigator and director of the MSU CIT. \"We have 25 scientists who are involved, as well as many students, postdoctoral trainees and technicians. It's a rare op - portunity when you can bring all these different areas of expertise together to focus on a single problem or theme, and that's why we're very excited about hav - ing this type of funding.\" HIGHLIGHTSPROJECT 1: TCDD Impedes the Minimal Activation Threshold Required for Initiation of B Cell Differentiation: An Integrated Experimental and Computational Modeling Approach Principal Investigator & Project Leader: Norbert E.

These faculty join the CIT as research collaborators as well as contributors to the En - vironmental and Integrative Toxicological Sciences Graduate Training Program. Eran AndrechekAssistant Professor, Department of Physiology Dr. Andr echek received his B.Sc. in Molecular Biology and Biotechnology from McMaster University in 1997 and Ph.D. in Biology from McMaster Univer - sity in 2003. R esearch in the Andrechek lab focuses on breast cancer using a combination of mouse models (transgenic, knockout and car - cinogen induced) and bioinfor - matics methods. Bioinformatics is used to generate predictions and hypotheses that are then tested with traditional genetics, with recent work identifying a role for key signaling pathways in both tumor development and metastasis. Brian GulbransenAssistant Professor, Neuroscience Pro - gram, Department of Physiology Dr. Gulbr ansen received his B.S. in Zoology and Physiology from the University of Wyoming in 2003 and his Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in 2007. Dr. Gulbr ansen is interested in how the two constituent cell types of the enteric nervous system (neurons and glia) interact and how these interactions influence gut function. Specifically, he is interested in how enteric glial cells influence enteric neurotransmission and neuron survival. Gina LeinningerAssistant Professor, Department of Physiology, Neuroscience Program Dr. Leinning er received her B.S. in Chemistry from the Uni-versity of Michigan in 1999 and her Ph.D. in Neuroscience fom the University of Michigan in 2005. T he Leinninger Lab studies neuronal circuits that regulate energy balance. Dr. Leinninger uses molecular and pharmaco - logical tools to identify, activate or ablate specific neuronal populations and study their physi - ological importance, particularly regarding feeding, movement and weight. Ning Li Assistant Professor, Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation Dr. Li r eceived her M.D. from Capital Medical University in 1982. In 1990, she received her M.S. in Endocrinology and Reproductive Physiology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and 1997 received her Ph.D. in Pathology from the same university. Dr. Li's r esearch focuses on using in vitro and in vivo models to study the impact of air pollut - ants (e.g., particulate matter, vapors and ozone) from differ - ent sources on allergic airway inflammation such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. The emphasis is on understanding the mechanisms by which various air pollutants and their com - bined actions promote allergic airway inflammation and the role of oxidative stress in this process. Keith LookinglandAssociate Professor, Pharmacology and Toxicology Dr. Lookingland r eceived his B.S. and M.S. in Biology from Towson State College in 1975 and 1977. He earned his Ph.D. in Physiology from the University of Maryland in 1982. His r esearch interests are focused on genetic and envi - ronmental factors involved in the pathogenesis of progressive neurodegenerative disorders associated with loss of central dopomine neurons such as Parkinson Disease and Restless Legs Syndrome. The goal of his laboratory's research is to develop novel neuroprotective or neurorestorative therapeutics to slow, halt or reverse the progressive neurodegeneration in these diseases. T he work in his laboratory uses rodent and cell culture models to identify and characterize genetic and environmental factors that cause selective DA neuronal toxicity - especially as applied to the underlying mechanisms that determine dif-ferential susceptibility of DA neurons to neurotoxic insult. Animals are evaluated on the basis of their neurochemical and immunohistochemical changes in selected regions of the brain, as well as genome-wide mRNA expression profiling to identify changes in gene expression in regions of brain with differential sensitivity to environmental neurotoxins. highlights www.cit.msu.edu9Linda Mansfield Professor, Large Animal Clinical Sci - ences, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Dr. Mansfield r eceived her B.S. in Biology in 1975 and M.S. in Virology in 1980 at the Univer - sity of Delaware. She earned her V.M.D. in Veterinary Medicine in 1986 and her Ph.D. in Parasite Immunology in 1990 from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Mansfield' s Compara - tive Enteric Diseases Laboratory studies bacterial pathogen Campylobacter jejuni. The incidence of foodborne disease due to C. jejuni remains very high worldwide. Serious disease sequelae can follow gastrointestinal (GI) infections with C. jejuni. The acute neuropathies Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) and Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS), and Reactive Arthritis (RA) are au - toimmune conditions associated with recent Campylobacter infection. Her overall hypothesis is that murine model(s) with a \"humanized\" microbiome will develop spontaneous autoimmune sequelae secondary to C. jejuni infection with strains with class A LOS. These models can be used to dissect mechanisms of autoimmunity and to serve as treatment and prevention surrogates for GBS/MFS patients. The expected outcomes will be new murine models of GBS and MFS and an increased understanding of mechanisms of initiation of autoimmunity following enteric infections with C. jejuni from GBS and MFS patients; this information will lead to future detailed mechanistic studies of how these identified autoim - mune pathways are facilitated by particular outer membrane and secreted proteins of this bacterium such as toxins. Michelle Mazei-RobisonAssistant Professor, Department of Physiology, Neuroscience Program Dr. Mazei-Robison received her B.S. in Biology and Chem - istry, Summa Cum Laude from Central Michigan University in 1999 and her Ph.D. in Pharmacol - ogy from Vanderbilt University in 2005. T he Mazei-Robison lab is interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie changes in ventral teg - mental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neuron signaling, morphology, and activity induced in neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and addiction. Despite evidence that dysregulation of the mesocorticolimbic DA system contributes to a number of psychiatric disorders, a detailed understanding of the main projection neurons in this pathway, the DA neurons of the VTA, is lacking. This includes the structural and functional neuroadaptations, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these adaptations, and the specific neurons and outputs affected.A.J. RobisonAssistant Professor, Department of Physiology, Neuroscience Program Dr. Robison received his B.S. in Biology from Rhodes College in 1999 and his Ph.D. in Molecular Physiology and Biophysics from Vanderbilt University in 2005. R esearch in the Robison Lab focuses on how models of drug addiction and depression alter gene expression in discreet brain regions, particularly the hip - pocampus. They use transgenic mice and viral gene-transfer tools to manipulate hippocampal expression of specific genes, as well as the machinery that reg - ulates chromatin structure and gene transcription. They then examine the effects of these manipulations on biochemistry, neuronal structure and physiology, and behavioral responses to drugs and stress with the goal of uncovering novel targets for therapeutic intervention in addiction and depression. Felicia WuJohn A. Hannah Distinguished Profes - sor, Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Department of Agricultural, Food, and Resource Eco - nomics Dr. W u received her A.B. and S.M. in Applied Mathematics and Medical Sciences from Har - vard University in 1998 and her Ph.D. in Engineering and Public Policy from Carnegie Mellon University in 2002. Dr. W u's research interests lie at the intersection of global public health, agriculture, and trade. How do agricultural systems affect health in different parts of the world? How do food safety regulations affect global trade of food, and ultimately food quality, particularly in low-income nations? What is the global burden of disease caused by food contaminants, and how cost-effective and feasible are interventions to reduce these risks? Her r esearch focuses on applying health economic and mathematical modeling techniques to understanding the public health impacts of agricultural practices, both in the United States and worldwide. highlights CIT Annual Report10Brenna Flannery Department of Food Science and Human NutritionMentor, James Pestka Br enna successfully defended her disserta - tion, \"Mechanisms of deoxynivalenol-induced anorexia and its impact on weight in the female mouse,\" in December of 2012 and earned her Ph.D. degree in Food Science and Environmental Toxicolgy. She is currently working as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of California Davis in the School of Veterinary Medicine Department of Molecular Biosciences. Her research there involves evaluating the neurotoxicities and the long-term behavioral deficits of organophosphate poisoning. Once her models are established, she will be testing novel therapeutic agents against organophosphate poisoning in hopes to reduce death, seizures, neurodegeneration, neuroinflam - mation and long-term behavioral deficts associ-ated with exposure. Five years fr om now she hopes to be an assis - tant professor publishing her research findings in peer-reviewed literature and successfully compet - ing for research funding. She would like to focus on how foodborne toxins/toxicants adversely affect the central nervous system. Steven Proper Department of Biochemistry and Molecular BiologyMentor, John LaPres Ste ven successfully defended his disserta - tion, \"The role of hypoxia-inducible factors 1 and 2 in cobalt-induced lung inflammation and development of lung immunity,\" in May of 2013 and earned his Ph.D. degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Environmental Toxicol - ogy. As part of the D.O.-Ph.D. Program, Steve is working on finishing his D.O. degree by complet - ing his clinical clerkships (essentially his 3rd and 4th year of medical school where he completes the many rotations and board exams that are required). He is based out of Sparrow Hospital and will be here in Lansing until he graduates with the Class of 2015 from the MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine. From there, he will have to complete a residency (usually a 3 year pro -cess). As of now, he is interested in pediatrics or internal medicine. In five years he hopes to be finishing his residency, and ready to start a fellowship in a pediatric specialty (either pulmonary/critical care medicine, allergy/immunology or neonatology). His research at MSU has greatly influenced his interest in how our lungs develop their immunity to environmental threats, and especially how environmental exposures affect this process and impact acute clinical care situations as well as future disease risk. Proper said, \"Extra training in toxicology was absolutely essential not just for my Ph.D. research but also for taking me in the direction of inhalation toxicology. It's fascinat - ing to me how much overlap our environment has with our development and risk for disease, so no matter what I end up doing in my career, it will probably revolve around toxicology and immunology.\" EITS PROGRAM 2012-2013 It was an excellent year for the Environmental and Integrative Toxicological Sciences (EITS) graduate program. This MSU program administered by the CIT continues to be among the very top programs in the U.S. for graduate training in toxicol - ogy, and the dual major format remains well respected and appreciated by our students and alumni. Importantly, several recent faculty hires have added strength to the CIT-affiliated faculty and hence to our capacity to train students. Cur - rently, 48 doctoral students are enrolled in the EITS program, distributed among several of our partnering PhD programs. Forty-two of these students are in the Biomedical Track and 6 in the Environmental Track. Many of our current students have received awards from the Society of Toxicology (SOT) or other organizations and serve on SOT committees. Students who graduated in the past year are all in postdoctoral posi - tions at various academic institutions in the U.S. and Canada. T he Fall of 2012 marked the first time that several of our partnering doctoral programs recruited and accepted students through the new BioMolecular Sciences (BMS) joint recruit - ing program. This proved to be highly beneficial to the EITS program, as a record 15 new students chose the EITS option during the past year. The 2012-2013 academic year also marked the 24 th consecutive year that the program has enjoyed training grant support from the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences. This grant provides stipend support for 6 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral fellows. Supplemental fund - ing from Dean Klomparens of the Graduate School provides additional support for stipends and for fellowships that enable students to travel to scientific meetings to present the results of their research. With the help of an outstanding cadre of CIT faculty trainers, Dr. Roth, the EITS Director, applied for competing renewal of the Training Grant in May 2013. RECENT EITS GRADUATEShighlights www.cit.msu.edu11Kaiyu He Department of Microbiology and Molecular GeneticsMentor, James Pestka Kaiy u successfully defended his dissertation, \"Mechanisms of ribotoxic stress response and downstream sequelae,\" in September of 2012 and earned his Ph.D. degree in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics and Environmental Toxicol-ogy. Kaiy u is currently a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Michigan Medical School in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology. His primary project focuses on elucidating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degra - dation toxin as a model. Elucidating basic ERAD mechanisms should provide critical strategies to alleviate ER stress, a pathologic cellular condition that underlies many human diseases including cardiovascular diseases. His futur e plans include publishing several papers in top tier journals and he hopes to pass the exam from the American Board of Toxicology to achieve his certificate. He hopes to be well-prepared in five years for toxicological positions in either academia or industry. Agnes ForgacsDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular BiologyMentor, Timothy Zacharewski A gnes \"Triazine-mediated disruption of BLTK1 Leydig cell steroidogenesis,\" in July of 2013 and earned her Ph.D. degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Environmental Toxicolgy. Agnes has accepted a postdoctor al research fellowship through Oak Ridge Institute for Sci - ence and Education (ORISE) to work with the US EPA at the National Center for Computational Toxicology in the Office of Research and Devel- opment located in Research Triangle Park, NC. The research she is conducting aims to increase the confidence in the use of chemical categories and read-across methods to integrate in vitro screening data into informing decision making. More specifically, she is developing methodolo - gies that combine EPA's in vitro high-throughput screening ToxCast data, predictive signatures of toxicity, and computational models with tradi-tional systems and structure-based approaches to enhance chemical category clustering for existing as well as new chemicals. This work involves data mining and analysis, development of software packages and computational methods, as well as collaboration with other government agencies including the European Chemicals Agency in the European Union. After completing her postdoctor al research, Agnes hopes to obtain a job in either government or industry, and continue to work in the field of toxicology, specifically in in vitro alternative methods and computational toxicology. Timothy JohnsonDepartment of Plant, Soil and Microbial SciencesMentor, James Tiedje T im successfully defended his dissertation, \"Microbial community response to anthropo - genic pollution: Antibiotic resistance genes and dioxin biodegradation,\" in May of 2013 and earned his Ph.D. degree in Crop and Soil Science and Environmental Toxicolgy. T im is now a post-doctoral fellow in the lab of Gerry Wright at the Institute for Infectious Disease at McMaster University in Hamilton, ON in Canada. He is studying novel drug discovery, secondary metabolite biochemistry and genome sequencing all from soil actinomycetes and also antibiotic resistance mechanisms.

Dr. Jack Harkema, CIT faculty member and MSU Univer - sity Distinguished Professor, is the Director of this multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary research center that is comprised of environ - mental and biomedical scientists from MSU, the University of Michi - gan, and The Ohio State University. The EPA has committed close to $32 million to the CLARCs. The overall mission of these EPA Centers is to research health effects of exposure to particulate matter (PM), ozone, and other air pollutants, both singly and in multi-pollutant atmospheres. In the last two years, GLACIER scientists have made tremendous progress in our understanding of the health effects of air pollutants found in urban and rural communities of Michigan and Ohio. For example, Dr. Robert Brook, professor of cardiology at the University of Michigan, and his colleagues have found that exposures to ambi - ent levels of PM in airsheds of southeastern Michigan can cause early signs of insulin resistance and increased blood pressure. Both of these health effects are facets of the metabolic syndrome (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, obesity) that affects over a third of the U.S. population. In the next three years, GLACIER scientists will focus their efforts on understanding what spe - cific air pollutants or air pollutant mixtures in the Great Lakes region are responsible for these and other health effects associated with urban and rural air pollution.
