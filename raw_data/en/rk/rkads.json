Immune response against this disease can be indu ced by infection or vacci nation. Protection after childhood vaccination is minimal after ten years. Our aim was to assess pertussis immunity state in a population of healthy young medical students. Methods: In this seroepidemiological survey, blood samples were obtained from 163 first-year medical students in Hamedan University, Iran. Se rum level of IgG against pertussis toxin (IgG-PT) was measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorb ent Assay (ELISA) method. For qualitative assessment, IgG-PT levels more than 24 unit (U)/ ml were considered posi tive. Data was analysed qualitatively and quantitatively considering gender and age groups. Results: There were 83 males and 80 females, with a me an age of 19.48 years, Prevalence of IgG- PT was 47.6% with mean level of 71.7 u/ml (95% confidence interval: 68. 1-75.3). No statistically significant difference was observed with respect to sero-positivity of Ig G-PT between males and females (45 cases (54%) vs. 34 cases (42%); P = 0.06) . Mean IgG-PT levels in males and females were 84 U/ml and 58.8 U/ml, re spectively (P = 0.91). Conclusion: A considerable proportion of our study population with a positive history of childhood vaccination for pertussi s was not serologicall y immune to pertussis. A booster dose of acellular pertussis vaccine may be indicated in Ir anian, medical students regarding their serologic conditions and outstanding ro le in health care systems. Background Pertussis is a very communicable disease caused by Borde- tella pertussis and all age groups are susceptible to this res-piratory infection [1]. The incidence of adult pertussis has been estimated to be 200 to 500 per 100,000 person- years, even in highly immunised populations [2-4], whichPublished: 9 May 2009 BMC Infectious Diseases 2009, 9:58 doi:10.1186/1471-2334-9-58Received: 11 December 2008 Accepted: 9 May 2009 This article is available from: http ://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/58 \u00a9 2009 Hashemi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

A total number of 314 suspicious cases of pertussis, according to specimens collected by Dacronswabs from nasopharynx, were reported in Iran in 2007.Of this, 23 cases were diagnosed by pertussis using thelaboratory method of Real Time polymerase chain reac-tion (PCR) [5]. Based on this report, the incidence of per- tussis in Iran has decreased from 40% in 100,000 population in 1978 to 0.5% in 100,000 population in2007. Pertussis vaccines use in routine paediatric vaccination programs has dramatically decreased the incidence and complications of whooping cough in children [6], but protection is thought to be minimal after 10 years withoutboosting [7,8]. Because of concerns about the complica-tions of whole-cell pertussis vaccines in older childrenand adults, booster vaccinations have not been recom-mended in these groups. In Iran, the pertussis vaccine isadministered in the 2nd, 4th, and 6th months of life, in combination with two booster doses one administered in month 18 and the other between the years 4 to 6. In spite of the worldwide decline in the infection inci- dence, the circulation of B. pertussis has not been elimi- nated [9]. During recent decades, numerous studies have documented that a significant percentage of prolonged cough illnesses among adolescents and adults are due toB. pertussis , with serological studies indicating a high rate of unrecognized infections [10-13]. These groups act as asource of infection for young infants who have not yetcompleted their primary immunisation [7,14]. Acellular pertussis vaccines have been evaluated in adolescents and adults and confer a safe and effective protection againstpertussis in 92% of individuals [15]. However, universaladult booster vaccination against pertussis has remainedcontroversial [7]. In this study, our aim was to determine the seroprevalence of B. Pertussis among a group of adolescent first-year med- ical students in the province of Hamedan, Iran in order toprovide local epidemiological data. This study, togetherwith other national studies, can supply evidence for rec-ommending adult booster vaccination. Methods This cross-sectional seroepidemiological study was con-ducted in healthy first-year medical students of HamedanUniversity, Iran yet did not have exposure to hospitalenvironment. We considered the prevalence of pertussisseropositivity, difference and confidence interval as 30%, 0.07, and 95%, respectively. According to our calcula- tions, a sample size of 163 subjects was selected by simplerandom method. Hence, all registration numbers of stu-dents were listed, and by applying table of random num-bers, the subjects were selected. All individuals were asymptomatic while entering the study. Any respiratory disease or conditions affecting immunocompetence wereof exclusion criteria. The subjects were classified into threeage groups: less than 19 years, 19-21 years and over 21years.. The data related to age, gender and vaccination sta-tus (according to their medical records) were obtained during a primary interview. All participants had received diphtheria, tetanus, whole pertussis vaccine (DTwP) man-ufactured by Razi Vaccine & Serum Research Institute,Tehran, Iran. Each dose of a o.5 ml of Razi-DTwP inactivated Bordetella Perussis bacterial cells, 0.3 to 0.6 mg aluminium phosphate (metal iron) and 0.01% merthiolate according to thr instruction sheet provided bythe manufacturer [16]. For serological assessment, a venous blood sample of 3-5 ml was drawn. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodiesagainst pertussis toxin, IgG-PT, were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits and results were interpreted according to the instructions pro-vided by the manufacturer (IBL Immuno-Biological Labo-ratories, Hamburg, Germany). For qualitative assessment,IgG antibody levels more than 24 units (U)/ml were con-sidered positive. Results were also analysed regarding quantitative values. Age and sex distribution at enrolment, the total preva- lence of seropositive results and mean level of pertussisIgG-PT in the studied subjects were calculated. In addi-tion, the findings were stratified by the age groups. Differ- ence in sero-positivity percentages was calculated using the chi-square test. Quantitatively, t-test or one-wayANOVA was used for examining mean IgG-PT levelsbetween the subgroups. Significance level was set at p <0.05. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our university and informed consent was obtained from allstudy participants. Results and discussion A total of 163 individuals (83 males and 80 females) wererecruited between March and June 2007. Mean age of the cases was 19.48 years, ranging from 16 to 24 years. Of these, 112 subjects were under 19 years, 40 were 19-21years, and 11 were above 21 years old. History of pertussisvaccination was positive in all subjects. The total sero-prevalence rate of IgG-PT was 47.6%, with a mean level of 71.7 U/ml (95% Confidence Interval: 68.1-75.3). Table 1 shows the frequency of IgG-PT posi-tivity in the studied population. As presented, there wereno statistically significant differences neither regardingBMC Infectious Diseases 2009, 9:58 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/9/58 Page 3 of 4 (page number not for citation purposes)the frequency of sero-positivity between males and females nor between the age groups. Mean IgG-PT levels in males and females were 84 U/ml and 58.8 U/ml, respectively (P = 0.91). In the analysis per-formed regarding the age groups, mean IgG-PT level was37 U/ml 49.2 U/ml for more than 21 year-old subjects. There were no significant differences in the mean IgG-PT levelsamong the age subgroups (p = 0.06). According to obtained results, a considerable number of medical students studied in an Iranian university from both genders were not serologically immune to pertussis. Since these students will have a major role in providinghealth care services in both in-patient and out-patientmedical centres in the near future, it is of high priority toperform complete vaccination programs through acellularpertussis vaccines. The importance of determination of IgG-PT in student populations has been implicated in former studies. In astudy performed on students with chronic cough at theUniversity of California in 1992, 34 cases (26%) of infec-tion with pertussis were found [12]. This led to this sug- gestion that B. pertussis cough illnesses were endemic in adolescents and adults and that they could be consideredas a source of outbreaks of the disease in susceptible chil-dren. Subsequently, a number of studies among sympto-matic and cough-free adolescents and adults have noted ahigh percentage of the illnesses due to B. Pertussis infec- tion [10,11]. We documented 47.6% seropositivity of IgG-PT in the asymptomatic adolescent population between the ages of19 and 24 years with a similar distribution between menand women. According to national childhood vaccinationprogramme in Iran, all of our subjects had complete his- tory of immunization against pertussis and none of them received any adult booster vaccine dose. Our data is con-sistent with another study in Iran (Isfahan) whichreported 48% positive serology for IgG-PT in adolescentswith prolonged cough [17]. The current statistics are also in agreemenr with those from some other countries [18,19]. In previous serological studies performed in different countries, pertussis protective antibodies were reported ina wide range of 30 to 97 percent. Vaccine antibodies begin to wane 4 years after the last dose, thus immunity to per- tussis vaccine diminishes to 0% to 20% over a 10-yearinterval [7,8]. It has been shown that the seroprevalenceincreases with age especially in countries with good child-hood vaccination coverage [10-13]. The incrementbetween the adolescent and adult age group is assumed to be due to natural pertussis infection. Repeated exposure to the infection can also explain high level of pertussis anti-body among unvaccinated adults. Apart from being an adolescent population, our study subjects were medical students. Health care workers havemore professional contacts with infectious patients than general population. As our finding showed, half of the studied population were seronegative. Therefore, Thisgroup will be more susceptible to pertussis in the futureworking as primary care providers in hospitals. Previousoutbreaks among healthcare workers and their patientscan signify the potentially harmful consequence of such results [20-22]. However, it should be considered that protection against B. pertussis is multifactorial. The pres-ence of circulating antibodies does not guarantee the pro-tection and the absence of antibodies does not imply thatan individual is necessarily susceptible. Acellular pertussis vaccines confer safe and effective pro- tection against pertussis in adolescents and adults [23]. InMarch 2006, the American Academy of Paediatrics pub-lished their recommendation that adolescents 11 to 18years of age should receive a single dose of acellular per-tussis vaccines combined with diphtheria and tetanus tox- oids (DTaP) instead of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids vaccine for booster immunisation. In this study, only medical students were included. There- fore, the obtained results may not be extended to adoles-cents and adults living in the studied region. Also, we didnot follow these students in order to document the clini- cal and serologic consequences of administration of a booster dose of DTaP. Although all studied individualswere students at the first year of medical school passingtheir basic courses, we were not able to establish any doc-umented contact with B. Pertussis. Further studies are required to determine the incidence, morbidity and complications of pertussis in adolescentsand adults to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccina-tion.Table 1: The frequency of anti-P T seropositivity according to age and gender.
