NSU History Nova Southeastern University (NSU) is a not-for-profit, fully accredited, coeducational institution. It was founded in 1964 as Nova University of Advanced Technology. In 1974, the board of trustees changed the university's name to Nova University. In 1994, Nova University merged with Southeastern University of the Health Sciences to form Nova Southeastern University. NSU is well known for innovation and quality in both traditional and distance education. The university serves large numbers of adult students and a growing population of traditional undergraduates. To date, the institution has produced more than 152,000 alumni. Based on fall-term enrollment as a measure, Nova Southeastern University is the largest independent institution of higher education in the Southeast with nearly 27,000 students, and is the ninth largest independent institution nationally. NSU is one of 169 colleges and universities statewide and one of 29 independent four-year institutions in Florida. The university awards associate's, bachelor's, master's, educational specialist, doctoral, and first- professional degrees in a wide range of fields, including business, counseling, computer and information sciences, education, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, various health professions, law, marine biology, psychology, and other social sciences. The university offers 52 undergraduate majors through the Farquhar College of Arts and Sciences, the Abraham S. Fischler School of Education, the H. Wayne Huizenga School of Business and Entrepreneurship, the College of Health Care Sciences, and the College of Nursing.8 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 Nova Southeastern University has the only college of optometry in Florida and the only college of dentistry in South Florida, and had the first college of pharmacy in South Florida.

University School of Nova Southeastern University, a fully accredited independent college preparatory day school, enrolls students in prekindergarten through 12th grade and operates from NSU's main campus in Fort Lauderdale. NSU's programs are administered through academic centers that offer courses at campuses in Fort Lauderdale, North Miami Beach, and Dania Beach as well as other locations throughout Florida, across the nation, and at selected international sites. Despite the geographic diversity of sites where classes are offered, 89 percent of the student body attends classes in Florida, and 82 percent of all students enrolled attend classes in the tricounty area (i.e., Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties). With an annual budget of approximately $563 million, Nova Southeastern University also has a significant economic impact on the surrounding community. A recent NSU study revealed that the university and its students and employees had an annual economic impact of approximately $1.4 billion on the Florida economy.Student Life NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 11 Student Life Student Affairs The mission of Student Affairs is to foster student success and a university community.

Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility Purpose: This code seeks to promote high standards of behavior and academic integrity by setting forth the responsibilities of students as members of the university community. Abiding by the code ensures a climate wherein all members of the university community can exercise their rights of membership.24 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 Code of Student Conduct Statement The university is a community of scholars in which the ideals of freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and freedom of the individual are sustained. However, the exercise and preservation of these freedoms and rights require a respect for the rights of all in the community to enjoy them to the same extent. It is clear that in a community of learning, willful disruption of the educational process, destruction of property, and interference with the orderly process of the university as defined by the university administration or with the rights of other members of the university cannot be tolerated. Students enrolling in the university assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the university's function as an educational institution. To fulfill its functions of imparting and gaining knowledge, the university retains the power to maintain order within the university and to exclude those who are disruptive to the educational process. In support of the Code of Student Conduct, any violations of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and/or university policies and procedures may result in disciplinary action and/or criminal prosecution. Violations of academic and/or supplementary standards will be handled through the student's academic college, center, or school. Violations of conduct standards, supplementary standards, university policies, and/or procedures will be handled by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs or by the individual academic college, center, or school as deemed appropriate. Changes to the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility will be posted on the Student Affairs Web site. Students are required to be familiar with the rules, policies, and Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility. Nova Southeastern University Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities Nova Southeastern University, as a community of women and men, is committed to furthering scholarship, academic pursuits, and service to our society. As an institution, our purpose is to ensure all students an equal opportunity to fulfill their intellectual potential through pursuit of the highest standards of academic excellence. Certain rights and obligations flow from membership in any academic community committed to such goals: the rights of personal and intellectual freedom, which are fundamental to the idea of a university scrupulous respect for the equal rights and dignity of others dedication to the scholarly and educational purposes of the university and participation in promoting and ensuring the academic quality and credibility of the institution Students are responsible for obtaining, learning, and observing the established university and academic center policies as listed in all official publications. In addition, students must comply with the legal and ethical standards of the institution, as well as those of Broward County, the state of Florida, as well as any other laws, rules, and/or regulations of other jurisdictions. All members of the community should inform the appropriate official of any violation of conduct regulations. A. Academic Standards The university is an academic community and expects its students to manifest a commitment to academic integrity through rigid observance of standards for academic honesty. The university can function properly only when its members adhere to clearly established goals and values. Accordingly, the academic standards are designed to ensure that the principles of academic honesty are upheld. NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 25 The following acts violate the academic honesty standards: 1. Cheating\u2014 intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise 2. Fabrication\u2014 intentional and unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise 3. Facilitating Academic Dishonesty\u2014 intentionally or knowingly helping or attempting to help another to violate any provision of this code 4. Plagiarism\u2014 the adoption or reproduction of ideas, words, or statements of another person as one's own without proper acknowledgment Students are expected to submit tests and assignments that they have completed without aid or assistance from other sources. Using sources to provide information without giving credit to the original source is dishonest. Students should avoid any impropriety or the appearance thereof in taking examinations or completing work in pursuance of their educational goals. Students are expected to comply with the following academic standards: 1. Original Work Assignments such as course preparations, exams, texts, projects, term papers, practicum, or any other work submitted for academic credit must be the original work of the student. Original work may include the thoughts and words of another author. Entire thoughts or words of another author should be identified using quotation marks. At all times, students are expected to comply with the university and/or program center's recognized form and style manual and accepted citation practice and policy. Work is not original when it has been submitted previously by the author or by anyone else for academic credit. Work is not original when it has been copied or partially copied from any other source, including another student, unless such copying is acknowledged by the person submitting the work for the credit at the time the work is being submitted, or unless copying, sharing, or joint authorship is an express part of the assignment. Exams and tests are original work when no unauthorized aid is given, received, or used before or during the course of the examination, re-examination, and/or remediation. 2. Referencing the Works of Another Author All academic work submitted for credit or as partial fulfillment of course requirements must adhere to each program center's specific accepted reference manuals and rules of documentation. Standards of scholarship require that the writer give proper acknowledgment when the thoughts and words of another author are used. Students must acquire a style manual approved by their center and become familiar with accepted scholarly and editorial practice in their program. Students' work must comport with the adopted citation manual for their particular center. At Nova Southeastern University, it is plagiarism to represent another person's work, words, or ideas as one's own without use of a center-recognized method of citation. Deviating from center standards (see above) are considered plagiarism at Nova Southeastern University. 3. Tendering of Information All academic work must be the original work of the student. Knowingly giving or allowing one's work to be copied, giving out exam questions or answers, or releasing or selling term papers is prohibited.26 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 4.

Alcohol Policy Nova Southeastern University, as an institution of higher education, is dedicated to the well being of all members of the university community\u2014students, faculty members, employees, and administrators. Concerned with the misuse of alcohol and other drugs (both licit and illicit), it is the policy of NSU to endeavor to prevent substance abuse through programs of education and prevention. NSU recognizes alcoholism and drug abuse as illnesses or treatable disorders, and it is NSU's policy to work with members of the NSU community to provide channels of education and assistance. However, it is the individual's responsibility to seek help. NSU also recognizes that the possession and/or use of certain substances are illegal. NSU is further obligated to comply with all local, state, and federal laws. The policy governing the use of alcohol by students at Nova Southeastern University is in compliance with the laws of the state of Florida prohibiting the consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons who are minors (under the age of 21). The policy is based on the use of alcohol in moderation and under appropriate circumstances. The university recognizes that students are adults and are expected to obey the law and take personal responsibility for their own conduct. The laws of the state of Florida prohibit the possession or consumption of alcohol by individuals less than 21 years of age. 1. The university will not authorize the use of student activity fees or other student funds collected and administered by the university to provide alcoholic beverages for any student event. 2. The sale, delivery, possession, and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages on any property owned and controlled by NSU is strictly prohibited, except as licensed by the state of Florida or otherwise permitted in these regulations. The use of alcoholic beverages on university premises shall be considered a privilege and may be allowed only if consistent with state laws and university regulations, and only when it will not interfere with the decorum and academic atmosphere of the campus. 3. Exception to this prohibition is made for university housing residents of legal drinking age. The possession and use of alcoholic beverages in university housing is governed by the Residential Living Guide . 4. The president, or an appropriate designee, may approve other exceptions to this prohibition, to allow possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons of legal drinking age at designated events and locations on campus.34 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 5. The use of alcoholic beverages off campus by students of legal drinking age is permissible. However, incidents of intoxication and/or misconduct are subject to university disciplinary action. Students are expected to comply with municipal, state, and federal laws pertaining to the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages. Any violation of these laws may result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, probation, suspension, or expulsion from the university. Guidelines for the Use of Alcohol at University Student Events 1. Nova Southeastern University functions, which are student oriented, may serve only beer and wine. All requests for such events must be coordinated through NSU's Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs. 2. Entry fees may be charged, but this fee is only for admission to the event, not for the sale of beer or wine. 3. One-quarter hour before the approved ending time listed on the exemption, ticket sales will stop. 4. Any advertisements for the event (including leaflets, invitations, posters, letters, and all other forms of advertisements) cannot advertise alcohol. These advertisements must display the following information: Beverages will be available. Must have valid state-issued picture identification for verification of age. 5. An adequate amount of food and alternative beverages (such as water, juice, assorted sodas, coffee, and teas) must be available throughout the duration of the event. These will be provided at the cost of the organization holding the event. The amount of food and beverages appropriate for the size of the event will be determined by the director of the student union. 6. No organization or individual may purchase beer or wine for an event. All beer and wine must be purchased and served by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs. No other alcohol is permitted. 7. The director of student activities or designee will be present during an event at which beer and wine are served. If the director is not available, then a university employee will be designated by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs. The organizational contact of the event must be present during the entire event as a point of contact for the director of the student union or designee. 8. The sponsoring organization is responsible for ensuring that all university policies are strictly obeyed. These guidelines do not override existing university policies, but rather, these guidelines should be used in conjunction with any and all other university policies. 9. Appropriate precautionary measures must be in place to ensure that alcoholic beverages are not served to persons under the legal drinking age. These measures include having a designated individual, as deemed by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs, screening people entering the event and attaching a bracelet or stamp indicating those of legal drinking age. At any time during the event, the screening individual has the option to decline identification provided by an individual. The entire staff working the event has the right to refuse service to individuals deemed as having enough alcohol before or during the event. 10. Under no circumstances should anyone be coerced to drink alcohol. All drinking games, contests, or events that encourage excessive drinking are prohibited. The sponsoring organization is responsible for ensuring that all NSU policies and procedures are strictly obeyed. 11. It shall be at the discretion of the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs whether to make arrangements and pay for any security needs necessary based on the specifics of the event and the number of estimated attendees. NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 35 12. Violations of these guidelines during the event may result in the closing of the event. All individual violations will be referred to the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs for review. The university can take disciplinary actions as a result of violations of these guidelines. Abuse / Physical Assault Nova Southeastern University has expectations of the student body to resolve differences in a mature and respectful manner. Physical abuse, verbal abuse, threats, intimidations, coercion, and/or other conduct that threatens or endangers the health, safety, and/or welfare of any other member of the university community on or off campus is prohibited.

It is a violation of the law and contrary to the policy of this university for any unlicensed person to engage in the professional practice of health care, law, psychology, audiology, and/or education. Students who are appropriately licensed in a profession may engage in that profession's work to the extent provided by the law. (Students of the College of Osteopathic Medicine are required to comply with the College of Osteopathic Medicine's policy and procedure regarding professional work while enrolled.) Arson No student shall commit or aid in the intentional commission of an act that results in a fire being ignited, which causes damage, or is intended to cause damage, to the property of the university or the personal property of any member of the university community. Bomb Threats The placement of a bomb threat is an intolerable violation of university policy, which will result in expulsion from the university. Breaking and Entering The entering, or attempt to enter, any room, building, motor vehicle, or other form of property without proper authorization or consent is prohibited.

Any student whose use of their cellular phone violates another's reasonable expectation of privacy or produces any media as a result of the cellular phone capabilities without express consent may be found in violation of this policy. Violations of this policy may lead to disciplinary action that may result in confiscation of the cellular phone and referral to Student Affairs as a violation of the NSU Code of Student Conduct. Students are instructed to refer to their center's or college's individual program policies regarding cellular phone use and possession, because additional restrictions may apply. Closing Hours No student is permitted to enter or remain in any university building or facility, including the swimming pools, or in the academic areas of the university, after normal closing hours, unless written approval to do so has been obtained in advance from authorized university personnel. Complicity Students associated with, or present during, the commission of an act(s) by another, which constitutes a violation of university policy, may also be charged if the student's behavior constitutes permission, contributes to, or condones the violation. Computers The following five sections detail NSU policy related to the use of computers, email, and the Internet. The information is available at www.nova.edu/common-lib/policies . Acceptable Use of Computing Resources This policy provides guidelines for the appropriate and inappropriate use of the computing resources of Nova Southeastern University. It applies to all users of the university's computing resources including students, faculty and staff members, alumni, and guests of the university. Computing resources include all computers, related equipment, software, data, local area networks, and listservs for which the university is responsible as well as networks throughout the world to which the university provides computer access. The computing resources of Nova Southeastern University are intended to be used for its programs of instruction and research and to conduct the legitimate business of the university. All users must have proper authorization for the use of the university's computing resources. Users are responsible for seeing that these computing resources are used in an effective, ethical, and legal manner. Users must apply standards of normal academic and professional ethics and considerate conduct to their use of the university's computing resources. Users must be aware of the legal and moral responsibility for ethical conduct in the use of computing resources. Users have a responsibility not to abuse the network and resources, and to respect the privacy, copyrights, and intellectual property rights of others. In addition to the policy contained herein, usage must be in accordance with applicable university policies (see Related policies listed at the end of this section) and applicable state and federal laws. Among the more important laws are the Florida Computer Crimes Act, the Federal Computer Abuse Amendment Act 1994, the Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and the U.S. Copyright NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 37 Act. Copies of these laws and the NSU copyright policy may be examined in the Office of Academic Affairs. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material, including unauthorized peer-to-peer file sharing, may subject the student to civil and criminal liabilities. Policy violations generally fall into five categories that involve the use of computing resources: 1. for purposes other than the university's programs of instruction and research and the legitimate business of the university 2. to harass, threaten, discriminate, stalk, intimidate, or otherwise cause harm or attempt to cause harm to specific individuals or classes of individuals 3. to impede, interfere with, impair, or otherwise cause harm to the activities of others 4. to download, post or install to university computers, or transport across university networks, material that is illegal, proprietary, in violation of license agreements, in violation of copyrights, in violation of university contracts, or otherwise damaging to the institution 5. to recklessly, willfully, negligently, or maliciously interfere with or damage NSU computer or network resources or computer data, files, or other information Examples (not a comprehensive list) of policy violations related to the above five categories include: using computer resources for personal reasons using computer resources to invade the privacy of another sending email on matters not concerning the legitimate business of the university sending an individual or group repeated and unwanted (harassing) email or using email to threaten someone accessing, or attempting to access, another individual's data or information without proper authorization (e.g. using another's computing account and password to look at their personal information) creating a false email address propagating electronic chain mail, pyramid schemes or sending forged or falsified email obtaining, possessing, using, or attempting to use someone else's password regardless of how the password was obtained copying a graphical image from a Web site without permission posting a university site-licensed program to a public bulletin board using illegally obtained licensed data / software, or using licensed data / software in violation of their licenses or purchase agreements releasing or threatening to release a virus, worm, or other program that damages or otherwise harms a system, network, or data preventing others from accessing services attempting to tamper with or obstruct the operation of NSU's computer systems or networks using or attempting to use NSU's computer systems or networks as a means for the unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data outside the university improper peer-to-peer file sharing viewing, distributing, downloading, posting or transporting child or any pornography via the Web, including sexually explicit material for personal use that is not required for educational purposes 38 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 using university resources for unauthorized purposes (e.g. using personal computers connected to the campus network to set up Web servers for illegal, commercial, or profit-making purposes) violating federal copyright, intellectual property, and/or trademark laws or the NSU copyright, intellectual property, and/or policy Inappropriate conduct and violations of this policy will be addressed by the appropriate procedures and agents (e.g., the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs or the Office of Human Resources) depending on the individual's affiliation to the university. In cases where a user violates any of the terms of this policy, the university may, in addition to other remedies, temporarily or permanently deny access to any and all NSU computing resources, and appropriate disciplinary actions may be taken, up to and including dismissal. Related policies that also apply to Web pages are as follows: Student-related: Student Code of Conduct and Academic Integrity Faculty-related: Faculty Policy Manual Staff-related: Employee Handbook General policies: Copyright and Patent Policy, Computing Account Security Agreement Enterprise Username and Password Policy Policy Rationale Nova Southeastern University's (NSU) network and information systems provide the technical foundation for conduct of its academic, research and administrative missions. Providing this open access to information technology is imperative to ensuring academic freedom at the institution. An important part of providing this network access is ensuring that the network and associated information is secure. The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance to faculty, staff, students, and other authorized users regarding usernames and passwords in order to protect individual and University information and resources. Adherence to this policy will help ensure that the university network and information systems are standardized, secure, and available to all. Policy Statement Usernames must be assigned to each individual user to access any NSU network. Generic usernames may only be used in circumstances where they are deemed appropriate by the Chief Information Security Officer. Passwords must meet the minimum standards set by the Chief Information Security Officer and, if possible, applications and devices providing access to technical resources must technically enforce them. Faculty, staff, vendors, and students must adhere to the standards for all systems and applications that come into contact with University technical resources. Systems That Cannot Comply with Minimum Standards If the minimum standards cannot be met, the system must be protected by other means, such as, but not limited to, a dedicated firewall, limited network access or multi-factor authentication. These mitigating controls need to be documented and forwarded to the Chief Information Security Officer for recording and audit purposes. NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 39 Remedies The University reserves the right to suspend access to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the network, systems or information periodically audit passwords for compliance pursue disciplinary action because of non-compliance Username Standards The current policy for university employees is to create the user ID from a combination of the user's first initial concatenated with their last name. If the user name already exists we add a number. Example: John Smith Username: jsmith@nova.edu (The second John Smith to be setup would be setup as jsmith1@nova.edu.) The current policy for university students is to create the user ID from a combination of the user's first name initial, last name first initial, and system generated random numerals. Example: Mary Jones Username: mj2427@nova.edu Username and Email Address Note: The university email address must be formatted the same as the username, so in the case of user John Smith with username jsmith, the resulting email address would be jsmith@nova.edu. Minimum Password Standards for User Accounts The following standards have been established by the Chief Information Security Officer. Absent a more secure password selection, the minimum baseline password standard for users and owners of systems utilized by the University is as follows: Passwords chosen must be a minimum of eight characters in length. From the following four different subsets of character classifications, pick at least one character, from at least three of the different subsets. - uppercase letter (A-Z) - lowercase letter (a-z) - digit (0-9) - special character (~`!@#$%^&*()+=_-{}[]\\|:;\"'?/<>,.) (A password example for a user account could be: one upper case character, one digit character, one special character, and five or more additional characters of your choice.) be private passwords chosen must not - contain a common proper name, login ID, email address, initials, first, middle or last name each password chosen is new and different 40 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 Nova Southeastern University will also enforce the following system parameters to ensure more secure controls: maximum password age - 365 days minimum password age - one day (meaning that the user will not be able to change the new password they choose on their own for at least one day after the change is made) remembered passwords (History) - three (meaning that the user will not be able to use the last three passwords that they have used previous to the current password) Passwords for user accounts must be changed immediately when a user that had access to that account is no longer with NSU. Minimum Password Standards for Generic and Service Accounts The following standards have been established by the Chief Information Security Officer. Absent a more secure password selection, the minimum baseline password standard for generic user accounts and service accounts (service accounts are typically used to start services on servers and other devices) is as follows: passwords chosen must be a minimum of 15 characters in length from the following four different subsets of character classifications, pick at least one character, from at least three of the different subsets. - uppercase letter (A-Z) - lowercase letter (a-z) - digit (0-9) - special character (~`!@#$%^&*()+=_-{}[]\\|:;\"'?/<>,.) (A password example for a generic or service account could be: one upper case character, one digit character, one special character, and 12 or more additional characters of your choice.) be private passwords chosen must not - contain a common proper name, login ID, email address, initials, first, middle or last name each password chosen is new and different Nova Southeastern University will also enforce the following system parameters to ensure more secure controls: maximum password age\u2014365 days. minimum password age\u2014one day (meaning that the user will not be able to change the new password they choose on their own for at least one day after the change is made) remembered passwords (History) - three (meaning that the user will not be able to use the last three passwords that they have used previous to the current password) Passwords for generic and service accounts must be changed immediately when a user that had access to that account is no longer with NSU. NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 41 Account Lockout An account lockout policy disables a user account if an incorrect password is entered a specified number of times over a specified period. These policy settings help to prevent attackers from guessing users' passwords, and they decrease the likelihood of successful attacks on the network. Accounts that are logged into more than five times incorrectly (using the wrong username and password combination) will be locked out for a period of 15 minutes after which they will automatically be unlocked and available for use again. Security Notification If an account or password is suspected of having been compromised, report the incident to NSU IT Security at (954) 262-4643 or via email at and change the password(s) immediately. Security Auditing Password auditing may be performed on a periodic or random basis by NSU IT Security staff or its delegates. If a password is determined to be too weak during one of these scans, the user will be notified by IT Security and required to change it immediately. Pass phrases Pass phrases are not the same as passwords. A pass phrase is a longer version of a password and is, therefore, usually more secure. A pass phrase is typically composed of multiple words. Because of this, a pass phrase is usually more secure against attacks by hackers and malware. An example of a good pass phrase: \"MaryH4daL1ttleLamb!\", or the phrase \"I love to play badminton\" could become ILuv2PlayB@dm1nt()n All of the rules above that apply to passwords apply to pass phrases Access to NSU Online Systems The following policy is also available at www.nova.edu/common-lib/policies/isp.policy.html . In order to access the university's computing resources, all NSU students must provide their own Internet access service through a suitable Internet service provider. Electronic Mail Communications The following policy is also available at www.nova.edu/common-lib/policies/emailcomm.policy.html . NSU requires students and faculty and staff members to hold and maintain one official university computer account that is used to access major computing resources, including electronic mail. These university-assigned computer accounts correspond directly to NSU email addresses (see below). All official electronic mail communications directed to NSU students and faculty and staff members will be sent exclusively to NSU-assigned computer accounts to ensure timely and accurate delivery information. NSU students may forward their NSU generated email to external locations, but do so at their own risk. Relationship between NSU computer account and email address: If your assigned computer account name is janedoe Your email address will be janedoe@nsu.nova.edu Note: A computer account may also be referred to as an email name or a username.42 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 Web Pages\u2014Use of Material The following policy is also available at www.nova.edu/common-lib/policies/copyright.html . You should assume that materials you find on the Web are copyrighted unless a disclaimer or waiver is expressly stated. You may not place any materials owned by others (i.e., copyrighted works) on your Web pages(s) without the expressed permission of the copyright owner (examples: graphic images from other Web pages, articles, video, audio, photographs, software, or images scanned from published works). You may include short quotations of text provided you identify in an obvious way (e.g., in a footnote) the author and the work from which the quotation is taken. If you want to include something from another Web page in one of your Web pages, then link to it rather than copy it. The occurrence of plagiarism on your Web page is subject to the same sanctions as apply to plagiarism in any other media. Images in the NSU graphics repository may be used on Web pages without permission. Clip art images provided with licensed software may be used if permitted in the license agreement for such software. You may not place any pictures or videos of people on a Web page without the expressed permission of the people in the picture or video. Every person has the right to privacy, which includes the right to restrict the use of his / her own image. In addition, the picture or video may be protected by copyright. If you have received formal permission to use material owned by another, place the following notice on the page that contains the copied material: Copyright 2005 by (name of the copyright owner). Used with permission. Although a copyright notice is not required to assert your rights to your own original material, you may want to include a minimal notice of copyright in a Web page footer when appropriate. When used, the copyright notice should appear as follows: Web pages: Copyright 2005 (your name). All rights reserved. Organization Web pages (examples): Copyright 2005 Cornell Law Review . All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2005 Nova Southeastern University. All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2005 The Graduate School of Computer and Information Sciences. All Rights Reserved. Related policies that also apply to Web pages are as follows: 1. General policies: Policy on Acceptable Use of Computing Resources, Copyright and Patent Policy, Computing Account Security Agreement 2. Student-related: Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility 3. Faculty / administrator-related: Faculty Policy Manual 4. Staff-related: Employee Handbook Consensual Relations Between Faculty Members and Students At Nova Southeastern University, romantic and sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student are subject to the prohibition against sexual harassment. Romantic or sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class (including supervised student activities for which academic credit is given) may appear to be coercive, and are prohibited. Even when no coercion is present, such relationships create an appearance of impropriety and favoritism, which can impair the academic experience of all students in that class. It is, therefore, improper conduct and prohibited for a faculty member to engage in a romantic or sexual relationship with a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class. NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 43 Contracting on Behalf of the University Unless specifically authorized by the appropriate university authority, students may not contract on behalf of the university. Students who attempt to, or enter into, a contract on behalf of the university without proper authorization, are subject to disciplinary action that will result in a hold being placed on university records and transcripts until restitution is made, as well as such other sanctions as may be appropriate. Any contract entered into on behalf of the university by a student without proper authorization is void. Disabilities Nova Southeastern University complies with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. No qualified individual with a disability shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in any activity, service, or program of the university solely by reason of his or her disability. Each qualified individual with a disability who meets the academic and technical standards required to enroll in and participate in Nova Southeastern University's programs shall be provided with equal access to educational programs in the most integrated setting appropriate to that person's needs through reasonable accommodation. At the postsecondary level, it is the student's responsibility to initiate the process for disability services. The process for obtaining a reasonable accommodation is an interactive one that begins with the student's disclosure of disability and a request for a reasonable accommodation. The student has the responsibility to provide Nova Southeastern University with proper documentation of disability from a qualified physician or clinician who diagnoses disabilities and sets forth the recommended accommodations. Student requests for accommodation will be considered on an individual basis. Each student with a disability should discuss his or her needs with the disability service representative in his or her academic center, college, or school before the commencement of classes. For the name and contact information of the disability support services representative at your academic center, college, or school, contact the university ADA coordinator, Arlene Giczkowski, director of student disability services, at (954) 262-7189. Academic Accommodation(s) Process Requests for accommodation must be made in writing to the disability service representative in the student's academic center, college, or school and must be supported by appropriate documentation of recent medical, psychological, or educational assessment data administered and evaluated by a qualified professional. If the student disagrees with the accommodation(s) proposed by the disability service representative in consultation with the appropriate program director and/or faculty member, he or she may appeal the decision through that center's, college's, or school's appellate process. If the issue cannot be satisfactorily resolved at the center, college, or school level, the student may appeal in writing no later than 10 days after the final decision to the university's Academic Accommodation Appellate Committee, which consists of the university's ADA coordinator or associate dean of students (if the ADA coordinator was consulted in the accommodation process) and representatives from at least four different academic centers, colleges, and/or schools. The student will be given the opportunity to present his or her appeal in an appearance before the committee. The committee will also review all relevant documents submitted with the written appeal before rendering a decision. The student will be notified in writing of the committee's decision within a reasonable amount of time of the hearing. The decision of the university's Academic Accommodation Appellate Committee is final and binding upon the student without further appeal.44 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 Academic Accommodation Appellate Committee Guidelines 1. Upon receipt of a notice of appeal, the ADA coordinator shall schedule a meeting of the committee at a time and place convenient to the student and to the committee members. 2.

Students may also want to refer to the NSU Grievance Procedures for Nonacademic Disputes. Drug-Free Schools and Campuses In order to comply with the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (Pub. L. No. 101-226, Title 34 C. F . R., part 86), Nova Southeastern University has adopted the following policy for all workplace, school, campus, and field-based programs. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol are prohibited in and on property owned or controlled by Nova Southeastern University and as a part of any of its activities (see Controlled Substances Chart in Appendix A). The term \"illicit drugs\" refers to all illegal drugs, and to legal drugs obtained or used without a physician's order. This policy does not prohibit the use of prescribed medication under the direction of a physician. No Nova Southeastern University student or employee is to report to work or school while under the influence of illicit drugs or alcohol. Possession of paraphernalia for illegal drug use, or taking a prescription that does not belong to you, are also prohibited. There are serious health risks associated with the abuse of drugs and alcohol. If you, a fellow student, teacher, or coworker has a problem with abuse of drugs and/or alcohol, help can be provided at the following locations: NSU Programs NSU Student Counseling Services are available to all NSU students. For information, please call (954) 262-7050.46 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 Community Programs Department of Children and Families Substance Abuse Program Office 1317 Winewood Boulevard, Bldg. 6, Third Floor Tallahassee, Florida 32399-0700 487-2920 Alcoholics Anonymous: (954) 462-0265 Narcotics Anonymous: (954) 476-9297 When a student uses or deals in drugs, he or she also risks incarceration and/or fines. The attached federal sentencing guidelines indicate federal penalties for trafficking in drugs. In addition to the federal sanctions, Florida state statutes provide sanctions in regard to the use, possession, and/or sale of illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol. Punishment varies depending on the amount and type of drugs and/ or alcohol involved. Felony convictions range from one year to life imprisonment. Possession of not more than 20 grams of cannabis is punishable as a misdemeanor of the first degree. Punishment for misdemeanors ranges from less than 60 days to one-year imprisonment. Under Sec. 893.13, Florida Statutes: It is unlawful for any person to sell, manufacture, deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver a controlled substance. Violation of this statute is a felony and is punishable under Chapter 775 of the Florida Statutes.

Criminal penalties for DUI include, but are not limited to, fines and incarceration. By applying for a driver's license and accepting and using a driver's license, a person holding the driver's license is deemed to have expressed consent to submit to breath, blood, and urine tests for alcohol, chemical substances, or controlled substances. Any Nova Southeastern University student determined to have violated this policy will be subject to referral for prosecution by the appropriate authorities. Other sanctions include evaluation / treatment for drug-use disorder, which may include mandatory completion of a drug / alcohol abuse rehabilitation program, and/or other university sanctioning, which may include expulsion. All Nova Southeastern University students will, as a condition of their enrollment, abide by the terms of this policy. Drug Policy\u2014Zero Tolerance Any student found in violation of the drug-free schools and campuses policy with regard to the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of illicit drugs or alcohol will face serious university disciplinary action, which may include expulsion from the university (see Controlled Substances Chart in Appendix A). NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 47 Emergency Situations To report an on-campus emergency situation from an on-campus phone, contact the police at 9-911 and public safety at extension 28999. If calling from off campus, dial the police at 911 and public safety at (954) 262-8999. Failure to Comply All students and guests of NSU are expected to comply with the directives or reasonable requests of university officials acting in the performance of their duties. This requirement includes reasonable requests for students to meet appointments in administrative offices; participation in administration and/ or judicial proceedings; and the compliance by the stated deadline with all the terms and conditions of all disciplinary sanctions. Administrative discretion may be used to place a hold on a student's account (registration, grades, etc.) if the student fails to comply with the directions of a university official. False Information Providing false or misleading information to the university or a university official, or to a local, state, or national agency or official is a violation of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility subjecting a student to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion or rescission. Falsification of Records Falsification of university records is prohibited. University records include, but are not limited to, admission, enrollment, registration, financial aid, student disciplinary, academic, health records, parking decals / hang tags and student employment records. Inappropriate conduct and violations of this policy will be addressed by the appropriate procedures and agents (e.g., the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs or the Office of Human Resources) depending on the individual's affiliation with the university. In cases where a student violates any of the terms of this policy, the university will take appropriate disciplinary actions, up to and including expulsion. Fire Safety Unnecessarily setting off a fire alarm; unnecessarily tampering with fire hoses, extinguishers, exit signs, and alarm equipment; or blocking fire exits and other means of impeding traffic may result in immediate university disciplinary action and criminal prosecution.

Students found in violation of the prohibition against gambling may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Grievance Procedures for Nonacademic Disputes This process should be followed for all nonacademic grievances of policies / procedures that are not governed by a specific academic center, program, college, or school. Academic grievances should be referred to the student's academic center. The purpose of these grievance procedures is to promote the orderly resolution of problems arising out of a student complaint concerning a policy, procedure, or administrative action of Nova Southeastern University. Grievances can often be adversarial, unpleasant, and unsatisfying, so we recommend that students discuss problems before resorting to the formal grievance steps. When formal grievance steps are perceived as necessary, students have a right to a fair process and hearing without retribution. 1. First, the student should attempt to resolve an issue in dispute at the level at which the dispute occurred. This attempt must be in writing (i.e., email, regular mail, or fax). The student may wish to use certified mail to verify receipt of the correspondence. In the correspondence, the student must present a rationale for his or her position based on factual information. 2. The student will receive a reply, in writing, which addresses the complaint. 3. If the reply is not acceptable, the student is encouraged to submit the complaint in writing to the associate dean of student affairs. The associate dean of student affairs will attempt to resolve the dispute. 4. If the associate dean is unable to resolve the dispute, he or she will notify the student and the dean of student affairs in writing. 5. The student may then appeal in writing to the vice president of student affairs. 6. The vice president will investigate and review the findings, and will notify the student in writing of his or her decision. 7. The vice president's decision is final and binding and cannot be appealed. Guests Students are welcome to bring guests to the campus, but must assume responsibility for the conduct of their guests and must accompany them at all times. If a guest is asked to leave a specific area of campus, it is the responsibility of the student host to cooperate with the university official making the request. The university reserves the right to exclude all guests from any area on campus in times of impending or actual crises or emergencies, such as hurricanes, campus disruptions, or bomb threats, and to exclude any guest(s) from any area of the campus for any reason the university deems appropriate. Health Policies Communicable Diseases Guidelines It is the intent of the university to protect students from communicable diseases that pose reasonable risk of harm to members of the university community. It is also the intent of the university to protect the rights of those infected with a communicable disease. Students who do become infected with a communicable disease must report the contracting of the disease to their program dean and the associate dean of student affairs and are subject to the guidelines listed below. The university will be NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 49 flexible in its response to incidents of communicable diseases, evaluating each occurrence in light of this policy and current available medical information. NSU will make available to the university community detailed information concerning the transmissibility of communicable diseases and precautions that can be taken to prevent the spread of various communicable diseases. Infected students can continue to study and work as long as they are able to continue to perform regular responsibilities satisfactorily, and as long as the best available medical evidence indicates that their continual status does not present a health or safety threat to themselves or others. An infected student returning to school after a leave of absence for reasons related to a communicable disease must provide a statement from the treating physician indicating current medical status. Students should submit their statement to their program dean or appropriate designee based on the policies of their respective college, school, or center, and the associate dean of students. Within reason, the university will make accommodations to the infected person, whenever possible, to ensure continuity in the classroom. No infected student may be dismissed from the university solely on the basis of a diagnosis of an infection of a contagious disease. A decision to dismiss or discharge will only be made after reasonable accommodation has been attempted, and an examination of facts demonstrates that the infected person can no longer perform essential requirements of the position or program, with or without a reasonable accommodation, or poses a reasonable threat to the health and safety of others. In the event that a student has a concern about the potential for the spread of a communicable disease within the university community, those concerns should be brought to the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs for review consistent with the current available information on the spread of the particular communicable disease. After review and evaluation of the concerns, if there appears to be a reasonable likelihood of the spread of the disease within the university community by an infected person, the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs will, after notification of the issues presented to the university president, contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or Broward Health Department for recommendations of appropriate action consistent with state law.

Communication related to the proceeding will be limited to identified individuals using administrative discretion on a need-to-know basis. Jurisdiction of University Policies and Procedures Students must adhere to NSU policies and procedures on the main campus; at any other NSU site; or while participating in any university-sponsored program, event, or activity. Lake Swimming Swimming in any lake, canal, and/or body of water on the Nova Southeastern University campus or being in the shark fountain is strictly prohibited and any violations of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action. Life-Threatening Behavior Nova Southeastern University recognizes that certain life-threatening behavior (e.g., suicide threats, gestures, or attempts; eating disorders; substance abuse; threats, gestures, or attempts to harm others) is a sign of personal distress. The university is committed to helping students alleviate whatever stress factors are precipitating life-threatening behavior by providing support and/or referral through use of appropriate resources. However, since it is critically important to maintain civility and respect for all members of the university community, it is recognized that action must be taken when such behavior is considered by the university to be disruptive to and unacceptable in the academic and social / living environment.54 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 Littering / Projecting Objects Students may not throw, discard, place, or deposit litter or project objects from university buildings or on university grounds except in receptacles provided for such purposes. Misuse of Telephones NSU students who misuse telephone lines or university accounts will be subject to disciplinary action and restitution.

Excessive noise that disturbs the campus environment, unless approved by the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs or designee for a special event, is not allowed. Students are held responsible for the actions of their guests. Off-Campus Violations The university reserves the right to take disciplinary action for violations of the Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility and university policies and procedures, even when they occur off campus or through electronic communications.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), also known as the Buckley Amendment, affords a student certain rights with respect to his or her education records. These rights include The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the university receives a request for access. A student should submit to the Registrar's Office a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The Registrar's Office will arrange for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. The right to request the amendment of the student's education record that the student believes is inaccurate or misleading. A student who believes that his or her education records contain information that is inaccurate or misleading, or is otherwise in violation of the student's privacy or other rights, may discuss his or her concerns informally with the University Registrar. If the decision is in agreement with the students' requests, the appropriate records will be amended. If not, the student will be notified within a reasonable period of time that the records will not be amended and will be informed by the Office of the University Registrar of his or her right to a formal hearing. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, collection agent, loan servicing agent, or the National Student Clearinghouse); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks.

For further assistance on this matter, students should contact the University Registrar's Office. Health Care Privacy (HIPAA) Statement The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requires health care providers to abide by the regulations for privacy and confidentiality of protected health information (PHI). The HIPAA privacy rule covers all individually identifiable health information at Nova Southeastern University health care centers whether the information is electronic, paper, or spoken. Because NSU operates health care centers, it is responsible for enacting privacy policies and procedures. The various NSU colleges, schools, and educational programs have enacted policies for their health care centers. NSU health care center staff members, students, and faculty members are responsible for following the policies that have been implemented by the applicable NSU health care center. In addition, the HIPAA privacy rule also requires that NSU provides education for health care center staff members, students, and faculty members. As such, all applicable NSU colleges, schools, and educational programs shall train their students rotating at NSU health care centers and other health NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 57 care facilities in compliance with the requirements of NSU's HIPAA privacy policies and procedures, patient privacy and confidentiality practices, privacy laws, and the federal HIPAA privacy regulations. NSU students and faculty members may also be subject to the HIPAA privacy policies and procedures enacted by the various health care facilities in which they train. It is the responsibility of the student and faculty member to familiarize himself or herself with these policies upon entering each facility. Any questions concerning the policies can be directed to the privacy contact of your NSU health care center or the NSU privacy officer. Public Laws Students are responsible for compliance with all public laws. Any act that could constitute a violation of public laws will establish cause for legal and/or disciplinary action by the university. Sexual Misconduct and Harassment The following three sections relate to NSU policy and definitions of sexual misconduct and sexual harassment. Sexual Misconduct Policy NSU, in compliance with the spirit of various federal and state laws (e.g., Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and other similar state and federal statutes or regulations), adopts the policy and fosters an environment where no individual may threaten the health, safety, and welfare of a member of the university community; or any person on university property; or at a university-sponsored or -supervised activity, through the commission of a sexual assault, engaging in sexual harassment, discrimination, battery, and/or misconduct, including acquaintance rape. Definition: NSU acknowledges acquaintance rape in its definition of sexual assault. Acquaintance rape is defined as forced, manipulated, or coerced sexual intercourse by a friend or acquaintance. It is an act of violence, aggression, and power, in which the victim, under protest or without consent, is forced to experience a sexual act through verbal coercion, threats, physical restraint, and/or physical violence. Consideration and rights to be afforded to all campus community members regarding the type of sexual assault: a. the right to have all sexual assaults against them treated with seriousness; and the right, as victims, to be treated with dignity b. the right to have sexual assaults committed against them investigated and adjudicated by the duly constituted criminal and civil authorities of the governmental entity in which the crimes occurred; and the right to the full and prompt cooperation and assistance of campus personnel in notifying the proper authorities c. the right to be free from pressure that would suggest that the victims: (i) not report crimes committed against them to civil and criminal authorities or to the campus public safety and disciplinary official; or (ii) report crimes as lesser offenses than the victims perceive them to be d. the right to be free from suggestions that sexual assault victims not report, or underreport, crimes because (i) victims are somehow responsible for the commission of crimes against them; (ii) victims were contributorially negligent or assumed the risk of being assaulted; or (iii) by reporting crimes, they would incur unwanted personal publicity58 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 e. the right to the full and prompt, reasonable cooperation from campus personnel in responding to the incident f. the right to have access to counseling services established by the university or other victim- service entities g. after campus sexual assaults have been reported, the victims of such crimes shall have the right to require that campus personnel take the necessary steps or actions reasonably feasible to prevent unwanted contact with, or proximity to, alleged assailants h. the right to be informed of disciplinary proceedings, as well as the outcome of such proceedings i. the same right to assistance, or ability to have others present, that is afforded to the accused during any campus disciplinary proceedings Disciplinary Action: In addition to any criminal or civil actions that may be pending or in process, the university reserves the right to pursue separate disciplinary action against any individual who violates any portion of this policy. Education and Information: The university, through the departments of the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs, residential life, recreation and wellness, and public safety, provides educational and informational programs and materials regarding awareness of rape, acquaintance rape, and other sex offenses. This information is provided through scheduled and on-demand programs. Nova Southeastern University students are encouraged to report to the police (9-911 on campus and 911 off campus), public safety (extension 28999 on campus and (954) 262-8999 off campus), and a university administrator all occurrences of sexual assault, either violent assault or acquaintance (date) rape. Professional staff members in the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs, residential life, student counseling, and public safety are among those who are trained and willing to assist students who are victims of sexual assault. If the victim then reports the crime to an administrator, the following procedure will prevail. Third-Party Reports: When there is a report of sexual assault, the person receiving the report whether a student, faculty member, or staff member is encouraged, in turn, to report the incident to a student life and/or residential life administrator. If the person reporting that assault is a third party (not the victim), the administrator will do the following: a. advise the reporter to counsel the victim to seek medical assistance b. advise the reporter to encourage the victim to talk with a counselor from the Rape Center in Broward County, a staff counselor at the Henderson Student Counseling Center, a student affairs and/or residential life administrator, the director of public safety, or some other university official c. protect the confidentiality of the victim (if name is known) Victim Reports: If a student who is a victim of sexual assault reports the matter to a university administrator or any other university employee, the administrator and/or employee will encourage the victim to seek immediate medical attention and assist the victim in appropriate methods and avenues to receive medical care. In reporting a sexual assault, the victim controls the process. The administrator and/or employee will encourage the victim to authorize notification of the university Public Safety Office (PSO) of the occurrence of the crime, and then to cooperate with PSO and student life and/or residential life and housing in reporting the matter to the rape victim advocate in the state attorney's office and to local police. The victim will be assured of university support including reasonable confidentiality, full cooperation with any police investigation, and NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 59 counseling through the Henderson Student Counseling Center and the Rape Crisis Center. If the victim authorizes the notification of PSO, the administrator and/or employee will inform the Office of the Vice President of Student Affairs, which will assist as liaison with PSO. Harassment Statement Harassment is defined as any conduct (words or acts), whether intentional or unintentional or a product of the disregard for the safety, rights, or welfare of others, which causes physical, verbal, or emotional harm; or conduct, which intimidates, degrades, demeans, threatens, hazes, or otherwise interferes with another person's rights to comfort and right to be free of a hostile environment. This includes, but is not limited to, loud or aggressive behavior; behavior that disrupts the orderly functioning of the university; disturbs the peace and/or comfort of person(s) on the campus of the university; creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. It also includes any conduct (words or acts) in which the university can determine a threat exists to the educational process or to the health or safety of a member of the NSU community. Sexual Harassment Policy It is the intent of Nova Southeastern University to protect all employees and students from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972. Sexual harassment undermines the integrity of the employment and academic environment, debilitates morale, and interferes with the effectiveness of employees and students. In accordance with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's promulgated guidelines, unwelcome sexual advances, unwanted requests for favors of a sexual nature, and any other unwanted verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature are considered sexual harassment if explicit or implicit submission to sexual overtones is made a term or condition of employment or academic program status employment or academic program status decisions are made on the basis of whether submission to or rejection of sexual overtones occurred a sexually intimidating, hostile, or offensive atmosphere unreasonably interferes with an individual's work or academic program status performance At Nova Southeastern University, sexual harassment of or by employees or students includes: 1. unwelcome or unwanted sexual advances. This includes unwelcome physical contact or sexual advances considered unacceptable by another individual. 2. requests or demands for sexual favors. This includes subtle or blatant pressures or requests for any type of sexual favor, accompanied by an implied or stated promise of preferential treatment or negative consequence concerning one's employment or academic program status. 3. verbal abuse that is sex-oriented or considered unacceptable by another individual, as well as sexually derogatory comments. This includes commenting about an individual's body or appearance when such comments go beyond mere courtesy, telling jokes that are clearly unwanted and considered offensive by others, or other tasteless sexually oriented comments, innuendoes, or actions that offend others. 4. engaging in any type of sexually oriented conduct that would unreasonably interfere with another's work or academic program status performance. This includes extending unwanted sexual attention to someone that reduces personal productivity or time available to work at assigned tasks. 5. creating a work or academic program status environment that is intimidating, hostile, or offensive because of unwelcome or unwanted sexually-oriented conversations, suggestions, requests, demands, physical contacts, or attentions.60 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 Nova Southeastern University will not tolerate sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is an insidious practice. It demeans individuals being treated in such a manner, and creates unacceptable stress for the entire organization. Persons harassing others will be dealt with swiftly and vigorously. Normal, non-coercive interaction that is acceptable to both parties is not considered to be sexual harassment. All allegations of sexual harassment of or by an employee, client, or vendor will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the Office of Human Resources and should be reported promptly to the associate vice president of human resources. At Nova Southeastern University, sexual harassment by employees, students, or third parties of students is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when 1. submission to such conduct is made to appear to be a term or condition of enrollment, attendance, or participation in a class 2. submission to or rejection of such conduct affects academic decisions 3. such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with a student's academic performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive academic environment 4. unwelcome physical contact, including but not limited to patting, pinching, or touching 5. offensive or demeaning sexual remarks, jokes, or gestures Students aggrieved by a violation of this policy may file a grievance under their center's grievance procedure, or may report the conduct to the dean of the center, any other faculty member, or the associate vice president of human resources. The associate vice president of human resources or the associate dean of students must be notified immediately by the center, the dean, or faculty member upon receiving a report of sexual harassment. All reports of sexual harassment will be thoroughly investigated by either the associate dean of students (Title IX coordinator) or the Office of Human Resources. Any individual who violates any portion of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. At Nova Southeastern University, romantic and sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student are subject to the prohibition against sexual harassment. Romantic or sexual relationships between a faculty member and a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class (including supervised student activities for which academic credit is given) may appear to be coercive, and are prohibited. Even when no coercion is present, such relationships create an appearance of impropriety and favoritism, which can impair the academic experience of all students in that class. It is; therefore, improper conduct and prohibited for a faculty member to engage in a romantic or sexual relationship with a student then enrolled in the faculty member's class. Solicitation and Posting Policy All on-campus sales and solicitations must be operated or sponsored by a university-recognized student organization and must receive the proper authorization. The Office of Residential Life and Housing must approve sales and solicitations in the residence halls. The following flyers are acceptable looking for a roommate selling a car, book, furniture, etc. NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 61 events or information associated with NSU clubs and organizations events or information associated with NSU administrative offices or academic programs academic services and programs associated with NSU The following flyers are not acceptable in any campus location publicity making any reference to drugs or alcohol, containing discriminatory language, or containing inappropriate photos, graphics, or language outside vendor or company promotions outside vendor health insurance information Academic centers, colleges, schools, residence halls, and campus buildings may have their own specific solicitation and posting policies. Visit www.nova.edu/studentleadership/forms/posting_policy.pdf for more information. Stalking Any individual who willfully, knowingly, maliciously, or repeatedly follows; harasses; attempts to contact or communicate (written, verbal or electronic); and makes a credible threat placing the individual in reasonable fear of death or bodily harm may be in violation of NSU's stalking policy. Such conduct is prohibited. Stalking causes substantial emotional distress in individuals and serves no legitimate purpose. Course of conduct means a pattern of conduct composed of a series of acts over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose. Student Publications Nova Southeastern University, as publisher, bears the legal responsibility for the contents of student publications. In the delegation of editorial responsibility to students, the university provides sufficient editorial freedom for the student publications to maintain their integrity of purpose as vehicles of free inquiry and free expression in the Nova Southeastern University academic community. The delegated editorial freedom of student editors and managers is subject to corollary responsibilities to be governed by the canons of responsible journalism, such as the avoidance of libel; indecent, undocumented allegations; attacks on personal integrity; and the techniques of harassment and innuendo. As safeguards for the delegated editorial freedom of student publications, the following provisions are made: the student press shall be free of censorship and advance approval of copy, and its editors and managers shall be free to develop their own editorial policies and news coverage editors and managers of student publications shall be protected from arbitrary suspension and removal because of student, faculty, administrative, or public disapproval of editorial policy or content. Only for proper and stated causes shall editors and managers be subject to removal, and then by orderly and prescribed procedures all university published and financed student publications shall explicitly state on the editorial page that the opinions therein expressed are not necessarily those of Nova Southeastern University or of the student body62 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 Theft or Unauthorized Possession Students involved in the taking, sale, or possession of property without the consent of its owner or without proper remuneration may be subject to university disciplinary action and a fine, as well as arrest and prosecution by legal authorities. Title IX Compliance Policy Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, 20 USC Sections 1681 et seq., prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in schools, whether in academics or athletics.

Loans are considered \"self-help\" aid and always have to be repaid. Student employment requires the student to work in exchange for a pay check. Please remember that students interested in federal financial aid must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and meet general eligibility criteria. For detailed information on the financial aid process and sources of aid, visit the financial aid Web site at www.nova.edu/financialaid. Financial Aid Checklist R 1. Complete the FAFSA and NSU State Aid Application. Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at www.fafsa.gov annually. It becomes available each January 1. The earlier you apply, the better chance you have of being considered for maximum available funds. To apply for Florida grants and scholarships, undergraduate students should also complete the NSU State Aid Application available at www.nova.edu/financialaid/forms/index.html . R 2. Plan for Housing and Meal Expenses. Your budget includes a housing and meal component. Please ensure that your budget covers these expenses if you intend to live on campus. R 3. Check Your Financial Aid Account Frequently. Regularly check your financial aid status via SharkLink to ensure that you have no outstanding requirements. The link to My Financial Aid is located in the center of your SharkLink Student tab. Now is a good time to confirm your admissions status. You will have to be fully admitted in order for your financial aid funds to disburse. R 4. Submit Additional Documents and Complete a Master Promissory Note. Some students may be required to submit additional documents prior to being awarded. You will be notified of outstanding requirements via NSU (SharkLink) email. Your requirements (outstanding and completed) can also be viewed in WebSTAR (access via SharkLink). If you are interested in receiving Federal Direct Loans, you will be required to complete a Direct Loan Master Promissory Note (MPN). NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 73 R 5.

The best place to start is the scholarship Web page at www.nova.edu/financialaid/scholarships/. R 7. Check Your NSU (SharkLink) Email Daily. NSU (SharkLink) email and WebSTAR are the official means that the OSFA will use to communicate with students. Keep up-to-date by checking your NSU email daily. R 8. Register for Classes (early). Students awarded Federal Direct Loans must be enrolled at least half time. Half-time enrollment is defined as six credits per semester for all undergraduate students. For graduate and first professional students, your program of study defines half-time status. Enrollment requirements for federal and state grants vary. Familiarize yourself with the enrollment requirements defined by your program office as well as by the financial aid programs through which you are receiving aid. Be sure to register as early as possible to ensure timely disbursement of your financial aid funds.

For complete information, please review http://www.nova.edu/financialaid/grantsloans /title_iv_return.html. Student Employment There are three main student employment programs: Federal Work-Study (FWS), Nova Student Employment (NSE), and Job Location and Development (JLD).

Students awarded FWS may participate in the America Reads/ America Counts Programs through which students serve as reading or math tutors to elementary school children. For more information on NSU part-time and full-time student employment, visit www.nova.edu/financialaid/employment. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) In order to receive financial assistance, a student must continually meet four criteria of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). According to federal regulations, effective July 1, 2011, NSU has established university-wide quantitative, qualitative, maximum time frame, and pace SAP requirements. Students who fail to meet SAP during the 2013-2014 academic year will not be eligible for Title IV federal and Florida state financial aid during the 2014-2015 academic year. Comprehensive information is available on the financial aid Web site at www.nova.edu/sap . Veterans Benefits Department of Veterans Affairs educational benefits are designated to provide eligible individuals with an opportunity for educational and career growth.

Standards of Progress A student receiving veterans education benefits must maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP). Standards for SAP are published at www.nova.edu/sap . A student who, at the end of the SAP evaluation period, has not met satisfactory academic progress may file an appeal based on extenuating circumstances. With an approved appeal, a veteran student may be certified veteran education benefits on a probationary basis. If the student does not meet satisfactory academic progress by the end of the probationary period (one evaluation period), the student's veterans education benefits will be terminated. For VA payment of benefits purposes, an I (Incomplete) designation for a course must be converted to a credit grade counting toward graduation, or a failing grade, by the end of one calendar year, unless permission for a delay is granted by the academic program office and/or dean for that program. Grade/Progress Reports for Students Receiving Veterans Benefits Nova Southeastern University furnishes each student with a Notification of Posting of Grade with instructions on how to view an unofficial transcript that shows current status of grades and earned semester hours for all courses completed and/or attempted, and grades for courses in which the student is currently enrolled. At the end of every evaluation period (e.g., term, semester) each veteran can request an official transcript that shows the current status of grades and earned semester hours for all courses completed and/or attempted. This transcript can be obtained from the One-Stop Shop at the William and Norma Horvitz Administration Building or Terry Administration Building or online at https://sharklink.nova.edu/cp/home/displaylogin . Conduct Policy for Students Receiving Veterans Benefits All VA students are expected to comply with the legal and ethical standards of Nova Southeastern University. Academic dishonesty and/or nonacademic misconduct will result in disciplinary action. Specific instances of misconduct include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, knowingly furnishing false information to the institution, and forging or altering institution documents and/or academic credentials. The institution reserves the right to require a student to withdraw at any time for misconduct as described above. It also reserves the right to impose probation or suspension on a student whose conduct is determined to be unsatisfactory. Students who feel their rights have been denied are entitled to due process. Students should refer to the Appeals and Grievance Procedures listed in this student handbook. The Office of the University Bursar The Office of the University Bursar is responsible for billing students, collecting and depositing payments, issuing refunds from excess financial aid funds, and verifying students' eligibility for financial aid funds. Bursar's Office Policies By registering for courses at Nova Southeastern University, the student accepts financial responsibility for payment of all institutional costs including, but not limited to, tuition, fees, NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 75 housing and meal plan (if applicable), health insurance (if applicable), and any additional costs when those charges become due. Payment is due in full at the time of registration. NSU ebills are sent the middle of each month. However, to avoid late charges, students should not wait for their billing statement to pay their tuition and fees. A student will not be able to register for future semesters until all outstanding balances from previous semesters have been paid in full. If a student has a balance 30 days after the start of the semester, a hold and a $100 late fee will be placed on his or her account. This hold stops all student services, including, but not limited to, access to the University RecPlex, academic credentials, and future registrations. It will remain on the student's account until the balance has been paid in full. Delinquent student account balances may be reported to a credit bureau and referred to collection agencies or litigated. Delinquent students will be liable for any costs associated with the collection of unpaid charges, including attorney fees and court costs. All registration agreements shall be construed in accordance with Florida law, and any lawsuit to collect unpaid fees may be brought in the appropriate court sitting in Broward County, Florida, regardless of the student's domicile. Methods of Payment NSU accepts Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Check payments include traveler's checks, cashier's checks, personal checks, and money orders. International checks must be in U.S. funds only and drawn on a U.S. bank. Wire transfers are accepted. Electronic check and credit card payments can also be made through NSU eBill. Credit card authorization forms can be downloaded from the Bursar's Web site at www.nova.edu/bursar/forms /cc_authorization.pdf and faxed to (954) 262-2473.

The 10-Month Payment Plan is available for the combined fall and winter semesters. For details, visit www.nova.edu/bursar/payment/payment_plans.html . Employer Tuition Assistance Plans Undergraduate students participating in employer tuition assistance programs who wish to defer tuition payment need to submit a letter of eligibility, a purchase order from their employer, or details of the program from the employer's human resources office or the company Web site. They must also provide postdated payments (checks or credit card authorizations) for the amount of tuition. Payment of tuition only (not fees), may then be deferred for five weeks after course completion. A $75 deferment fee is charged for this service and must be paid at registration, along with all other fees. Students must notify the Office of Student Financial Assistance if they are participating in the Employer Tuition Assistance Plan. Graduate students should inquire with their program office regarding any employer tuition assistance deferment plans. 76 NSU Student Handbook 2013-2014 Florida Prepaid College Plan NSU accepts and bills the Florida Prepaid College Plan for tuition, fees, and on-campus housing costs. The plans are based on the tuition rates of the tax-assisted Florida public colleges and universities.
