LevineIn Trauma and Memory, bestselling author Dr. Peter Levine (creator of the Somatic Experiencing approach) tackles one of the most difficult and controversial questions of PTSD/trauma therapy: Can we trust our memories? While some argue that traumatic memories are unreliable and not useful, others insist that we absolutely must rely on memory to make sense of past experience. Building on his 45 years of successful treatment of trauma and utilizing case studies from his own practice, Dr. Levine suggests that there are elements of truth in both camps. While acknowledging that memory can be trusted, he argues that the only truly useful memories are those that might initially seem to be the least reliable: memories stored in the body and not necessarily accessible by our conscious mind. $21.95.

It Can Actually Help Adults Combat Stress. As we grow older, we put aside our crayons and colored pencils in favor of more respectable writing utensils like pens and highlighters. However, it turns out coloring can be beneficial for adults \u2014 namely for its de-stressing power. The practice generates wellness, quietness and also stimulates brain areas related to motor skills, the senses and creativity. In fact, publishers have lately been launching coloring books specifically for adults. The trend is alive and well in countries in Europe and North America. \u2014 huffingtonpost.comThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 4 Since 1982, Crazy Wisdom Bookstore has served as a center of information in the subjects of conscious living, holistic health, bodymind therapies, psychology, Buddhism, spiritual development and consciousness.

Rituals can keep us sane, keep us honest with ourselves, and keep us going, whether we are aware of it or not. I spoke with twelve notable people within Ann Arbor's body/mind/spirit community, some well-known holistic practitioners in the region and others you may not know as well, to hear about their daily rituals. Each answered three questions that provide an outline, neatly drawn around the lives of these twelve talented people. The questions were: What do you do in the morning to wake and ready yourself for the day? What do you do throughout the day to maintain your composure?What do you do at night to wind down and prepare for rest? David Ufer David is a well-established local businessman. He is a certified Iyengar yoga teacher and a former Yoga Coordinator for the Ann Arbor YMCA. He currently teaches at Yoga Focus, founded and owned by his wife, Karen Ufer. As a student of yoga for forty years, my daily ritual is not particularly unusual. I practice yoga asanas most every morning before I go into work. As we live each day with our varying struggles and joys, I'm attempting to be more observant and hopefully playful with breathing in the course of the day. I get upside down by practicing yoga inversions at the end of the day. Beth Barbeau Beth is a traditional midwife, childbirth educator, and a resonance repatterning practitioner. She is also the owner of Indigo Forest, on Jackson Road, which blends teaching practical, inspiring classes with a \"natural family specialty store.\" Before I get out of bed, I do a jin shin , a series of hand holds. Jin shin is an energy system awareness. The hand holds help to balance and unify the body. So I usually do those and start to feel a lot better. Then I get a quart of water, add half a lemon, first thing in the morning to help my liver and hydrate. I usually meditate a few minutes. When I'm doing well, I also do a series of stretches and a walk. When I walk I do some breathing and praying, and when I'm doing that my day seems to go in a much more positive direction. I take little mini breaks in which I do deep breathing and [drink] water. I also am doing some jin shin finger holds, some energetic balancers. I might also do some squatting; there's a whole thing that restores your adrenal glands through squatting. There's a whole Tibetan tribe, many of whom lived until they were over 100, and worked seven days a week \u2014 they look beautiful. They squat for a few minutes every hour. So when I'm not going too fast, it really helps to sustain my energy throughout the day. I try to do a little bit of awareness of what's called \"cutting cords,\" sort of an energetic way of making sure that I'm energetically being very present and not trailing anyone's energy on to the next thing. I tend to make a list for the next day. I do some stretching, and my writing time is often at night. Both at the beginning and end of the day, I usually stand on the earth, spend a few minutes wandering the garden, things like that. I connect with nature even just by sticking my head out the door to the backyard. Especially in the morning, I stick my head out to smell the air. Henry Buchtel Henry is an acupuncturist and herbalist who spent 11 years studying in China. He is now the President of the Michigan Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. I put clothes on immediately upon getting out of bed and I don't shower in the morning. I don't want my body to lose heat first thing. Most of my habits have to do with physical health. I used to be too little too late, now I'm too much too late. I'd like to be enough at the right time. I have to create order in my physical environment to have mental clarity. I have memorized texts from Taoism; reciting them slowly and visualizing the characters brings order to my thoughts, and makes me able to see clearly what I'm avoiding or falling behind on. Having a beer actually is really nice. Eating together as an extended family is important in ways I'm not incredibly conscious of. Bathing at night is something I learned from China. It's a way of preparing for sleep. You're really restful already and it makes a big difference in health and quality of life. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September- December 2015 Page 6 \"I get upside down by practicing yoga inversions at the end of the day.\" \"Reading is an everyday all-important thing in my life.\" -J onathan Tyman\"I connect with nature even just by sticking my head out the door to the backyard.\" -Beth Barbeau\"It's nice to start each day by going outside for a short walk on my street.\"\"I shuffle papers and basically have a clean desk and ready myself for the day and get excited to see patients. I've kind of grown up with these people.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 7 Frank Levey Frank is a carpenter, breathwork facilitator, and meditation teacher. He is also co-director of Blue Turtle Nature Camp in Ann Arbor, where he teaches nature awareness and wilderness living skills to children. My primary practices now are connected breath \u2014 lying down, I inhale and exhale, and say, \"I am here, now in this,\" in conjunction with my breath. I keep the breath connected, remembering that this is what we've got, right here, right now. It brings focus and I try to do it with a smile on my face, for about five minutes. Throughout the day I practice mudita, following four concepts: love, kindness, compassion, and joy for the wellbeing of others. I often practice while driving, just wishing people well. At night I do something called ho'oponopono, a practice that directs four phrases towards yourself and others. The phrases are: I love you, I'm sorry, please forgive me, thank you. Those four things work together in a magical way. Jonathan Tyman Jonathan has been teaching aerobic and Ashtanga yoga since 1993, and he has been one of Inward Bound Yoga's teachers since its founding in 1995. He has a Ph.D. in American Culture, and has been teaching and writing about, and making, films and videos since 1982. I get out of bed, drink water, do yoga for twenty minutes \u2014 I have a routine that I do. Then I meditate for about 20-40 minutes after yoga. Then I have coffee. Then I write one page. Those are my first words. I try to keep words at bay until then, and I see what words pop out and write them down. That's 20-40 minutes. Then I have breakfast. Then it's 8 a.m., and if I have time, if I don't have to do something, be somewhere, then I read. Reading is an everyday all-important thing in my life. I do another yoga practice sometime during the day. I have to tend my body. I have to make sure it functions. Otherwise it gets out of hand and doesn't function well. It really is helpful and important for me to do that. Instead of just once a day, I kind of divide my practice into three sections. I do an Ashtanga routine or just some backbends and hip openers. That can take 20-75 minutes. I close screens by 10 p.m. and go to bed. I do my other short yoga practice, twists and forward bends, and then climb into bed. Dr. Edward (Lev) Linkner Lev is board certified in both Internal Medicine and Holistic Medicine and has been practicing in Ann Arbor for 38 years. He is in solo practice and co-founder of the Parkway Center, as well as a clinical assistant professor at the U-M Medical School and a founding member of the American Board of Integrative Holistic Medicine. I have the best mornings of anyone I know. I do not use an alarm clock. I wake up and I do my gratitudes for my friends, family, and so on. I then start my meditation. I'm greeted by my cat, Chewy. I then let my dog out and get coffee on my way to the gym at 5:45, then I go into work at 8:15. I shuffle papers and basically have a clean desk and ready myself for the day and get excited to see patients. I've kind of grown up with these people. I've been able to create an environment of love. People attract what they desire, and I want to be clear headed and having fun. I live in the now. I eat lunch and do paperwork and take my dog, Maizey, on a walk. She goes everywhere with me, so wonderful having a dog here. It's good to be in nature. I have lots of stress reducers \u2014 hanging out and having fun, laughing, being around people you attract. I live by the four agreements: be impeccable with your word; don't take it personally; don't make assumptions; and always do your best. I tidy up \u2014 I live in a hundred-year-old home. We always try to eat as a family and play with the grandkids. I go for a walk, relax, and spend down time with my family, and always read in bed. Linda Diane Feldt Linda Diane is a holistic health practitioner, herbalist, teacher, and published author. She has provided an integrated approach to holistic health care since 1980. She also served for a number of years as the President of the Board of the Ann Arbor People's Food Co-op. Primarily my dog and her immediate needs get me up, which are to go outside. I get to wake up and go outside within five minutes of waking up, which is actually pretty nice. So that's pretty much the start. It isn't too long before I have to take an hour to do Internet and emails, that kind of thing. It's nice to start each day by going outside for a short walk on my street. Picking up dog poop in the morning is a very grounding exercise. I work from home, so overall that's extremely helpful. Before and after each client I wash my hands, which is actually a very profound ritual. Coming in clean with no preconceptions for each client, and reestablishing my space and their space, and disconnecting from what's often an intense experience for somebody. More recently I have been trying to write down five things I'm grateful for that day. It's lovely. It's very nice to consider those things. I haven't gone back and reread any of them yet, but even if I'm someplace I don't have my notebook, it's nice to think about it. I usually go to bed thinking I didn't do enough, and I'm realizing that's more anxiety than reality. I'm trying to switch off that voice in my head. Lifelong I've been a reader and I read myself to sleep with a light that turns itself out automatically. \"Throughout the day I practice mudita, following four concepts: love, kindness, compassion, and joy for the wellbeing of others.\" -Frank Levey \"What is my intention for today? I create the way I want to approach the day.\" -Laur a Shope Continued on page 8Jocelyn Granger Jocelyn is the founder and owner of the Ann Arbor Institute of Massage Therapy, which has trained hundreds of massage therapists in the region and state through its diploma program. The first thing I do is go outside and give my birds new bath water and feed my deer and feed my pets. Then I get myself ready. I have to have my coffee with chocolate protein powder. I don't even use an alarm clock. I wake up at 5:30 or 6:00 usually. I usually have a dance class that I take \u2014 there's my composure and stress reliever right there. Right now my best friend and I are creating our own dance classes. I don't! I often have to come into my office and sit down and compose myself. Typically I try to stay in a good mood and laugh. Nothing is that bad that after a few minutes I can't stop exploding and laugh about it. I like to go out in the garden and water my vegetables. I play in the garden and I like to come in and make myself a salad for dinner. I like to sit around and watch TV, then read and that's it. I do get everything ready for the morning. Everything I have to take with me is ready. \"Typically I try to stay in a good mood and laugh.\"Cam V ozar Cam is a psychotherapist and consultant with over thirty years of experience. He also teaches tai chi at the Cancer Support Community, and is a well-regarded poet. I start my day waking up to Handel's Water Music . I spend a moment in gratitude. I take morning showers to wake up, and I do a series of yoga stretches, chi gong exercises, tai chi, and meditation. My chi gong exercises vary with the seasons and my physical condition to balance my energy. I take pleasure in my daily routines and look forward to doing them each day. This can be as long as 90 minutes or as short as 15 minutes depending on the time available. I began this practice over thirty years ago when I injured my back. It has become more spiritual over time. It is a gift that the original pain from the injury has given me. Currently I am pain free ninety percent of the time. In my psychotherapy practice, I am very disciplined about writing a summary note after each session. This helps close the energy from the previous session and prepare for the next session. For lunch I spend ten minutes walking outside or in meditation to rejuvenate my energy. At the end of the work day, I like to exercise by swimming or taking a walk. This releases any physical tension stored in the body. After dinner I talk with a friend. I watch about a half hour of light TV or read. Before going to bed, I give a moment of gratitude for the events of the day and release them. The key to these rituals is flexibility with time and persistence. I also link activities together so they create a pattern for my day. Dr. Dennis Chernin Dennis is a leading holistic doctor and homeopathic physician, and is the author of several books on meditation and holistic medicine as well as homeopathy. He is also the co-founder and lead singer/leader of Ann Arbor Kirtan. Well, I meditate in the morning. I do alternate nostril breathing. I do that before meditation and then I try to do some stretches and sometimes some yoga. I eat a hearty breakfast, millet rice cereal with blueberries, and then I eat two almonds and a banana.\"I began this [chi gong] practice over thirty years ago when I injured my back...

During that time I either listen to NPR to catch up on the news or I practice my chanting. I lead a Kirtan group. Sometimes, it's different chants I'm learning or interested in including in my group. That helps me in those days. During the day, I try to care for patients and help them as holistically as possible and that gives me a lot of joy. When they're suffering, I show compassion, caring, and love so that they can get better and be the best they can in life. That gives me a lot of joy and comfort in my own life and balance. I also am fortunate that my lifestyle and work often come together as one. I usually have dinner. I'm vegetarian. My partner and I eat often very hearty meals, and often times we take a walk in the evening through wooded areas, we enjoy that. We may read together, catch up on the news, or watch baseball. Then before bed I will try to lift weights and meditate again, and try to do some yoga a couple times a week. I also do tai chi and I go through a form in the evening. I take a shower every night and that's that. Laura Shope Laura is the founder and creative director at Bluefire Institute and guides people to \"live life on fire.\" One thing I make sure to do for myself everyday \u2014 it often happens at different times \u2014 is what I call a check in. Some might call it a prayer; it's a connection, something I say out loud to connect to a larger spirit and connect myself to the present. I go through a series of five questions. I ask, what's different? That could be from last check in or in that moment. Then I ask, what works and what didn't work? In my own performance and what's going on. Then I say my state of mind, my state of body, and state of spirit, and acknowledge each one. \"Mind\" being whatever is in my head, \"body\" is what's going on physically, and \"spirit\" is universal. I describe it and acknowledge it. I then ask, what am I grateful for? What is my intention for today? I create the way I want to approach the day. I also do a daily plan at the beginning and end of each day. I do make lists and work off of that. I work off of my calendar, so I schedule and can be present for what it is that I'm doing at that moment. If I've done the planning, then I can be present. It varies. Right now I'm home with kids for the summer. Being present, taking a moment, a deep breath, and making sure I've taken care of myself in terms of food needs. I focus on what's happening right here, right now. The other thing I do routinely is move a lot, whether it's a fitness activity or just walking. That's an important way for me to function. \"T o wind down well, I can do no better than to tell a bedtime story to my 7-year-old daughter, Grace. I usually fall asleep on top of her quilt sooner than she does.\" Individual Consultations Provides personalized support for: Life's Challenges Grief Self-Care Your Journey Carol Bennington, PhD Bach Foundation Registered Practitioner Bach International Education Program Instructor Awakening-Hearts.com or call 734-726-4303Advanced Workshop: Bach Flower Remedies Oct. 24-25, 2015 Ann Arbor Level 2 - 12.5 CEDiscover the healing essences of nature Well, I do like to look at what I completed for the day, and what my priorities are for tomorrow. I may have specific plans for the next day. I like to review my day and plan the next. I try to complete that before activities with family start to happen. I sometimes will do the gratitude question again. I like to go for a walk at the end of the day and let my mind relax or do other activities that let my mind relax. I go to bed pretty early and get a good night's sleep, that's an important part of my regimen. Bill Zirinsky Bill is the Editor/Publisher of The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal . He and his wife, Ruth Schekter, are the long-time owners of Crazy Wisdom Bookstore and Tea Room. During the summer, I roll out of bed and swim every morning, before I do anything else at all. The rest of the year I swim first thing four to five days a week. Swimming helps me to wake up in the most delightful way, energizing me, organizing my whole being, bending me. I eat gluten-free cereal, kefir, and fruit for breakfast most days. I wake up grateful and happy to have two lively young daughters in my life. I have been reading The New York Times every morning since I was a school boy, and the articles wake up my mind to that day's world, and help me to ready myself for the day. The main thing I bring to the table during the course of my days is that I genuinely relish and treasure the life I'm living. Perhaps it's because of family losses I've experienced. But whatever the cause, I find that my daily sense of composure comes from just appreciating what is right in front of me, and constantly noticing how precious that would seem were I facing illness or death. I have been trying to meditate sometime each day, and often it's a walking meditation. I fail to do meditation as much as I'd like, and that shows up often enough. I do make a conscious effort to pay attention to each interaction I have, and have that interaction be a good one. I fail at this, as well, often enough, but keep at it. One thing I'm learning to do more is to yield, especially to my strong-willed 12-year-old daughter, Leela. That's my spiritual practice this year. I also eat a fair amount of dark chocolate to compose myself, but I'm kidding myself on that one. I am not good at winding down, generally. As a night owl, my mind is often too busy in the evenings. A walk helps, as does a light snack. To wind down well, I can do no better than to tell a bedtime story to my 7-year-old daughter, Grace. I usually fall asleep on top of her quilt sooner than she does. Thank you to all our participants.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 9Re-Thinking Sukkot on the Anniversary of My Father's DeathThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September- December 2015 Page 10 Five girls wait for their egg sandwiches and I'm calling their names. A baby throws up and her mother is bewildered. She can't connect child, vomit, napkins, high-chair, table, and floor. Can you help me? Of course. Of course. I dip a rag into the sani-bucket and swipe the surface chlorine clean. The girls finish their food and rise. They drag their full bodies into the peopled streets. The table they leave behind is a mountain of trash: soiled napkins, bits of sandwich meat, foamy drinking cups. I think of a phrase my mother would say as I clean up their mess: . She would mean the undignified gesture of wayward refuse, the lack of tip, even the choice of food. Literally she would mean \"purely American behavior.\" I repeat her phrase in my mind as I separate landfill from recycling. This repetition comforts me. For a few seconds, I am not a woman in servitude to a world that eats my money before I'm sure I've ever held it. I am an alien stacking used plastic baskets, separating what can and can't be saved. An outsider; I'm just trying to earn enough to get home. As I'm writing this, it is Sukkot. Sukkot is one of my favorite Jewish holidays, although I cannot say I know enough about it. Much like my knowledge of the stars, I tend to take what I want from religion and leave the rest. Here is what I have come to understand: during Sukkot, Jewish families build a temporary shelter (an open structure called a Sukkah) in memory of the shelters once used to survive \"wandering\" for forty years. A Sukkah is like the Christmas tree of fall harvest, decorated in lights, vines, and gourds. Each shelter is individual and the decorating of it is a ritual in and of itself. Sukkot lasts seven days and during those seven days one is encouraged to take all meals under the stars; those devout enough will opt to sleep outside as well. Sukkot does not, however, require a devout spirit. In fact, ritually, Sukkot scripture asks that you bind four different branches or \"species\" together to use as a kind of wand. This branch wand signifies four types of Jews, from the most devout and learned to the \"I'm in it for the Kugel\" Jew... ish. Sukkot maintains that all types of Jews are important in holding space for this ritual of memory, of survival. The last day of Sukkot falls on October 15 th, which is also the anniversary of my father's last day alive. It is fitting, then, that I have spent the past week thinking about the temporary structure of my life. No, I haven't built a three-walled vine-woven shelter so that I may sleep beneath the solar eclipse and darkening October sky. Instead, I've taken on this job. This job that asks me to forgive people their rudeness, to serve them with no expectation of reward. Each day I clock in, work toward exhaustion, and clock out. My only drive is knowing one day I will have enough money to return home so that I may be in the same city as my father's grave. On October 14 th, my mother calls me. She talks at me for what feels like hours. Her topics shift rapidly. She recounts a movie she watched alone the night before in exacting detail. When my response is negligible, she starts talking about perogies. How the ones with potato are always more likely to come apart during boiling, everyone knows that and when will I give her a grandchild anyway? She is trying to take up space because like me she is haunted by silence, by the impending anniversary, and unlike me she does not know how to lock her feelings away inside herself. Instead, she begins to reminisce about her own mother taking my brother to the synagogue when he was a boy. \"Back then there were no kippas,\" she sighs, \"not for us. My mother tied four knots in a black napkin to make a circle and he wore it proudly. It was sweet. Oh. What is life anyway? Nothing.\" My mother barely thinks about Sukkot. As a child growing up in the post WWII Soviet Union, many Jewish rituals were denied her. Her knowledge of such things is selective, like mine. She knows to light a candle on Yom Kippur, to fast and pray for forgiveness; that Rosh Hashanah is the New Year, the honeyed light we dip our hopeful apples in. She knows that it's Sukkot because balconies all down Ocean Parkway are covered with wicker walls and because Hassidic men start to harass her on the street waving bundles of branches in her face yelling \"Jewish? Yes? Jewish?\" Once, m y father lay in Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, recovering from yet another heart surgery. A young Hassidic man busted into his room and asked impatiently: \"You Jewish?\" My father repeated the word Jewish , hesitant with his English, yet proud: I Jewish. In response, the strange man grabbed his right arm. He began to wind the arm with the black straps of the Tefillin, a box filled with scrolls used in prayer. My father didn't know how to say, \"Wait, I can't raise this arm, I'm post surgery\" or \"Why are you here?\" Instead, he allowed the intrusion. The man wound the box tight, without tenderness, and instructed my father to repeat after him. When my father's Hebrew pronunciation faltered, he was corrected not kindly. Any interjection I made was ignored. This was a physical contract made between one sick man and one religious man doing mitzvah. The protective urgency of the daughter hardly mattered in such a circumstance. It's awful, I'm sure, that the memories I have of my father are always tinged with weakness: his and mine. I wish it were otherwise. I wish I could tell you, in detail, about the man he must have been before rheumatic fever ravaged the valves of his heart. How he moved amongst the writers and artists of Moscow's underground, his insatiable Cancerian adoration of women, his wild vodka soaked nights. Those details are buried with him. Instead, here is a story I hold: Once, my brother was stationed with the Russian Army in Germany. The troops were very hungry; there was a lack of supplies. My father obtained a crate of bananas, which were rare in Russia \u2014 a delicacy in the days of the Iron Curtain. He took the rail to Germany and surprised the boys. There is no record of how he accomplished such a thing but I know it is true by the way my brother's face lights up when he retells the story. In some ways this act of nurture was a woman's gesture, not because women are predisposed to nurturing but because we are expected to be. We are also expected to speak well of the dead, but back when my father was alive, my mother would often lament the ways she never felt like she had a husband: how she was expected to earn all the income, how he wasn't strong enough to make her feel protected. Mine was not the type of family to acknowledge sacrifice. Sacrifice was something we did habitually, like eating dinner, or washing underwear in the sink. In his last years, my father couldn't be trusted to shower with the door locked or go outside to buy fruit. Scared of metal and anti-theft detectors (their effect on his defibrillator), my father would wait for me outside stores with heavy plastic bags \" \" \"purely American behavior.\"By Gala Mukomolova For a few seconds, I am not a woman in servitude to a world that eats my money before I'm sure I've ever held it.Sukkot lasts seven days and during those seven days one is encouraged to take all meals under the stars; those devout enough will opt to sleep outside as well.

Because he spent his days raising me, he managed to avoid learning English and at the end of his life knew only a handful of words: Jewish, daughter . Once, I had a physics tutor whose name was Boris, like my father's. He moved through our building on one leg and would pinch my face when I asked stupid questions. Up until he passed, Boris2 and my father spent a lot of time sitting on a bench outside our building. Afterward, my father sat alone. So begins the fourth year of my life without him and I, too, am alone, shaking the four species (or branches) in spite of my scant Jewish upbringing. Perhaps four is a magic number here. In Hebrew, four is Dalet, which is a branch on the tree of life. Dalet also translates to door, as in the door one must go through to understand God. What troubles me here is that a Sukkah has no doors. It is open to God always, a dwelling that is at once divine and ordinary \u2014 natural. Or perhaps I've had too much wine and there is nothing special about this year, no door I can ever walk through, no God that can offer me a house where grief and hope live together. What is life? October 15 th passes as it always does, a day hushed with relentless rain, my inability to leave bed except to eat and relieve myself. Nothing. At work, there are certain kinds of elderly men who inspire a lump in my throat. They tend to sit by themselves, order tea and cookies, take their time. They have elegant hands and soft grey hair. It is an effort, for me, to bring them their order without crying \u2014 especially this week. I think my father could have been one of these men, could have lived another ten years, could have brought one of those mystery novels he loved so much to a caf\u00e9 and enjoyed time alone with his small pleasures, but that was a life never meant for him. I hope there's a universe that exists other than this one and he is happy there. But what if it is otherwise? What if he is wandering lost without me like I am without him? Then I have made my heart into a kind of sukkah, a shaky dwelling place for his memory, divine and open to the elements. I have to believe that that is good enough.

Local energy healer and botanist Bronwen Gates has been developing \"Sanctuary Sophia,\" her Ann Arbor home and garden, as a sacred space for the past nine years, and is now making it available for personalized healing retreats and residential apprenticeships. She described Sanctuary Sophia as an \"urban wilderness\" and \"a place where all beings are respected.\" It is named for the goddess of wisdom, and also for a lost cat who wandered across Gates' path and now lives with her. Literally, it is a sanctuary for Sophia (the cat), who provides part of the healing energy that exists there. Gates said that guests of Sanctuary Sophia \"will have access to the diversity of resources available, choosing from my palette of healing gifts, and can make use of my extensive library of books and crystals and essences. They can enjoy delicious food to nurture body and soul, sit with the energy of the Sanctuary, or adventure beyond to access additional insight.\" Another new offering from Gates is her new \"Magical Mystery Tours.\" Originally from the Lake District of Northern England, she will be guiding spiritual retreats to that mystical landscape in late September 2015 and again in the spring and summer of 2016. \"These journeys let us be touched by the magic of the land and become more open to the magic of who we are,\" she said. Participants will explore ancient sacred sites, stone circles, and the ancient, natural volcanic landscape of the area. \"It's about going to a sacred and beautiful place and also learning about yourself in relation to the experience,\" Gates said. There will be planned trips, but also plenty of time for people to walk and meditate.

She has treated many clients with chronic pain , especially those who have tried more traditional approaches with little or no success. She said that as a holistic practitioner she is able to work not just with the symptoms of pain but also the mental and emotional aspects and causes. She works with children as well as adults \u2014 among her success stories is a young girl with autism who, when she began treatment, was non -verbal and unable to attend school because of severe sensory integration problems . The child is now in school, learning to tolerate a variety of sensations, and beginning to develop a vocabulary. \"Our experience is that the body knows precisely what is needed for healing , and our job is to assist in uncovering that inner knowing and strength,\" said Amy . She explained that newly occurring symptoms can usually be resolved faster. Issues that have been present for many years often take several sessions and require deeper healing work. P eople interested in working with Amy or Markus can call for a consultation, during which they can discuss treatment options for their specific issues , whether their insurance is accepted, and how to go about getting a doctor 's referral.

In November 2015 , local musicians Kathy Moore and Anne Crawford will launch The Moore The Better, a musical event service offering personalized \"performance and music engagement experiences .\" The duo will design and perform at events to \"celebrate, honor , remember , and help transform through some of life's changes\" \u2014 birthdays, graduation, moving away , retirement, promotion, memorials, awards, cancer- free milestones, and anything else people would like to create a musical experience around . Their first event was a milestone birthday , and consisted of a gathering of friends and family who not only listened to Moore and Crawford perform but also participated by singing , storytelling , and even coming up with lyrics together . \"It was a huge success,\" said Moore, \"laughter and tears and stories and everyone singing .\" Multiple generations were present, and all participated in the experience together . \"We're born to sing ,\" said Moore, and she loves to encourage people to sing in e verything she does. Many people have so much anxiety around singing , she explained, when it can be such a powerful experience, especially in groups. In offering these events, Moore said , she is \"seeking to open up people's ideas about what events are worthy of this kind of attention in their lives.\" She and Crawford hope to be involved in life events and celebrations they haven't even thought of yet . During these events, they facilitate an experience that everyone present can get involved in . Moore is a music therapist, voice teacher, vocalist, and songwriter. Crawford is a pianist, violinist, and composer. Moore explained that events can include just the two of them or more instrumentalists, depending on what is desired. If people want to dance, for example, they might decide to include bass and percussion in the ensemble. Moore is currently on a three -month trip exploring national parks, and will return in November, when she and Crawford will be available to begin offering events.

Mary Light, traditional naturopath and consultant herbalist, is returning to private practice after several years of \" sabbatical ,\" during which she founded the Naturopathic School of the Healing Arts. Prior to her sabbatical, Light had been in private practice since 1994, when she lived and worked on the East Coast. Having grown up and lived in Michigan until the age of 17, Light returned to the area in 2003, began her herbal studies in 2005, and started the Naturopathic School in 2009. Light will continue to teach at the school, but she will step back from some of her administrative work there as others year-old Viking stone walls that are still in use to contain the area's numerous sheep, \"contorted, gnarled oaks,\" and a misty, moist landscape where it is easy to feel the energy of the rocks and plants. In both Sanctuary Sophia and on her trips to England, Gates helps people \"open communication with the land.\" She explained that nature speaks to us in a different language, and most of us are not used to listening to it. Our usual way of \"communicating\" with nature is through our domination of it. But, \"our bodies and homes are made of nature,\" and \"there is wisdom in nature and in ourselves if we know how to access it,\" she said. Bronwen Gates' website is www.bronwengates.com.

Beginning April 1, 2015, the People's Food Co-op was the first Ann Arbor business to start accepting \"rCredits,\" a community currency system designed specifically to benefit the local economy. The rCredits system was started in Greenfield, Massachusetts, in 2013, and was designed to be replicated autonomously in other communities. Ann Arbor was the second community nationwide to implement this system, when Washtenaw County rCredits was launched in April 2015 under the leadership of Adam Konner and Jim Bates. The Food Co-op was the first business to start accepting rCredits, and since then, a number of other businesses have followed suit \u2014 Fuzzy Lines Design, Bates Electric, Inc., Silvio's, Sassafrass Tech Collective, The Hive Co-op, Liberty Pediatrics, and Hut-K Nutrilicious. When someone signs up for rCredits, he or she receives an \"rCard,\" which can be used at any local participating business. U.S. dollars are put into the rCredits account and spent with the card. Participants then receive incentive rewards \u2014 electronic community credits issued whenever someone buys or sells something through the rCredits system. When people sign up, they get $20 worth of rCredits, plus a 10 percent reward on whatever they buy or sell. Participants can cash out rCredits they have received as payment for goods or services, but they cannot cash out their incentive rewards (as these must continue to circulate in the community). Once a month, people also get an inflation adjustment, so the funds in their rCredits account don't lose value. The long term goal, explained Konner, is to be able to fund local businesses, projects, and organizations through a process that rCredits users democratically decide upon. Konner said that most money in the current economic system is created by banks, through lending. He explained that this means most money created is based on debt and on what will make the banks a profit (not what will be helpful to communities, the nation, and the world). He also said that right now, more money is owed to banks than actually exists, which creates an unsustainable environment for growth and leads to circumstances in which there will always be someone who defaults (sometimes through no fault of their own). rCredits is an attempt to put the power of money creation into the hands of local democratic systems. \"Money, in a way, is a signal of what has value,\" said Konner. \"Currently, private banks are deciding what has value based on what is going to make them a profit.\" rCredits have value because local businesses decide to accept them, and once the local system is stable, a democratic process will be set up in which the community will be able to decide how incentive rewards are spent. This could include lending for local businesses; funding for nonprofits, schools, regional energy production, and/or food storage \u2014 any number of community projects based on what members decide. The democratic system will be set up so that participants can vote on any issue brought to the group (detailed rules and agreements are documented on the rCredits website).

Many cultures celebrate some rite of passage for this important milestone, but it is uncommon in Western culture, and, as Rubio-Turtle explained, many young women grow up with a negative view of menstruation that is reinforced by our culture. \"This goes on to have repercussions for self-esteem, relationships, body image, choices around sex, and on into experiences of pregnancy and birth. It's a big issue, and in my experience, there are hardly any women who don't carry some legacy of shame, guilt, or unease where their bodies and bleeding are concerned,\" she said. A 30-year study in Australia has shown that preparing young girls for menarche has a positive effect on how they feel about menstruation and their bodies. Jane Bennett, an Australian educator in women's cycles and fertility, developed a workshop called \"A Celebration Day for Girls,\" which she has trained women like Rubio-Turtle to facilitate. The day-long workshop (for girls ages 10 to 12) teaches girls about their bodies and the changes that come around menarche. Before the Celebration Day, Rubio-Turtle hosts a shorter session for the girls' mothers or female caregivers. This session is to support the mothers/caregivers in \"becoming 'okay' to talk about, and in some cases, reframe [their] own experiences so [they] can present [their] own menarche stories from a positive, healed perspective....\" Rubio-Turtle said that the Celebration Day for Girls uses a mix of gentle storytelling, anatomical education, and practical discussion of what's involved in periods. \"Young girls receive a broad education in what it means to be a biologically functioning woman that goes beyond mere biology.... It presents entry to womanhood as part of the natural order of things. As something to look forward to and feel positive about, and more miraculous than that, it presents it as a privilege that we get to experience, and use to deepen our understanding of ourselves, and our lives.\" Rubio-Turtle's own young daughter has been through the experience. \"On the way home, she expressed her excitement about growing up, and how much she was looking forward to finding out more about herself in this way. I felt pleased, and also strangely removed from the experience \u2014 already, she has stories and feelings around menarche and the menstrual cycle that I can't identify with. Positive ones. Her experience is utterly different than mine \u2014 and that is a very good thing. To have your 11-year-old girl express positivity about her body is a beautiful thing to witness....\" The fall 2015 dates for the Celebration Day for Girls are August 22, September 25, and December 5 (with mothers' sessions scheduled the day before each workshop). Rubio-Turtle keeps the groups small \"for intimacy and trust,\" so interested mothers or caregivers should contact her early to reserve their spots. Rubio-Turtle will also host facilitator DeAnna L'am, an internationally known pioneer in \"menstrual empowerment,\" in a \"Red Tent Activation\" event for adult women who want to experience a positive initiation that they did not experience at their menarche.

Whalen stressed that the Women's Center and RTT are committed to inclusiveness. The physical space is set up in an open configuration. Clients and therapists interact in an open waiting room and shared kitchen. The space is welcoming and helps to \"break down the hierarchy placing the therapist above the client,\" explained co- director Marnie Leavitt. The open space, she explained, encourages interaction and reduces shame and stigma around therapy by normalizing it. The offices in which therapy take place are private. Parking is easy , adding to the Center 's inclusiveness, and the restrooms are handicap accessible. RTT also accepts Medicare, which many older people rely on . Maissa Osman, a communication coach who works for RTT, speaks French and Arabic, and one of the student interns speaks Spanish, so non -native English speakers have options. Whalen is the only Deaf fully licensed psychologist in Michigan, offering therapy and assessment services in ASL (as well as for hearing patients). She also has experience and a specialty working with LGBTQ clients. When asked about RTT 's \"holistic therapy \" approach, Leavitt said that holistic therapists acknowledge that the mind and body are connected, and recognize the importance of nutrition, rest , and exercise in mental health . From a social work perspective, she said , the person and his or her environment are interconnected. Sometimes, she said, mental health problems can be \" a reasonable response to unreasonable circumstances.\" With the dual Women's Center and Room to Talk programs, Leavitt said , people in need of services have options whether or not they have insurance. Also , about 5 percent of the Center 's clients are men, she said , adding \"we 're not anti -men, just pro -woman!\" The Center does offer couples counseling in their non -insurance program. The Women's Center is located at 510 S. Maple Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103 . The Center's phone number is (734) 973-6779, and the email address is info@womenscentersemi.org.

The series is named \"Science by the Cup,\" similar to the groups' original series, \"Science by the Pint,\" which took place at Arbor Brewing Company. Each event will host three to four speakers on a variety of science topics. Elyse Aurbach, one of the student founders of the group, explained that she and co-founder Katie Prater wanted training for themselves and their colleagues in communicating about their scientific specialties to the public. RELATE offers graduate students and researchers a 10-week intensive workshop with instruction and feedback from communication experts on making science topics engaging and accessible to laypeople. To complete their training, the researchers put their new skills to use by participating in community engagement events. The series will include a full range of topics in science, technology, engineering, and math. It is a chance for attendees to learn about cutting edge research happening at U-M and to talk in person with scientists who can answer their questions. The group promises \"no boring lectures.\" Each speaker will take questions from the audience after their talk. Refreshments can be purchased from the Tea Room. The full schedule of speakers and topics will be available on RELATE's website, www.learntorelate.org, in early fall. Organizers Elyse Aurbach and Katie Prater and outreach coordinator, Brooke Horton, can be reached by email at RELATE.Outreach@ umich.edu. Local acupuncturist Ellen Porter was recently accepted as a non-VA Acupuncture Community Provider with the Ann Arbor Veterans Administration and now accepts VA insurance. Porter is a nationally board certified Five Element Acupuncturist. Five Element Acupuncture is an approach to healing of body, mind, emotion, and spirit, which, Porter explained, is very effective for treating those with trauma. She said that it deals not just with physical pain but with the mental and emotional aspects of healing, and with root causes of symptoms. She has been practicing this style of acupuncture for over nine years, serving patients with stress, physical pain, PTSD, emotional suffering, and women's and men's health issues. Porter has treated many veterans and wanted to offer this method of healing to those who have served our country and rely on VA insurance.

She also is very knowledgeable about nutrition and teaches how to use food as medicine. New clients experience a three-part first session consisting of a half hour of conversation about health history and background, a half hour of physical examination, and a half hour first treatment. Some clients start to feel relief immediately, while others will take more than one session to start feeling better. Usually, Porter said, the more recent the problem, the faster it heals. Veterans using VA insurance who want to work with Porter will need approval from their doctor, and she can help explain this process.

She has been practicing yoga for 15 years and teaching for 7, and she has been practicing Reiki for almost 20 years. Originally from India, Adsule came to Michigan in 2005 to conduct cancer research as a postdoctoral fellow in biochemistry, first at Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit and later at U-M. In 2011, she returned to India, where she decided on a career change. Yoga had helped her to overcome chronic pain and swelling due to polymyalgia rheumatica, an autoimmune disease she suffered from. Desiring to help others learn yoga and resolve their own health problems, she received training as a yoga teacher at ParamYoga in Pune, and opened her own studio, Tejasvini Center for Yoga & Reiki, which she ran for two years. In 2013, Adsule's family decided to immigrate to the United States. She pursued training and became a certified yoga therapist at YogaMedics in Farmington Hills. She also became a licensed Reiki Master through the International Center for Reiki Training. For now, Adsule works as a yoga therapist at YogaMedics, the VA Hospital in Canton, and Prism Pain Clinic (also in Canton). She teaches yoga at West End Yoga Studio on the weekends, and offers Reiki classes and healing sessions in individual's homes located in a 30 mile-radius of Canton (including the Ann Arbor area). She is passionate about helping clients of all ages, from children to seniors, and is currently completing Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT) training for working with children and young teens. She helps her clients to \"develop stamina, and strengthen the body-mind and overall well-being.\" Because of her background in cancer research, she has a special interest in developing yoga sessions for cancer patients, survivors, and caregivers. At some point Adsule hopes to open her own yoga and Reiki studio similar to the one she operated in India. Shreelekha Adsule can be reached at (734) 904-2917 or at tejasvinireikicenter@gmail.com. Her website is www .tejasvinireikicenter.com . Kimberly Harrison, singer and holistic voice coach, moved with her life partner, Marvin Rieli, from L.A. to Michigan last year. The pair, both musicians, ran a busy voice studio in L.A., but having grown tired of the traffic, lines, and busyness of the city, they decided to relocate to Michigan, where they wanted to \"live a more nature-based life,\" Harrison said. Now, Harrison is performing and building her voice coaching business: Singing For Your Soul. Explaining the holistic nature of her voice coaching, she said that there are Shreelekha Adsule is a certified yoga therapist and Reiki Master based in Canton.

The first is the traditional conservatory environment, which she described as regimented and perfectionistic; it works well for some people, and produces some wonderful singers, she said. The second Harrison described as people \"singing to find their voices,\" tapping into a \"primitive and primal\" part of themselves to help them get through emotional blocks and fears. This second type of environment is where she thrives and what she works to create for her students. \"Anyone can sing,\" Harrison said. \"Don't listen to anyone who says you can't because it's not true. We all have different voices and capabilities, but we all can be trained.\" Voice training, she explained, can have many benefits beyond becoming a better singer or speaker \u2014 as in a yoga practice, people learn to breathe more deeply, and they can use voice training as a mindfulness practice as they focus on being in their bodies. She said it can help calm anxiety, lower depression, increase positive hormones such as oxytocin, improve self-confidence, heal trauma, create personal growth, and help people express themselves more dynamically and listen to themselves and others more deeply. \"To use our voices to the fullest is very sacred work,\" she said. Harrison offers a free half-hour \"vocal strategy session\" to people interested in working with her. She meets with the person, finds out what they want to achieve with voice training, and gives them some tools to use right away. She works with people who want to \"do something\" with their music professionally, and also with those who want to sing for fun, enjoyment, and increased well-being. Harrison offers voice classes and private training online and in person at her home in Brooklyn, Michigan. She is considering looking for a space to begin offering in-person training in Ann Arbor as well. She works with yoga instructors and other professionals who rely on their voices for work, helping them to \"sound better, project healthily, and understand how to use sound and voice work to enhance their classes.\" She also performs live music for yoga classes and concerts, using voice, harp, drone, and frame drum.

West End Yoga in Canton, a Hatha yoga studio owned by Leah Slagenwhite, opened in November 2014. In June 2015, Allison Dailey partnered with Slagenwhite to add a \"holistic and mystic boutique\" to the studio. Dailey is the creator of Sapphire Soul, a nationally-known subscription box, which includes items like crystals, essential oils, sacred space items, self-care products, candles, and jewelry \u2014 all curated to support mindfulness, self-care, and \"soul-work.\" Describing the new boutique, Dailey said that every item complements what is done in the yoga studio. She teaches a chakra-balancing class on Saturdays, and is also a Desire Map Facilitator, and said that there is \"intention, purpose, and meaning\" in all of the work she does. Her passion, she said, is \"helping people find their gifts and tap into their magic.\" She stocks tumbled stones, reiki- and oil-infused candles, \"boho\" clothing like kimonos and scarves, beaded jewelry, essential oil sprays and blends, and gem elixirs. Slagenwhite's offer to partner and open the boutique came at a great time, explained Dailey. Her call came the same morning that Dailey had decided to quit her corporate job to focus on Sapphire Soul and her other \"soulistic\" teaching and coaching pursuits full time. West End Yoga offers a mix of yoga classes with titles like \"Awaken,\" \"Balance,\" \"Energize,\" and \"Calm,\" which are described as \"moving meditations.\" They also offer Baby and Me classes, and Buti Yoga \u2014 \"a soulful blend of power yoga, high-intensity tribal dance, and deep abdominal toning,\" which Dailey recently became certified to teach.

I started teaching small classes with me off the erg (\"the erg\" is a common term for indoor rowing machine). I had people rowing different pieces and I would walk around them with coffee and coach them ... until I got certified by Concept 2 as a master instructor and met my friend and lifelong rower Terry Smythe. She totally changed my perspective and I turned it into a spinning class, but with rowing machines. Q. What is some of your favorite music to row to? A. Oh boy, tough one. We have a Wired Wednesday social media campaign where I take requests (but I'll take them every day) and use them for a playlist. We have some very eclectic stuff, but if I had to pick ...

The company is focused on \"building a community of spiritually in-tune entrepreneurs.\" Founding the business, said Szelkowski, \"came on the heels of a nine-month awakening experience.\" He said he had a lot of dissonance and internal conflict with how he was running his business, relationships, and life. At the end of this intense awakening, he had a new awareness of what he feels he is supposed to be doing. A2Mastermind is about \"changing the status quo of how business is traditionally taught and practiced.\" His goal is for entrepreneurs to create \"an alignment and resonance between internal belief systems and what you're doing in everyday life.\" \"A business that is run based on core values, and not chasing money, will provide more satisfaction, will be easier to operate, and will attract better customers/clients into the business. It's the type of business that everyone involved feels good about, and inspires loyalty from customers and employees alike,\" Szelkowski explained. One problem spiritually aware business owners often have, he said, is a blockage around making money in a spiritually based business. Among other issues, he helps people to unlock this blockage and attract prosperity. He feels that Ann Arbor is a special city, and wants to be part of the \"unlocking\" he feels is already taking place here, and of building a spiritual business community. Szelkowksi runs the Ann Arbor Spiritual Entrepreneurs group every other week, with the purpose of providing an environment for like-minded entrepreneurs to network and learn \"sound business and personal development tactics\" that are rooted in values, intuition, and spirituality. He also runs the Ann Arbor Spiritual Meditation Meetup, which meets on alternating Mondays at the Crazy Wisdom community room. Austin Szelkowski's website for the CW Meetup is at www .a2mastermind.com /cw. The site also has information on upcoming meetups and events, and about working with him.

She offers individual consultations and ongoing mentoring for clients in the Bach Flower Remedies, and is one of a dozen U.S. instructors for the Bach International Education Program. Bennington's extensive background in flower essences includes studying at the Bach Centre in England, taking practitioner courses for several North American systems of flower essences, and her doctoral dissertation, which explored people who used flower essences and their connection to nature. For anyone wishing to explore the Bach flower remedies in-depth, or even become a practitioner themselves, the Bach International Education Program offers a three-tiered training program. Bennington will be offering Level 2: The Advanced Workshop on October 24 and 25, 2015, in Ann Arbor (for those who have already taken a Level 1 course).

Husband and wife team Jason and Kelly Hoey, both experienced personal trainers, have opened an indoor rowing fitness studio in west Ann Arbor: Terra Firma Indoor Rowing. Jason answered our questions: Q. Why have you chosen to focus on rowing? What benefits does it have?A. I chose rowing because I always found it to be a beautiful movement. Everything in the body is working in sync in a repetitive, fluid motion. It is a total body workout that improves strength demands necessary for power, stability, posture, and flexibility. Once people learn it, I have an awesome example to refer to for other exercise patterns. Oh, and it's fun! Q. What is a rowing class at Terra Firma like? A. We have five different types of classes: Learn to Row, Endurance 50 minutes, Total Body (rowing machines and bodyweight exercises), Total Body Strength (weight training), and Zenrow (mind-body connection emphasized). Each class begins with a warm-up and setting a goal or intention for the class. We usually spend 45 minutes on the workout, which is set to music but not usually choreographed. The end of class is usually a cool down with mobility work and breathing exercises, then shavasana. Q. Can you talk about your training philosophy? A. I believe exercise is like prescription medicine \u2014 the goal is to find the right amount to get the desired result and no more. Any more becomes a negative stress on the body. Most of my day is spent trying to figure out how much is too much and how to bring the concept of regulating the forces of exercise on people in a one-on-one or group setting. I'm not into debating what's good and what's bad in the fitness world. I'm a fan of all modalities that help people reach their goals and provide a platform to learn about themselves. Suffice it to say that everything has its place; it's up to the fitness professional to decide if and when to use it. Flower essences and nature-based approaches can offer a personalized approach to transform grief and other challenges of daily living. \u2014 Carol Bennington, Ph.D., and Bach Foundation Registered Practitioner Husband and wife team Jason and Kelly Hoey, both experienced personal trainers, have opened an indoor rowing studio in west Ann Arbor called Terra Firma Indoor Rowing.

The doors are a well-known phenomenon in the area and are thought to be the work of city-dwelling urban fairies. Local herbalist Linda Diane Feldt reported to CW Journal that the new door, called \"Faerie Well: A Healing Space,\" appeared in June. She also reported that children have already begun leaving small gifts for the fairies. Of course, no one knows for sure what goes on behind the fairy doors, but Feldt speculated that Ann Arbor's urban fairies probably have a harder time than fairies living in the woods, and are probably in need of healing from time to time. She said there is a patch of woods near the new door. As with most of the fairy doors, this one seems to be evolving over time. Feldt said she hopes the fairies will put up an awning for winter. Jonathan B. Wright, Ann Arbor's foremost expert on the local urban fairies and original discoverer of the doors, has set up a website with pictures of many of the fairy doors and information about the fairies at www.urban-fairies.com. Sue Whitmarsh and Marie Brooks opened Breathe Yoga, a new studio in downtown Chelsea, in July 2015. Whitmarsh graduated from the Center for Yoga in 2013 and has taught at many studios, gyms, and community locations. She teaches Yogi Beers at the Chelsea Alehouse on the third Saturday of each month \u2014 an event where participants can follow a one-hour yoga class with a pint of their choice, which, Whitmarsh explained, helps encourage socializing after yoga, when normally students would scatter immediately after class. \" Yogi Beers was the first of an idea that Breathe Yoga is expanding upon to bring yoga into more unusual settings, and perhaps to groups of people who might otherwise feel unsure about entering a yoga studio.\" Other programs the two are involved in include Yoga Out Yonder, which combines yoga and hiking, and Farm Fresh Yoga, which is outdoor yoga at a nearby farm. \"Sue and I are both big believers in community involvement, and we're thrilled to be partnering with local businesses and organizations to bring yoga to a wider audience, as well as introduce yogis to new locations and experiences they may not know of otherwise,\" Brooks said. Brooks has been practicing yoga for 15 years and is currently completing her yoga teacher training at Yoga Integrated Science in Louisville, Kentucky. Once her training is finished in October she will begin teaching at the studio; she also handles many of the business aspects. \"Marie and I both want the studio to be accessible to everyone, from beginners up, and we founded it on the belief embodied in Krishnamacharya's words: 'If you can breathe, you can do yoga,'\" said Whitmarsh. \"We want to create a safe, comfortable, and nurturing space where our students can come and practice, learn and grow, and be at ease to feel what they need to feel in their bodies, hearts, and minds.\" Breathe will offer a variety of yoga classes, including Vinyasa, Slowflow, Ashtanga, and Yin. It will also offer classes in meditation, Pranayama (yogic breathing), and eventually some more specialized classes, such as Chair Yoga, workshops in Ayurvedic principles, and classes for athletes, such as runners and cyclists.

Patti Gaves started Everyday Environments in June 2015, offering individual and family consultations and educational events to help people improve their surroundings for better health. Air quality, water quality, household and personal care chemical use, electromagnetic fields, light, humidity, and ambient noise are all factors Gaves analyzes in homes and workplaces. She loves to help families of children with autism and sensory needs, people with allergies, asthma, chemical and environmental sensitivities, and unresolved chronic fatigue or other symptoms by working with them to assess their everyday spaces and consider changes that may help. Gaves developed her programs for evaluating and optimizing everyday spaces after learning about and applying environmental psychology principles to help her son, who is environmentally sensitive and has allergies. She begins the evaluation process with a health questionnaire, examining what symptoms individuals or family members may be experiencing. Then, she visits the home, thoroughly examining all of the environmental factors. Finally, she meets with the family or individual to explain what she found, and recommends changes. She has some products available for sale: EMF-shielding items, countertop water filtering systems, air cleaners and purifiers, an HVAC filter, and some chemical-free personal care products. Other products she recommends, such as a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter, which she said she recommends to everyone. She sells and recommends only products she uses herself in her own home. She may also recommend other professionals for big projects, like mold removal, if necessary. Gaves is available for home environmental assessments within a 50-mile radius of Ann Arbor.

While chatting with Lisa Eidsvig (featured in Crysta Goes Visiting, issue #60) about alternative healing, I mentioned I was curious about Reiki. \"Oh!\" she said. \"You need to talk to Dixie Stewart!\" And so, a few weeks and a phone call later, I sat down with Dixie in the Crazy Wisdom Tea Room. Dixie is a local licensed massage therapist and energy healer with a bright and vibrant personality. She tailors her sessions to the needs of her clients, sometimes using a combination of techniques to facilitate the healing process, whether it is physical, emotional, or a combination of the two. She has studied Reiki, reflexology, Swedish and seated massage, craniosacral therapy, and more. She wants everyone to know that energy healing \"is not evil. [It] comes from God or the universe, whatever you want to call it.\" She went on to explain: \"At the beginning of my day, I pray for guidance that I do the right thing to heal people in the way they're comfortable with. I pray through Jesus.\" She uses her intuition to guide her hands to the area that needs to be addressed. \"Everything I do, I do through prayer.\" Sometimes the people who go to her don't feel ready for energy healing or are \"afraid they'll end up a basket case\" after an emotional release. \"Most people cry at my table. It's a good thing!\" she assured me. \"Energy is clearing the blocks that stop the flow [of the life force].\" As she works, she explains what she does to her clients. She wants to educate them, not just fix them. \"This is your healing process. You have to be a part of it.\"Dixie strongly believes in the chakra system. She gave me a demonstration of one of the ways she balances a person's chakras by placing one hand on my chest and the other on my back to balance my heart chakra, confiding, \"If you don't have much time and can only clear one chakra, always do the heart.\" She immediately picked up on a heaviness on the right side of my body, where I have had issues ever since I was in a car accident a few years ago.

Creating with the Heart and Lisa Jarrell Right now is a good time to be a local artist. A number of galleries, shops, and markets devoted to selling locally made wares are popping up all over Southeast Michigan. This is how I found the works of Lisa Jarrell, who sells through, among other locations, Catching Fireflies in Ann Arbor's Kerrytown (the store with the bubbles). What first caught my attention were her mixed media 6\"x 6\" painted tiles featuring a painted on object of nature \u2014 a bird or tree (or both) \u2014 and a quote written in a semi-cursive handwriting that she developed herself. \"They're all handwritten,\" she confirmed. The use of a twig across the top to crown the piece is a wonderful organic touch. I was also drawn to Lisa's Michigan-themed pendants and glass bottles with sand, pebbles, and other objects placed inside. Silly me, I didn't realize these disparate things were all made by the same artist until I visited Lisa's website, which says something about her artistic versatility. There is a running theme of nature in all that Lisa creates. The twigs, sticks, and stones that she pulls from nature she considers gifts and always gives thanks. \"The [Great] Lakes always provide many gifts!\" she said after showing me some driftwood she picked up from a Grand Haven beach. In order to make her pieces more lasting (organic materials break down over time), Lisa has been using a technique called encaustic, a blend of beeswax and resin that essentially seals the wood to make it last. Lisa wants her art to be loved, not \"falling apart on the wall.\" In addition to nature, Lisa's big inspiration is her heart. \"Art is created by the heart.\" She follows her heart in all of her creations. She believes that not everyone will get what she is doing, and that's okay. When the right person sees it, and it speaks to them, it's all the more special. \"I've had people start crying in my booth [at art festivals],\" she said. \"I bring tissues with me.\" Far from being put off, Lisa embraces their stories and welcomes their candor. Lately, Lisa has been developing what she calls \"soul gardens,\" little bottles of found objects that speak to an individual's heart. At the center of the bottle, what would begin the garden, is a small stone, such as rose quartz. \"I'm learning about the metaphysical properties of stones,\" she explained, in order to add another layer of meaning to the garden. The owner of the garden would then build from there. \"A pebble, or a tiny feather you found that you just really like.\" Lisa is an artist with beautiful ideas and a desire to give back to the world that clearly brings her joy, whether it's through connecting with strangers at an art show or donating a portion of proceeds to the local Humane Society. Her love shines in her work, and I feel blessed to have one of her pieces hanging in my home. It reads simply \u2014 and boldly \u2014 \"Gratitude.\" Find Lisa online at expressionsofearth.com and email her at lisa@ expressionsofearth.com. 1 22 \"Most people cry at my table.

In sixth grade, Ray and a friend made comics together, and (Ray laughed) in eighth grade, he \"painted a comic book character on a trash can at the Calhoun County Fair.\" After studying a book of art by Wassily Kandinsky during his bus rides to work, Ray was so struck that he \"felt drunk, but hadn't had a drink.\" Soon after, he quit his job, cashed in his retirement, and spent a year making art. (He's now back to hourly work and does art alongside.) Ray is a versatile and natural artist who, in addition to the usual sketch pads (I love his black and white drawings), canvases, collage, and digital art, likes to paint on unusual objects. Once, a former landlady gave him a dented round metal sled. He pounded out the dent and painted on it. When the Dark Horse Brewery in Marshall, Michigan (Ray's hometown) first opened its VIP room, Ray was invited to paint a mural on the floor. When I asked if that was hard, he laughed and answered, \"It was hard on my quads, on my knees, and on my up-and-down muscles.\" At the first Madhouse Poetry Series event in Ypsilanti a few years ago, I watched Ray paint live on a door. It was the first time I'd seen a piece of art come alive before my eyes. Watching the layers of \"light and colors\" change was exciting! At a more recent Madhouse gathering, Ray painted on \"live canvases,\" two lady volunteers wearing flesh-colored camisoles. But Ray doesn't only do live gigs, nor does he spend much time networking. \"I prefer to let opportunities come to me,\" he explained. And they do. While camping at a weekend festival, he made friends with his neighbors who turned out to run T-Bois Blues Festival in Larose, Louisiana. Ray mentioned that he is an illustrator and that if they needed any poster art, he'd be happy to offer his services. Not long after, they contacted him. He's designed three posters for them since. He showed me a few that he's done for T-Bois and a friend's wedding invitation in the style of a music festival poster. Every detail had meaning, such as the sidebar of one poster for T-Bois that turned out to be not just a fancy decoration, but the evolution of a fetus in the womb. This portion was eventually changed in the final design over worries people might find it uncomfortable. \"That's what's nice about digital [art],\" said Ray. Details can be changed without scrapping the whole piece. Ray is also a fan of abstract art because he likes to see what other people see in it. \"Art is experiential \u2014 making sense of your senses. The meeting of the creator and the viewer.\" After meeting with Ray, I know I will never look at art in the same way. View more of Ray's work at artviaray.blogspot.com.

I loved teaching, and I think I was pretty good at it. But due to the combination of health problems associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, I needed to leave teaching.\" She was never quite certain what made her ill to begin with, or even what made her better. It was a long, slow road to recovery, with many interventions. Along with the extreme fatigue and pain associated with the illness, Mary also suffered severe cognitive deficits. During the first four years, she was almost totally incapacitated. She experienced a whole range of problems, as she struggled with even simple everyday tasks. Walking around the block was exhausting, her mind was constantly in a fog, short-term memory problems made remembering new information very difficult, and severe pain made even bending over to load or unload the dishwasher a challenge. \"A huge chunk of my life had been turned upside down,\" Mary said. \"It seemed as though everything I'd once been good at, and taken for granted, was lost.\" The road to recovery took over a decade. As Mary gradually began to regain her health, she started looking for things to do that would allow her to use her creativity and exercise her brain. In the late nineties, Mary started a small business making keepsake videos. She'd always enjoyed photography and creating photo albums for her large extended family. So as her parents fiftieth wedding anniversary approached, she took on her first project by scanning over 400 family photos and combining them with music into a memorable keepsake video. This was during the time of videotapes, before DVD technology. Mary is convinced that the repetitive tasks involved in putting together these projects helped improve her cognitive functioning. The videos looked at life through a series of themes rather than the simple, chronological passage of time. Her videos told the stories. In the case of her own family, their lake house was a longtime gathering place, so for one section, she used pictures taken over the years to create a memory of life at the lake through the generations. \"I was telling our family story in a distinct way, through photos and music rather than verbally. My father was especially moved as it reinforced how much fun we had together and how strong our connections were.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 28 This is one in a series of articles we've been doing on local business owners and their businesses. What follows are profiles of two interesting businesses that are thriving despite the odds. By Mary RunserPhotos by Susan Ayer FOUND is a specialty retail store that features a mix of new and vintage items, as well as jewelry and gifts created by local artists who use recycled and found materials. FOUND also has art supplies, old photographs, wall hangings, candles, and other home accents. But you'll soon discover there's much more to this store in downtown Ann Arbor's Kerrytown Market & Shops. We've all heard the adage \"everyone has a story,\" and it's true, each and every one of us do. These stories are really what FOUND is about, and it begins with owner Mary Cambruzzi's story. Originally from Central Illinois, Mary followed her husband and his job to Ann Arbor 35 years ago. Their grown son and daughter are Ann Arbor-born and raised. Mary was a special education teacher in the Plymouth School District for 10 years before she became inexplicably ill. \"In 1987, I was diagnosed as having chronic fatigue The Bona Sera Underground Supper Club hosted events for five years, and in that time raised $20,000 for various charities.FOUND: The Gallery of Stories FOUND Gallery 407 N. 5th Ave., Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104; (734) 302-3060; www .foundgallery.com FOUND is growing! In early July, FOUND signed a lease with Kerry- town to move into the street level space that was once Elephant Ears, more than doubling its size. In the larger space, FOUND has plans to expand their handmade and vintage collections, carry bigger items, and offer workshops and events. Opening in late August! opening her own shop that combined vintage and handmade objects in a fresh, contemporary way. Kathleen told Mary she'd be happy to help her work out a business plan, and said Kerrytown would make a good location for the shop because of its historical significance and proximity to the Farmers' Market. That began the many years' long process of seeking out the resources needed to start and grow a successful retail business. \"It was frightening at first because I was just coming out of years of illness, and I had absolutely no clue about how to run a business,\" Mary said. Kathleen helped Mary through the start-up process, and Mary went on to open FOUND in 2005. This year the store is celebrating its tenth anniversary. One key to its success has been the shop's unique selection. Certainly, they carry new products, such as candles and lotions, but it's the quirky items that often catch the attention of customers. Many of the vintage pieces call up special memories for people. \"People come into the shop, and when they do, their stories come out,\" Mary said. She recalled a time when a woman from Iowa found an old advertising piggy bank tucked into one of the cabinets. The woman explained that the bank was marked with her family's meat packing company imprint, and that the family had two other banks just like it, but there were three siblings. They had just lost a parent, and she was worried about trying to divide things equally. Five hundred miles from home, she found a third pig at FOUND. Happy coincidences like this are not rare occurrences for FOUND's customers. And the store itself seems to encapsulate Mary's personal story of how she has reinvented herself and her career over the last 10 years. Now, she is in the process of re-imaging her business. \"Kerrytown has been a wonderful place for the business,\" she said. \"A larger retail space would allow me to display larger pieces and expand our inventory.\" This past July, a great opportunity arose for FOUND \u2014 they signed a lease with Kerrytown to move into the street-level space that was once Elephant Ears, more than doubling its size. With many plans underway for this new larger space, we can begin to get a picture of how FOUND Gallery might evolve over the next 10 years.After creating 15 or so keepsake projects, Mary encountered another business opportunity, one that would eventually lead to the creation of FOUND. A local antique shop allowed her to rent cabinet space for $45 a month to sell antique pottery and collectibles. Shortly thereafter, Mary got a booth at a garage sale gallery. \"I found I had a definite knack for knowing how to put things together to create interesting displays,\" she said. Mary then started renting space and working a couple days a week at Cambridge House Antiques near Trader Joe's in Ann Arbor. While there, she met Kathleen Dolan and explained to her that she'd been considering The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 29 Feature continued on page 30 \"I found I had a definite knack for knowing how to put things together to create interesting displays.\" \u2014 Mary Cambruzzi, ownerMary went on to open FOUND in 2005, and this year the store is celebrating its tenth anniversary.

Opening in late August!The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 30 Feature continued from page 29 Jan Benzinger , owner of Mudpuddles toy store, is an original Ann Arborite. \"I believe I'm one of the three left,\" she said with laughter. In a town filled with students from all over the world, being a native Ann Arborite is a bit of an oddity. But most of us who live here, native or not, wouldn't trade this little town for any other. It's a great place with tremendous diversity in people and culture, and it's a great spot to be a business owner. Jan is keenly aware of this as she has owned three stores in Ann Arbor, and all of them have been in the Kerrytown Market & Shops. \"I've never had a mainstream job,\" Jan said. \"I've always had the pleasure of creating my own jobs.\" At the age of 19, she lived in the basement of a friend's home. There was a potter's wheel in the basement, and she decided to teach herself how to make pottery. Later in our conversation, Jan remembered that she did work as a mail carrier for the post office for a year when she was young. She said that she didn't like getting up early and reporting to someone else, and didn't think her attendance was very good as a result, which was not the case with pottery. \"Since I loved making pottery, it wasn't a big issue to get myself into the studio,\" she said. Jan explained that when she was 19, she, like many other teenagers, was rather lost. \"I believe that, while I may not have known it at the time, pottery was a gift to me. Just to realize that I could make something beautiful from my own hands, and perhaps eke out a living from it, was just a marvelous thing.\" For a number of years, she did the art fair circuit throughout Michigan, a fun but not necessarily easy endeavor. \"You may sign up to do 15 or 20 shows, pay your fees, go to the first two shows and sell completely out of your product,\" Jan said. \"Now you've got to go back home to make more product, so there's no way you can do the other shows. Or you might go to a show, one in which you're practically guaranteed to make money, except it rains and very few people show up.\" During the lucrative years, doing the art fairs was wonderful, but as she got older and watched herself and others her age work harder for less of a return, the idea of turning a key and having a stable work environment became much more appealing. In 1980, Jan opened Foxfarm Pottery in Kerrytown Market & Shops, the first of her three businesses in that location. Her business partner, Sharon Plumley, came on board after Jan realized she hadn't considered how she could possibly be in the store for eight hours a day and make pottery at the same time. So Sharon ran the store while Jan was in the studio, though Jan said she didn't believe Sharon was really that fond of the pottery business. While at a show to purchase items for the store (they carried other artists' work in addition to Jan's), Jan's eye gravitated toward other things besides pottery \u2014 like birdhouses, wind chimes, and other nature pieces, which she loved. \"We decided to blend them in with the other inventory we carried at Foxfarm just to see how it worked,\" she said. Jan BenzingerMudpuddles: A Place for Kids of All Ages Mudpuddles 407 N. 5th Ave., Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104; (734) 662-0022; http://kerrytown.com/mudpuddles/ \"Just to realize that I could make something beautiful from my own hands, and perhaps eke out a living from it, was just a marvelous thing.\" \u2014 Jan Benzinger, ownerThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 31 It worked well enough that they petitioned Kerrytown for extra retail space for the fourth quarter. \"We made more money in that quarter than we did in an entire year making and selling pottery. It didn't take us very long to realize that this was the way to go,\" Jan said. And from there, Marsh and Fields Nature Works was born in 1987. \"Eventually, 'nature' became too commonplace. Every store had some corner devoted to cute little gardening tools and plaques. I just didn't like the way it cheapened the genre,\" she said. Inside Marsh and Fields, another small section \u2014 a space dedicated for kids and toys \u2014 expanded into the idea for Jan and Sharon's third business endeavor: Mudpuddles, which opened in 1995. Jan is the buyer for Mudpuddles while Sharon is the financial guru. Both women enjoy going to the International Toy Fair in New York City every February. Who wouldn't? \"After the holidays, when you're burned out, the Toy Fair is the perfect thing to see what's new and to re-energize you,\" Jan said. \"When I was a kid, I wanted to be a kindergarten teacher when I grew up, and I kind of am,\" she said. \"Those five and six-year-olds are who I relate to.\" When you look around Mudpuddles, you'll notice they have a hefty inventory. \"The store isn't really deep into any particular niche,\" Jan said. \"We carry books, but we aren't a bookstore. I like books, and I think we should have some. We carry sports items, but we aren't a sports store. We really just have a little bit of everything.\" Customers' suggestions are a great help with inventory. When a customer asks for a certain item, Jan researches it to see if it would work in the store. There's no target age range when it comes to purchasing for the store, nor is either gender favored, so Mudpuddles is able to carry a diverse selection. \"Speaking as an artist, becoming a business person isn't an easy changeover,\" Jan said. Yet, she's had three successful businesses. \"Part of that is due to Sharon. She crunches the numbers, and that's just as well. The person who does the buying shouldn't have to worry about how it's going to get paid for. It strikes fear in your heart!\" \"Opening Mudpuddles, Foxfarm, and Marsh and Fields Nature Works have really just been a way of providing ourselves with jobs,\" Jan explained. From time to time, she does think forward to the day when she may no longer own Mudpuddles. \"I hope that the store will still be here, that we could sell it, but it would remain. I'm such a part of Kerrytown that the notion that Mudpuddles might not be here at some point breaks my heart, so I hope that doesn't happen.\" Sharon has stepped away from the day-to-day operations of the store, and when it's time for Jan to do the same, she hopes it will carry on. \"Kerrytown needs a toy store, and this is a great one.... If the alternative is that Mudpuddles disappears, I'll probably be here until I'm 85.\" In June, Jan and Sharon added one other member to their team. A promising employee, his full-time schedule has allowed Jan to begin stepping away and doing other things. \"Perhaps one day this will be his store, but I'm not quite ready to take that step just yet.\" For now, she prefers to continue welcoming her customers into her little corner of the world. ###\"When I was a kid, I wanted to be a kindergarten teacher when I grew up, and I kind of am. These five and six-year-olds are who I relate to.\" \u2014 Jan Benzinger \"Kerrytown needs a toy store, and this is a great one.\" \u2014 Jan Benzinger The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September- December 2015 Page 32 Namaste, Roshani! Namaste, Roshani \u2014 As I deepen my yoga practice, I can't help but notice that most yoga instructors I meet and read about are all practicing vegetarians. I wonder if I should try vegetarianism, but I don't really know what the exact connection is between the meatless lifestyle and yoga. Could you direct me to some resources which may demystify things a bit for me? Yours truly, Dave S., Ann Arbor Dear Dave, It certainly didn't take long before you noticed the widespread practice of vegetarianism and veganism within yoga communities, did it? Though in recent years some Western yogis of fame, (such as Tara Stiles and Sadie Nardini) have been open about their meat-eating ways, traditionally , yoga stems from gurus of South Indian origin, where vegetarianism is the standard in most household diets. Sri Krishnamacharya, commonly referred to as \"the father of modern yoga,\" taught Sri K. Pattabhi Jois and B. K. S. Iyengar, who have each left an indelible mark in the yoga world. Jois went on to develop Ashtanga yoga and Iyengar created Iyengar yoga. Both were lifelong vegetarians who went on to teach people like David Life, the founder of Jivamukti yoga. Jivamukti yoga only allows practitioners deeply committed to veganism to obtain certification as yoga Instructors. In total, there are ten principles of yoga. One of the ten is called Ahimsa. Literally translated from Sanskrit, Ahimsa means \"compassion for all living beings,\" and some interpret its meaning as \"nonviolence.\" Naturally , one could argue that killing animals merely for consumption goes against the tenet of Ahimsa. Unfortunately , though it may be an obvious connection to make, it is not an easy practice to adopt. If you are considering a transition from carnivore to vegetarian, I would suggest starting with a small step, like \"meatless Mondays,\" for example. Go without meat once a week and see how you adjust. Spend the day being especially mindful of all foods you consume. Take note of any physical, mental, or spiritual changes you feel. You may feel naturally inclined to give up meat entirely . You may not. If you feel vegetarianism is not for you, you can begin practicing Ahimsa with yourself and those around you. We can fall into violent cycles of self-deprecation or judgment against ourselves and others around us. Remember this is also a practice that requires nurturing ourselves. Being mindful of our thoughts, words, and actions is all a part of ensuring we honor the principle of Ahimsa. Whether you decide to go vegetarian or not, stay diligent in your yoga practice and remember in the words of Sri K. Pattabhi Jois: \"Practice and all is coming.\" With warm regards, Roshani Namaste, Roshani \u2014 This may seem like an odd problem to have, but I figure you've probably heard it almost all by now. I've begun a semi-regular yoga practice, and it usually seems that afterwards, my body is not reveling in bliss mode, but rather recoiling with sore muscles. Am I doing something wrong? Please help! I want to tap into my inner Zen, but my \"achy breaky heart\" keeps getting in the way. Seth K., Ypsilanti Dear Seth, That's not an odd problem at all. Trust me, all yoga practitioners have been in your shoes at some point. Even now , if I stay off my mat for more than two weeks, I can hop back into a simple asana like Downward Facing Dog and feel it all up and down my legs the following morning. Having said that, if your instructor is not correcting your alignment, it may just be your body adjusting itself to this new practice. That's natural. For now , take pleasure in long steamy hot baths with Epsom salt. The heat from the water will relax your muscles and the Epsom salt will relax your nervous system. Also, immediately after a yoga class try eating potassium-rich foods, like bananas, or drinking potassium-rich beverages, like coconut water. The mineral potassium is great for proper muscular functions. The consumption of potassium, whether in food or drinks, reduces chances of muscle spasms and balances out blood sugar spikes. Lastly , it may seem silly but stretch before you stretch! Create a mini routine before a class wherein you can do some simple stretches before you actually go through with a full hour-long class. While yoga can be a very spiritual practice, if you are mainly focusing on asanas, or postures, you may need to consult with a physician beforehand. All the best! With warm regards, RoshaniYOGA Whether you're a seasoned yogi or getting ready to roll out your mat for the first time, you'll find a variety of tips from local yoga instructor, Roshani Adhikary . Prasarita Padottanasana-CNamaste, Roshani \u2014 I'm pretty new to yoga \u2014 I have been attending a weekly class for just few months now \u2014 but even as a beginner , I have noticed more than just physical benefits. I have heard that yoga is great for anxiety, which is the main reason I started attending class to begin with. But I'd like to access these benefits outside of the classroom, particularly when I'm feeling acute anxiety. Do you know of any simple poses I could do on my own? Alice T., Ann Arbor Dear Alice, Yoga is certainly a spiritual and mental practice, and oftentimes, beginning students tend to focus just on the physical aspect (which is understandable, with the aches, pains, and tight muscles that undoubtedly surface when you're trying new poses for the first time). It definitely sounds like you have the right attitude \u2014 enjoying the process and accepting the challenges along the way . Here are two simple poses you can try on your own when you're feeling your anxiety getting the best of you: Child's Pose addresses the areas where people tend to hold a lot of tension \u2014 back, neck and shoulders \u2014 and it is a pose commonly known as a place of rest. I'm sure you've already tried it in your yoga class, returning to it between more challenging asanas. This pose also encourages steady , mindful breathing, which calms the nervous system. Tree Pose is also wonderful for easing anxiety . Finding your balance, maintaining it, and keeping your gaze fixed ahead of you takes your focus off of the racing thoughts. Your doubts and fears might still be there, but you are standing strong in spite of them. This is a useful pose to do in the morning, or during the day , when you really need to tap into your inner strength. Though anxiety is very cunning and can sway you to believe otherwise, your inner strength and essence always reside within in you. Continue with your yoga practice, and you will not only strengthen your physical core, but your core self as well ... which is a beautiful thing. Best wishes, Roshani Remember this is also a practice that requires nurturing ourselves. Being mindful of our thoughts, words, and actions is all a part of ensuring we honor the principle of Ahimsa, or \"compassion for all living beings.\"Tree Pose is also wonderful for easing anxiety. Finding your balance, maintaining it, and keeping your gaze fixed ahead of you takes your focus off of the anxiety.

Kay Page 38 Great Tastes in Local Food by Crysta Coburn Page 40 Conscious and T asty Eating and Nutrition our new section! The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 33 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 34 Food preservation had been the answer to the cold winters in the North for thousands of years \u2014 and then it wasn't. Grocery stores replaced the thousands-year-old tradition with thousands of miles of travel. Food started being imported, and with it, the need for preservation fell away. But what remained was a desire to eat local food. The chemical-packed peaches that are flown into the grocery stores of Michigan during the winter months are nothing compared to the fresh-grown fuzzy fruits that occupy the trees on the west side of the state during the summer months. This is where Rena Basch stepped in, and created Locavorious. \"We provide locally grown frozen fruits and vegetables in the winter months, enabling people to benefit the earth and our community by eating locally in the winter,\" said Basch. The idea came from her kitchen and home practice of freezing food for her family. As the Ann Arbor Township Clerk, she became more interested in sustainable agriculture and small farms. Basch was a frequent shopper at local CSA's, but she was disappointed when the season was over. A co-worker suggested freezing food as a method of preservation, and an idea was hatched. A few business counseling sessions and classes later, Basch decided to start Locavorious on April 1, 2007. She jumped, without even finishing her business plan, \"because you can't take this stuff too seriously,\" she laughed. She was confident that Locavorious would work, and her leaps have proven beneficial. But it hasn't all been easy. \"People really don't value the true cost of food,\" Basch explained. Locavorious pays the farmers and workers a very fair wage, which automatically drives up the cost of a pound of green beans, she explained as an example. Basch and her small team of six people clean the produce, hand process it, package and freeze the product \u2014 there are no small-scale machines that would be useful for the amount of food she is preparing. By the time that pound of green beans gets a price tag, she could very well charge seven or eight dollars. But she doesn't, because Basch understands that the majority of people grocery shop at large-scale supermarkets, looking to spend 99 cents on a pound of frozen green beans. But, as she explained, what Locavorius offers is an entirely different product. \"The easiest thing to do is have somebody taste it,\" she said. \"We purchase from sustainably run farms, and prepare [our products] by hand by fairly paid workers, but the bottom line is that it's all about taste.\" Part of the reason Locavorious' food tastes so good is because of the relationships Basch has made and the research she has done. She's been shopping the farmers' markets in Ann Arbor for over a decade now, and she knows who has the best of each crop. Her process is quick and natural \u2014 once she has the harvest in her hands, it's processed and frozen as quickly as possible, in its own natural juices. Basch's choices in quality and sustainability certainly factor into the taste of Locavorious' product; the produce she provides is organic whenever possible, and the food is grown by farmers who are making an effort to decrease their carbon footprint. Locavorious not only supports a local economy by giving local farmers more business, but supports a healthy environment as well. \"We're helping to increase the market for farmers who choose to grow sustainably,\" Basch explained, mentioning that growing in Michigan isn't always easy, and doing so naturally adds a massive challenge. \"We're trying to pull from those kind of farms, because that increases their economic footprint, and decreases our carbon footprint,\" said Basch. Richard Andres of Tantr\u00e9 Farm is one of the providers for Locavorious' produce. For Tantr\u00e9 Farm, the relationship with Locavorious has been a beneficial one, in part because Basch buys from them, but Andres has found other benefits, as well.\"There's a tradition of people coming together to preserve the harvest, and she's Basch understands that the majority of people grocery shop at large-scale supermarkets, looking to spend 99 cents on a pound of frozen green beans. But, as she explained, what Locavorius offers is an entirely different product.Local Food for Winter Months \u2014 Locavorious Preserves Tradition By Chelsea Hohn Basch and her small team of six people clean the produce, hand process it, package and freeze the product.Rena BaschThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 35 sort of rediscovering that,\" Andres said. \"I think that's an important narrative for everybody \u2014 people participating with the food that they eat.\" Sustainability is also a big part of Locavorious, and their model reflects that. Instead of using petroleum to ship corn halfway around the world, the food is coming from four miles down the road. \"And we carpool,\" added Basch with a laugh. Locavorious provides local frozen food during the winter months, but doesn't leave customers hanging. The food comes with recipes and suggestions for how to cook it, which is Basch's favorite part. \"With all the fresh food available, we've forgotten how to cook with frozen food,\" Basch said. It is a different process, and one that can go overlooked when the grocery store is stocked with everything a foodie might need, at any time of the year. Providing quality local food and information on how to prepare it aren't the only reasons Locavorius keeps going \u2014 Basch's passion continually pushes the business forward. \"I just really believe in local food as a way to improve the economy and environment,\" she said. \"I believe it's such a win-win-win ... for local agriculture, for the environment, and for eaters.\" Locavorious subscribes to a \"back-to-the-future\" mentality \u2014 bringing back traditional practices in a way that benefits the earth and the people who are working to preserve it. For Basch, she believes that preservation is the future, but it seems like she's just picking up the past from where others may have left off.

There's my adoration for red wine, my newly acquired appreciation of kombucha beer (double trouble), and then yogurt, decadent cheese, and everything in between. It's hard not to be an advocate of it all. I love the carbonation of kimchi and the aged flavor of sauerkraut, and though the flavors may be a bit too intense for some, there are a lot more foods available to us than we think in the world of fermentation. Vinegar is fermented. Coffee beans and cacao beans are fermented (it allows the fruit to come off the bean more easily, and the process also brings out a lot more flavors). And fermentation creates safe food. The USDA states that properly fermented vegetables are safer than raw vegetables, and \"there has never been a documented case of foodborne illness from fermented vegetables\" ( The Art of Fermentation, p. 135). Although I know fermented foods are good for me, I've always been curious about the how/what/and why of this seemingly magical process. To find out more, I turned to David Klingenberger, CFO \u2014 or Chief Fermenting Officer \u2014 at The Brinery. Since opening in 2010, The Brinery has quickly become a local favorite with its simple and delicious fermented products, like sauerkraut, kimchi, tempeh, hot sauce, and more. As they continue to expand, they are coming up with more variations and products with the hopes of one day becoming \"the Zingerman's of fermentation,\" according to David. Brinery products are all raw and unpasteurized, and their ingredients are sourced from local farms. Prior to starting The Brinery, David had been fermenting for nearly a decade, falling in love with the process after he began working at Tantr\u00e9 farms straight out of high school. His summers working at Tantr\u00e9 inspired him to look at agriculture and food in a new way and informed his vision about feeding himself and the community. To meet David is to really experience someone who has discovered his calling \u2014 his passion, knowledge, and authenticity drive his work at The Brinery. He continues to feed his community in innovative ways and teach us about the various possibilities that exist with food (The Brinery offers classes in fermentation as well). Though David appreciates \"the science and the health benefits of fermentation,\" to him, the anchoring point and the guiding light of The Brinery relates to how humans have adapted this natural process to meet our needs. \"We co-evolved with methods of capturing and harnessing energy ... and fermentation is a perfect example of [how we used a natural process] to create something that benefits us \u2014 fermentation keeps out the decaying bacteria and organisms and creates an environment for the bacteria that preserve the food to thrive.\" The Brinery uses a lactic acid fermentation process, unlike most mass produced foods, which rely on vinegar. The Brinery's lacto-fermentation process is naturally catalyzed with salt water (brine). The salt creates conditions that favor the bacteria, pull nutrients, and add flavor. And the process doesn't always stop after jarring \u2014 on The Brinery's website, it cautions: \"Sometimes fermentation will continue to occur after jarring; any bubbling, fizziness, or slight bulging of the lid is 100 percent natural and safe.\" The resulting flavors and textures also explain why The Brinery has become such a hit. \"There is this deep umami flavor that comes through fermentation: beer, salami, pickles, miso, fish sauce. This deep flavor comes through fermentation, and then in the aging, flavor is imparted,\" David explained. For example, sauerkraut at The Brinery is made in big batches during the fall, when farms usually have an excess of cabbage. Once fermentation is complete, sauerkraut can sit for months and cure, which allows the deep flavors to meld and mellow. Kimchi, on the other hand, has a short fermentation and aging process due to the amount of carbonation. It is typically eaten within the first couple months of aging, and has big, bold flavors. Though it may seem odd to consume bacteria-rich foods, the truth is, we need them. And as David will assure us, there is no need to be scared of bacteria. \"We have co-evolved and lived with bacteria since the beginning of time. We're born with bacteria; it's in our cells, and so when we eat these probiotic-rich foods, we are not just helping the bacteria within us, but we're also adding to it.\" I find all of this fascinating, though it may be because I am a woman with IBS who constantly struggles to find balance within my gut. Still, I have noticed a huge difference in my digestion when I eat bacteria-rich foods like sauerkraut or kimchi; everything in my gut moves more smoothly, and in turn I feel better. My respect for fermentation began with a tempeh Reuben, and since then, my love and curiosity for bacteria-rich foods has created a different relationship between me and my gut. Though I'm just beginning to skim the surface of this world, we should all be happy that we have The Brinery to turn to when we're in need of a gut check! Brinery products can be found at Arbor Farms, Babo Market, Plum Market, Whole Foods, The People's Food Co-op, and more.

Gottschalk is a Certified Cicerone (sommelier of the beer world) and took an old party store in a fresh direction when he opened the new Blue Front as a fine beer and wine shop in July 2014. Customers enter the store under crisp, dark blue awnings. The space is light and airy, the aisles wide. Interesting old-fashioned light bulbs hang in a fixture over the front counter. Two easy chairs grace the entry area. Joshua Kay: Let's start off with the space. How did you approach renovations? Adam Gottschalk: The place was a wreck when I got the keys, but my dad saw that it had good bones. My wife and I did the design, and my brother did most of the renovations. The front counter is topped with cherry wood from my uncle's farm. The paneling on the sides of the counter is reclaimed redwood. We put in new windows and flooring, and we got a new cooler. It was a lot of work, but every day it came together a little bit more. Joshua Kay: What were you doing before this? Adam Gottschalk: I grew up in Ann Arbor and moved to Chicago. The dream was to open a brewery \u2014 I've been brewing about seven years \u2014 but you need a lot of money and a lot of time to do that. I felt like I needed to get more industry experience, so I worked in Chicago at a few beer stores. I managed one for a while. My parents knew the owners of this building, so when the old tenant moved out, they called me and said, \"Hey, the Blue Front is vacant. You should move back to Michigan and open up your own store.\" And I talked to my wife and told my parents, \"That's a cool idea. We'll think it over.\" They said, \"Well, they need to know by Monday.\" This was on a Thursday. I said, \"We can't do that on such short notice.\" And my dad called me on Saturday and said, \"Well, if you don't do it, I'm going to.\" So I said, \"Okay, let's do it.\" JK: What kind of shop did you want to create? AG: In Chicago, the store that I was working in most recently was very much like this. It was owned by a couple and very family oriented. They had a small baby who'd hang out in the store, and the neighborhood would come in to say \"hi.\" Everyone knew everyone, and it was clean and nice. We wanted to create a place like that, with great selection and great service, where people would want to come in and hang out. We have a ton of people who sit and chat about beer and then say, \"Oh! I've been chatting about beer for an hour and a half! I gotta go!\" We just wanted a nice, inviting space where we could help people find beer and teach people about beer. JK: So I was going to ask about that teaching part \u2014 .AG: That's probably one of my favorite things about being here, because we have a lot of people who say \"I just got into beer, and I like this [kind], and can you help me find some new things?\" So it's really fun to be able to help them out. I make sure my staff knows their stuff because the education part is so important. JK: Is there a progression you follow when you start people in the craft beer world?AG: Yes! First, we find out what they've had before and see if there's something they've liked that we can build on. Or sometimes they're moving from typical American light lagers into craft beer. A good gateway for them is wheat beers. For Interview by Joshua B. Kay \"All of our windows have UV film on them because light is the biggest killer of beer freshness, and we have tons of windows.\"\"We just wanted a nice, inviting space where we could help people find beer and teach people about beer.\"Conscious Eating & NutritionThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 39 example, there's Bell's Oberon and Arcadia Whitsun here in Michigan. With those, people can see that there are more flavors out there than light American lagers have, but they're not overwhelming beers. Belgian beers are also a good way to start because there are so many great flavors to explore. I look for beers that are flavorful but accessible, with nothing that someone's likely to find offensive. From there, I can steer them to different styles, like IPA's [India pale ales] and porters. Some people decide they love a particular style, and I can guide them in exploring more within that style. Other people want to explore new styles. JK: In the wine world, the ideas of proper storage and proper aging are well- accepted. Are you trying to achieve that kind of respect for the need for freshness and proper storage in the beer world? AG: Absolutely. We took a few steps that I think go above and beyond most places. All of our windows have UV film on them because light is the biggest killer of beer freshness, and obviously we have tons of windows. It was funny because when we were remodeling, we had paper over the windows so people couldn't see in. And when we were mostly done, we said, \"All right, pull the paper down!\" We saw the light pour in, and we realized, \"Okay, that's not going to work at all.\" So we put up the film, and it cuts about 98 percent of the UV rays and holds out a lot of the heat, too. We pay attention to temperature, too. In the winter, it's a little chilly in here. It's not because we're cheap about the gas bill. Every little bit we can do helps store the beer properly. Also, we sometimes run out of things because I'd rather have to say, \"I'm sorry, I've sold the last one,\" than say, \"I have forty cases sitting around.\" So, we're always trying to have the freshest stuff. JK: How do you select your inventory?AG: We have a ton of beers \u2014 we're just shy of 800 \u2014 but there's a lot more beer out there. Instead of trying to have one of everything, our inventory is a little more curated. I think we do a good job of having a good amount of variety without having it be completely overwhelming or having beer start to go bad. We have a ton of Michigan beer, probably about 30 percent of the beer we have, but also a lot that people might not have had. JK: If someone is interested in beer-food pairings, is that something you can help them with? AG: Absolutely. A lot of people, at least in the past, when they think of food and fine dining, think that they have to have wine pairings, but beer is way more versatile. Yes, there's a ton of grapes out there, but you're really restricted to those flavors. What kind of wine do you pair with asparagus? There are a lot of tough wine pairings, whereas with beer, just the traditional styles alone give you so many options, and then there are the crazy experiments that breweries do. For example, what do you pair with banana bread? Well, I have a banana bread beer! With pairings, you can either complement or contrast. For example, with a sweet dessert, you can get a sweet beer to go with it, or you can have something totally opposite that showcases the difference. One rule is that the beer always has to be bigger than the food, or else it will just get lost. With a beer, a sip is really quick, but your palate has more contact with food. So, you need the beer to be big enough to make an impression. JK: I see this sign on the front counter for in-store tastings. Tell me about those. AG: We love tastings! They're super fun. Some beers everybody knows, but there are some that are great but need a little help getting people introduced to them. It's fun for the breweries and for us. People can try things and learn about new beers and breweries. We can also help people plan their own tastings at home, especially because we sell a lot of single beers. That way, people can try a variety for a low price. JK: Are there particular Michigan breweries that are doing things that you're especially excited about? AG: Here in Ann Arbor, Wolverine is an awesome addition to the beer scene. I thought at first that their all-lager approach was a gimmick, but they do a great job. They do a lot of classic styles really well, and they've done a bunch of cool experiments that have really worked. They've changed our conception of what you can do with lager beer. And Jolly Pumpkin is a wonderful brewery. They're really advancing sour beers. Ron Jeffries, the brewmaster, is an artist. He doesn't stick to schedules, and he hand-tastes every batch. They don't send it out until it's ready, and they really care about their product. Looking beyond the southeast, I'm excited to have Blackrocks distributing down here. It's a Marquette brewery, and everything they do is good. Their IPA is one of the best in the state. I put it right up there with Bell's Two Hearted and Founders Centennial IPA. JK: What trends do you see in the craft beer industry? AG: One trend that excites me is more sour beer. That's a fun trend, and because of it we're seeing a rebirth of some lesser-known sour styles, like Berliner weisse and gose. They are light in alcohol and really quenching. And session IPA's are a new thing. I drink a lot of them, and I like the trend of having beers that are more drinkable and well-balanced. JK: Anything concerning in the industry? AG: I don't think it's concerning, but the industry has expanded so rapidly, and I think there's going to be some consolidation. Eventually, there's going to be so much beer, and people are getting really well-educated about it, so I think some breweries that are not as good are going to start to close. JK: The need for real quality will be preeminent?AG: Yes. Right now, a new brewery opens something like every 1.2 days in the U.S., and there are hundreds of new breweries in the planning stages. It's just insane. There are two more planned in Ann Arbor! And Saline is getting a new one. They're going in everywhere. There's room for more across the state, but they'll really need to be good to survive. JK: With the proliferation of craft breweries, are you seeing consumers getting more educated? AG: Absolutely. It's not as \"hipsterish\" as it was, just on the cutting edge. It's more mainstream. ### Blue Front is located at 701 Packard St., Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104.

I know, chai isn't coffee. But I now have a coffee alternative, the honey latte, or caf\u00e9 miel as it is also known, which is spreading across Ann Arbor. When I entered Lab on Liberty for the first time, I was delighted to find caf\u00e9 miel on the menu. The flavor was robust, not overpowering. Their chai latte is spicier than others, though not off-putting. I'd order it again (if I don't order the caf\u00e9 miel). Lab's furnishings are simple and casual, and the color palate neutral. I love the cozy corner by the window adorned with an eclectic blend of furniture that looks similar to what you might find at Treasure Mart. Lab feels like Ann Arbor. I noticed, while waiting for my latte, a door that opened to Lab's neighbor. I poked my head in to find Tomukun Noodle Bar, packed with the lunch crowd. (Tomukun and Lab share owners.) I now know that what I should have done was lunched at Tomukun, then moved next door to Lab for a relaxing after-meal coffee or macaron dessert. I should have also called friends to join me. (Live and learn.) Tomukun Noodle Bar offers something I haven't had since I was in Japan over ten years ago: okonomiyaki. Literally translating to \"grilled as you like it,\" okonomiyaki is often \"savory pancake\" or pizza.\" Tomukun's \"pancake\" is thick, and toppings include \"shrimp, squid, scallions, and onions. Topped with bacon, cheese, Japanese mayo, okonomiyaki sauce, dry roasted seaweed, and shaved dried bonito.\" It sounds like a lot, and it is extremely filling (probably why it's on the appetizer list, to encourage you to share). But trust me, the resulting blend of flavors put me over the moon. Other menu items include pho, ramen, udon, donburi, and more. The chicken donburi is quite delightful. There are more toppings than I usually see, making Tomukun's donburi truly a flavorful signature dish. Both the donburi and oyakodon pair excellently with a cold bottle of Asahi Super Dry. The menu also changes seasonally, with summer ushering in cold noodles \u2014 so refreshing in the heat! On the other side of the Noodle Bar from Lab is the newest of the three businesses, Tomukun Korean BBQ. The prices may be higher, but the dining experience is unique and wonderful. There are not many restaurants in the U.S. that allow you to grill your own food. (If you have trouble with this, the capable wait staff is happy to help.) It's also fun! So don't feel daunted. Tomukun BBQ is a great date spot, and the food is entirely authentic Korean. Co-owner Scott Meinke let me in on some of the plans for the three businesses. Rather than expand, the owners intend to \"stay fresh and build on what [they] have.\" Lab has added Michigan craft beers to their menu and is also planning to have craft cocktails. They \"don't want to turn into a bar,\" Scott assured me, but are going for a more European model, which includes alcohol alongside coffee. \"We want it to be a place people can gather.\" A lot of thought and love have clearly gone into creating both Tomukun and Lab. Whether at the Noodle Bar or the BBQ, you're in for a treat, and with Lab next door, you have everything you could possibly need for a fantastic night out. I look forward to seeing them all evolve! Lab, Tomukun Noodle Bar, and Tomukun BBQ are located in neighboring suites at 505 E. Liberty in Ann Arbor. Lab is open weekdays 8 a.m. until 10 p.m., Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., and Sundays 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. The BBQ is open Tuesday through Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. (kitchen closes at 9:30 p.m.). The Noodle Bar is open Monday through Thursday from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 1 a.m., and Sunday from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Harvest Kitchen Located in Ypsilanti's historic Depot Town, Harvest Kitchen is easy to miss. But there is something truly special going on behind that door. Harvest Kitchen makes eating locally grown, healthy food easy and accessible to everyone. They can be found at their storefront in Ypsilanti, as well as three local farmers' markets (check their website for a full list of times and locations). Their menu changes based on what foods are in season and what is available from their local farm suppliers. And, as it says in their mission statement, \"all of our food is grown and made with love and care.\" It shows! There are a few different ways of buying your meals from Harvest Kitchen. Stop by the storefront or the farmers' market booth when you're short on time and want to pick up a complete, healthy meal to take home or on the go. You can also find select items at Argus Farm Stop. Or, if you have time to plan ahead but can't make it out, Harvest Kitchen now delivers within Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor for $7 per order, and Saline, Dexter, Milan, Belleville, and Canton for $12. They also offer catering and meal subscriptions. Options range from salads to entrees to desserts for both omnivores and vegetarians, fresh and frozen (for future at-home preparation). One signature dish, the curried chicken salad, is a customer favorite, and for good reason! Juicy chunks of chicken packed with flavor, fine on its own or in a lettuce wrap or sandwich. I also recommend the Mexican chocolate brownies, another Harvest Kitchen signature, made with cinnamon and a hint of cayenne pepper. They are not spicy, just delicious. I think I will be adding cinnamon to my own homemade brownies in the future. When I entered Lab on Liberty for the first time, I was delighted to find caf\u00e9 miel on the menu. I now know that what I should have done was lunched at Tomukun, then moved next door to Lab for a relaxing after-meal coffee or macaron dessert.As it says in their mission statement, \"all of our food is grown and made with love and care.\" It shows!

It was absolutely mouth-watering and tasted like something I would make in my slowcooker if I actually had the time. With Harvest Kitchen, I don't have to stress. I can place my order during my break at work, pay online with my credit card, then swing by and pick up dinner on my way home. Don't get me wrong, I love to cook! But there are days so packed that dinner is the last thing on my mind. If you feel me on this, check out Harvest Kitchen and support our local food economy. You'll love it. The Harvest Kitchen Storefront is located at 32 E. Cross St. in Ypsilanti and is open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 7:30 p.m. and Saturdays from 11 a.m. until 6 p.m. Harvest Kitchen can also be found at the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market, Cobblestone Farm Market, and Westside Farmers' Market. Check www.harvest-kitchen.com for days and times. Pilar's Tamales When I first discovered Pilar's Tamales, I was fresh from California and looking for some familiar foods. Before moving to California, I had never even heard of tamales. But once I tried them, they became one of my favorite foods. Sourced from locally-grown, organic produce and antibiotic- and hormone-free meat, Pilar's Tamales are some of the best tamales around. (They also offer yummy vegetarian options!) And Pilar's has been expanding, now encompassing Pilar's Caf\u00e9 located at 2261 W. Liberty in Ann Arbor, Pilar's Cart that pops up at the Kerrytown and Westside farmers' markets, and Pilar's full-service catering. (Anyone getting married?) In addition to the 12 regular menu options, Pilar's Tamales incorporates in-season ingredients, resulting in \"seasonal tamales,\" such as broccoli and cheddar, sweet potato, blueberry, apple, kale, squash, turkey, and many more. With such a selection, it's hard to choose! Although \"tamales\" is in the name, tamales are not the only wonderful thing about Pilar's. Another draw for me is the traditional Salvadoran dish pupusas, \"handmade tortillas from 100 percent stone-ground corn masa, filled, grilled to perfection.\" Pilar's offers four varieties: chicken; pork; black and loroco and cheese. (Loroco is \"a tropical flower bud that tastes more vegetal than floral.\") On your first trip to Pilar's Caf\u00e9, you should make it easier on yourself by ordering the Perfect Pair Special, which offers one tamal and one pupusa, as well as beans, plantains, curtido (a lightly fermented cabbage coleslaw), and a small house drink. One signature dish, the curried chicken salad, is a customer favorite, and for good reason!

With greeting cards, soaps, loose leaf teas, and locally made crafts, there is a lot to discover, and there is also a peaceful and inviting yoga room. And in the restroom, there is something absolutely wonderful (you read that right), a board that reads \"Take What You Need\" and offers paper tear-aways with words like \"peace,\" \"rest,\" \"strength,\" and so on. I chose \"rest\" because I'd been working so much that some rest was exactly what I needed, and the smile that little piece of paper gave me lifted my spirits. Just another way to show that Pilar's cares about their customers and our community, as well as really great food. Pilar's Tamales Caf\u00e9 is located at 2261 W. Liberty in Ann Arbor and is open Tuesday through Friday from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m. and Saturdays from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m.Pilar's Caf\u00e9The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 42 Bill Zirinsky: Lisa, you've been in the community for decades, working and raising a family. You co-founded and ran Selma Cafe. You are a full-time school social worker, as well. For those of our readers who may not know, what was Selma Cafe, why was it created, why did it become such a cool and popular and \"talked about\" phenomenon -- perhaps the epitome of a certain slice of the Ann Arbor zeitgeist during its heyday -- and what happened to it? Lisa Gottlieb: Selma Cafe is a non-profit organization that supports local food and sustainable agriculture, created in February 2009, by my then-husband Jeff McCabe and myself. When we started, we had a seed of an idea that included weekly Friday morning local food breakfast parties at our home on the west side of Ann Arbor. Selma grew into a full blooming enterprise, measurably increasing our local foodshed and financially supporting many local farmers and food businesses. Every week, we had a different guest chef who created a menu based on local and seasonal foods. Volunteers would prep and serve the meals, guests would make donations, and we used the money to buy all the ingredients for future breakfasts. We were keeping all the food dollars in our community, which was an important part of our mission. The rest of the money was used to offer loans to local farmers to purchase hoop house kits and our volunteers would build them with the farmers. After four years of weekly breakfast parties, with sometimes 200 guests coming to our home, the city shut us down because of us operating in a residential neighborhood. We moved breakfasts to Sunward Cohousing on a once a month basis. Our last breakfast was April of 2014, and since then, Selma Cafe has been on hiatus. I think there were several key factors to the success of Selma Cafe, including the growing value in our community of knowing and supporting local farmers and food artisans, the fun and energy of having such a massive undertaking in someone's home, and a super inclusive and friendly vibe that was a natural part of volunteers all working together with shared mission. What we created with the Selma Cafe community is a powerful example of what can happen when people come together with shared mission and passion, along with delicious food and a lot of joy. Bill Zirinsky: And what do you do as a school social work er? Lisa Gottlieb: I've worked for the Washtenaw Intermediate School District for the last 15 years, where I provide school social work services to students in the Washtenaw County Juvenile Detention Center, for the Ann Arbor Deaf and Hard of Hearing Program, and WAVE (Washtenaw Alliance for Virtual Education), a county wide alternative high school program. In addition to direct social work support and special education services, I am a certified Kripalu yoga teacher and really enjoy offering mindfulness meditation and yoga to some of the students with whom I work, especially in the detention center. BZ: And you've raised kids in Ann Arbor, too? Lisa Gottlieb: Y es, I have two adult children, and I'm fortunate that they both live and work in Ann Arbor. My daughter, Zoe Clark, is executive producer at Michigan Radio (NPR), and the co-host of the weekly radio program It's Just Politics . My son Nevon Clark has worked at Ravens Club, in downtown Ann Arbor, since they first opened. I'm really proud of both of them, and love having them close by. BZ: You've become involved in Compassionate and Nonviolent Communication. Start off by telling us what is Nonviolent Communication (NVC), and who was Marshall Rosenberg? Lisa Gottlieb: Nonviolent Communication, also known more informally as Compassionate Communication, is a way of connecting with oneself and others with a primary focus on empathy, interconnectedness, and honest self-expression in order to reduce conflict and increase affiliation and connection. NVC consciousness includes the foundational beliefs that all people's needs matter, and conflict and disagreements can be solved through deep listening, awareness of needs, compassionate understanding and sharing authentically. Although it is often considered a form of communication that works at a personal and interpersonal level, there is also an important aspect of NVC that encourages reduction of conflict on a much larger scale, from businesses and institutions to global conflicts. NVC was created by Dr. Marshall Rosenberg, who, as a teenager, moved to Detroit a week before the 1948 race riots. He was deeply motivated to look for peacemaking solutions, and earned a PhD in psychology in the 1960s. Eventually his work and studies, including an interest in Buddhism, led to the principles of NVC, and he founded the Center for Nonviolent Communication, where he was the director of Educational Services and was an entertaining and effective teacher for thousands of people over the years. Dr. Rosenberg passed away in February of this year. Currently, NVC has an international presence, with hundreds of certified NVC trainers and practitioners across the planet. BZ: You mentioned to me that NVC met many needs for you, for a form of communication that spoke to your intellect and your heart. How did you first get involved, and did it call out to you right away? Lisa Gottlieb: The foundational aspect of NVC that brings the focus to empathetic listening--holding a space for our own, and someone else's experience without judgment or evaluation, is very powerful. I first was introduced to NVC by my former husband about a year after we separated, and I was moved by how our communication changed in ways that were very healing for both of us after we ended our marriage. I was curious about how he was communicating with me, and I resonated so deeply with the empathetic quality of our conversations that I immediately read Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life, written by Dr. Rosenberg. That was it. I was really hooked. Because NVC is less a technique and more a practice of connecting empathetically to support interconnectedness, build connection, and create authentic relationships, I have found it to be a powerful agent for personal growth, conflict resolution, and living with more awareness and grace. Lisa Gottlieb on Compassionate and Nonviolent Communication NVC (Nonviolent Communication) has offered me a profound sense of freedom, authenticity, and the potential for deep connection in my relationships.I first was introduced to NVC by my former husband about a year after we separated.... I was curious about how he was communicating with me, and I resonated so deeply with the empathetic quality of our conversations that I immediately read Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life , written by Dr. Marshall Rosenberg. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 43 BZ: There had already been some NVC activities going on in Ann Arbor? Lisa Gottlieb: Yes, when I looked around Ann Arbor to see what was happening with NVC, I found a practice group that had been operating for a while, and a few people who were invested in NVC consciousness. I wanted more though. I wanted some intensive training and I was looking for ways to learn NVC, while building a strong, vibrant, local NVC community. BZ: So, in 2014, you brought NVC here in a fresh way. What kind of response did you get? Lisa Gottlieb: My first NVC training was in Columbus, Ohio, where I met Jeff Brown, an experienced and skilled certified trainer, and the director of the non-profit Compassionate Communication of Central Ohio. His natural abilities and enthusiasm for NVC resonated with me, and after I returned home, I contacted Brown and expressed my interest in bringing him to Ann Arbor to lead a beginning NVC workshop. Brown, who has lead hundreds of workshops and trainings all over the world, was on for it, and together we planned a two day workshop geared towards those new to NVC. We had over 70 people attend, and ended up with a waiting list. It was clear to both of us that Ann Arbor was alive with interest, and we were pleased with the success of the workshop. This was in May of 2014. That summer, I attended a residential NVC trainer-focused retreat in Northern California. Brown was one of the trainers, along with Francois Beausoleil and Miki Kashtan; all three are very experienced, well respected, effective and engaging teachers. The four of us sat down together and started brainstorming about a year-long intensive NVC pilot program in Ann Arbor. Brown and Beausoleil were committed to leading it, and I agreed to be the local host and training assistant. At that point I decided to start on the path of becoming an NVC certified trainer. The year long program launched in February 2015 with over 35 participants, coming from Michigan and half a dozen other states. I'm thrilled with how quickly NVC is growing in SE Michigan. BZ: How does NVC weave together the interpersonal and the global? Lisa Gottlieb: NVC reminds me of my study of Kripalu yoga, and other mind-body and ancient wisdom traditions and teachings. We start at the personal level and work outward in ever growing circles. We explore our own feelings, longings and needs. Dr. Rosenberg used to say NVC is essentially an inside job. We give ourselves empathy and acceptance, and we ask others to help us with empathetic responses and warm support. The circle radiates outward from self. We learn to connect with others in the same way we connect with self, practicing empathy, and searching for connection. The circle continues to radiate out into the world. BZ: You mentioned to me that NVC isn't just a technique but a heart-opening practice. Please elaborate. Lisa Gottlieb: Until we can open our hearts to understand and accept ourselves and others, techniques and strategies to attempt to get what we want simply won't be effective. The words and communication techniques ring hollow. With NVC consciousness, we don't have to agree or align with someone else's position to understand them and work towards understanding their experience. Problem solving and solutions come when authentic connection happens. Rosenberg said, \"Every act of violence is an attempt to meet an unmet need.\" If we are able to look at our own actions and behavior, our own drives, as well as those of others through this lens, through the lens of compassionate understanding, we can begin to connect in a way that makes room for honest self-expression, and the generosity of spirit that comes from our soft and undefended hearts. I like to point out that it isn't necessary to agree with someone to feel empathy for them and their beliefs or actions. If we operate from the idea that we are all trying to have our needs met, and we can understand what those needs might be, we can begin to really see another person for all they are, including their vulnerability, their losses, their sense of hopelessness or despair. When we are regarding who they are with compassion, our own hearts soften, and we can begin to find our way forward. Of course, sometimes we can do our best, and we aren't successful. There are situations where beliefs and actions are so repulsive and horrific that it isn't possible to get to empathy, and, sometimes the people with whom we interact are just too difficult for us. Yet, most of the time, in our day to day lives, we can walk that path of finding connection and figure out solutions. This is true even if the other person we may be communicating with doesn't utilize NVC, or even know of its existence. As long as I can continue to touch into empathy for the other person, as well as empathy for myself (especially if the interaction creates discomfort, anxiety or stress) there is the potential for connection and change. BZ: You've said to me that an important aspect of NVC consciousness is 'celebration and mourning'. Please say more.Lisa Gottlieb: Most of us have been raised in a culture of reward and punishment. We do something \"good\", and we are praised; we do something \"bad\" and we are blamed and punished. We're trained early on to respond to the external judgements of others to feel safe and included. Our family systems and culture form who we are based on this external evaluation of our worth. This is deeply ingrained in most of us, and we learn to make decisions based on pleasing others and being rewarded, or avoiding blame, shame and punishment. This tends to move us away from touching in to what is alive for us, and often prevents our connection with our own individual needs. We learn to feel satisfied or dissatisfied with ourselves through the eyes of other people and their evaluations and judgments of us. In NVC, we practice a different approach. When we meet our own - and other people's needs - we consciously celebrate the specifics of the communication or action, and when we don't, we consciously mourn what wasn't effective, and take responsibility for our part, while exploring more effective ways to improve for the future. Here's a way to look at this concept in practical terms. Next time you think or say something or someone is \"awesome\", or \"terrible\", perhaps take a moment and consider the specifics of it. Is it awesome because it fills you with happiness, or it inspires you? Is it terrible because you notice sadness, disappointment or even rage associated it with it? When we tune in to our feelings, instead of evaluating what someone else does or doesn't do, we can more easily connect with what needs are being met, or unmet in relation to our evaluative thinking. Once we know our needs, and the needs of others, we can live more fully and with more attention to discover what moves us, pleases us, or hurts us. We can do this instead of blaming or praising others from an external place of judgement. Along with learning and practicing empathy, learning how to touch into our needs and the needs of others is a fundamental aspect of NVC consciousness. BZ: What is it about NVC that has most deeply spoken to you? And what do you believe that it offers that isn't offered by other tools for interpersonal communication? Lisa Gottlieb: NVC has offered me a profound sense of freedom, authenticity, and the potential for deep connection in my relationships. It also has been a powerful tool in deepening my ability to help build connection between people who might otherwise be lost in conflict and unhappiness. It is the foundational parts of NVC consciousness that make it different from other forms of communication I've learned previously, including deep empathetic listening to self and others, the belief that we are all connected to each other, and that we thrive when all needs matter. B Z: What's next for NVC in Ann Arbor? Lisa Gottlieb: I've recently formed Compassionate Communication of Ann Arbor (CCAA), with the support of Jeff Brown, and Compassionate Communication of Central Ohio as our non-profit sponsor. We have a website and a Facebook page that shares information about NVC happenings in the Ann Arbor area. I'm working towards Ann Arbor being a hub of NVC, and CCAA becoming a group that supports and grows the NVC community in our area. There are currently a number of people in the community leading practice groups and teaching classes and workshops. As part of my certification process, I am teaching beginning NVC workshops, as well as offering coaching for individuals, couples and small businesses. As the year-long program wraps up in November, there are plans for more workshops and classes for those new to NVC, as well as for people who want to deepen their learning and practice. BZ: Anything else you'd like to tell us about NVC, Lisa? Lisa Gottlieb: NVC consciousness is a practice that has tremendous spaciousness and acceptance for anyone interested in it to start from wherever they are in their search for an improved relationship with themselves and others, and to gain a sense of hope about the future of our planet. By simply learning to gently make small changes in how we engage with ourselves and others, we can create measurable changes in improving our happiness and the happiness of those around us. I encourage anyone with curiosity about NVC to read a book, go online and check it out, or look into a locally offered workshop or class.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 44 Drought, poverty, worker exploitation. The poisoning of the air, ground water, and soil. These are just a few of the crises facing our world today. We see them everywhere and they seem overwhelming. What can the average person \u2014 people like us \u2014 do to combat them? We can start with a decision we make every morning: what we choose to wear. The way Americans view clothing has changed dramatically over the past hundred years. One need only look at the size of the closets of the average home built in the 1940s compared with modern construction to see this. The lack of a walk-in closet is a deal breaker for many homebuyers nowadays, and the popularity of shoe closets is on the rise. An entire closet devoted just to shoes would have been virtually unthinkable to the average American fifty years ago. Much of what we buy now is what is known as \"fast fashion,\" or clothing that is designed and manufactured quickly so that consumers may buy the \"current trends\" immediately. Fast fashion is cheap \u2014 sometimes ridiculously so \u2014 allowing even lower income households to keep up. Examples of fast fashion retailers include Wal-Mart, Meijer, Target, Kohl's, and just about every clothing store you will find at shopping malls like Briarwood in Ann Arbor, including H&M (more on them later). In the book Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion (Portfolio, 2013), author Elizabeth L. Cline points out that \"Americans spend more money on eating out in restaurants every year than they do on clothes.\" She then postulates: \"It's not that we can't pay more... we just don't see any reason to,\" adding \"with the same or similar products available at so many different stores, we presume whoever offers us the lowest price is being fair and we give them our business.\" So, who is responsible for our addiction to good deals and cheap clothes? We are. Who fuels the fashion industry that exploits workers and cuts corners in order to lower prices of an increasingly inferior product? We do. Every day. With our purchases, we consumers vote on which fabrics we prefer our clothing to be made from, what quality of garment we find acceptable, and at what prices we are willing to purchase them. Consumers determine the market, not manufacturers. Consumers demanded a cheaper product, and they were answered. At what cost? Yes, clothing is sold for cheaper prices today than it was fifteen years ago, but it's made so cheaply that the average manufacturer only expects a lifespan of two months for a woman's top. But who cares when that top only cost $8? What a deal! Michigan's state minimum wage is $8.15. You can be sure that with prices this low, the countless number of people who helped make that $8 shirt were not being paid minimum wage. Looking again at Cline, we learn that \"raw materials account for 25 to 50 percent of the cost of producing an item of clothing, while labor ranges from 20 to 40 percent.\" This is why very little clothing is made in the United States (Nike shoes, hardly a cheap brand, have never been made here), and why many of the pieces are manufactured by companies that exploit their workers by ignoring labor laws, the minimum wage, and/or requiring their laborers to work incredible hours to meet all-but-impossible production goals. American garment workers who do earn minimum wage make approximately 38 times their Bangladeshi counterparts. In order to keep costs low \u2014 as we consumers insist they must \u2014 it just makes sense to move operations overseas. Tragically, some workers are not being compensated at all for their labor. In early 2014, the Target Corporation in particular was under fire from international anti-slavery group Walk Free for using cotton grown in Uzbekistan where citizens are forced by the government to harvest cotton. With zero percent labor cost, the price to consumers drops even lower. Though workers abroad may be paid less than they would be in the U.S., this does not necessarily mean they are being exploited. After all, it does make some sense to weave fabric from locally grown plants (cotton, bamboo, and so on). Many smaller clothing companies, in fact, choose to keep their costs down by importing cloth made overseas and assembling their items here because most overseas factories will only take on especially large orders. Regardless of how the company chooses to operate, at every step of the process is the opportunity to treat laborers fairly with adequate breaks and fair pay here in the U.S. and abroad. Now let's look at the environmental cost to our fast fashion addiction. Those sewing machines aren't conjuring cotton out of thin air, after all. To quote Ecouterre, a website whose \"mission is to inform, inspire, and encourage innovation\" in the global fashion industry: \"To ignore the apparel industry's environmental and social impact would be negligent, not to mention foolhardy.\" Ecouterre also points out that \"$2 billion of hazardous pesticides are used every year to grow cotton \u2014 more than any other agricultural crop.\" That means more chemicals are being put into our clothing than into our food. Many Americans are worried about the pesticides that show up in our food supply. We wear our clothes countless hours more than we spend eating. Though many people enjoy the breathability of garments made from natural fiber, the plants these fabrics come from, like cotton, bamboo, and hemp, are quite thirsty! They also tend to get treated with a hefty amount of pesticides. Rayon, another popular clothing material, one that you may find in fair trade stores, comes from wood pulp, and contributes to global deforestation. In order to avoid issues of water-usage, pesticides, slave labor in the fields, and so on, many sustainable or eco fashion followers prefer to wear garments made of nylon, spandex, acetate, acrylic, and polyester, all of which are durable, man-made products that can be made into a wide variety of textures and tend to hold their colors better than their plant-based counterparts. Greta Eagan, sustainable fashion blogger and author of Wear No Evil: How to Change the World with Your Wardrobe (Running Press, 2014), does caution that such fabrics may contain Perfluorinated Compounds, or PFCs, which are cancer-causing and can leech into our ground water and soil, thus it is recommended that these garments be washed at least three times before being worn. This isn't all as dire as it may sound. There are solutions. Cotton, for example, can be grown organically. Eagan claims that organic and fair trade farming practices can actually reduce the amount of water required to grow cotton by 60 percent. It can also be bought and sold under fair trade conditions. As for rayon, the Canadian forest conservation nonprofit group Canopy has launched Fashion Loved By Forest, which aims to end the fashion industry's involvement in deforestation by asking companies to commit to sustainably sourced fibers rather than sourcing from ancient trees and rain forests. So far a number of big names have hopped on board, such as Levi Strauss & Co., Patagonia, and international fast fashion guru H&M. There's that name again. In case you haven't heard of H&M, they are a multinational retail company based in Sweden that specializes in the newest and coolest clothes. With stores in 55 countries around the globe, H&M is the second largest clothing retailer in the world, and they are known for both their hip styles and reasonable The Eco-Friendly Wardrobe ~ Why and How to Make the Shift to Sustainable Fashion By Crysta Coburn Much of what we buy now is what is known as \"fast fashion,\" or clothing that is designed and manufactured quickly so that consumers may buy the \"current trends\" immediately. ... the average manufacturer only expects a lifespan of two months for a woman's top. American garment workers who do earn minimum wage make approximately 38 times their Bangladeshi counterparts. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 45 prices. Depending on the style, a pair of women's jeans can be purchased for as little as $10 and as high as $50. (Remember, Michigan's minimum wage is $8.15.) In H&M's case, the company has shown itself to be committed to inexpensive products as well as a more sustainable future. They've already allied themselves with the Fashion Loved By Forest campaign. Recently, they also launched the Garment Collecting program in stores around the world, including right here in Ann Arbor at the Briarwood Mall. Every customer who brings unwanted clothing back to the store to be collected in bins by the registers will receive a discount on their new clothing purchases. According to H&M's website, there are three ways to repurpose the unwanted garments: rewear (second-hand), reuse (or repurpose), and recycle. It turns out that natural fibers, in addition to being biodegradable, can be recycled. Author Greta Eagan explains that natural fiber clothing \" can either be shredded back to their fiber state and respun into a repurposed yarn (typically with added virgin fiber for strength) and woven or knitted into a new fabric, or they can be down-cycled into something else (like stuffing for a dog bed or insulation). \" H&M also claims that \"of the thousands of tonnes of textiles thrown away every year, 95% could be re-worn or recycled.\" Their goal as a company is to \"reduce waste and create fashion in a closed loop.\" H&M promotes itself as a conscious company and details many of its sustainability and fair wage goals on its website. Even so, it is still fast fashion. So what do we do? In her various writing on eco fashion, Eagan tries to find the balance between the current reality of America's fast fashion addiction and a commitment to sustainability. She proposes a system called the Integrity Index, comprised of sixteen points. When considering purchasing an item of clothing, ask yourself: 1) does it use natural/low impact dyes? 2) is it made from natural fibers? 3) organic? 4) fair trade? 5) recycled/upcycled? 6) 9) zero waste? 10) convertible? 11) vegan? 12) have a low water footprint? 13) transparent company model/sourcing? 14) cradle to cradle? 15) slow fashion? and 16) stylish? Eagan especially stresses a garment's style, asserting that if it doesn't fit or flatter you, don't bother. (Sage advice.) Using that as your base, she then advises everyone to choose three of the most personally important items from the list (rather than memorizing all sixteen) and choosing their clothes with these criteria in mind. Be as picky as you want. Maybe a shirt is stylish, donates 10 percent of the proceeds to charity, but is a cotton/polyester blend. Whether or not that is acceptable is up to the person considering the purchase. Are some of these considerations going to factor into the price? Yes, which is why items like second-hand and recycled are included in the list. Also, items that are convertible, or serve more than one purpose, are especially helpful in extending one's wardrobe. Between growing consumer consciousness and industry response, the future of eco fashion looks bright. The biggest hurdle is convincing people to change how they view clothes and adjust their shopping habits. Eagan's guidelines help, but we need to go further. We need to accept that we get what we pay for; and for good quality, ethically-sourced clothing, we need to pay a little more. No more impulse buying just because it's a good deal. Plan ahead. Take stock of what is already in the closet before heading to the store. When shopping at places like H&M or a thrift shop, bring along old clothes to donate \u2014 don't just throw them away. Check websites like Ecouterre and Eco Fashion World that keep lists of designers and companies who create sustainable clothing. And spread the word! If you find a great organic cotton dress, tell people. When you see fair trade slacks, let all of your buddies know. Each one of us can choose to make the difference. Every day.

It's unexpected, both in subject and design, and frequently demands a second look. That's perfectly fine with artist Anne Mondro, an associate professor at the Penny W.

Her art focuses on the human body, or to be more specific \u2014 on humanity.\"I employ metaphors all the time in my work,\" she said. \"For a long time now my work has been focused on art and the human body, in all ways, in our relationship with ourselves, with others, both physical and metaphorical.\" For Mondro, a native of Taylor, Michigan, art is not only a method of self-expression, but of processing personal experiences, keeping them close and giving them value. Although she started out studying jewelry making and metalsmithing at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, her focus shifted when she traveled to Kent State University in Ohio to earn her Master of Fine Arts. Her grandfather, back in Detroit, contracted cancer.\"My experience of family illness began to come into my work,\" Mondro recalled. \"My grandfather was dying of cancer, so I would have this commute to Detroit, and most of my time was spent reflecting.\" \"As I was driving, I would reflect on the experiences my family was going through as a result of my grandfather's illness ... and I was thinking how a patient is treated as a specimen, rather than a whole being. It was like a person becomes an object \u2014 a region \u2014 rather than a whole person. And that experience started coming into my studio, and the work became very personal.\" The result? Her thesis, \" Sarcinae de Corpus ,\" or \"Baggage of the Body\" \u2014 an assortment of sculptural pieces that resembled old-time doctor bags.\"I actually called them 'medical bags,'\" Mondro said. \"And you would open them up and inside would be a representation of the region of the body affected by an illness. The bags became a metaphor for the baggage we carry when someone is ill.\" \"In my case, I wasn't present when my grandfather was ill, so I wasn't really contributing, and yet, there was this whole emphasis on living my own life, and I was By Diane Majeske Photos by Tobi Hollander a r t i c l e c o n t i n u e d o n p a g e 5 0 The ART of Anne MondroBEING HUMAN:The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 49 \"Intertwine\" shows two anatomically correct hearts, connected and crocheted from copper wire, molded from one piece. \"INTERTWINE\" Tinned copper wire,2012 \"I use wire for a variety of reasons \u2014 some of it is structural, but also, I've come to see it as a metaphor for how we need to protect our hearts and protect our partners, and I've been using it as a metaphor for strength and protection \u2014 as well as fragility.

I was thinking about how the whole family dynamic changes when someone is ill, how your role changes \u2014 relationships are tested, and you find strength in unexpected areas.\" Mondro pauses a moment, lost in thought. \"I think when you lose a loved one, sometimes you kind of sweep things under the rug, or you think, 'I'm fine.' Art became a way for me to process the experiences, to add value to them. Because it's these experiences, really, that make us who we are.\" AN ARTIST IN THE COMMUNITY Though Mondro's art often focuses on serious, sometimes dark topics, she is anything but maudlin. She has an easy smile, often punctuating her words with graceful hand gestures, and is quick to laugh \u2014 even at herself. \"I don't want to come off like I had a terrible, dark childhood or anything,\" she said. \"I had a wonderful childhood \u2014 it was great.\" She notes how her parents supported her artistic endeavors, how she was close to her grandparents. She shrugs slightly and shakes her head. \"I just developed this real interest in science and anatomy and art.\" In fact, she was sure that if she found art to be healing, others would as well. She came to U-M in 2003, and in 2006, she developed a community engagement course, partnering with the University's Geriatrics Center. The course, titled Retaining Identity: The Role of Creativity in the Healthcare Setting, focused on the benefits of creativity as a positive distraction from pain. \"Creativity helps retain who you are beyond your illness,\" she said. \"When you're in the hospital, you lose a lot of your independence; this is an opportunity to have some say in an activity, or a part of your day. Creativity alleviates stress, it gets you focused on something else. It's a chance to play and use your imagination, which is hard to come by when you're in the hospital. It's a chance to tell your story.\" That course led to an ongoing collaboration with the Geriatrics Center, one that continues today. Mondro is currently working with the Geriatrics' Silver Clubs, which offer social programs for adults with mild to moderate memory loss. Mondro developed an interdisciplinary course that pairs students with adults at the centers. During the course, titled Memory, Aging & Expressive Arts, the adult and student work together, collaborating on an art project. \"The course is designed to develop student sensitivity and awareness,\" she said. \"We use creativity as the main tool to connect with the community and build intergenerational relationships. The students receive a holistic perspective on aging from professors who contribute to the course, and then the student works one-on-one with an adult for 12 weeks, exploring the arts.\" Elaine Reed, facilitator for the Silver Club Programs, is the co-instructor of the course and an artist-in-residence at the U-M Hospital. She's also a longtime friend and fan of Mondro. \"Anne is incredibly nurturing and patient and creative \u2014 and kind of groundbreaking, actually,\" she said. \"This is a safe environment; it's an incredibly creative environment. It isn't a typical class. Here the student and the club members use expressive therapies to enjoy each other's company and not focus on the disease.\" \"The focus is on what the member can do and on the enjoyment ... they've composed music, they painted, they've even made short documentaries. They impact each other's lives. It's amazing.\"ANNE MONDRO c o n t i n u e d f r o m p a g e 4 8The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 50 Breathe reflects the emotional and physical challenges of illness and disease.

That course led to an ongoing collaboration with the Geriatrics Center, one that continues today.Mondro's art, says Reed, is equally fascinating. \"Anne's artwork uses unexpected imagery and materials to convey ideas about art in the healthcare field,\" she said. \"Her use of crocheted heavy-strength metal to produce delicate anatomical specimens invites you to look deep into the sculptures with wonder.\" IN THE STUDIO Of course, Mondro isn't always teaching. When she's alone, she creates. She sculpts \u2014 wire hearts, hearts with feathers, digital images of hearts or lungs. Art \u2014 art and the body. One sculpture, \"Intertwine,\" shows two anatomically correct hearts, connected and crocheted from copper wire, molded from one piece. \"The work I do with the adults with memory loss very much affects my work,\" she admitted. \"I feel like I've told my own story, and I really think deeply about the stories that are shared with me by caregivers and their partners, and that relationship. That's what this represents.\" Her fingers trace a photo of the image. \"I use wire for a variety of reasons \u2014 some of it is structural, but also, I've come to see it as a metaphor for how we need to protect our hearts and protect our partners, and I've been using it as a metaphor for strength and protection \u2014 as well as fragility. Why do we wear armor? Because we're vulnerable to being hurt.\" In contrast to poetic reflection, the actual process of creating the sculpture is methodical, almost therapeutic, for Mondro. \"You have to focus,\" she said. \"It's a way to process through my hands, if that makes sense. I work things out technically as well as emotionally.\" And while she can create quickly, the actual research takes far longer.\"I can create in just a few months,\" she said. \"But those hearts, for instance, they took me a good year to research. I had to go to U-M's anatomy lab to look at actual hearts and had to learn how to structurally make the piece. It's from one strand that is interlocking loops. It takes a lot of thinking about the technique and the construction ... I sit in my studio and work it out.\" And there's more to come \u2014 a larger installation of intertwined hearts, based on the stories of 15 couples she's worked with for more than a year. What comes after that, she's not sure. But she knows it will focus on the struggles of the body. \"Why do I focus on the body?\" she mused. \"I don't know ... I focus on the heart a lot, since I feel like it's so much a part of our life on many levels. And art and healthcare, I think that just came from my upbringing, from having such a connection and a wonderful rapport with my grandparents and with older adults. It's just always been an interest of mine, and I can see it moving from contemplative to something more into advocacy. How? I don't know yet.\" She laughs. \"Art, life. It's always a work in progress, right?\" ### To see more of Mondro's artwork, visit www.annemondro.com.

September 18 - 20The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 52 Kate Soper came of age in the early 1960s. She is part of the generation that ushered in a new wave of women. She is a quiet but active feminist. In certain respects, she followed a traditional path. She is married. She has children. But early in life, she decided that while she might make a home, she would not be \"just a housewife.\" She has balanced the personal and professional in a way that augurs a new standard for women. True, earlier pioneer women forged roads that most women (and men) could hardly imagine possible. There are women of Kate's generation who are daughters of those pioneering women. But they are few, and Kate was not among them. Still, she grew up determined to have the kind of independence and professional freedom enjoyed by most men and few women of that era. Her decision was fortified by changing trends. Women began realizing ambitions that took them far from hearth and home. Many of these women, Kate included, became role models for their children. After 45 years in several professions, Kate recently retired. As an attorney, she devoted a considerable amount of her time to the still nascent Women Lawyers Association of Michigan (WLAM), a source of support and mentorship for women lawyers. Within the organization, she focused on issues of gender equity. In her own practice, she did insurance defense work and family law. Later, as a University of Michigan administrator, she held positions that allowed her to help countless students and faculty members. Her six U-M posts included Assistant Provost, Assistant Dean of LS&A, and Director of the Dual Career Program at the Medical School and the College of Engineering. Since retiring, she has turned to writing. Her 2013 book, Steps Out of Time: One Woman's Journey on the Camino (Stellaire Press), is based on the journal she kept in June of 2002 during her 34-day, 500-mile trek across northern Spain. The book is both a travelogue and a meditation on time and meaning. It quickly sold out its first printing. Public readings draw standing-room-only crowds. Many who thought they knew Kate were amazed to read of her travels. Many were surprised to discover her passion for physical challenge, her love of adventure, the hardiness that kept her going, and the spiritual seeking that deepened the experience, both during and after the Camino. The limpid prose of Steps Out of Time is marked by insights into solitude, time, and the rewards of contemplation. The book, published under her full name, Katherine B. Soper, includes comic episodes along with graphic descriptions of blisters and their remedies. In a chapter called \"Being, Just Being,\" she writes about the physical trials of the journey.What Propels a Journey? The Peripatetic Career of Kate Soper ~ Linguist, Lawyer, Feminist, Adventurer, Author By Rachel Urist Photos by Tobi HollanderKate Soper is fond of this passage from Henry David Thoreau's Walking: \"...if you have paid your debts, and made your will, and settled all your affairs, and are a free man, then you are ready for a walk.\" Kate Soper came of age in the early 1960s. She is part of the generation that ushered in a new wave of women. She is a quiet but active feminist.[Her book] is based on the journal she kept in June of 2002 during her 34-day, 500-mile trek across northern Spain.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 53 ...the pain is as real as the moments of peace and beauty\u2014and probably as necessary. The pain, I am discovering, grabs my attention in a way that forces me to set aside petty cares and concerns and puts me in touch with a more visceral reality, making me aware of my body in a way that clears my mind. When I am conscious of the pain, I am truly present. ...A Buddhist friend once urged me to think about the difference between pain and suffering. This was probably good advice. ...Later, I heard a saying attributed to professional bicycle racers that helped me understand: pain is inevitable, suffering is optional. When I began my journey to Santiago, I experienced pain and I suffered. Now, toward the end of my journey, I still experience pain, but most of the time I walk through it. I am learning to be in the space which is mine. Being, just being. A very Buddhist concept. In a chapter called \"Growing Understandings,\" she contemplates the mental effort required to rethink the role of time, which once seemed such a basic concept. Time on the Camino is tied to the ancient rhythms of the sun and not the relentless ticking of my watch. Sometimes hours slip by at a speed that makes my head spin; other times each minute seems to last an eternity. Moments can be glorious or grueling, but I am present for them. And they pass. The sun appears every morning. Many who knew Kate only as an attorney will be further surprised to learn that Kate's legal career was her second calling. Before attending law school, she was a professor of French, first at Boise State. She loved this job, both for the fun of teaching students about a culture and language she loved and because her schedule allowed her to hit the ski slopes most afternoons from the day the local ski area opened in the fall until the day it closed in the spring. She put her first husband through law school at the University of Colorado, where she earned her Ph.D. and was a teaching assistant during graduate school. (Her doctoral dissertation was a study of the images of women in the poetry of Guillaume Apollinaire.) But after seven years, the marriage ended, and she accepted a position at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, teaching French and Spanish. \"It was the only state I hadn't visited,\" she explained, \"and I needed to get far away from the people who knew me as part of a couple.\" At age 31, Kate applied to law school. Actually, she applied to six law schools and was accepted by each. Her father persuaded her that the University of Michigan would be the best springboard for her legal career. While she loved languages and had taught English in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, and in Bordeaux, France, as well as French in Boulder, Colorado; Utica, New York; and Boise, Idaho, she was ready for a change. The summer before law school, she landed a job as a line-walker supervisor on the Alyeska Pipeline. \"It was the best job I ever had,\" Kate said. Not only did it pay for the first year of law school, it also allowed her to enjoy the pristine landscape of Alaska, north of the Arctic Circle, and to have unscheduled time for the first time in her adult life. Her various responsibilities included rescuing her crew, most of whom were men, from bears. When a worker saw a bear, he or she would climb up to safety on a pipeline support's cross-beam, call in the problem, and wait for Kate. Though she had more serious \"weapons\" at hand (an air horn and M-80 firecrackers \u2014 now illegal in the U.S.), most of the time, she'd drive up in her truck, honk her horn, and the bear would run away. Kate Soper's Steps Out of Time: One Woman's Journey on the Camino got an honorable mention in the Writer's Digest 2014 awards, and a silver medal in the Independent Publishers 2014 awards. Here are a judge's comments for the 22nd Annual Writer's Digest Self-Published Book Awards. \"It is challenging to summarize in a few lines the richness of the bonding readers are sure to enjoy with Steps Out of Time. While the narratives of other pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela are available in an array of languages, Soper stands out as a unique and rewarding guide. An ardent francophone, she set out on foot from Bayonne, France, and crossed the border into Spain. This author will win the heart of every other female armchair traveler who yearns to break free and achieve a sense of self. Soper shares details that win our admiration, like her husband's anger when he realized she was going to make good on her plans to leave him for forty days in order to walk across Spain. (He redeems himself at the conclusion with words and actions that demonstrate why Soper adores him!) Soper is a careful planner and note taker, an observant traveler, and a humble spirit. I loved enjoying the journey with her, and I appreciated her daily struggle over whether to choose refugios, hotels or paradores. She never whitewashes the journey or makes it sound more romantic than it really is. Indeed, there are discomforts and dangers that she carefully underlines, never forgetting to allow the reader to see the roots of the pilgrimage that date back to the Middle Ages. Soper's travel narrative stands out for the quality and detail of her descriptive and narrative writing, as well as the interest level of her reflections, which will be given high marks by intelligent readers. I liked the inclusion of photographs of traveling companions and places. I also appreciated the historical details and anecdotes and the travelers' tips that are set off in boxes. Soper seems to have put as much care into her book as she did, indeed, into her pilgrimage. She imbued both works with dignity and relevance in a straightforward, honest manner that will not be lost on the reader. I tip my hat to a formidable traveler/writer.\" The limpid prose of Steps Out of Time is marked by insights into solitude, time, and the rewards of contemplation.

(The path is made walking.) The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 55 The irony of the situation was not lost on Kate. She was hired for this job after enrolling in a weekend course on new gender equity laws that was offered in Fairbanks by the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). She turned out to be the only woman in the class. The men were there to learn more about these laws in the hope that they could avoid hiring women on the pipeline project. When they realized this was no longer possible, they offered Kate a line-walker supervisor position, apparently figuring that the devil you know is better than the one you don't. Kate had proved her mettle in other ways, too. Early in her Alaska tenure, she took a winter survival class. The group consisted of three women and thirteen men, all in their twenties and thirties. For the final exam, they were air-lifted to a frozen lake in the shadow of Denali for what was supposed to be a four day camping trip in the Alaskan wilderness. During the day, they explored the back country on cross country skis. The snow was so deep that if you fell and put your pole in the snow to get up, it just kept going down. One member of the group, a helicopter pilot (and poet!), insisted that Kate take her turn setting the course and breaking trail. He talked about the freedom of making bold choices, of forging ahead, of being first. She still remembers his advice to her: \"Don't be afraid. You must be willing to make mistakes. I've made plenty and from every mistake, I learned something. It's part of being human and it's how you grow.\" From that experience Kate learned that one needs emotional fortitude as well as physical strength to lead the pack. The skiing was hard. But it was beautiful, too. \"It felt like I was alone in the world in this vast snowfield; the power of the natural world was overwhelming but so was the feeling of possibility,\" she recalled. \"It was unbelievably moving and gorgeous.\" She went on: The day the plane was supposed to pick us up, a storm came in. The plane was delayed\u2014by ten days. They couldn't come get us so we spent our days in a small wall tent. There was no radio contact and nothing to do so we spent the days telling our life stories. Who knows how much of them were true, but it was fascinating! We strung ropes between the wall tent and the little pup tents we slept in and the latrine, so we wouldn't get lost in the whiteout. I didn't think we were going to die, but we could have. It never got even close to zero degrees. At night, it might be thirty below. We wore layers, two of everything, even two sleeping bags, to keep warm. We had a potbelly stove in the wall tent for heat and fire for cooking, but by the time the storm broke, we were down to two slices of bread per person per day and were living off \"bread soup.\" We were so relieved when the storm finally broke that nobody minded all the hard work of packing down the snow with our skis to make a runway.

Continued on page 56 Photos from the Alyeska PipelineThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 56 For many, such an experience would signal the end of adventures. Not for Kate. \"It whet my appetite,\" she said. \"I loved winter camping.\" While stranded, the companions vowed to take a group photo if they were rescued (\"We were feeling rather dramatic and anxious by then,\" she said) and promised to hang the picture in their offices. The group is no longer in touch, but Kate still sees them every day, in the photo. Since that episode, Kate has forged new paths in other areas. In the once male- dominated field of law, she became a respected voice for WLAM. In the early 90's, when Kate was president of the local chapter, she spearheaded the Date Rape Awareness Community Service Program and helped script the role-playing scenarios that were presented in area high schools. Their efforts were cutting edge. Working with other WLAM role models \u2014 Naomi Woloshin, Zena Zumeta, Sally Fink, Molly Reno \u2014 to raise consciousness and address gender equity issues, Kate's initiatives were ahead of their time. This was long before \"No means No.\" It was before \"date rape\" was common parlance. Each presentation of role-played encounters between a boy and a girl was followed by discussion, which drove home the message. What were the legal ramifications of teenage sex? When could outsiders step in and legally strip young people of their perceived autonomy? Most teens were astonished to learn that something called \"statutory rape\" was on the books. It was a shocking concept. That their actions could be deemed crimes, when they thought their behavior was private and consensual, was sobering. Many students said the exercise helped them think a little harder about their understanding of consent in this context. WLAM member Molly Reno, who helped create some of the date rape scenarios, remembers that students sat in rapt attention for these presentations. Today such programs are widespread in corporate, academic, and medical settings. Many use professional actors. These programs operate as teaching tools for faculty and staff, with presentations of difficult scenarios that have flummoxed those in power. When WLAM's date rape program was active, the organization's members (along with male volunteers for the boys' roles) did the role-playing. One of Kate's former colleagues pointed out that while it may seem odd for lawyers to double as actors, consider that lawyers who litigate do a fair amount of role-playing with their clients to prepare them for the often daunting legal processes of taking depositions and testifying at trial. Mediators, too, find it helpful to role-play with clients, especially when the disputes involve private matters, when clients feel vulnerable and uneasy. The date rape initiative contributed to Kate's receiving the 1992 Mary E. Foster Award \u2014 \"for her contributions to the advancement of women in law and women in general.\" According to Molly Reno, \"Kate's leadership had us all looking more at social justice issues.\" She adds that WLAM's mission was always twofold: 1) to promote social justice by using legal skills to benefit all women in society, and 2) to provide emotional support through mentoring, networking, and offering legal support to women lawyers. Mary Elizabeth Foster, for whom the award is named, was the first woman to practice law in Ann Arbor. She graduated (with high honors) from U-M's law school The Peripatetic Career of Kate Soper Continued from page 55 \"...by the time the storm broke, we were down to two slices of bread per person per day and were living off 'bread soup.'\" -Kate Soper recalling her wilderness survival class \"It felt like I was alone in the world in this vast snowfield; the power of the natural world was overwhelming but so was the feeling of possibility.\" - Kate Soper, on skiing in the shadows of Denali Photos from The Alaskan Winter Survival ClassThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 57 in 1876 and set up shop in her home on Catherine Street. Kate joined a prestigious roster when she won the prize. In telling me about it, she exclaimed: \"I was so incredibly honored to be on the same list as Jean King!\" Jean Ledwith King, as I later learned, was a more recent legend in Michigan's history of legal matriarchs. In 1965, she entered U-M's law school. Upon graduation, she challenged the status quo. She was among the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus, helped extend Title IX to cover sports in schools, and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1984, which saw the nomination of Geraldine Ferraro for vice president. Like many of her colleagues, Kate was influenced by the wave of feminist writers that included Simone de Beauvoir, Betty Friedan, and Bella Abzug. The climate was ripe for change. Many of Kate's colleagues in WLAM graduated in classes that were only fifteen percent female. The new generation challenged decades of patriarchal assumptions. Today enrollment at law schools as well as medical schools is at least fifty percent female. Ironically, many young women today are impatient with feminist concerns, which are deemed pass\u00e9. Female ambitions are taken for granted. Familiar phrases, such as \"We've come a long way, baby,\" document an evolution in which Kate has played a role. Long before Kate joined WLAM, she had experienced patriarchal bias first-hand. In high school, during senior year, she was told that she couldn't run for class president because \"girls can't be president.\" So she ran for secretary-treasurer. (When her boyfriend of the time teased her by deliberately misreading her posters \u2014 \"Kathy Ball for Sec'y-Treasurer\" as \"Kathy Ball for sexy treasurer\" \u2014 she felt discomfited, but it was not until years later that she understood why.) The following year, at Duke University, after enrolling as a pre-med student, her advisor told her \"women don't do that.\" Nevertheless, she joined Duke's pre-med society where she was the only woman. After the society made her sit outside the operating theater (male students were inside, as observers), she left both the group and her medical aspirations. Today she speaks wistfully of a female friend from Duke who remained undaunted, went to medical school, and has had a long, satisfying career as a pediatrician. When Kate switched to French and decided to spend her junior year in Paris, Duke tried to dissuade her from that too. \"We only give the grade of C for coursework transferred from abroad,\" she was told. Given her high GPA, this gave her pause, but only briefly. She went to Paris and turned Duke's policy to her advantage. She took courses for fun, \"courses I'd never have taken anywhere else.\" She added: \"And I developed a new attitude about rules and the status quo!\" Today, Kate combines her legal and linguistic skills. Acting pro-bono, she translates for asylum cases involving French-speaking Africans seeking asylum status in the U.S. As one friend put it, \"she deploys her French for advocacy.\" She also helps pilgrims on the Camino by volunteering at the French Trailhead where her French and Spanish enable her to effectively assist pilgrims from all over the world. Where did Kate get her moxie? Her capacity for self-determination? Many women of Kate's generation read Germaine Greer, Gloria Steinem, and earlier feminists, but remained locked in traditional roles. That Kate is endowed with self-confidence is clear. Tracing it, however, is tricky. What we do know is that she is the eldest of the three sisters and thought of herself as \"independent\" and \"headstrong.\" She was fortunate to have a father who was supportive of his daughters' ambitions. While his views on women were traditional, he encouraged his daughters to live up to their potential. \"He sometimes gave us mixed messages,\" said Kate, \"but he was a good mentor. He never doubted I could do anything I tried, although he didn't always agree with my choices! And he always held me accountable.\" He made a point of taking each of his daughters out for lunch regularly, for t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates. Kate loved those outings. \"He was so organized,\" she said, possibly unaware that she herself is often described that way. \"He would have notes on index cards in his shirt pocket, so he would not forget to say and ask whatever was on his mind. Sometimes this was pretty annoying, especially during my teens, but we always knew he was motivated by his love for us.\" Kate's father was a pilot with his own plane. He flew the family for outings to Chicago and beyond. During World War II, he served in Italy. Upon his return, he entered the family business; his father's wholesale seed company became the son's career. He traveled extensively, making connections with growers and working to promote the industry he loved. Shortly before his death in 1997, at age 84, he edited and published the 16 th edition of a book that had, under his leadership, become the industry standard for growers. He also wrote the introduction and the first chapter: \"Greenhouses for 2000 and Beyond.\" Kate's mother was a college graduate but never worked outside the home. She urged more traditional activities that held no interest for Kate. The result was tension. She felt her mother was disappointed in her.

Raising kids is definitely not as easy as it looks!\" Kate also credits her mother for showing her the cultural scene of Chicago. The family's home was in Geneva, Illinois, forty miles from Chicago. Kate remembers seeing a ballet with Maria Tallchief. They went to theatre productions, museums. When Kate was 13, the family went to Europe. She remembers the Brussels World's Fair and Aida in the Coliseum, where elephants paraded onstage. The family's last stop was Paris. Kate recalls sitting in a sidewalk caf\u00e9 thinking, I like it here. I want to come back. We know from Kate's book that the Camino taught her patience; that at the end of her mother's life, Kate was able to give her mother the gift of time \u2014 to sit quietly with her, and just be. She says this time was a lasting lesson of the Camino. We know that people find her inspiring. Friend and fellow attorney Zena Zumeta, a Mary Foster Award winner, former president of WLAM, and legendary mediation instructor, called Kate \"brilliant.\" She added: \"Kate is a very talented mediator. She listens, reaches out, brings people into decision making. She's a natural peacemaker.\" Zumeta mentioned two more qualities that make Kate unique: \"You feel better in her presence\" and \"There's no ego there!\" Zumeta remembers when women were not taken seriously. \"It was hard to get contacts, jobs, recognition. WLAM was a godsend for us. We could talk to each other, send each other cases, stand up to the powers that be. As an organization, WLAM could give voice to women's outrage.\" Kate's friend, neighbor, and fellow attorney, Susan Patton, speaks of Kate as a woman who \"speaks softly and carries a big stick.\" In their neighborhood book club, when Kate lays out a hypothesis, \"she drives her point home. As lawyers, women had to be tough,\" said Patton. \"You had to sink or swim. Kate swam.\" In describing Kate, the words used repeatedly by friends and colleagues are: soft- spoken, engaging, modest, resourceful, adventurous, astute, insightful, sensitive, emotionally honest, considerate, and courageous. Tony England, Interim Dean of U-M Dearborn's College of Engineering and Computer Science, worked with Kate when she was Director of the Dual Career Program at U-M Ann Arbor. Her responsibilities involved finding jobs for \"trailing spouses.\" Most spouses who came to their attention were academics, but not all. Certain cases, remembered England, The Peripatetic Career of Kate Soper Continued from page 57 \"It was hard to get contacts, jobs, recognition. WLAM was a godsend for us. We could talk to each other, send each other cases, stand up to the powers that be. As an organization, WLAM could give voice to women's outrage.\" -Mediator and Lawyer Zena Zumeta \"Finding a good balance is so central to making progress on gender, and it was exciting to be able to contribute in a small way.\" -Kate Soper on her role as director of the dual career program at U-M Ann Arbor Kate's 70th birthday with her daughter, daughter-in-law, son, granddaughter & husband Kate and her husband, Philip, a former U-M law professorThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 59 seemed \"insoluble.\" She solved them. He gave the example of a faculty candidate whose spouse was a church organist. To his astonishment, Kate found a church that needed an organist. He summed up his assessment: \"Her performance was always excellent. I never had to tell her what to do or what to try. She was very effective. She was energetic. I got letters from candidates expressing appreciation \u2014 whether or not they got the job!\" England's only fear about Kate was that he might lose her. She worked for both the medical school and the school of engineering. He worried that the medical school might wrest Kate for themselves. Kate loved this work because it was a way to support women as well as men who were trying to combine career and family. \"Finding a good balance,\" she said, \"is so central to making progress on gender, and it was exciting to be able to contribute in a small way.\" Abby Stewart, former Associate Dean of LS&A, also worked with Kate on dual career issues. She spoke of Kate's \"tenacity and determination.\" She added that, \"Kate was enormously effective at a very difficult job. She maintained people's hope, made the connections, and typically found the right fit. She never gave up.\" In her retirement, Kate is as busy as ever. Between her volunteer efforts and her push to promote her book, she works full time. She is trying to wrap her mind as well as her days around a schedule of readings, meetings, emails, and phone calls. She often expresses amazement that the book has had such a passionate response. Susan Darrow, Kate's friend and neighbor, said: \"I don't think she realized that people would have much interest \u2014 or that she could produce something that people would find worth reading.\" The book deserves a place on every respectable reading list. The final chapter, \"Beginnings,\" takes us deep into the present. In those concluding pages, we find: \"Over the last thirty-four days, I have been practicing with every step, every blister, and every pleasure, the art of being alive.\" \"Beginnings\" has the following passages too: This new measure of time influences how I think about distance. Now, rather than worrying about how fast I can go the distance, I see that a journey takes time and, more to the point, that the time is not wasted if I look around and appreciate what the distance traveled has to offer. When I started walking, I felt great frustration at how long it took to get anywhere on foot. It was as if I was living in slow motion and would never reach Santiago. Now I see that I'm making good progress. At the end of most days, I have traveled a modest distance under my own power. I haven't gotten lost, I've found food and shelter, and each day I've drawn closer to my destination. What's more, when I embrace this new cadence, I find that I like the pace of a pilgrim. I like being receptive to whatever the journey might offer. It's counterintuitive for this busy professional, but the Camino way of time and distance is empowering. Now more than ever, I feel centered and grounded. During her journey, the words \"pilgrim\" and \"pilgrimage\" also underwent evolution. I understand pilgrimage differently now, too. Pilgrimage, I thought when I left home, was a trip to a sacred place made by a religious person seeking to reaffirm his or her faith. That definition did not apply to me. Over the past weeks, the experiences of my journey, as well as conversations with my fellow pilgrims, hospitaleros, villagers, and especially Camino priests, have led me to see that while the history of pilgrimage may lie in religious beliefs and traditions, the practice transcends a strictly religious interpretation. ...regardless of what we search for, pilgrimage offers the promise of wisdom and understanding. ...Secular I may be, but I'm a pilgrim nonetheless. The long-distance pilgrims I talk with express the same wonder I feel about this journey. We recognize, each in our own way, that we have experienced the magic of the Camino and are changed because of it. What we don't know, can't know, is what the Camino will mean in our lives when we return home to spouses and jobs and responsibilities. ...We need to get to Santiago, not so we can say we're done with this trip, but, rather, so we can begin to process what has happened to us. Kate's friend and fellow writer, Betsy Jackson, watched Kate struggle with the dual task of accepting and adopting the suggestion repeatedly made by people who read the early drafts of her manuscript: that she needed to open up about herself in the book. Fodor's publishes travelogues. Kate could write something deeper. \"Kate's journey started before the book and continues after,\" Jackson said. \"Once she allowed herself to expose her inner self, to explore the spiritual nature of the journey, the book took shape.\" For Kate, at first, it felt exhibitionistic. It was antithetical to her. She is a very private person. But those who encouraged her are ecstatic. Said Jackson: She's helped others identify yearnings, needs, fears, just by telling her story \u2014 not probing into others, but into herself. It doesn't matter that Kate and I have such dissimilar backgrounds, and that I haven't been on the Camino. She spoke to my needs, my hopes. Isn't it nice to know you can write something that resonates for perfect strangers? Since their retirement, Kate and her husband, Philip, a former U-M law professor, have been spending a month in Paris most years. On sabbaticals, they hiked some memorable treks in the U.K. and New Zealand and walked a portion of the pilgrimage trail in France. He has also volunteered his language skills at the Camino trailhead at Saint Jean Pied de Port in France, assisting pilgrims in German. He's come a long way. Thirteen years ago, when Kate announced that she would walk the Camino, Phil was neither enthusiastic nor encouraging. (Their two children, Chris and Kate, cheered their mother on.) On the very last night of her two-month journey, eager but chary about her husband's reception, she found this welcome fax: \"Well done, valiant warrior, brave pilgrim. Congratulations on your accomplishment. Safe journey home. Much love, Philip.\" Kate is a quiet, delightful presence. She engages with warmth, charm, and intelligence, whether addressing a crowd of fellow lawyers or holding a private t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. Her smile is disarming. Tall, fair, willowy, with green eyes and amber hair, she carries herself with a natural elegance. She looks ageless, but she recently became a grandmother. Both of her children are highly accomplished, but Kate distances herself from their success. \"I take no credit for my children's achievements, though I am so happy to see them finding their way,\" she said. She is humble but not passive. She invokes a Spanish proverb: Se hace el camino en caminando. She says that the best English equivalent is: \"It's about the journey, not the destination.\" This past May, in honor of her 70 th birthday, she returned to the Camino and walked hundreds of miles. \"Now, rather than worrying about how fast I can go the distance, I see that a journey takes time and, more to the point, that the time is not wasted if I look around and appreciate what the distance traveled has to offer.\" -Steps Out of Time Kate Soper recommends a book by Colin Fletcher, The Man Who Walked Through Time. Here are a few favorite passages from his book: \u00b7 \"Every journey except your last has an open end. Any journey of value is above all a chapter in a personal odyssey. Its end is not so much a goal attained as another point in a continuing process.\" \u00b7 \"To understand man's significance, I saw, you must first accept his insignificance.\" \u00b7 \"...the journey had conferred on me a rare but simple gift: an almost perfect confluence of what I thought and what I felt. [It] had offered me, that is, the key to contentment.\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 60 David Lawson and a number of other experienced meditation teachers and practitioners have begun a new Buddhist meditation center in town, Still Mountain Buddhist Meditation Center. David was a meditation teacher for many years at the Deep Spring Center, and The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal published an article by him on meditation just two years ago. I sat down with David some months back in the Tea Room to discuss this new center, and why it was dreamed into existence. We also talked about his own practice of Buddhist meditation, and how it has nourished him and influences his daily life. Tall, lanky, handsome, reserved, kind, and thoughtful are words that come to mind when describing David. There is also a sense of a serious and seasoned man, no w with a light touch in how he moves through the world at age 67. He and his wife, Linda (a therapist and photographer), live in Scio Township west of Ann Arbor with their five-year-old son, Benjamin. He is also the grandfather to eight-year-old Joshua, who is the child of David's older son, Aaron, who lives near Atlanta.Bill Zirinsky: David, you were a senior meditation teacher at Deep Spring Center for many years. Why did you and some others choose to start Still Mountain? David Lawson: The decision to help start Still Mountain was complex for me. For one thing, it was becoming very difficult to integrate such a wide variety of teachings from the many spiritual traditions outside Buddhism that were being offered at Deep Spring. I really only wanted to study Buddhism, and although nobody ever said I couldn't do just that, the other things that were going on became a real distraction for me. This definitely does not mean that I believe other spiritual traditions to be inferior to Buddhism. Not at all! In fact, it is my sincerest hope and wish that people who have connections with other traditions may feel comfortable in coming to study with us, and we are already finding this is to be the case. Perhaps this is occurring because people sense that we are not trying to push a doctrine. And as for myself, I am perfectly content to spend my time looking into the mystery of the so-called 'mundane,' that which is right in front of me, rather than searching in other realms and dimensions. This life is so wonderfully mysterious. In rare instances when I feel somewhat bored, or just not very interested, I know that I am not seeing clearly. In my life, there are profound mysteries, such as, \"Why do I still get stuck in the same old behavioral patterns that have been kicking me around all my life?\" or \"Why am I still so greedy, and fearful?\" Of course, I don't have to be a Buddhist to ask these kinds of questions. In fact, if I take on identification as a Buddhist and wear it as I would an article of clothing, then that becomes a problem, too. The Buddha seemed to be asking his followers to consider all of the ways in which they wear their self-identifications, and this would also definitely include one's identification as a 'Buddhist.' So I know that. By the way, I maintain close friendships with many people who are still at Deep Spring, and people in that community know that I regard them with deep gratitude and respect. Deep Spring is doing just fine without those of us who decided to leave, and I know that it will continue to be a very important part of the community, serving many people in many ways. Bill Zirinsky: I know that you're steeped in the Theravadin Buddhist tradition. Tell us about your own Buddhist meditation background? David Lawson: Theravada means the \"path of the elders,\" and some consider it to be the most reliable formulation of the Buddha's teachings, although this is not Interview by Bill Zirinsky Photography by Linda Lawson We are a Buddhist center. We value what the Buddha had to say about how to live a meaningful life, and we have seen the happiness that the teachings have brought to ourselves and many others. Also, we wish to learn to be more egalitarian and inclusive in our practice, and we are not looking to set up a community that is dependent on one teacher.The Crazy Wisdom Interview with David Lawson on the Founding of Still Mountain Buddhist Meditation Center This life is so wonderfully mysterious. In rare instances when I feel somewhat bored, or just not very interested, I know that I am not seeing clearly. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 61 necessarily my own view. Nevertheless, the Theravada approach is the one I know best, and it seems coherent. There were many other sects within early Buddhism, and the Theravada teachings survived largely due to the coming together of somewhat incidental historical events. Anyway, beginning in the 1980s, I started learning various forms of meditation practice that rely mainly on the ability of the mind to focus in on one object for an extended period of time. It did not take long for the \"wow\" factor to show up, and I started feeling better in my own life almost immediately. The only problem was that I had learned these techniques mainly from books and was practicing alone. Without knowing it, I developed some bad habits and my progress came almost to a standstill. So what to do? Then, I learned that, in addition to concentration practice, there is another basic form of meditation recommended and taught by the Buddha. This other form of Buddhist meditation has come to be known as \"insight practice,\" which is maybe an okay translation of the Pali phrase \"vipassana bhavana\" as it may have been spoken by the Buddha. However, vipassana itself is definitely not unique to the Theravada tradition. In any case, with insight meditation, one expands range of attention to include the full content and context of what is being experienced. If concentration practice is a vertical process in which there is a diving into the object, so to speak, then insight practice is a more horizontal approach allowing for a wider scope of attention. In concentration practice one experiences a unification of mind, a lessening of sensory input, and a slowing or stopping of time. In vipassana, one sees the multi-fold aspect of experience as it flows in time and is conditioned by the senses. One gets to see not necessarily new things, but things anew, you might say. In fact, the sense of \"thingness\" may evaporate completely so that nothing comes into view established as a thing separate from its environment, its context. These experiences in meditation can be quite startling! For example, it may take us completely by surprise to see how much effort we have devoted to maintaining a view of self as separate from our perceived environment. Then, questions may come like \"Is this why the world seems to be happening to me?\" or \"Have I developed these deep habitual patterns of behavior in an attempt to protect the self from its own natural vulnerability?\" Then, I get to see what a full-time job my effort to control experience has become, and at that point I can only laugh! I want to retire, take it down to part-time status, or at least take a vacation. My older son, Aaron, is an airline pilot, and he sometimes talks about the autopilot that some pilots have given the name \"George.\" George is really into control, and that is a very good and needed function for George. The only problem is that he tends to over-steer at times and tries to cut rigid, square corners, especially when making a turn. In fact, George can steer so jerkily that sometimes the pilots will take him off-line just because of it. There is a little bit of George in all of us, so we don't have to look down on him, just know his limitations and thank him for his contribution. Well, anyway, I wanted to learn vipassana, and started looking locally for a teacher. I ended up finding this wonderful teacher named Barbara Brodsky. She was so generous with what she knew, and slowly, with her guidance, I started to develop a practice that really brought a lot of comfort, peace, and yes, even stability. Barbara also generously brought in a variety of visiting teachers from time to time, and I learned much from them. She asked me to start teaching four years later, and I have been doing that ever since. I also later studied with Ken McLeod, who is a well-known teacher in a completely different Buddhist tradition. From Ken, I learned how to open up both my teaching and sitting practice a little bit, and that also was a turning point for me. Ken has pretty much retired from teaching now, but he has had an enormous influence on a number of practitioners and teachers across the country. I actually still use concentration techniques and don't really consider them to be separate from vipassana. Some vipassana practitioners do not consider concentration techniques to be valuable, but I have seen first-hand their usefulness. I also use so-called \"directed\" approaches to meditation, as well as \"undirected\" approaches, and find both to be helpful. Actually in practice, any line drawn between these approaches can sometimes seem to be a dotted one. And although there may be somewhat of a bias toward the more passive noting of experience within the modern vipassana movement, I don't see that as a real problem. Bill Zirinsky: Was it a difficult decision leave Deep Spring Center, and can you tell us some about what went into that? David Lawson: Yes, it was a very difficult decision. It had been my spiritual home for a long time. I have always disliked leave-taking of any kind. How do you say to a dear friend \"I used to be able to hear what you are saying, but now I find I need to listen to myself a little more?\" And sometimes this requires setting aside the distractions and starting over from scratch. With Still Mountain, I basically wanted to help create an environment in which there would be no confusion about what was being taught. I really just wanted to simplify my approach. This is one reason why I prefer to teach mainly from the perspective of questions. I have enough answers already! Don't many of them seem to be very fragile, circular arguments that break down with even the slightest examination? The Buddha himself refused to engage in any kind of metaphysical speculation. For example, he thought even the question of \"Who is my true self?\" to be beside the point. He didn't seem necessarily to be saying that answers to these questions weren't Nor do we ask anybody to believe anything in particular. Really, we ask only that participants look to their own practice for what is useful.

To me, the Buddha was definitely not \"anti-intellectual.\" He had a first-rate mind, and he used it in really far-reaching ways. At the same time, he seems to be pointing to the ability of the human heart to come to a \"homegrown,\" intuitive understanding of wholeness, of the sacred. Ideally, this takes place within a community, because intuition needs to be tested. We generally don't need others in the community to say \"You are wrong!\", but rather, \"Why don't you look again and then let's talk about how to either confirm your intuition or ask it another question.\" Bill Zirinsky: You mentioned to me that you are hoping that Still Mountain will be a place in which members can find the congruence between different traditions. Please say more about that. Lawson: Well, of course, this is not an original thought on my part. People such as The Dalai Lama, Judith Lief, Joan Halifax, Joseph Goldstein, and others have been talking for some while now about the need for the three main traditions within Buddhism to be able to talk with and learn from each other. This is not a project to eliminate or gloss over the substantial differences among those traditions but simply to start a real dialogue. What can we learn from each other? The Dalai Lama recently lamented that, despite his efforts, he has spent more time talking with spiritual leaders of other traditions than with leaders within the various schools of Buddhism. So in the case of Still Mountain, we are rooted in the Theravada path, but we are also looking to enrich our understanding and practice by learning from the other Buddhist traditions. If we are surprised by the insights that come our way, this will be to our benefit. Bill Zirinsky: I have been an observer of the various Ann Arbor-based, Eastern spiritual sub-cultures for many decades. And Ann Arbor has been a place in which a number of different Buddhist groups have flourished \u2014 the Zen Buddhist community on Packard led by Resident Priest Haju Sunim, the Tsogyelgar community on West Liberty led by Traktung Rinpoche, the Jewel Heart community led by Gehlek Rimpoche, and the Deep Spring vipassana group led by Barbara Brodsky. Is there a need for yet another Buddhist community? What is, and what is going to be, different about Still Mountain? David Lawson: Still Mountain was started by a group of very senior practitioners. Maybe there is really nothing new under the sun, I don't know. I would say that we didn't really set out to differentiate ourselves from other groups, although many who now study with us say that it feels somehow different from what they have experienced elsewhere. We have spent lots of time in developing our guiding principles. First of all, as I said, we are a Buddhist center. We value what the Buddha had to say about how to live a meaningful life, and we have seen the happiness that the teachings have brought to ourselves and many others. Also, we wish to learn to be more egalitarian and inclusive in our practice, and we are not looking to set up a community that is dependent on one teacher. Nor do we ask anybody to believe anything in particular. Really, we ask only that participants look to their own practice for what is useful. Perhaps most important, we want to spend earnest effort in learning how to cultivate and express kindness toward each other and toward the community at large. This is, of course, easy to talk about and maybe not so easy to do. In one of the Buddha's best known discourses known as the \"Metta Sutta,\" he talks about a radical practice of regarding everybody with love, but the punch line in that discourse comes when he advises the setting down of preconceived notions and views that otherwise tend to separate us from each other. Being human, of course, we know up front that we are going to make mistakes. But we will trust that it is possible for us to learn how to be respectful and generous with our affection. BZ: Susan Weir, also a long- time senior teacher at Deep Spring, also left a couple of years ago to form a new meditation group. Why did she do that, and what is her focus and orientation? Lawson: Here, in my opinion, is another good example of a senior practitioner and teacher who felt she needed to go her own way for her own spiritual development, although I am sure there were also many other factors that came into play. I would not presume to be able to speak for Susan, but I do know that it was also not an easy decision for her. Susan is an excellent teacher, and her group known as Insight Meditation Ann Arbor is thriving. Her primary focus, I believe, remains on the teaching of Theravada vipassana. She teaches there with Ann Barden, Lou Weir, and Terry Gliedt. We are all friends. BZ: You mentioned to me that a kind of egalitarianism in decision-making was going to be a key aspect of this new Buddhist community. Can you say more about that? Lawson: Well, I think a truly egalitarian decision-making model is really very scary for most organizations, so many of them don't even try it. It can bring up all sorts of questions like \"How do we ever get anything done?\" or \"Where does the buck stop?\" By the way, a local author and practitioner named George SanFacon has spent much of his life in investigating the whole question of how to build a democratic community. His published insights are extremely valuable, and I can highly recommend looking him up in person and on the Internet. He has been helpful to many groups locally and elsewhere. I think it is actually imperative for us, in a way, to explore our fears around democratic decision-making. In the model that I feel we have inherited from the Buddha, it is pretty clear that he pleaded with his followers to step up and take responsibility for their own spiritual development. This is what we're looking for in community and what many of us, including myself, have been thirsting for, even if we were not always completely aware of it. BZ: Who are some of the others who have helped to start this community, and tell us something about their backgrounds? Lawson: Well, the initial planning group for Still Mountain started meeting in January 2014. Members of that group included Carola Carlier, Hugh Danville, Erica Dutton, Mariko Foulk, Mary Grannan, Simon Ha, Kay Mahan, Peg Tappe, and myself. All of these people were so generous in contributing their own special skills and understanding, and we worked very hard together. I could spend hours talking about each one of these people, really! They are all truly extraordinary, and their backgrounds include many years of meditation practice and commitment to the path we have been discussing. Vocationally, their backgrounds include teacher, counselor, interior designer, social worker, psychologist, nurse, IT analyst, and communications consultant. We were so lucky to have found each other in this work! Continued from page 61 David and son, Ben I think a truly egalitarian decision-making model is really very scary for most organizations, so many of them don't even try it. It can bring up all sorts of questions like \"How do we ever get anything done?\" or \"Where does the buck stop?\" Teaching is, by its very nature, a very strange and awkward thing. There can be the presumption that I, as teacher, know something that you don't. And here, let me just hand it to you! But what if in handing it to you, I end up shaping it in a way that fits only my ability to hold it, not your capacity to know it freshly for yourself? David Lawson on the Founding of Still Mountain Buddhist Meditation Center The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 63 We have also formed our first Governing Board. And this is where the real work begins. The members include Hugh Danville, Anita Sherman-Moran, Yair Rivlin, Judi Green, and Jim MacBain. We feel very fortunate that these folks have so enthusiastically agreed to donate their time and expertise to the guidance of Still Mountain. It is a very strong Board, and several members have substantial experience serving elsewhere on nonprofit boards as well as in leadership roles in other organizations. Finally, there are the teachers. These currently are Hugh Danville, Erica Dutton, Mary Grannan, Bilha Rivlin, Jim Whiteside, and myself. All have considerable teaching experience, and I am honored to be a part of the group. Each of us is committed to further developing our understanding and teaching skills. BZ: What is currently being offered at Still Mountain, and about how many people are participating in its various offerings? Lawson: We offer meditation classes for beginners, continuing practice/study groups for more experienced practitioners, and a sitting every Sunday morning open to the public. We \"opened our doors\" in August of 2014, following a workshop offered by a well-known meditation teacher based in California. We will also be offering retreats beginning this year, as well as other workshops. Our first retreat offered by Still Mountain teachers will be this October at Howell Nature Center. Currently, the people who come to our practice/study groups and our Sunday sitting number approximately 50. There are also two ongoing meditation groups, one offered through Turner Center, and the other by one of our teachers in the Plymouth area. Total participation in these two groups is currently about 30. In addition, we expect at least 50 people annually to sign up for our beginning classes offered through other public venues, and there are others who have expressed interest in participating in special events and other offerings as they occur. So I guess measured purely in terms of numbers, we are doing okay, although I don't necessarily consider that to be the most important indicator of impact or contribution to the greater community. BZ: Where have you been meeting, and will you continue using that same venue?Lawson: We are currently meeting at the Turner Resource Center in the North Campus area. We like it because of the location but also because we have the best landlord in the world! It is a very warm and inviting environment. Yes, we plan to continue with this venue, and our new in location in Plymouth. BZ: Are you bringing in any teachers or authors or Buddhist thinkers from outside Ann Arbor to give talks or lead workshops? Lawson: Last year, we invited Jason Siff to lead a workshop on his method of recollective awareness, which he has been practicing for many years and has written about extensively. This was our first official \"Still Mountain\" event. We also plan to invite other teachers outside the Ann Arbor to lead workshops and retreats with us. We will be announcing some pretty exciting events coming up yet this year and in 2016. Stay tuned! I do think that meditation communities in general would do well to tell beginners that an emphasis only on meditation, meditation, and meditation will not be sufficient to bring real freedom in their lives. What is also needed, if I may say so, is the practice of looking in the direction of others whom we believe to be so different from ourselves, with understanding and patience. Continued on page 64 BZ: You are beginning a chaplaincy program with Bernie Glassman and Joan Halifax. Tell us about that, please. Lawson: One important emphasis of the Still Mountain approach will be to explore how we can be of real help to others in our community. We don't want to keep what we are learning to ourselves, but we also don't want to proselytize. We could really start anywhere, because there is so much need wherever you look! I spent some time in teaching meditation in a prison system, and found it to be a growth experience for me. We could do something like that again. Or we may choose to work with dying people in hospice settings, as one of our teachers has already done. Whomever we can help, perhaps a big part of our work will be to simply sit with the other person, the one who has been forgotten or left behind, without making a big deal out of it. We can learn to do that. In order to be able to help offer this kind of work as an organization, I personally felt that I would need formal chaplaincy training. There is only a small handful of Buddhist chaplaincy programs in the U.S., perhaps the best known of which is Upaya Zen Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The leader of that center is Joan Halifax, maybe best known for her work with the dying, and she is an amazing teacher in many ways. She describes her two-year program as \"radical chaplaincy\" working in the charnel grounds of society. I am very much looking forward to seeing if this training might open up my heart a little bit. Maybe it's possible! Upaya has trained a number of lay chaplains (I think about sixty, maybe) over the past several years, and they are doing good work in their communities. 734.761.5908 Healing Touch Energy Work Multidimensional, Intuitive and Transformational Healing Essential Oils Consults Spiritual Direction Flower Essence Master Formulas Workshop & Retreat Facilitator The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 64 BZ: You are, to use your own words, \"flying by the seat of my pants\" in terms of your leadership role in the still-fairly-new Still Mountain community. You said to me that, in terms of your disposition, you prefer to be moving towards the back of the bus, not leading from the front of the bus. Can you say more about that? Lawson: I think there is a big difference between leadership as offered to a leader by members of the group and leadership as asserted by an individual. The latter context of leadership, unfortunately, is often at the expense of community. Also, when seated at the front of the bus, it is possible to get a really bad case of motion sickness, especially if every single turn has to be in line with a predetermined route. From the back of the bus, on the other hand, you can still see the road ahead and shout out advice like \"Look out for the ditch!\" when needed. This does require, however, letting others take turns doing some of the driving. BZ: You told me that you are someone who enjoys learning and teaching, especially learning, and that you are hoping that the Still Mountain organization will be a collaborative model, where it runs just fine without one leader. At the same time, a new organization does need some clear decision-making. How is that sorting itself out, so far? Lawson: Yes, teaching has never come easily for me, and I've worked hard at it almost continuously for the past 17 years. Teaching is, by its very nature, a very strange and awkward thing. There can be the presumption that I, as teacher, know something that you don't. And here, let me just hand it to you! But what if in handing it to you, I end up shaping it in a way that fits only my ability to hold it, not your capacity to know it freshly for yourself? I can easily contaminate it in the hand-off, or I can fumble it altogether. Learning, on the other hand, can occur jointly between two people. If I think I have something to offer as a teacher, and I can learn to talk about it in ways that convey the beauty of what I am seeing, then I am also learning something myself in my exchange with you. But the communication always has to be two-way. If you think I am the teacher here, you have to be able to say, \"I don't really get what you are saying. Please try again.\" With regard to building a clear decision-making process, you are right that this is critical. I like to remind myself that Still Mountain only \"opened its doors\" a few months ago, and so we are still working out some of the ways in which we will interact. But I think we are making great progress overall. We have community meetings every month, the Board is working in a number of vital areas, and the teachers are exploring how they will work together for the good of the community. It is going well, but I don't necessarily think it will sort itself out. There has to be ongoing and active involvement of the full community. BZ: Tell us about your own personal, family background. Where were you raised, what was your heritage? Lawson: I was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. My parents did not have a car, and they were renting an apartment from this wonderful guy who owned a mortuary at the time. I was actually brought home from the hospital in his hearse. I still have a beautiful poem written by him to me, in which he refers to me as \"Little Johnny.\" I don't really remember him, but I do love him. My folks broke up when I was in early elementary school, and my younger brother and I ended up living with my mom in Traverse City, Michigan, then later in Grand Rapids. My brother and I would spend every summer with our father in Chattanooga, and that was great, too. My parents were both Christian, and I have many fond memories of the wonderful music and basic wholesome feeling of going to church with them as a boy. My father was an accountant, very devout and a deacon in the church. He also played a mean game of basketball and had a wry sense of humor. He was a hard worker, and most things in life did not come easily for him. My mother was a very beautiful and haunted person. People were instantly drawn to her, and she loved to party and have fun. She could also out-debate anybody I have ever met. She worked very hard all her life in mostly administrative jobs. My blood line is mainly English, Scottish, and Cherokee. Much of it is a mystery to me, and maybe I'll look into it more deeply someday. BZ: And where did you go to high school and college? What did you study? You also played basketball, right? Lawson: I went to high school in Grand Rapids, then to college here at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I was a premed student and entered medical school in Tennessee, where I was considered an in-state student because of my father's residence. After spending four years in Ann Arbor in the sixties, I can tell you that Memphis was a culture shock, to say the least. My first Memphis apartment was close to the hotel in which Martin Luther King was assassinated. Ultimately, medical school turned out to be a big mistake, and the whole experience precipitated a real existential crisis for me. In fact, I remember playing a lot of basketball in medical school when I should have been studying. I was immature and under a lot of stress.Continued from page 63 I was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. My parents did not have a car, and they were renting an apartment from this wonderful guy who owned a mortuary at the time. I was actually brought home from the hospital in his hearse. My meditation practice shows up in so many ways in my marriage that often surprise me. Maybe Linda says something that used to irritate me and now it doesn't at all, or maybe it does a little bit but I am able to stop my reactive pattern before it gets going with a head of steam.

Recently, he composed a dance to an opera while wearing a homemade kitchen apron and a pirate hat. I think he has already added years to my life from the laughter alone.Continued on page 66 BZ: And what was your degree in, or degrees? Tell us about your path as a young man, please. Lawson: I have a bachelor's degree from University of Michigan in pre-professional Studies, and a master's degree from Wayne State in occupational and environmental health. Ann Arbor was such a terrific place to go to school, and I fell in love with it almost immediately when I arrived here. I grew my hair long and took on some of the other affectations of the counter- culture. But what a ride it was! Ann Arbor in the sixties was really this kind of quaint little place with all of these wonderful people with all of their new ways of thinking and expressing themselves. I have been deeply shaped by that time and still listen to Dylan, for goodness sake! On some level, the education I was receiving here had to do with thinking about and taking action against abuses of power and privilege. I had a very difficult time, however, in applying it when I left school. I was basically lost. When I dropped out of medical school, I remember picking up a book titled The Way of Zen. I was mesmerized by it. One of my friends who was still in medical school visited our apartment one evening, saw the book, and said, \"I wish I had the time to read books like that!\" I don't know where John is now, but I wish I could tell him how meaningful that one comment was as I struggled with my own sense of failure. I was also married at the time, and my first son, Aaron, was born in Memphis. I was working at Baptist Memorial Hospital as a surgical scrub technician while I made a final decision about whether to come back to medical school. It would probably curl your toes if I told you all of the things they let me do there as a know-nothing scrub assistant. Well, anyway, we decided to go back up to Grand Rapids. I worked there for a while and then we moved back to Ann Arbor, where my wife re-entered her program at U-M. She and I ultimately parted ways in the late 1970s. Throughout the seventies, I did different kinds of work that I knew would never ultimately be my vocation. These included jobs ranging from restaurant manager to hotel auditor to private investigator. Then, in 1977, I sensed it was time for another change. I entered the Wayne State program, and that launched me into a career that I have been engaged in since 1980. In the eighties, I lived pretty much alone, some said \"like a monk.\" It's during that period that I started to meditate. I started to notice that I was not so angry anymore, not so lost! People actually started saying they liked being around me, which was a big change. In a way, I had found myself again. I also spent lots of time with my first son, whose custody I shared with his mother. Aaron was really the light of my life, and we did everything together! It is a huge happiness for me that he still knows how much I love him. The size of his heart is enormous, and somehow he has been able to keep it open despite lots of disappointment. He is an inspiration to me, truly! I met my wife, Linda, in 1989 at a workshop on improvisational comedy. By the way, improvisational relationship comedy has been an ongoing theme for us all these years! We are having a wonderful life, and it just keeps getting better! 5340 Plymouth Rd.

That was a pivotal event for me. The floor just dropped out from beneath me, and I was in a state of very deep despair for a long time. I had loved her dearly, and now she was gone! I went into group therapy for family members with alcoholic parents. Here is when I took another big growth step. There was suddenly the necessity to deal with death, with not knowing, and with the fragility of my life and those of my friends and family. It was strong medicine. BZ: And where do you work? What is your profession?Lawson: I work at Corporate Headquarters for Freudenberg-NOK in Plymouth as their director for health, safety, and environmental services. I guess you could say it is my job to protect the occupational wellbeing of all of our associates. BZ: What kind of company is Freudenberg, what do you like about it?Lawson: Freudenberg-NOK is a joint venture between German-based Freudenberg and the Japanese company NOK. The cultural mix is fascinating. The company is also deeply committed to taking care of its associates, so it has been a wonderful environment in which to make a livelihood. I am grateful. BZ: You are now a father of a young boy, and also a grandfather. That must be interesting and fun? Lawson: Yes, my second son, Benjamin, and my grandson, Joshua. Linda and I would talk about having a child, and I thought the idea was preposterous for someone of my age, but the more we talked about it, the more I realized that maybe I could handle it. In the delivery room, I took him in my arms and chanted to him, and the doctors and nurses were very patient with me. Then, I remember saying a prayer to him that night, thanking him for coming to us. Linda and I sometimes remark how dreamlike our lives feel, then Ben will wake us up with one of his impromptu performances. Recently, he composed a dance to an opera while wearing a homemade kitchen apron and a pirate hat. I think he has already added years to my life from the laughter alone. A couple of weeks ago, he announced that he has two ears: one that he only hears with, and one that he only talks with! This is true for all of us, yes? And some of us try to listen with the ear we only want to talk with. This is also something that we will work with at Still Mountain! Then, this morning as I was leaving for work he said, \"Bye! See you back on Earth!\" My grandson, Joshua, lives in Georgia. He is such a beautiful little guy and makes friends so easily. I wish I got to see him more, and I am looking forward to seeing him grow up! Continued from page 65BZ: Are you focused on the growth of the Still Mountain community, and if so, in what way, what will be the stages, as you see it? Lawson: I wouldn't say I'm focused on the growth of Still Mountain in terms of numbers of participants in our community, however I am keenly interested in the growth of Still Mountain as a real community. As you know, Scott Peck talked about the stages of community with a lot of insight in how it really works. The first stage he described is maybe you might say the \"honeymoon\" stage. I love you, you love me, and everything is beautiful. Then, because I \"love\" you so much, I try to change you or rescue you from yourself. When you resist, I see that maybe there are some things about you that I'm not so crazy about. The third stage is one of chaos, in which there seems no way out of this dilemma. Life is a real drag! And here is where the real work of community comes in. Peck says that if we can hang in there and do our own work without trying to appropriate the experience of others, then we can make a breakthrough into real community. In real community, there are true differences of opinion and focus, but people learn to relish the diversity. The boundaries between people are not transcended so much as made workable. BZ: You mentioned to me that in the world of vipassana meditation, many of the communities are quite inward looking, and you'd like that not to be case for Still Mountain. Can you elaborate on that, how you want Still Mountain to contribute to the wider community and be less inward? Lawson: Well, this is sort of natural, I think. If we find something that we can do by ourselves, such as meditation, and we see it open the heart in a way that makes the world beautiful as it is, we may be tempted to try to do that to the exclusion of an outward focus. Let's say you go away for a week on a wonderful retreat and suddenly you are in awe, you see things that you previously had no idea about. You want more! But then, you may also notice a bit of sadness creeping in as you come home and see how everybody else is still stuck in the mud! You can ignore the sadness and continue to focus on yourself, or you can come to see your practice in a larger context. People may be saying \"Boy, how you've changed! How can I get some of that?\" How do you respond to that? There is a practice in one of the Buddhist traditions that can be translated as \"sending and receiving.\" In this practice, one breathes in the suffering of others. This is a practice of compassion. Then, on the outbreath, one sends out the intention to express what is called \"lovingkindness.\" This alternating between compassion and lovingkindness is so powerful as to break down the sense of loneliness and separation that we all experience. This is where the heart really wants to go if we will let it. My hunch is that as Still Mountain starts to look more outwardly, we may discover that the whole distinction between inward and outward becomes a bit arbitrary. And I certainly don't mean to imply that the typical insight community is selfish and inward looking to the detriment of the greater community, because this is sort of a typical critique put forth by some in the other Buddhist traditions. However, I do think that meditation communities in general would do well to tell beginners that an emphasis only on meditation, meditation, and meditation will not be sufficient to bring real freedom in their lives. What is also needed, if I may say so, is the practice of looking in the direction of others whom we believe to be so different from ourselves, with understanding and patience. In real community, there are true differences of opinion and focus, but people learn to relish the diversity. The boundaries between people are not transcended so much as made workable. David Lawson on the Founding of Still Mountain Buddhist Meditation Center Also, I get to be aware of all of my fears for him, how his life will go, without getting too caught up in them. I am working a lot with this one! And Linda really helps me. BZ: In the way in which you navigated your departure from Deep Spring?Lawson: Well, I still don't know exactly how skillful I was in my process of leaving Deep Spring. I did take my time, some people said too much time! Maybe that is another place in which I was working on my practice of patience. Mostly, I remember many late nights in meditation, exploring what was pulling me. I wanted to take action from a sense of being pulled rather than being pushed. I tend to talk to myself a lot about this distinction. When I feel pulled rather than pushed, I notice that the quiet voice of intuition starts to speak, even if in a tentative and halting way. That is when I really start to listen with the ear that wants to listen, rather than the ear that only wants to talk. BZ: In the way in which you are trying to navigate this early stage in the life of Still Mountain? Lawson: What has surprised me the most about my own attitude regarding Still Mountain is that I am not really all that concerned about whether it succeeds as an organization or not. Of course, I want it to be of value to the active participants and the larger community and succeed in that way, but even if that were to not happen, I would be fine with it. This attitude of acceptance about whatever happens in this regard is completely attributable to my practice, I feel, and a real shock to me! It would have not been possible for me even several years ago. Somehow, I have been fortunate enough to come upon a practice that takes much of the steam out of my sense of success and failure. I can just concentrate on what seems right in the moment and let the rest of it go. What a relief! BZ: Thank you, David. For more information, email stillmountainmeditation@gmail.com or go to their website: stillmountainmeditation.org. David Lawson can be reached at dlawson@fastmail.comBZ: I have noticed that some seasons over the last half-decade you were leading workshops entitled, \"Five Months to Live.\" Tell us about those. How have those gone, have they been meaningful to you, and to people who've attended? Lawson: Morbid fear of death haunted me for much of my life. I can remember waking up at night crying out to my parents about dying and how afraid I was of it. Fear of death was, in some sense, what propelled my spiritual seeking and also my excessive busyness at certain times in my life. I just didn't want to face it. Then, my mother died, and I had no choice. I also learned that the Buddha recommended looking at the fact of death straight on as a way of loosening its grip. This seemed to make no sense to me. Wouldn't it just make me fear death all the more? But since nothing else had worked, I decided to try it. I spent lots of time trying the methods the Buddha presented for looking at death, and you know what? It worked! If somebody like me can learn how to not only live with death but come to have very little fear of it, then anybody can do it, I guarantee you. Because I was really an extreme case. In the workshops, we presented these practices to those who were ready to try them. We had lots of interest, and many reported significant reduction in their fears after only five months. Some people took the workshop more than once! I recently had a long-time practitioner tell me that she thought she should take one of these workshops every year. Other teachers became active in presenting this material as well, especially Mary Grannan and Dottie Coyne. And their workshops were also highly subscribed. I feel confident that we will be offering such workshops again through Still Mountain. BZ: How does your meditation practice show up in your marriage?Lawson: When you meet somebody who you intuitively understand could be so important in your life, it is scary, right? And I was very careful, probably too careful. One of the first things I discovered was that I needed to learn how to let go of my compulsive need to be right and to be able to figure out the Truth, with a capital \"T.\" My meditation practice shows up in so many ways in my marriage that often surprise me. Maybe Linda says something that used to irritate me and now it doesn't at all, or maybe it does a little bit but I am able to stop my reactive pattern before it gets going with a head of steam. Or maybe I slip all the way into one of my old patterns and fall out on the other side, to be left wondering \"How the hell did that happen again?\" In that case, even then, there can be some comfort in knowing clearly that it did happen and that I'm now able to look at it again. I'm able to come back. Best of all, sometimes, when she does not notice it, I may just look across the room and see her and recognize her, really see her! And of course, that breaks down all of my defensiveness and my wish to know the \"Truth.\" Because who cares what the \"Truth\" is when you are looking into the face of the beloved! That is the truth. BZ: In your fathering of your young son? Lawson: Here is where I find the practice of patience comes in for me. I still have lots to learn about it. If Benjamin gets caught up in a temper tantrum, for example, I get to engage with him in a way that gives both of us a little space. However, I still need to provide guidance. That requires patience.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 67 Somehow, I have been fortunate enough to come upon a practice that takes much of the steam out of my sense of success and failure.

Individual treatments in a group setting. Maybe I'm kidding myself, but I believe I'm OK with the fact that my life has an expiration date. Perhaps there is a kinder, gentler reality in the next world \u2014 who knows. Losing loved ones is a very different story, though. I had my first close encounter with Lady Death when my dear friend, Diane, was diagnosed with cancer in the mid-90's. I witnessed Diane's profound spiritual and emotional healing during that last year of her life. And like all her loved ones, I felt the exquisite pain of loss when death overtook her. Talk about powerlessness. These days I am a regular at the Ann Arbor Death Caf\u00e9, hosted by my friends Merilynne Rush and Diana Cramer. We gather publicly on the third Saturday of every month in the Crazy Wisdom Tea Room, where we drink tea, eat cake, and talk about death. I find the conversations oddly comforting. And I haven't lost my youthful zeal for taboo-busting, so that is also part of the appeal. Acceptance of self and of the reality of death \u2014 sounds like I'm doing great with Erikson's integrity challenges, right? Well, one of my big lessons these days is that life is paradoxical. We are all bundles of contradictions, and I am no exception. I like my life and I have a lot of despair. I came of age in the sixties, after all. My friends and I were convinced that any wrong could be righted. I addressed this humorously in my song \"Different By Now\": I thought it would be different by nowI thought my friends and I would be taking a bowFor saving the whole damn human raceFor making the world a much better placeBut we're still stuck in the same rat raceI thought it would be different by now! -from Drop the Knife: A Memoir-in-Song As a young adult, I believed I would see the day when humans live in harmony with one another and the natural world, acknowledging our interconnectedness and The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 68 It was the fall of 1994. I was living and working in Maryland, just over the DC border. Faced with the possibility of a hysterectomy, I sought spiritual solutions along with mainstream medical advice. Ursula, a trusted friend and healer, advised me that the imbalance in my womb was in part a result of my conflicted relationship with my mother. \"It would be good for you to create a ceremony of forgiveness and separation,\" she said. \"Let your mother's story be hers and your story be yours.\" So I gathered a group of nine women, inviting them to witness the ritual and reflect on my journey. Each had supported, inspired, and taught me: Pattie, my soulmate; Ursula and other beloved long-time my therapist du jour; Jane, my acupuncturist; Elise, a Dutch bodyworker. It was Ursula's turn to speak in the circle. Jeanne, part of this healing process is about coming to terms with your power and your powerlessness. When you haven't accepted your power and can't face your powerlessness, you need a mother. When you can own them both, the only mothers you need are the Earth and the Shekinah \u2014 the sacred presence of the feminine. You don't need a mother in human form. Every human being is your peer. Twenty-one years later, I have clear memories of that day \u2014 the circle of women, our voices joined in song, smoke rising from an abalone shell as I burned symbols of resentment and asked for spirit help in releasing my grudges against Mom. In the years that followed, I experienced a sweetening of our relationship. The health crisis was resolved with minor surgery, leaving my womb intact. Was it the ceremony that turned the tide? I'll never know. But I will spend the rest of my days incorporating the medicine of Ursula's words. It is part of my work as an elder-in-training. I have developed my views on elderhood through a variety of influences: goddess spirituality, the Feminist Movement, indigenous wisdom, and Erik Erikson's eight stages of psychosocial development. One thing is clear to me: becoming an elder means more than just getting older. It requires developing the capacity to reflect on and learn from one's life experience. It's about harvesting those lessons, skills, and gifts, and finding ways to share them. Having recently turned 65, I am now entering the last of Erikson's life stages, where the developmental challenge is integrity versus despair. The goal is acceptance of oneself and of the reality of death. So how am I doing? My life has certainly taken some unexpected twists and turns over the years. I gave up the search for the man of my dreams long ago when I discovered a preference for the company of women \u2014 one in particular. Pattie and I celebrated the 25-year anniversary of our commitment ceremony this spring, and we were able to legally wed, at least at the federal level, in 2014. Job-wise, I've gone from performing musician and part-time secretary to full-time clinical social worker to my current (and presumably last) gigs as part-time U-M tech trainer and part-time musician, workshop leader, community activist, and big bubble-maker. It's a good life, crafted through a combination of skill, privilege, and luck. And on a good day, I like the person I have become. I wish I could time travel back to my lonely adolescent self and whisper in her ear. \"Hang in there, kid. In the future, you have a wonderful partner and great friends. And you learn how to make up creative projects and carry them out, perform your own music with confidence, write, speak, teach, and live out loud!\"By Jeanne Mackey Field Notes from an Elder-in-Training \"Let your mother's story be hers and your story be yours.\" Maybe I'm kidding myself, but I believe I'm OK with the fact that my life has an expiration date. I need to become my own loving parent. Making giant soap bubbles is another reliable spirit-lifter. One of Jean Mackey's Bubble Pop-ups on the DiagPhoto by David Dugree Photo by Laura ColeJean and Pattieensuring that all living beings have what they need to thrive. I do appreciate the positive changes I have witnessed thus far, such as the election of our first African American president and the growing acceptance and legalization of gay marriage. I am heartened when I meet young people who are passionate about social justice and by the emergence of peer-led collaborative movements and trends, such as the Maker Movement, \"unconferences,\" World Caf\u00e9, and of course, Death Caf\u00e9. But my expectations of a global shift in consciousness in my lifetime were just a wee bit unrealistic. Experience has taught me \u2014 painfully \u2014 that power struggles, intolerance, and self-deception are present wherever humans gather. If I begin to doubt that, I need look no further than my own snap judgments and hotheaded tendencies. My rude awakenings are not limited to the state of the world. I assumed that everything I didn't like about myself could be fixed, one way or another. I would never have predicted the internal struggles that still impact my daily quality of life. That insecure adolescent who feels like a failure \u2014 she's still in my psyche! She is pretty sure she doesn't have what it takes to navigate this scary adult world. Lacking self-trust, she is always on the lookout for the wise adults who can tell her what to do. And that just doesn't work anymore, if it ever did. The answer is obvious. I need to become my own loving parent. But when the anxious self-doubt starts revving up, I don't feel like giving that inner teen an invisible hug. I just want her to chill out or go away. I suspect my mom had similar reactions when my insecurities kicked up her own deep-seated feelings of inadequacy. There are no quick fixes for what I'm grappling with \u2014 no denying that I am living in a world where economic, racial, and gender-based injustice is a daily reality for millions, and where humans still treat the natural world as a resource to be conquered and consumed. Hopefully, the balance will shift someday, but I doubt that I will live to see it. And on the personal level, it is unlikely I can eradicate the negative beliefs formed during those dreary small town high school years. It's not hard to see all the ways I am powerless. But where do I have power? \"Tell me what you pay attention to, and I will tell you who you are.\" - Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset, 20th century Spanish philosopher I have the power of choice. As Buddhist eco-philosopher Joanna Macy says, our ability to \"suffer with\" the world is the literal meaning of compassion, and part of what fuels our collective impulse to turn towards a more life-sustaining culture. I can \u2014 and do \u2014 look for ways to contribute to the healing of our world that feel right for me and are therefore personally sustainable. In my relationships with others and with myself, I can choose what I pay attention to and what I cultivate. I can't get rid of the old thought patterns, but I can create new ones over time, drawing on what I know about energy work, sound healing, emotional release, ritual, and art. Music has been my companion and ally through a lifetime of singing, performing, and noodling around on guitar, piano, mandolin, accordion, and most recently, banjo. These days, it helps me connect with my mother. Mom is 95 now, living in a nursing home in my hometown of Oxford, Ohio. She is cheerful, well cared for, and blessedly free of pain. But the feisty, opinionated woman I have known all my life is mostly gone, lost to dementia. Inspired by the film Alive Inside about the power of music to reach people with memory loss, I have started bringing my electronic keyboard along when I visit. I set up in the activity room as the residents come wheeling in. I make sure Mom is right up front so she knows it's me. She doesn't remember what she said two minutes ago, but she still knows all the words to \"Paper Moon\" and \"Ain't Misbehavin'.\" After each tune, she announces to the other residents, \"That's my favorite song!\" \"But you said the last one was your favorite, Marge.\" \"Well, this one is too.\" Making giant soap bubbles is another reliable spirit-lifter.Pattie and I have been doing our public bubble \"pop-ups\" for about three years.

Other times, it's college students who dive into the bubble-popping zone, delighted for an excuse to play. It's not unusual to hear four or five languages during a session \u2014 Spanish, Arabic, Russian, Chinese, Hindi. The question comes up every time: \"Did someone hire you to do this?\" We explain that we only bubble for fun. Some folks urge us to come up with a bubble business plan. Others respond with a grin and a hint of relief. They have guessed the secret of our community give-away. Making big, buoyant, beautiful bubbles and enticing passing strangers to join us is the nicest present we can give ourselves. Joseph Campbell said, \"We can't cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy.\" I have that quote on a bumper sticker on my guitar case. Another favorite is Amy Tan's challenge: \"If you can't change your fate, change your attitude.\" If some of my friends are right, and I volunteered to be born into this reality \u2014 well, I must have been pretty na\u00efve about what I was signing up for. But as long as I am here, I know what matters and what I want to presence. And maybe someday I will find out that my all-time favorite bumper sticker is true: \"Everything will be okay in the end.

If it's not okay, it's not the end.\"At Top of the Park Jean and Pattie at the UM Museum of Art the day after they were married last yearWe've all heard about climate change or global warming ... and since 97 percent of world scientists agree that it's happening and that it's human-caused, we're willing to accept it. We know sea levels are rising; storms, droughts, and wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense; and thousands of species are going extinct each year. But what does all that have to do with us living in Southeastern Michigan in 2015? What will life be like in 2030 or 2050 or 2100 for our grandchildren and all children? And why should we care since at some point we won't be here? If you're receiving mailings from AARP , this article is for you. You may not think of yourself as an \"elder.\" That's an identity that seems to belong to another culture (Native American elders, for example) or our parents' generation. But you can see that your life is filled with a string of events and accomplishments that puts you in a different category of experience than those younger than you. You have garnered knowledge, experience, expertise, networks, and resources that put you in a different place than you were at, say, 30 or 40. You may also have the luxury of a slower pace of life than those who are still juggling the demands of career and family. And because of these gifts of elderhood, there is an important role for us to play in addressing climate change. Our leadership is needed because humanity is at a critical turning point, and our wisdom and experience \u2014 and most especially our love \u2014 are a powerful force to help us turn the tide. Author James Gustave Speth once opened a climate conference by saying, \"The only thing we have to do to be sure we will leave a ruined world for our children and our grandchildren is to do exactly what we are doing now.\" In r esponse, philosophy professor and climate activist Kathleen Dean Moore later wrote, \"To imagine [my grandchildren] wandering, hungry, in a barren land changed everything for me. I decided I would never do anything in my working life that doesn't at least try to make the world safe for bog lilies and hooting owls and laughing children.\" Given the gravity of this situation, the natural question is, \"What can I do?\" \"How can I make any difference as an individual?\" But when we move alone to address climate change, we can be left feeling anything from self-righteousness to impotence or despair. The task before us seems so daunting that old habits of mind take over in the face of the overwhelm. So what if we move together instead? Imagine a wind blowing through a landscape. Every leaf, every branch and blade of grass moves together in the wind. Each moves in its own way, but each flows in the same direction in response to this invisible power. What if our love is the power that causes us to begin flowing in the same direction and harmonizing our movements: through the shared reality of our love, through anticipation, imagination, and careful planning? Then the question becomes, \"What can we do through me?\" Suddenly we are standing in an ethical and powerful place, powerful because we are standing together. The People's Climate March in New York City in September 2014 drew nearly a half million participants. Speaking there, Kathleen Dean Moore said, \"In every struggle for justice there is a turning point, a tipping point, when what was unimaginable becomes inevitable.\" Now is our tipping point. If we take sufficient action in time, we can turn the climate crisis into an unprecedented opportunity \u2014 an opportunity to create a future that realizes our dreams for leaving a legacy of a joyful, loving, beautiful life for all children. So we are calling elders in SE Michigan to bring our leadership to \"turning the tide.\" Please join us in creating our own version of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"beloved community.\" We could begin in many ways. One is by learning to honor ourselves as elders and appreciate the unique role that this special time in our lives gives us. We could begin by making individual lifestyle changes together \u2014 using public The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 70 Green Living By Claire Maitre and Nancy Ogilvie Because of these gifts of elderhood, there is an important role for us to play in addressing climate change.

We have a wealth of love, wisdom, and life experience to contribute, and we are a force to be reckoned with! As a result of this summit, we expect to create an ongoing climate action community in SE Michigan, supporting and inspiring each other in taking action to create the legacy we want to leave for future generations!

But individual action alone will not be sufficient. We will also organize to take collective action, from letter-writing campaigns to lobbying policy-makers to participating in marches, demonstrations, and boycotts. More ideas will come, powerful ones, from our synergy, unleashed creativity and fierce love. To persist in advocating for the deep and real change that is needed, we will need a community that reminds us to celebrate our lives now and encourages and supports us in challenges. The climate crisis is too big and scary to face alone. We need the sense of belonging to something bigger than ourselves that community gives us. We need people around us who can join in celebrating every success, big or small, who can support each other in sustaining hope and keeping on. Only together can we persist in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds and reach our vision of leaving a legacy of love. The way today's younger people feel about our generation seems to run the gamut. Some are angry that we haven't done more; some look to us with hopeful expectation for the possibility that we could help lead toward a beautiful future. We cannot afford to turn away from their gaze. Together, we will show them what our love looks like through our willingness to show up, roll up our sleeves, and do what needs to be done to stop the destruction of our life support systems. We need to show them what our deepest love looks like by doing what needs to be done to create a sustainable life community on this beautiful Earth, the only home they will ever know.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 71 \"It's a Black-And-White-Warbler,\" he slowly said to me. \"I heard you the first time,\" I wanted to say but didn't. I really didn't want others to notice that I was the only one who couldn't see the birds. I was beginning to feel like the little boy in the story of The Emperor's New Clothes , the one who knew what he saw and it was nothing like what everyone said. I was there because I needed a hobby. It was going on one year since my husband and I had wanted to get pregnant. We had used everything known to medical science but that little tester-stick came up colorless every time. I had more frustration that year than I ever had known in life and needed desperately to get out of my life and into another space. A lovely friend had listened to my story and then said kindly, \"Have you any hobbies?\" I did have a few hobbies, but my sewing and crafting only kept me at home where everything reminded me of the baby we wanted. So here I was, miles from home in the woods with strangers in the second week of May. I had been holding my binoculars up every time these Audubon people called out their birds but wasn't seeing much. Their enthusiasm was drawing me in, but I didn't know how they could actually be seeing tiny birds, especially those called Warblers. I had been attracted to birds since I was a child. I remember buying four-inch models of them to take home and paint. I loved those birds and memorized their names. I painted them by number just as the directions said. But trouble was, I never saw any. Sure I had Woodpeckers at my backyard feeder. There were also Blue Jays and Sparrows: the same ones everyday. Nice as they were, I wanted to see the really exciting ones. You know, Scarlet Tanager, Baltimore Oriole, Indigo Bunting, and Yellow Warbler. I'd seen them in \"bird guides\" but had always looked upon them dubiously. Those birds must have been around in the past, sort of like dinosaurs. There wasn't much chance I could see them, I thought. Here I was again longing for the promise of those birds. I had seen an invitation in a local church bulletin that said everyone was welcome to come \"watch the Warblers while in their spring migration.\" I had wondered aloud at the church if this was for real. \"Yes,\" came the answer. \"There are beautiful South American birds coming up north just now to breed, and you, yes anyone, can see them. Can you borrow a pair of 'binos'?\" Well, sure, everyone has 'binos,' right? So I got some from a relative and showed up at 7 a.m. to see those beautiful birds. But that aggressive man wouldn't stop with me. \"Did you 'get' it yet?\" he wanted to know. Well, I'm not in the habit of lying, so I said with my head hanging, \"No, I didn't.\" \" No? Well let me see your binos! I'll get it for you.\" I didn't know then that everyone has to learn to use that birding tool and I was no different. Unbeknownst to me he was simply hoping he could adjust my binoculars in case that was keeping me from seeing what everyone else saw. \"Here, try it now,\" he said. \"Look for movement on that tree trunk and then bring the binos to your face. Do you see the tree trunk?\" \"Yes.\" It was true. I saw the trunk in the binos. Who could miss that? Whatever he had done had made all the difference. But still, no bird. \"Now move the binos up the trunk until you find the bird.\" I dutifully obeyed. Up, up the trunk I went until... a zebra? Not a zebra, a tiny bird that just looked like a zebra! It was an unbelievable sight! Excitement? Not the word. Awe. Amazement. No words. This tiny bird, which now was huge in my 'binos,' was walking up the tree trunk like a dog sniffing vegetation. I took the binos down because there were tears in my eyes. I took a breath and tried to imagine what the bird was like that I saw. Did it have a head color? A body color? Beak? Feet? Wings? I only saw black and white feathers in stripes all over. Had I really seen it? It was nothing like what I'd imagined. Nothing like I'd seen in the bird guides. A feeling of magnificence and meaning and truth shot through me like I know my own name. It said without words, \"Pay attention. This is important. This is life and you are just a part of it.\" I didn't see the Virgin Mary or God or my dead grandmother, but I felt like the Universe touched me in a new way. And I was hooked. That day, as my facility with binoculars got better, I started seeing more and more of the birds that the others were seeing. I realized this man wasn't being impatient, he had just wanted to share the magnificence of this with me. I couldn't wait to go on another \"Bird Walk.\" Of course, everyone sees birds. But that day I learned about \"Birders,\" those who decide to be where they can see more birds. Birders feel some connection to creatures with wings and they can never get enough. Is it a \"consuming hobby\"? It's probably different for everyone, but let me just say that it is controllable. It's a passion that will keep calling, gently reminding you that there is wonder and beauty to be known in birds. Did You Ever Want to Be a \"Birder\"? By Dawn Swartz \"It's a Black-And-White-Warbler,\" he slowly said to me. \"There are beautiful South American birds coming up north just now to breed, and you, yes anyone, can see them.

More on birding on page 72Blue Jay in nestThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 72 Beginning \"Birding\" If you ever wanted to be a \"birder,\" now is the time to get out there. Here are some practical tips. Find others who like birding. Audubon is a group that is everywhere and has been around quite awhile. There you will meet people who barely have to be asked to give a beginner some help. In our region, there are several groups that hold meetings and bird programs for the public, like Washtenaw Audubon Society (usually referred to as WAS), Michigan Audubon, Detroit Audubon, and Toledo Audubon. I recommend local beginners explore the WAS website first, Washtenawaudubon. org. WAS tends to have field trips in most months, and during the spring and fall migrations they have trips every week on Thursdays at 8 a.m. in Nichols Arboretum. These self-guided walks include all ages and are user-friendly. People go together, because the more eyes there are, the more birds you will see. Even if you don't know the birds you see, you can point out what you see and someone else will figure out what it is. So if you can see, you can contribute! And if you can't see, but you can hear, there, too, you can contribute. The give and take, the connection with others you have never met, are good for the soul and just plain fun! Washtenaw Audubon has hikes and caravan trips with leaders, so check the website often and plan ahead to get a start with others who will welcome your eyes and ears. It is a good idea to tell the leader that you are a beginner (I didn't know this back then...) so you can get extra help. Remember this is a non-competitive sport (not withstanding The Big Year ) and relies on honesty and candidness to get everyone working together. WAS also has meetings at the Matthaei Botanical Gardens on the third Wednesday of each month, September to June, at 7:30 p.m. Birding classes are offered at Leslie Science & Nature Center quite often in March through April, but the classes only have twenty spots and there is always a waitlist. Call early to get in on this. Other things to know about getting started:1. Most birders like to bird a lot during the migrations, which are in spring (roughly April and May) and fall (roughly September and October). This is because migrations provide the most birds to see, as well as, and this is key, a high species count. It's fun to see whatever birds are around, but the really sought-after birds are those you can hope for but not predict. Here are some terms that are helpful to know as you begin: \u00b7 Resident birds: those who live in the area year-round \u00b7 Migrants: those who are passing through to breed elsewhere \u00b7 Breeding birds: those who are having young where you see them \u00b7 Incidentals: those who are off their own species' usual course 2. You can \"bird\" anywhere and anytime, so do whatever gives you joy! I watch for Robins to build nests (breeding) in the spring in my yard. In five years at my address, I have noticed they come every year and often have two clutches (nesting cycles). I look to see how close they build nests to last year's nests and I am observant to when they are courting, nest-building, nest-sitting (on eggs), and feeding young in the nest, as well as when the fledglings are on the ground still begging for food. I love cheering them on from a distance, aware of their successes as well as their perils. From my home I have also seen nesting Chipping Sparrows, House Wrens, Chickadees, Grackles, and House Finches. But Robins have captivated me because they so regularly return to the same places to have their young. 3. Along with finding other birders, buying your own bird field guide is a must. If you like looking at it, give yourself time to just read and peruse. Any guide that you like will be fine. I recommend not buying one that has the birds in photographs. I know the pictures are beautiful and seem most realistic. But what you don't see is that the figure has actually gone through the eye of the camera before it came to you. It came in through certain light and you might not see the bird in that light. Thus, you might not recognize the bird you see when it is in a different light. Hand-drawn birds have been seen multiple times by the person before they draw it and that will temper their representation. In my experience, the drawings will be most \"realistic\" and actually more realistic than a photograph. But judge for yourself. There are different opinions on this, so of course, buy what you like to look at. Another consideration is, do you want to learn only the most common birds, or resident birds, of your area or would you also like to learn the migrants and breeding birds? Do you wish to have a field guide that only shows birds of your state, the Eastern U.S., or the whole of North America?

Most birders like to bird a lot during the migrations... Eagle Cedar Waxwing Common Loon4. The other necessity for birding is binoculars. The ideal birding binocular is 8 x 40. This is the best compromise between the magnification and field of view. These will let in enough light but also will show a steady picture with the distances one usually sees birds. At any higher magnification, binoculars will need to be on a tripod. And if you think you might ever want to use them to view insects, dragonflies, or butterflies, get the feature called \"close focus.\" The most important thing after you get your own pair is to take the time to practice using them before you are out in the field. Just practice finding an object that you see with the naked-eye and then see how quickly you can get that image in your field of view. Nimble birders see the most birds because birds usually have more to do than wait on us! 5. Of course, opportunities online have no limit. Pictures and video are everywhere for the Googling. If you want to learn to identify birds by ear, there are commercial products like CDs to train your ear. But there are also many free of charge on YouTube. Cornell University is one of the best-known places to study ornithology and offers many resources online. Another good resource can be found at: www . allaboutbirds.org /guide/search. With approximately 10,000 bird species worldwide and about 1/10 th of them coming to North America at some time each year, a multitude of birding adventures await you. So follow the pull to watch birds however, wherever, and whenever you wish \u2014 because when it's birds you want, the sky's the limit! Dawn Swartz has been \"birding\" since 1995 and her personal species count is 522. She takes annual trips to Magee Marsh and Point Pelee, Canada, and often joins Washtenaw Audubon's activities.

Most musicians and music lovers at least know the name, which has become synonymous with small children playing small string instruments. But it is actually much, much more. Where did this \"Suzuki stuff\" start? Shinichi Suzuki was born in Japan in 1898 the son of a violin factory owner. As you might imagine, violins were everywhere in his life, but it wasn't until he was an adult that he decided to play one instead of \"play around\" with one. His parents, being of means, sent him as a young man to study the violin in Germany, arguably the birthplace of Western music. While undergoing his studies, he became ill, and in his recuperation, had time to ruminate on the people around him. He noticed two things he thought worthy of further study: that each child, because of his environment, was able to learn to speak the German language with perfect inflection and nuance, and that, if this was possible with German, why not with the language of music? From those two insights, as well as the love in his own heart, came the impetus for his career of teaching and his philosophy of education. His Institute of Talent Education in Japan was begun in 1948 and he continued to teach there until about 1988. His death was in 1998. Suzuki said that the best learning came with love and produced joy! These then are the hallmarks of Suzuki Study, which currently includes violin, viola, cello, piano, bass, flute, recorder, guitar, and voice: \u00b7 A commitment is made to begin with one instrument. However, after beginning and learning what is entailed, some choose to study another as well. \u00b7 Parental involvement requires that the parent come to lessons to take notes, and then practices with the child daily. \u00b7 Putting music in the environment immediately after (if not before) birth. \u00b7 Each instrument has its own Suzuki repertoire, which is learned sequentially, so that the building blocks for playing found in each piece build upon the last ones. \u00b7 There is no need for \"exercises\" because the lessons for learning are found in the pieces themselves. \u00b7 A child in Suzuki Study is raised by a village, not just by parents; he or she can participate in regional playing opportunities, the Summer Institutes, and because of a common repertoire, can play with virtually any Suzuki student in the universe. If you are thinking about Suzuki study for your child, here is some advice on getting started. \u00b7 The best time to start Suzuki Study is when the child becomes old enough to have a relationship with someone who is not in her family. \u00b7 Look for teachers who are on the website suzukiassociation.org. Teachers listed there not only have facility with the instrument and educational knowledge but also have taken courses from Suzuki teacher trainers. \u00b7 Educate yourself: Suzuki has written several books. Among them are a couple of very shorts reads that will quickly help you understand his philosophy. The two shortest ones are Nurtured by Love (Alfred Music, 2013) and Ability Development from Age Zero (Alfred Music, 1999). \u00b7 Remember that any teacher can take a music course book off the shelf at the music store and teach from it. Using the Suzuki books alone without a teacher schooled in his philosophy cannot be called \"Suzuki Study.\" This method will work for you if you want to spend more time, rather than less, with your child as he or she grows. If your relationship is strained as this time, it is recommended that you wait until the relationship is healed before beginning Suzuki Study. Western Methods: Suzuki Methods: Students learn by eye, incorporating the ear to aid intonation and add expres-sion.Students initially learn by ear, then begin learning by eye as a separate skill years after beginning the instrument \u2014 just as talking and reading any language are separate. Learning happens in a team of two, student and teacher, but primarily the student learns from the teacher.The Suzuki Triangle brings the learning to all; student, parent, and teacher each work to set the student up for success and all are expecting to learn in the process. The student is told what to practice and how to practice it, and then left alone in silence (hopefully) to accomplish the goals.The teacher tells the parent in the child's hearing what each goal is for the week. The parent writes these down and the student and parent work together on the goals in practice in a specific way as taught by the teacher. Each student experiences his/her learn-ing alone until he or she is of the ability to join a band or orchestra.Every opportunity is taken to learn in groups: class lessons, Suzuki parties, and Summer Institutes. Dawn Swartz became Suzuki Certified in 2000 after earning her Bachelor's of Music Education degree. She lives in Ann Arbor in the Lawton School area with her husband and one son, who has studied both violin and piano for 14 years.

Suzuki said that the best learning came with love and produced joy! Parental involvement requires that the parent come to lessons to take notes, and then practices with the child daily.Teachers who have trained in the Suzuki philosophy are listed by zip code in the list kept on the Suzuki Association website. When you find teachers in your area, ask about their program. Once you have found your favorite things about the Suzuki way, ask if they include these things in their studio teaching. Also ask if they would be open your child (and parents) listening to a lesson or two being taught, which can give you an idea if a teacher will work best with your child and family. Suzuki experts recommend parents do this before \"signing on.\" How is Suzuki Study \"different\"? I like to talk about musical study apart from Suzuki as \"the Western Method.\" It may be unfair to group all other methods together, but for these purposes, I think Suzuki is different enough to stand alone.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 77 The sound of the r ain pounding on the roof of the little theater increased as I ascended the rickety steps at the back of the stage. The tiny barn on Ann Arbor's Old West Side had been restored to become the Carriage House Theatre. My head and shoulders emerged into the loft, which was cluttered with the sets of past productions. I crouched on the top step, straining to hear my cue over the rush of the rain. As I picked up my prop, a green plastic apple, and stuffed it into my vest, I reflected on how lucky my sister and I were to be founding members of the Spinning Dot Theatre Youth Company. It w as June 14, 2015. We were in our closing performance of The Bridge, the third and final play of the Youth Company season, which spanned the school year. I was relieved that the performances had gone pretty well, yet there was also a sadness. I had developed a close relationship with the director, her assistants, and the other actors, and it would be hard to say good-bye for the summer. Our small thea ter troupe made itself big in our hearts with its creativity and kindness. The first meeting took place in September, 2014, in the Ann Arbor Civic Theater rehearsal space. The amazing, energetic director, Jenny Anne Koppera, greeted us: \"Welcome to a year of firsts! This will be a year of new ideas and new possibilities!\" She wasn't kidding. Spinning Dot f ocuses on global theater, using material from all over the world. For example, The Bridge was written by a playwright from Kosovo, and our first play, Junkanoo!, was made up of various multicultural folktales. Presenting plays from other countries was a lot of fun and taught us about the customs and arts of other cultures. One of the r easons I've loved Spinning Dot so much is that kids get to participate in the creation of the projects. For example, we got to invent the story of Junkanoo! First, we brought in international stories about tricksters, but these weren't yet put together into a single story to perform. Then, one Friday at rehearsal, Jenny announced, \"I'm going to go out in this hallway. I'll shut the door and try not to listen in while you guys come up with a story for our play. You have five minutes.\" The company members huddled together in a tight circle. Occasionally, someone would have an idea and break away from the group to pace around while they refined it. Then they would come back and share their thoughts, which would be followed by, \"Yeah! I like that!\" or \"I still like this one,\" or \"Wait! I have a better idea!\" We kept asking Jenny for more time, and after about fifteen minutes, we had the story for our play. But we still needed a script, and for me, that was the best part, because I got to write it. Getting to write a play and then perform it was my favorite part of Spinning Dot. While I was working on the script, I asked myself a lot of questions, like \"Is this line worth including?\" and \"What would this character say here?\" One thing I found about writing a play that I also acted in is that it made it a lot easier to memorize my part. I put so much thought and effort into writing each sentence that I can recite almost the whole play.We performed Junkanoo! five times, including at a children's theater festival at Eastern Michigan University. It got better each time, and our audiences gave us great feedback. After Junkanoo!, we moved on to our next big project, the International One-Act Festival at EMU. A mix of college students and Youth Company members directed and acted in the plays. In fact, I had the pleasure of directing one called Thomas the Elephant. Before we got started, Jenny and another actor/director named Colleen gave us directing lessons. They taught us how to visualize each scene, stop the action during rehearsal, and give helpful tips to the actors. Directing the play was lots of fun, because I loved learning how to direct and got to work with such a great cast of adult and Youth Company actors. After the one-act festival, we focused on The Bridge. As with Junkanoo!, we were both cast and crew. For example, I helped manage the props and set. I learned a lot about the job of a propmaster, such as making lists of necessary props for each scene and rules for how to handle them. My friend Leo, who's a very talented musician, composed, arranged, and performed almost a full score for The Bridge. He had also written and arranged music for Junkanoo! Other castmembers worked on costumes and stage managing. Jenny and her wonderful co-director for The Bridge, Matthew Webb, taught us everything we needed to know. We rehearsed The Bridge for two months. On opening night, Jenny came back stage to where the company was gathered. \"No pressure, but lots of pressure,\" she said, giggling, \"because it's a full house!\" You could almost taste the nervousness in the air, including my own. Each performance was a little different and better than the last, and each one was sold out! It was really exciting to perform in front of standing-room-only crowds. The Spinning Dot Theatre Youth Company was just a mix of strangers when we first met, but now we talk to each other as old friends. I had a lot of fun acting with these new companions, and I'm extremely grateful to them for their friendship and hard work. This year of firsts has been one of the greatest experiences I've had in my eleven years on this spinning dot we all live on, and I will never forget it. I'm looking forward to our next season, when I can see my friends from the original company and welcome new actors, too.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 78 Playing with Crystals Kids are naturally drawn to crystals due to the color rays and subtle vibrations that each stone emanates. Some children may be drawn to a specific crystalline structure, such as the octahedron crystals of fluorite. Some may be attracted to the vibrant violet colors of amethyst, and some may be drawn to a particular crystal because it helps them feel good. Crystals are also an excellent way for children to stay connected and in tune with the earth. Often children are very intuitive when they use stones, always listening to the stone and where it wants to be used. Stones can be beneficial to them in a variety of ways just by keeping them in their aura. Children of all ages naturally gravitate toward crystals, and they are a wonderful way to have fun and explore. Crystals for Kids Aquamarine is an excellent stone for children who are over-sensitive, causing ADD/ADHD. They feel everything, including other people's feelings. Aquamarine brings in the light blue ray, shielding their aura with a soft blue calming light, helping them to discern their own feelings from those of others. It also opens their throat chakra, encouraging them to speak their truth. Children find the cooling energies of aquamarine calming, and they will often use it to draw excess heat away from the body. Children are nauturally drawn to amethyst's violet colors. Amethyst helps keep their crown chakra open, deepening their connection to the Divine. By bringing in the violet ray, amethyst overflows the wearer with a calming, peaceful energy. Children also find amethyst to be very calming, and they usually enjoy wearing it, sleeping with it, or using it at the crown chakra to help relieve headaches, excess energy, or tension. The sunshine golden rays of citrine help children feel confident and happy. Citrine opens the solar plexus chakra, transmuting all lower vibrational energies to positive \u2014 including thoughts, fears, and stress \u2014 while stimulating a sunny, cheery disposition. It is also one of a small handful of stones that never needs to be cleansed, so it can be very protective. Citrine is the best stone to support and amplify kids' positive intentions. Hematite, with its cool, calming energy, brings in the silver black ray, opening the base chakra and connecting children to the earth. It helps to draw away excess energy, allowing children to ground and center. It also reminds us that we are all channels of pure unconditional love and light. When kids work with hematite, they are intuitively drawn to use it near the feet or base chakra, which helps them to remember the importance of being here now. Children also love working with quartz crystals. Often when kids are building healing crystal arrays, they use quartz to help transmit their pure intentions. Quartz crystal brings in the rainbow white light ray, clearing away lower vibrational energies and bestowing clarity and focus. It transmits all types of energies, can be used in healing work, and aids with meditation by helping the mind to focus. It is a stone that benefits all of our chakras. When children wear quartz, it expands their aura in a protective white light bubble. Children are attracted to the soft, calming pinks and blacks of rhodonite. Rhodonite is the best stone to stop panic attacks \u2014 the black mineral, manganese, grounds excess energy while the pink rhodonite overflows the body with the highest amount of unconditional love and peace. It also brings in the unconditionally loving pink ray, helping to heal kids' hearts. It encourages and enhances one's natural talents and abilities. The manganese is beneficial for alleviating headaches and muscle cramps. Often children like to place rhodonite on their heart chakra to open their hearts and eliminate stress. They also like to place it in their auric field, which helps awaken their latent talents and skills. Kids are drawn to the natural unconditional love that pours out of rose quartz. Rose quartz opens their heart chakra, helping them to release stress and heal emotional wounds while increasing self valuation and love. It helps us to be receptive to the By Jennifer VanderWal highest amount of unconditional love and the importance of self love. Children are often drawn to hold rose quartz in their hands, or they will intuitively know to place it on a chakra or part of the body that needs more self love. Even with a high vibration, sugilite emits a grounding, calming energy from the violet ray. It is an excellent stone for children because it raises their vibration to the same vibration they had when they chose their life path, so it reminds them of their path, purpose, and what they came here to do. It also opens and aligns our crown and higher chakras. Sugilite is a great stone for children these days because most of their high anxiety comes from wanting to remember their life purpose. Children are often drawn to meditate with this stone in their third eye chakra, or place it above the crown chakra. Crystal Arrays Crystal arrays are constructed based on the energies we want to be transmitted. For example, if a child has a lot of excess energy, placing calming stones together in a calming shape will help to transmit these calming energies to them. Or if you want to use the stones for healing, you can choose specific healing stones based on your intent, and place the stones in a healing pattern, and they will work together to transmit the intended energies. Here is a great crystal array that is fun to construct with your kids; the peaceful, calming energies it transmits are particularly beneficial when the array is left in your child's bedroom. You will need one piece each of amethyst, aquamarine, rhodonite, and rose quartz. Have your child place the stones in a circle or any shape that feels good to them. Encourage them to use other stones that they may be attracted to or what feels good to them. A good pattern for releasing excess energies is a counterclockwise spiral. The feminine energies of the counterclockwise circle help to ground excess energy and send it to the earth. Because often children's stress comes from not remembering their life path, another useful array to try involves sugilite, rhodonite, and hematite. The stones are arranged in a triangular shape, and kids can meditate in this array, or it can be placed under their bed or at the crown chakra. Sugilite helps children remember their life purpose; rhodonite helps them identify with their talents and skills; and hematite helps them to ground their talents and skills physically to the earth and remember that we are all channels of pure love and light.

Teaching sewing, which I'm passionate about and really good at, allows me to help people feel good about themselves.... As a teacher, I not only want to foster learning, but build self-esteem and inspire confidence, which hopefully will spill over into other parts of my students' lives. Working from home gave Reinstein the flexibility she wanted, allowing her to see her kids more, who were in elementary school at the time. \"I could join them on field trips and bring a supplemental family income to our home,\" she said. \"It was also a teenage dream come true \u2014 I always wanted my own sewing business.\" Reinstein's studio and school is nestled in her southeast Ann Arbor home. It's cozy, warm, and welcoming, and loaded with all the right stuff to successfully complete any project sewn by any student, beginner and advanced alike. There are four sewing stations with 16 stitch sewing machines and all the right tools, including measuring tapes, marking pencils, pins, scissors, and rippers. A large table for cutting and ironing material is a focal point surrounded by bins of every size loaded with patterns that she has on hand for students needing help getting started. Lots of brightly colored spools of thread stand ready. The walls are decorated with students' projects. Blouses, shirts, doll clothes, an elastic band skirt, and snugly felt animals respectfully display the wide range of ages, interests, and skills of students who attend All Sewn Up! The studio is well lit, with natural light from large wall-to-wall windows that look onto a lovely backyard with lots of trees and shrubs. The atmosphere is relaxed and industrious all at once; perfect to inspire any creative vision. Classes are small, with just four students, to optimize learning through individual attention. Classes are one hour in length. Reinstein also offers camps at winter and spring breaks and during the summer. What's especially unique about her classes is the age and ability mix of the students. The combinations of young adults, retirees, teens, tweens, and children starting as young as age 6 help students push past barriers they might otherwise accept. Being in a mix of generations feels natural and real-to-life. As Reinstein put it, \"Adults are motivated by kids and kids are cheered by adults. Kids worship the adults and adults think, 'If this six year old can make this shirt, then certainly I can.'\" Everybody wins. Many students have very little experience with a needle and thread. Many have attended a class before, building on experience gained from previous projects. Several students are regulars, attending throughout the year. Beginners learn how to use the sewing machine safely and comfortably, doing simple projects to practice sewing straight lines, such as a pillow, pillowcase, or drawstring bag. Prior to class and camp, students email sewing project details to Reinstein, including pattern numbers if available, so she can be sure the project is a match between the right amount of challenge and the student's abilities \u2014 something that won't be too frustrating or ruin sewing forever. \"There are skirts, and then there are skirts. Some patterns are much more complicated and require an experienced eye to see that. Some projects need to be vetoed for the best interests of the student,\" she explained. Reinstein welcomes what students want to do as long as they can do it. \"When students ask me to sew for them, I refuse,\" she said. Every sewing project is an opportunity to practice reading directions, pictures, and diagrams. Students are encouraged to read directions and try to follow them by themselves. My theory is that if they can draw their own conclusions, the learning will stay with them longer. Of course, if they don't understand, I explain and demonstrate what to do. Since everyone learns differently, I re-explain information when students don't understand until it makes sense.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 80 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community I have a deep appreciation for the sewing enthusiast or professional seamstress. I was the kid who wore home-sewn outfits on school photo day, Halloween, and at birthday parties. Corduroy suits, button down blouses, school totes, and witch costumes \u2014 my mom found the pattern and figured it out. She was fabulous. So good, in fact, she taught night school sewing classes (in addition to her day jobs!) to supplement the family income. As a kid, I took this for granted, an attitude that didn't change until I found myself as an adult with piles of socks needing darning and shirts with missing buttons. The basics intimidated me. Sewing something from scratch was elusive to me; a recipe of instructions I never learned. The prescribed ugly blouse made in middle school home economics made bad much worse. To this day, sewing from choice \u2014 and sewing beautiful, useful things \u2014 is a marvel to me. I see it as a symbol of girl or boy gone indie; the power to elevate personal style on a budget in a fashion culture saturated with sameness and brand names. Now as an adult, I see the benefits of sewing are many, and, with a good teacher, can transform elusive into entertaining. This became evident when I met Anne Reinstein, owner of All Sewn Up! Sewing School in Ann Arbor. As Reinstein put it, \"Sewing is a huge esteem builder. It's a skill for life.\" Spending a few afternoons at her school showed me that sewing is a fun-centric activity for kids and families seeking ways to feel good, mentally focused, and fashionable on a dime. I witnessed how taking on a sewing project offers a unique way to intentionally seek connection with our creative selves and focus this energy to build skills and confidence. Especially in kids, it fosters an \"I can do it\" attitude that translates outside the sewing lab experience, inspiring vision for future projects and even life goals. Reinstein explained that the act of choosing a pattern or project suited to a student's creative vision supports self-actualization, a value she champions as a teacher. \"It's amazing to support a student through a project and see them come into confidence about themselves and their abilities. Leaving my studio wearing the sewn shirt on their back, or whatever it is they made, is testament to the pride that's achieved by completing a project they chose to do,\" she said. In 2006, Reinstein was selected by MTV in New York to teach a teenage boy from Huron High School how to sew so he could actualize his dream to become a fashion designer. He left her studio wearing a swanky, custom designed jacket he made himself from lessons with Reinstein. He won first place on the hit show Made. He made it! In just four weeks, he had become what he wanted to become: a talented fashion designer. New , Fun , and Just Plain Cool By Lisa Gribowski Smith All Sewn Up!

The atmosphere is relaxed and industrious all at once; perfect to inspire any creative vision.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 81 Some students come without patterns and use hers. She also guides students to use their imagination and draw their own pattern. \"A young boy really wanted to sew a tool box for his dad. So together we drew a wrench design and dad got a nifty tool bag from a very proud son,\" she said. The excited chatter of students and busy buzz of the sewing machines show that Reinstein's empowerment style of instruction really works. When I arrived at her home, I was immediately impressed with the adorable utility of the house for students. A handwritten note on the front door directs students to the studio. I followed the happy sounds of children and tweens at sewing camp chattering sweetly about their projects. The kitchen adjacent to the studio showed signs of a tasty snack just enjoyed. Reinstein serves healthy snacks made from scratch and fruit; no packaged, sugary stuff. The summer camp session I attended was extra animated: twin siblings, age 9, and boy and girl tweenie friends. The projects were as varied as the students themselves: American Girl doll outfits, a tablet case, and a self-designed dragon stuffed animal. The atmosphere was relaxed and engaged with students learning by doing. Reinstein answered each and every question with genuine attention, impressive detail, and fresh interest. The energy in the studio was pure harmony. I was impressed and amazed! There was this dynamic triple layer of interaction going on that Reinstein facilitated beautifully: first, the individual sewing projects and all the hands-on learning these naturally entail; second, the group project of discovery, of learning how much fun sewing is and expressing this with needle and thread; and third, the friendship and camaraderie naturally unfolding in class with humor and quiet conversation. What was especially remarkable to me was the level of calm and concentration Reinstein maintained as she gracefully adapted to the questions and needs coming at her rapid speed. She treats individual projects as shared opportunities for learning. Sewing becomes a group experience in many ways, which fuels a shared excitement to create and finish projects. Later that day, over the telephone, I discovered the special source of Reinstein's calm, the magic that makes Anne uniquely Anne. Reinstein comes from a family of ten. She is the fifth child of eight children. Raised in a two-bedroom home her parents converted to four bedrooms in east Detroit, Reinstein is used to sharing space. Lack of privacy and living with constant, happy, controlled commotion is second nature to her. Growing up, there was always something going on. We lived in a neighborhood full of large families. All the kids played together. Dinnertime was announced by the sound of a bell my mother rang on the porch. We all listened for this. At home, everyone had a job. Children took care of meals, setting and clearing the table. As we got older, we graduated to more complex jobs. Everyone was expected to do chores. Reinstein's father was a well-paid hair stylist and her mother was a schoolteacher. She was fired when she got pregnant because \"that's just what happened in those days.\" The back drop to Reinstein's success as a seamstress is due in large part to the independence expected from her and her siblings to help the family survive on single income earnings. At age 13, she was expected to provide all the basics of her own wardrobe beyond her school uniform. By necessity, she learned to sew on her grandmother's 1940's two-stitch Singer sewing machine. She started with an apron, and then moved on quickly to a blouse and trendy 1970's wide leg slacks. Soon she was making her own prom and homecoming gowns. In 1990, she bought her first sewing machine: 25 stitches, automatic, with a one-step buttonhole. After working with a machine attachment requiring a lot more steps, she said it was \"magic and amazing and blew my mind!\" Reinstein is warm, generous, and attentive \u2014 a lot like a favorite doting relative, the one who makes you feel like the only person in world that matters is you. This makes it possible for students to trust their creative vision and the flow of its unfolding through hands-on learning. She makes it safe. Reinstein welcomes mistakes, joking that she is in the \"Hall of Fame of Mistakes\" and would like students to join her. Mistakes give students credibility in class. It's an opportunity to rise to the challenge of not knowing what to do and figuring it out. We get to celebrate the learning together and see the skill success on the actual shirt, bag, jacket, or whatever the child is sewing.... [Students] show off the accomplishment to other students and their parents later, wearing it or carrying it out of class. A huge esteem builder! I asked Katarina Berens, age 12, who started classes with Reinstein when she was 9, and now attends weekly and in the summer, what All Sewn Up! has meant to her. She enthusiastically answered: \"Sewing is so cool, I get to make things I would normally buy in the store. In class, Anne tells me to make mistakes so I can fix them when I am by myself. I am already on my second sewing machine, which has way more stitches and is more complex.\" Berens has sold merchandise for three years at the Ann Arbor Art Fair in the Kids Tent. This year she sold string bags in several different sizes, doll aprons, and headbands. \"I am learning about business and how to sell to people because you can't just expect stuff to sell while you're sitting back,\" she said. Berens is also planning to sell on Etsy. I can confidently say that meeting Anne Reinstein has lifted my dread of joining needle with thread. My bad memories of failed home economics projects are fading out, replaced by a renewed notion that sewing is actually fun, and that taking a class alongside little kiddies for inspiration seems like a fabulous idea. My daughter, who just turned eight, is the perfect class companion. While she reminds me and others frequently that she's not a \"girlie girl,\" I'm guessing cool soccer patterned material to commemorate the historic championship of the U.S. Women's Soccer team against Germany will convince her to join me at Reinstein's studio. While I'm not aspiring to be my mom or anywhere near a DIY mama for my kid and hubby, I say \"yes\" to any fun, new opportunity to hang out and bond with my darling daughter. Besides, I'm excited to sleep atop my very own pillowcase sewn by none other than me. All Sewn Up! Sewing School is located at 3 Medford Circle, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104.

Column continued on page 82 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 82 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the CommunityNew , Fun , and Just Plain Cool Column continued from page 81 Hope Clinic I discovered Hope Clinic in downtown Ypsilanti through my friend and neighbor, Mia Moyad. It's normal routine to stop and chat when we pass each other on foot or by car, exchanging weekly highlights, updates, and news. I followed her intentional journey from graduate studies at the University of Michigan School of Social Work to employment as Manager of the Social Work Department and Patient Advocate at Hope. Over several visits, I discovered what an exceptional place Hope really is; a haven for local families offering practical support through various programs, professional guidance, and heart felt support. Here Moyad is at her finest, doing what comes so naturally: compassion for suffering and service to ease the hurt. Always happy, optimistic, and deeply caring about the person before her, her calm presence reassures, creating a confidence that everything is going to be ok. The goodness I experience every time I'm with Moyad is the same feeling a person can expect when they arrive at Hope. \"Unconditional acceptance and respect with no questions asked\" is how Moyad described the welcome people can expect at Hope. She delivers, as do all the staff and volunteers at Hope. \"Poverty has many faces and our job here is to give services to those who ask for help with graciousness and non-judgment to restore dignity where difficult life circumstances have degraded morale and make life hard,\" she explained. Moyad has a team of seven social workers. They work on a patient-by-patient basis to remove barriers, offering kind and practical support to make things better. As I sat in her office, a young homeless father, age 25, arrived. He needed a document signed by a social worker to be eligible for public housing. He was surviving homelessness by \"couch surfing,\" moving from couch to couch at the homes of friends, relatives, and acquaintances. He was tired and overwhelmed, earning just $30 per week after child support was deducted. As he described his life to Moyad, he frequently repeated, \"There's just a lot going on,\" referring to the mass of details he was trying to manage each day to survive and meet his basic needs. Moyad's job is to zero in on the immediate need and take care of it when possible in real time. She aims to empower clients with whatever knowledge and emotional support they need to do the next best, necessary step to take care of themselves independently. Moyad took care of the form, made sure he had enough food, and described ways to access more services at Hope if he needed them. Hope is a nonprofit, inter-denominational Christian organization located at 518 Harriet Street, strategically positioned on a bus route, near neighborhoods, and with easy access to Interstate 94. Patients are from all faiths and reflect the diverse racial and ethnic make-up of America. Hope has about 30 staff and approximately 300+ doctors, dentists, nurses, and miscellaneous skilled and talented volunteers. Services at Hope are extensive, addressing the whole person: mind, body, and spirit. Free dental and medical care, including free medicine and food relief programs are provided. Skillful, professional support to navigate government programs, hospital charity care, and other community and state programs are among the many ways Hope guides people to have basic life necessities. Asked about her work, Moyad shared: A big part of my job is to teach patients how to get what they need from organizations and institutions to remove barriers, attain basic necessities, and some kind of quality of life. Sometimes this means translating a job application, practicing a mock job interview, or making a phone call to a difficult landlord to guide a client through a scary or intimidating situation or bureaucratic process. When we don't have the resources on staff, we get in touch with one of our volunteers to try to fill a void. Clients often need help learning to budget their money, which is critical to their independence. I have a financial planner who volunteers her expertise. A person can end up homeless by using money for rent on a sudden, unexpected expense. A mother and daughter lost their apartment and lived out of their car for four months when they didn't receive the IRS refund they expected and paid a vet bill for a sick cat. As soon as they had housing, our financial advisor met with the mother to give her skills to avoid this happening again. Many of Hope's patients manage severe or chronic health conditions, including diabetes or neurological disorders including epilepsy. Some are challenged with depression or other psychiatric conditions that require medication, regular supervision from a doctor, as well as support to navigate the healthcare system. A primary responsibility for Moyad is to explain the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, to patients, as well as the Medicaid expansion. She said: Hospitals offer charity care programs to those who qualify. Most patients don't know this. Helping patients access this requires knowing where to go, what forms to fill out, and all the bureaucratic details to deal with to access the care. It's detail oriented and time consuming, but very, very rewarding to help a patient get the care they need and deserve. Hope medical doctors and I recently advocated for a young boy who needed surgery. His parents didn't have the funds nor the medical insurance. We were able to facilitate the operation and transportation through Shriners Hospital. Hope has several programs available that are especially helpful to families. KIDS CAN COOK: A fun, skill-building program for 8 weeks, beginning in October 2015. It emphasizes nutrition within budgetary constraints, healthy portions, cooking techniques, and fosters friendship through conversation at meal times. At the end of the program, children prepare and serve a full-course meal to their parents. Mia Moyad Hope Clinic is a haven for local families offering practical support through various programs, professional guidance, and heart felt support. \"Poverty has many faces and our job here is to give services to those who ask for help with graciousness and non-judgment to restore dignity where difficult life circumstances have degraded morale and make life hard.\" -Mia Mo yad Hope has about 30 staff and approximately 300+ doctors, dentists, nurses, and miscellaneous skilled and talented volunteers. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 83 FOOD PANTRY and FRESH PRODUCE: Three times per week by appointment families who qualify for monthly groceries can pick up pre-packed groceries or \"shop\" for themselves in the food pantry. There is also an emergency supply of food packages available to those in immediate need, anytime no questions asked. Fresh produce is available two times per week from Hope's brand new fresh produce building. HOT MEALS: Served on Saturdays and Sundays from 4-5 p.m., meals are available to anyone who shows up. BABY CARE EMERGENCY PROGRAM: Every Thursday from 2-4 p.m. essential items for infants, including diapers, wipes, food, and formula, are available to parents. Donated, lightly-used clothing items are displayed for the taking when available. Layettes are also available by appointment for newborns. WASH WITH CARE: A busy laundry service available to families by appointment, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. In 2014, as many as 253 households did 6,895 loads of laundry. Free washers, dryers, and laundry detergent are provided. There is a playroom with toys and books adjoining the laundry room to entertain children while laundry is underway. On my visits to Hope, I met a number of families doing laundry. Here, between machine cycles and while folding piles of children's clothes, I learned about the central place of Hope in clients' lives. Gloria, aged 44, a single mother of 12, has been a client since 1995, when she arrived in Michigan from New Jersey with her first child. I found Hope in the neighborhood. When I could walk, I walked here to do my laundry with my children, or come for a meal on weekends. I worked at McDonald's and could barely make my rent. Hope donated a washer and dryer to me, and then a van. The van really inspired me to want more for myself. I'd think about all the things I could do if I could just drive there. The van inspired me to want more for myself and my children. While the washer and dryer eventually broke down, Gloria still drives the van. She is unable to work due to chronic pain and swelling in her legs. Despite the many daily challenges Gloria and her children face to simply survive, they along with many families experience life as happier and more manageable because of the love and support they can count on from Hope staff and volunteers.

And it is never too late to discover it! It is our \"inner GPS\" and our birthright. of the term \"mother's intuition\" or \"women's intuition\"? Well, it's not just for females anymore! Many people aren't aware of their intuition or don't believe they have any. People often think that you have to be \"special\" to be intuitive, or that it only applies to those who've been aware of it from birth. Some people think that the term \"intuitive\" only applies if you know that you're psychic and can read minds or predict the future. None of which is the case! Mothers are said to have keen intuition because they develop a heightened awareness of what's going on with their babies. This is likely an evolutionary necessity, since pre-speech children cannot communicate their needs easily. But we all have the need to sense our environment and listen to our inner guidance. And we all have intuition. It just needs to be acknowledged, developed, and trusted.I first started exploring my intuition when I went to the Body Mind Spirit Festivals that the New Age newspaper phenomeNews held at Macomb Community College in the 1990s. There I met a psychic who was teaching psychic development classes. It sounded like fun, and I was ready to try something different \u2014 although I wasn't sure I had any ability. In my first psychic development class, I marveled at what other students could get, but never thought I was receiving anything much. Then, through various exercises, I eventually learned to recognize the intuitive information I was getting. It turns out that I am especially strong in clairvoyance (clear seeing, in my mind). It was beyond exciting, as a new world opened up to me. I've taken a variety of classes over the years. I had no idea in the beginning that I'd evolve to do paid readings for the public! One of the reasons why I'm now hosting Holistic Psychic Fairs is to expose the public to this knowledge that has enriched my life. And it's also why I've begun to teach Intuition Development \u2014 to share the gift of intuition with others.by Amy B. Garber Photos by Joni Strickfaden When I was first guided to start the social/educational group \"Intuitives Interactive\" three years ago, I figured it would attract people like me \u2014 i.e., \"mature\" women. And it does. But the group also has a healthy balance of men who are exploring their right-brain side, and the attendees range in age from twenty-somethings through people in their seventies. Children and teens have also attended with their parents. There are over 400 members in the Intuitives Interactive group on Meetup.com, and over 200 on our Facebook organization page. We get new people visiting the group each time. So when I open the meeting, I usually repeat this quote from the University of Michigan Division of Public Safety's crime alert messages: \"Trust your intuition. If a particular situation makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, choose an alternative.\" See? Even the U-M police acknowledge that intuition is real and should be followed! You may not realize when you are accessing your intuition, because most of us do this naturally without thinking about it. But intuition improves when we practice it, acknowledge it, and listen to it. Let's say that you have an impulse to take a different way home from work one day. You may not consciously see the reason to do it. Honor it! It could be that you will avoid a traffic jam, have extra time to hear something meaningful on the radio, or see a place that you wouldn't have found otherwise. Often it's easiest to exercise our intuition with people with whom we have a strong connection. Someone you haven't talked to in ages comes to your mind and you're not sure why. Pay attention to it and follow up with that person. You'll likely get the response, \"I can't believe you called! I need to talk to you!\" I believe that when we are using our intuition, we are accessing our Higher Self or Soul, our individualized piece of the Source/Oneness/Collective Consciousness \u2014 which has infinite wisdom. To quote Sanaya Roman's channeled book, Being Your Higher Self: \"[Your Higher Self] exists in a realm where all beings are united as one multidimensional consciousness.... Your Higher Self usually talks to you through your intuition and feelings. It can also communicate by sending you odd coincidences and synchronicity.... As you strengthen your connection to your Higher Self, you will experience increasing insights, revelations, and expanded awareness.\" Intuition can guide us through life, helping us to aid ourselves and others, avoid pitfalls, generate ideas, solve problems, and more. If I need to make an important decision, I'll ask my Higher Self for guidance. I tend to get the \"knowing\" or ideas automatically now. But there are various ways you can get an answer, aside from learning divination tools like tarot cards, muscle testing, or a pendulum. If you practice meditation, ask the question when you begin to meditate and see what you get. You can journal in a meditative state and get an answer (called We all have the need to sense our environment and listen to our inner guidance. And we all have intuition.

What services do you offer?Virginia June: White Wolf Healing was established as a business in January of 2010, and offers monthly trainings in the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) ear acupuncture protocol. This protocol is specific to addiction and dual diagnosis treatment. It is used for smoking cessation, stress management, pain management, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and addictions to food, drugs, alcohol, and gambling. I have been a registered trainer with NADA for over ten years. The training we provide leads to a certificate to become an \"Auricular Detox Specialist\" who can work in the state of Michigan under the supervision of an M.D. or D.O. I also offer auricular acupuncture to individuals and small groups. Julianne Linderman: What does the NADA ear acupuncture method involve? When did you discover it? Virginia June: The protocol involves the insertion of five extremely fine (smaller than two hairs) needles into specific points in the outside of each ear. I discovered it in 2002. My supervisor at the time was an Auricular Detox Specialist with NADA. She allowed me to observe a treatment with a patient who was experiencing overwhelming anxiety and wanted to leave inpatient treatment. Within five minutes of the needles being placed in her ear, the patient fell sound asleep for a half hour. Afterwards, she was completely calm and relaxed. She was able to successfully complete her inpatient stay. I knew right then that this was one of the best protocols I had ever seen as a clinical social worker. I was a strong advocate for incorporating it into treatment. JL: How are you incorporating this method into your current work? VJ: My utmost passion and greatest joy is teaching the NADA protocol. I have been teaching over ten years. I teach on a monthly basis and love the passion students have, and the many different ways they plan to implement auricular acupuncture into their practices. I teach an array of professionals, from physicians and social workers to friends and family of addicted individuals \u2014 no prior experience in acupuncture is necessary to receive training. After training, if one wishes to offer this protocol for monetary purposes, he or she must do it under the supervision of an M.D. or D.O., but training equips a person to practice the technique on friends or family members without medical supervision. I have been a therapist in the addiction field for over 25 years. I am a recovering addict/alcoholic with 28 years of sobriety. In addition to teaching, I see patients in my private auricular acupuncture practice to support their recovery, and I also travel to other drug and alcohol treatment facilities in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. I have trained practitioners at the Detroit Veteran's Hospital. I am very happy to say that many drug courts are beginning to implement this protocol. JL: Why is the ear so effective in healing? How does it interact with other parts of the body? VJ: The ear is a microcosm of the macrocosm (body). An acupuncturist can treat the entire body from the ear. It is the first organ that is formed in utero, so it has an energetic connection to the entire system. Acupuncture uses needles to manipulate and open the energetic meridians in the body so the body can function at its optimum. JL: Why is ear acupuncture particularly useful in treating addiction? VJ: It is particularly effective in treating addiction because it is a non-verbal process, and it has an immediate response. There is no need for the patient to reveal any personal information to the practitioner. Most individuals seeking help with addiction have some degree of difficulty with trusting other people. There is no need for an assessment of the patient. The protocol is just as effective even if the patient does not share his or her story. NADA auricular acupuncture is based on five specific points that are mapped out on the surface of the ear. They are: Shenmen or Spirit Ga te - used for calming and relaxing S ympathetic - used for relieving tension Liv er - used to detoxify, as well as to relax and relieve anger and frustration Kidne y - used to strengthen the willpower and release unwanted toxins Lung - used t o help respiration, as well as for detoxification JL: Can you share with us a story of how you have seen ear acupuncture positively affect a patient with addiction treatment? VJ: Many patients have tremendous anxiety and/or depression about letting go of their best friend (the drug and/or drink). Many times, I place the needles in the ear and the patient falls fast asleep within five minutes, and after sleeping for 30 to 45 minutes, he or she wakes up feeling rejuvenated, as if receiving a full night's sleep. I have had patients with chronic pain issues cry with me because it was the first time in five years that they were completely pain free. Veterans have gotten such great results from this simple technique that they demanded that the V.A. get the NADA protocol implemented into their hospitals. One veteran I worked with had not been able to sleep without being violent or having nightmares since his return from Afghanistan, and after treatment, he slept comfortably for over an hour and cried tears of joy when he awoke. Some patients are not sure they want to quit their substances immediately, but know in the back of their mind that they need to quit. Many people have stopped smoking after as few as six sessions. For other patients with opiate or cocaine addictions, the acupuncture helped eliminate urges and cravings that so often plague a recovering person for weeks or even months after stopping use. I had a patient who was coming for pain management who wanted to get off all the opiates because the opiates slowed down his thinking processes. He had been in chronic pain for five years, even with pain medications. He was in tears and stated, \"Virginia, you have no idea what this means to me. This is the first time in three years I have been completely pain-free ... even if it is just these five minutes, it is a miracle to me.\" Virginia June is a licensed social worker with the state of Michigan and has over 25 years of experience in the addiction field. She is a Certified Advanced Alcohol and Drug Counselor and a Registered Trainer with the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA).

Both herbs have been used in many forms, especially as tea, oil, and dried bundles for smudging. Mugwort ( Artemisia vulgaris ) As the Latin name implies, mugwort is named after the lunar goddess Artemis. It has both magical and practical properties, and is famously known for its dream-enhancing abilities. In the Middle Ages, people believed that putting mugwort into a burning fire would offer protection from lightning strikes. On a household level, mugwort is used in gardens and also in sachets placed among clothes to protect from moths. In the Far East, particularly Japan, Korea, and China, mugwort is used to flavor rice dishes, and in Germany, there is a tradition of using it to flavor the Christmas dinner goose. Mugwort is also known for its protective qualities, and various cultures throughout history believed that it protected from evil spirits, wild animals, and disease. For personal protection, it is bundled or included in sachets or amulets. Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs lists the spiritual powers of mugwort to include strength, psychic abilities, prophetic dreams, healing, and astral projection. Mugwort can be burned as a smudge to clear negative energies from a home or space, or to clear one's own personal energy field. Historically, people have stuffed pillows with mugwort to aid lucid dreaming and put wreaths on their homes for protection. Bathing in mugwort tea is one Native American method for purifying one's emotions and spirit. Some Native Americans include mugwort in their smoking mixtures as part of the pipe ceremony to call out to the Great Spirit. There is evidence that mugwort has some ability to induce a mild altered state. As such, the consumption of mugwort, either as a tea or as part of a smoking mixture, has been used as a preparation for divination, astral protection (out-of-body travel), lucid dreaming, and for shamanic journeying. Additionally, the herb has been used as incense, particularly by the Aztecs. As a medicinal herb, mugwort is particularly associated with the treatment of colds, rheumatism, inflammation, fatigue, and digestion. Related to wormwood, mugwort is considered to be a tonic for digestive issues and even a cure for digestive parasites. Romans put mugwort in their sandals to help with foot pain. For women, mugwort is considered to be an emmenagogue \u2014 used to stimulate blood flow in the pelvic region and the flow of menstruation. Cultures in the Far East particularly have used mugwort as a tea to help with colds and fevers. In Chinese medicine, mugwort is called \"moxa\" and is the herb used in Chinese moxibustion. This procedure involves burning the mugwort close to the patient's skin to warm and stimulate the meridians of the body. Sage (Salvia officinalis ) In the United States, sage is probably best known as a culinary herb, and secondarily as a smudging herb used by Native Americans. It has many properties in common with mugwort, particularly its use for purification, protection, feminine issues, and inflammatory conditions.As a smudge, sage is often combined with either cedar or sweetgrass, bundled together, and tied with twine. The smoke is used to clear out negative energies in preparation for shamanic healings, house clearings, and rituals. It helps to make a space sacred. In ancient times, some people believed that eating sage every day could make a person immortal, protect them from harm, and help them to gain wisdom; some people would carry sage in their pocket. Like mugwort, sage may also be included in smoking mixtures used in the Native American pipe ceremony. Sage has a long history as a healing herb. It can be used as a tea or a gargle to help with sore throats or any type of inflammation or bleeding in the mouth, and even to reduce drooling for people with diseases like Parkinson's. Sage is also known to be a tonic for the liver and kidneys, a digestive tonic, and a blood purifier. It is supposed to be good for rheumatism and for reducing excessive menstrual bleeding, as well as for cleaning wounds and ulcers. Since ancient times, people have believed that sage promotes better brain function, and so in modern times, this herb is being investigated for its potential in benefitting Alzheimer's patients. In my own practice as a shamanic practitioner, I use sage extensively as a smudge, both to clear the aura around clients who come in for healing, and to help clear negative energies out of houses when I am called to do a house clearing. After doing healing work with clients, I typically instruct them to take a hot bath in Epsom or sea salt, with a dash of lavender essential oil, but mugwort tea would make a nice substitute. Sage and mugwort can enter your life in a variety of forms, whether to enhance dreams, aid in relaxation, clear the energy in your home, or improve health. Whatever forms you wish to explore, you will certainly come to appreciate the benefits of these extraordinary plants.

The Crazy Wisdom Calendar by Kathleen Riley Photo by Joni Strickfaden T he T herapeutic P ower of Memoir Writing By the end of my first edit, I was able to self-witness my dilemmas and laugh at myself. Because I could laugh at myself, I knew I was forming a healthy sense of detachment. I also noticed that I no longer had the desire to repeat telling my story over and over again because I had captured it on paper to share with my family, community, and the world. When you capture your story on paper, you no longer have to worry about remembering the timeline, who did what to whom, or question why your life ended up the way it did, or re-live the intensity of the story's emotion. It makes it easier to let go of the past, forgive yourself and others, and begin to focus more on where you are now in positive ways. Around the time you reach your second edit, what occurs is an integration of self, where the authentic is born. From this place forward, exaggerated views and behaviors mysteriously melt away and healthier new realities form. You feel whole and full of joy. Your heart is open in acceptance of yourself and others. You see humor in being human and you can actually hear yourself laugh from the belly on up. Your eyes are open to what God must have been seeing all along \u2014 a beautiful wonderful self inside of you. When all is said and done, of course, I have no proof that writing my memoir has reversed what might be genetically predisposed, but what I do know is that it was a healthy form of self-love, an act of courage, and a pathway of self-acceptance leading me to uncover the healthy parts inside. It has helped me be honest with myself in hopes of writing a better ending. And, amazingly and to my surprise, there are no more long suffering bouts of depression, sadness, or heartache. They have all vanished. Even my anxiety around public speaking, and intrusive ruminating thoughts, or what is known as an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), are gone. As for the overarching purpose, What You Feel Is Real serves for my family and future generations as a time capsule, piecing together important life events that are influencing their lives today. For readers, I am happy to share and connect with them through my memoir of healing and purpose as it represents my reset button of personal wellbeing during this time and place in my life. Kathleen Riley is the founder of The Dove House (www.thedovehouse.org), a center for healing and wellness beyond recovery. She is the author of What You Feel Is Real, Everyday Miracles and the soon-to-be published Space of Love. She is a graduate of the Advanced Corporate Coaching Program with Corporate Coach U, Inc., and is certified as a chaplain with the International Fellowship of Chaplains.

W e seek the truth.W e reach deep down inside as we admit the worst, accept it, and release it. Writing in the present tense can have the same positive impact as living in the present moment, for the writer and the reader. I saw memoir writing as an opportunity to potentially revitalize my body.Writing my memoir, What You Feel Is Real, took five years to complete as I moved through various stages of emotional, physical, and spiritual growth. By tapping into my most intimate and deepest feelings, I knew it was a safe way in, as well as a safe way out, for releasing anger and resentment. I was also aware of the power of the spoken word, and that by capturing the healing spirit of a story, it would have a positive impact on others. But what I didn't expect to discover at the end of the writing process was its therapeutic power to eliminate depression, anxiety, and obtrusive thoughts that had plagued me for over a decade. When I watched my mother at the end of her life hang on to anger and resentment toward my father, who had passed away 20 years prior, I knew it would behoove me to address the same issues harbored inside myself. I feared that if I didn't attend to clearing anger and resentment, I might meet the same untimely death from pancreatic cancer that both my mother and grandmother faced. I saw memoir writing as an opportunity to potentially revitalize my body. According to Dr. Caroline Myss, author of Anatomy of the Spirit , the human mind encodes thought, converts it into matter, and stores it within different energy centers of our body (chakras). Myss worked with thousands of patients, decoding how these energy centers work, and found that specific illnesses can be linked to past emotional traumas. Her work in energy medicine offers one solution to the puzzle of why some people heal while others don't. For me, this meant focusing on life themes or stories that correspond to the third energy center, which, according to Myss, is linked to illnesses of the stomach, spleen, pancreas, liver, gallbladder, adrenals, and lower thoracic spine. Trauma stored in these organs includes emotional issues concerning the loss of personal power, fear of intimidation, lack of self-esteem, and survival intuitions. In preparation to write, I collected my thoughts and constructed a timeline for each of the major events in my life. Next, I met with a professional interviewer and told my story as we recorded each session into a dictation device. Then I gave my recordings to a transcriber to not only transcribe sentences but, more importantly, to capture the vibrations and intonations to help develop my voice. After each recording session, I noticed an energy release from my body that hung over me like a dark cloud for three days until it gradually dissipated. As anticipated, I was experiencing a deeper healing by speaking out my story in this manner. From the notes, I was able to compose my memories and turn them into scenes, and create a story in the present tense written as a first-person narrative. (Side note: Writing in the present tense can have the same positive impact as living in the present moment, for the writer and the reader.) As I more deeply explored the story-at-large, I was able to trace my thoughts and feelings back to childhood memories and make sense of repetitious patterns. Singular events that occur at different ages and stages of one's life \u2014 i.e., in the womb, as an infant, toddler, or adolescent \u2014can spiral into meta-events that affect the entire course of our lives today. Once we connect meta-stories with these specific events, we have the ability to disempower our robot-selves and transform into functional, healthy adults. Similar to energy medicine strategies that restore the body, writing your memoir helps to identify and release toxic emotional energies for relieving symptoms of post-traumatic stress. It took courage and willingness to be vulnerable by exposing scenes riddled with shame and guilt for the world to see. I told myself, \"It's okay because I can always edit the parts I feel are too personal, later on.\" But what I discovered was that the most embarrassing parts weren't so bad after all. Once they lost their power, they actually ended up becoming the best parts of my memoir because they connected to the deepest core of my being human. After all, life can be a beautiful mess when making our wrongs into rights. We cry. We seek the truth. We reach deep down inside as we admit the worst, accept it, and release it. In my memoir, I call this the \"Divine Dive,\" reaching down to the base of your core for the fearless search for truth.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 115The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 116 Yoga (cont.)

Teachers, Lecturers, W orkshop Leaders, and the CentersThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2015 Page 121 By Julie Tumbarello Photo by Joni Strickfaden ACTIVE DREAMING AND MESSAGES FROM THE BIRDS I've been a dreamer as long as I can remember. Not just a night dreamer, but a day dreamer \u2014 one who notices signs, synchronicities, and coincidences from the universe. Like many of you, as a child I would share my dreams and experiences to little acknowledgement. For me, the dreams continued to come, and I longed for an understanding of the messages they were delivering. So over the years, whenever I ran across a book on dreaming, I would pick it up. Some I finished; others fell by the wayside. All of them were missing something that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Then one afternoon I attended a meditation group, and the leader mentioned Robert Moss. As I had done so many times before, I decided to look up this dreamer. I was surprised to find that Moss, unlike the others I had researched, had written many, many books on dreaming. I decided to read one of his books and was drawn to The Three Only Things: Tapping the Power of Dreams, Coincidence and Imagination . As soon as I began, it felt like a coming home. This wasn't just any kind of dreaming practice, it was Active Dreaming, where night and day dreams come together with the interplay of synchronicity, coincidences, and imagination. The best part of it all was that it draws from the strength of shamanic tradition, which focuses on experiences of the dreamer herself. As soon as I started the book, I could not put it down. So when a scheduled work trip came up, I packed the book in my carry-on and took it along with me. It was a hot July day and I was on my way from Detroit to Rhode Island. I arrived at the gate a few minutes early, so I took a seat near the boarding area and eagerly pulled out my copy of The Three Only Things . I resumed my reading at chapter 8: \"Coincidence and What Wants to Happen.\" I started to read: \"The Romans were especially devoted to getting messages from the flight and the voices of birds . . .\" VOOM! Something passed over my head. I looked around but didn't notice anything. Back to reading: \"Before making an important decision, top Roman officials, accompanied by members of the council of augurs (bird-watchers) . . .\" VOOM! The woman next to me exclaimed, \"Wow! That was close!\" I glanced up from my book just in time to duck as another bird flew right at my head. I looked at the book, then looked at the bird and thought: I am so glad I was not reading about elephants! We soon packed up our belongings and boarded the plane. But, as sometimes happens, there were mechanical issues. We got back off the plane while the issue was attended to and since it was around lunch time, I decided to get a salad and iced tea. I found another spot in the airport and sat down, placing my salad on my lap and my iced tea on the floor next to my right foot. It was one of those hot, humid Michigan summers, and even though the terminal was air conditioned, it was still quite humid. My iced tea started to sweat as the humidity condensed on my cool cup. Within minutes a small bird appeared, hopped up to the cup and began drinking the refreshing droplets of water. Soon another bird appeared and joined in, then another, and another. Shortly there were a half dozen birds gathered around my cup hopping in and out drinking the water drops (and yes, this was inside of the airport). People were stopping and commenting on my \"little buddies.\" Others stopped to take pictures. This went on for quite some time until it dawned on me that I had my own camera. I gently reached into the bag next to me, slowly pulled out my camera, and hovered it over the top of my cup and snapped the moment. I later reviewed the picture and noticed what I had captured was a round circle with birds gathered around it. I looked at the front cover of The Three Only Things , and the picture on the front cover was of birds, gathered around a circle \u2014 a bird bath, and a place for them to drink water. Moss has said truth comes with goose bumps. When I saw the pictures of the birds at the airport gathered around my cup and the front cover of The Three Only Things, I was one big goose bump. I knew in that moment that these birds were my messengers and the message was clear. \"Through dreams, coincidences, and the workings of imagination, we begin to remember that there is a world beyond the obvious one, and that it is there we reawaken to who we are and what we are meant to become\" (p. 3). These dreaming birds reminded me of what I already knew and were pointing me in the direction for reawakening. A reawakening to a life as an Active Dreamer. Following the message from these birds and listening to my dreams, I went on to study with Robert Moss and became an Active Dream teacher. I'm passionate about Active Dreaming for many reasons, but most of all because it is about both spontaneous night dreams and being open to all of life's experiences, including those that play out during the day. These experiences cannot, and should not, be isolated from one another. Active Dreaming means being open to the universe, and life 24/7. When we open up to the powers that speak to us in dreams and messages from the universe during the day, we have access to an amazing resource that allows us to be full active participants in how we create and dream our lives.
